Charter flights between Fujian Province and Colombo soon
Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga experienced the sense of authentic Chinese hospitality during his visit to Quanzhou recently and business visit paved the way for the Boarding Mountain Travel Company LTD (BMTC) to arrive with its first delegation of elite travelers from China last week to Colombo.
These meetings were successfully collaborated by Vidura Gunaratne, Chairman of Silk Route Ceylon Merchants (Pvt) Ltd due to his long- standing association with the Chairman and CEO of Boarding Mountain Company in China, Wu Mi Fino&Wu Yin He.
The event marked a significant milestone between the two main operators; The Boarding Mountain Travel Company Ltd and its local representative; See Lanka Voyagers (Pvt) Ltd. an MOU between the two companies too was signed to further enhance bilateral ties between the two countries.

La La Land herald more days of sun for musicals
So, perhaps youve heard: La La Land didnt win best picture at the Oscars.
But if every cloud has a silver lining, this one might be called golden: The Emma Stone-Ryan Gosling musical, which did win six Oscars, has been racking up box office numbers remarkable for a musical  nearly $417 million globally so far, according to comScore  and even more for an original one with no previously known songs or story. Damien Chazelles eye-popping, toe-tapping creation ranks third in all live-action film musicals, behind the 2008 Mamma Mia! and the 2012 Les Miserables, neither of them original.
Thats big-time money, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at comScore. At times, the musical genre has been marginalized or not taken seriously. But this is serious business.
Its enough to make a musical fan break into sudden, joyful song  and as musical fans know, theres absolutely nothing wrong with that  perhaps on the way to the multiplex, where this weekend Emma Watsons Beauty and the Beast is expected to have a huge, $120 million-style opening.
And if a Disney tale featuring a Harry Potter-caliber array of top British actors isnt your thing, you need only wait; theres a slew of other live-action musicals in the works, a combination of originals, sequels and remakes. This Christmas, well have Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum in The Greatest Showman, with music by La La Land lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, and a year later the high-profile Mary Poppins Returns with Emily Blunt, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Meryl Streep, among others. Also reportedly on tap: a Will Ferrell-Kristen Wiig original musical about the little-known world of corporate musicals, and a Josh Gad musical with songs by Broadway luminaries Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. A musical version of the Broadway megahit Wicked is also coming down the pike.
And theres more yet to come. Good movies beget other good movies, said Marc Platt, a producer of La La Land, not to mention the upcoming Mary Poppins Returns and Wicked films. So when a movie captures the imagination and hearts of people around the world, its going to have a positive influence on similar genres getting made.
In a broader cultural sense, is the musical undergoing a renaissance, or at least a major moment Or is it all just a happy coincidence Certainly, its been a great time for musicals on Broadway, where Mirandas Hamilton has been breaking all kinds of records (and bringing with it a hugely enthusiastic, youthful audience) since it opened in July 2015. And on TV, theres been the trend of live musicals like Grease, Peter Pan and Hairspray.
I dont think its a coincidence, said Mandy Moore, the choreographer of La La Land, whos also worked extensively in television. I think it went away for a while, that style of storytelling, and that style of music, and its like anything  bellbottoms were cool, and then they were not cool, and then they were cool again. People throw it away for a while and then come back to it and remember, oh, that was really cool, and why dont we reinvent it
To Menken, who composed the music for Beauty and the Beast (and many other musicals), the moment for musicals has been happening for quite a while.
Look at the box office, he said in a recent interview, listing Hamilton and a slew of other Broadway shows, by him and others. Its just an explosion of musicals. And this new generation coming up who were sort of weaned on our influence, and theyre kicking butt.
Platt and Moore of La La Land also point to the younger creative voices injecting life into musicals in various forms; Chazelle is 32, and Miranda 37.
Its part of the evolution of the art, Platt said. You have new young voices who grew up seeing the world in a certain way, and hearing the world in a certain way. And whats really interesting is  theyre all steeped in the history of the genre. Lin-Manuel and Benj and Justin can tell you every piece of musical theater history, the way that Damien can tell you the history of great American and French New Wave musical cinema. And so theyre taking from the past, drawing on what theyve learned and studied, but putting it through the lens and the filter of their very contemporary world.
Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon credits animated musical films with getting audiences comfortable with the simple act of a character breaking into song.
And then if you let it happen, it turns out that the audience actually loves that, Condon said. Theres a wider audience for it, for just the joy of breaking out into song. It feels like the audience has caught up again.
They may have caught up, but that doesnt mean its going to be easy for future screen musicals to capture the La La Land magic, Dergarabedian of comScore said.
Its not going to happen every year, he said. That was lightning in a bottle.

La La Land will be screening in Sri Lanka at the Empire Arcade in April. It will be a CEL release

Anandasangaree demands Sambanthans resignation
The Secretary General of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), V. Anandasangaree in a letter to Leader of the Opposition, R. Sampanthan, has asked that Sampanthan submit his letter of resignation from the position of Opposition Leader, if the government fails to deliver on its promises to the Tamil people within a period of two weeks.
The Tamils have reached their limit of tolerance, but not now, it happened long ago. They are now forced to come to a decision to demand your resignation from the office of the Leader of the opposition, which office you had been using to defend the Government, much against the wishes of the people, not only the Tamils but people of all ethnic groups, stated the letter released to the media yesterday.
He further states that many of the problems of the Tamil people such as the release of lands, detention of Tamil political prisoners, grievances of the families of the missing persons, could have been solved long ago, if he, the Opposition Leader really wanted it.
Please take a piece of paper, write out your resignation from the office of the Leader of the opposition and keep it with you, with the threat of sending it, if solutions are not found for these problems within a period of two weeks. Please dont forget that people have now started condemning you and burning your effigies, he added and warned that the people would soon demand the resignation of all ITAK MPs from Parliament or to withdraw their support to the Government if no action is taken soon. Anandasangaree also observed that it was foolish for Sampanthan to have demanded that both parties; the LTTE as well as the army be tried for war crimes as the recruits by the LTTE were all under compulsion, with no right to question why. He has stressed that Sampanthan not delay any further and bring pressure on the government to start work on delivering their promises.
The TULF contested within the Tamil National Alliance in the 2001 Parliamentary elections under a common platform, but soon the TNA started taking a pro-LTTE stance which led to a split within the TULF; led by its President Anandasangaree who was opposed to the LTTE. At the 2004 Parliamentary elections, members of the TULF who wanted to remain with the TNA formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK).

And they learned nothing from history
Sri Lankas the first private medical college, North Colombo Medical College (NCMC), was started during the reigns of President JR Jayewardene pioneered by Dr. Dankande Muhandiramge Heennilame. Dr. Heennilame toying with the idea of establishing a private medical college since seventies pointed out the dire need of revamping medical education in Sri Lanka. He strongly believed that the trajectory of medical education should change with times and demands and foresaw the difficulty in doing so with the existing system.
Dr. G.M. Heennilame, a visionary and one of the founders of the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka, first proposed the establishment of a private medical college to the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka in 1975. However after considering, the social, political and economic environment prevailed at the time, the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka showed their reluctance to Dr. Heennilames suggestion to establish private medical college in the country.
Picture by Chinthaka Kumarasinghe
After the political change in 1977, Dr. Heennilame once again presented his proposal to the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka who willingly agreed to consider it. They formed three-member committee including medical practitioners Dennis Aloysius and Walter Gooneratne to study the proposal and make recommendations to the professional body. According to their feasible study, three-member committee recommended a fee-levying non-profit oriented, undergraduate medical college. Later they developed their report further and made it into a fully-fledged a project proposal identifying Ragama as the location for the private medical college.
First non-profit private medical college
A detailed report was subsequently presented to President J. R Jayewardene who in turn agreed with the proposal to set up the North Colombo Medical College. On July 4 1980, the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka launched on their ambitious project by appointing a five member Board of Governors to run the North Colombo Medical College, that included well known medical auctioneers such as. G.M. Heennilame, Dennis Aloysius, Walter Gooneratne, Sathis Jayasinghe, and Shelton Cabraal. These highly qualified medical practitioners agreed to work without a salary to establish Sri Lankas first non-profit private medical college. On September 25, 1981, they inaugurated the North Colombo Medical College.
Founding a non-profit oriented private medical college was a visionary and revolutionary approach by the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka. During the early eighties even the East Asian countries like South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand were not so familiar with the private university system.
Sri Lanka had a significant potential to be a qualitative private education hub in the South Asia, but alas as a nation we missed that opportunity due to acrimonious politics and short-sighted self-centred politicians. This eventually put us behind times where the other countries in the region were far ahead of us in providing private education to cater to the needs of the Asian countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan have established solid private sector education options for Asia as a result. Besides other higher education streams, Pakistan has fifty-five private medical colleges, Bangladesh has forty-eight private medical colleges and Nepal has ten private medical colleges. A significant number of Sri Lankan students have received their education in these countries yearly to obtain medical degrees.
The district quota system introduced by successive governments had shut the doors every year for scores of brilliant students denying their right to enter a medical faculty of state run university. These students who were denied of medical education largely due to government policy readily embraced this opportunity, which was created by the North Colombo Medical College. Initially the North Colombo Medical College enrolled hundred students per year, they received more than thousand applications each year during 1981 to 1989. The North Colombo Medical College authorities introduced internationally recognized admission policy, which was not only focused on academic achievements. The admission criteria to North Colombo Medical College were based on: 70% for performance at GCE A Level, 10% for GCE O Level and distinctions, 10% for extra-curricular activities and 10% for the viva voce.
Free education system
However vocal and militant opposition against the North Colombo Medical College by Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), JVP led university students organisations and few academics with a leaning towards left wing politics created a monster, out of the NCMC which was in place to destroy free education system. Prof. Carlo Fonseka, Prof. Nalin de Silva and Dr. Rajitha Senaratne were vocal critiques of the NCMC and they were the main speakers at public rallies that were organised against NCMC.
After more than two decades they have changed their view point on private universities and now they openly support the establishing of private universities including medical colleges. Prof. Carlo Fonseka recently stated that NCMC was a solid example to prove that private sector also can produce high quality medical practitioners (http://www.lankaenews.com/news/5304). Writing an opinion piece in The Island November 11, 2006, Prof. Carlo Fonseka put his weight behind the International Medical and Technological University to launch pre-clinical course at Piliyandala.
He pointed out that Sri Lanka needs more doctors: the number of doctors per 100,000 of the population in Sri Lanka is one of the lowest in the countries of the world and even in the region. To make matters worse many doctors, most if not all of them members of the GMOA, who are sent abroad at huge state expense for postgraduate training do not return to serve their motherland. So we must somehow increase the number of doctors produced in our country. The State is doing all it can to increase the output of doctors. This year two new medical faculties were created, one at Eastern University and the other at Rajarata University. But the State cannot satisfy the demand for medical education in the country. For many years in the recent past, over 200 students of very rich parents have gone abroad each year to qualify as doctors. They return and after passing the Act 16 Examination and undergoing internship training, become entitled to practise medicine in Sri Lanka.
In the process of going abroad for medical studies they have drained a vast amount of foreign exchange from the country. If a part of the medical course can be taught in Sri Lanka, parents will save a lot of money and the country will save a lot of foreign exchange as a result. By reducing the cost of medical education, such a procedure will enable children of not-so-rich parents also to qualify as doctors. The net effect would be an increase in the number of doctors in the country. The pre-clinical campus of the IMTU at Piliyandala was in my judgement such a project. At present it is only a bunch of medical students misguided by some of their big brothers in the GMOA who seem to be determined to disrupt the enterprise by shouting silly slogans about the pohosathunge moda lamai sandaha vaidya upadhi kadaya  degree shop for foolish children of rich people.
Prof. Fonseka not only supported the private medical school but also vehemently criticized the Sri Lanka Medical Councils (SLMC) and GMOAs destructive role against private medical colleges: the SLMC has also violated a fundamental right of many other citizens of the country who are due to sit the Act 16 Examination. This is a manifestation of the arrogance of power the SLMC possesses from time to time. It derives its power from the GMOAs capacity to engineer strikes by its members and thereby jeopardise the lives of the poorest people of this country when they are stricken by serious illness. In the face of this murderous power of the GMOA, governments considerate about the lives of the poorest citizens in the country pathetically succumb to the demands of the GMOA whether they are reasonable or unreasonable.
Prof. Stanley Kalpage, a former Chairman of the University Grants Commission and Secretary of the Ministry of Higher Education, was the guest speaker at the last Convocation of the NCMC in 1994.
During his speech, Prof. Kalpage disclosed what the real reasons were for targeting NCMC. He stated that the GMOA took up cudgels against the College thinking that state medical faculty graduates would be pushed out of employment in government hospitals. The daughter of a high office bearer of the GMOA had applied with qualifications suitable for her admission and had been admitted. When the same persons son, whose qualifications were not adequate, was refused admission, he became an inveterate enemy of the NCMC. A number of general practitioners were disappointed when their children failed to gain admission. It was not possible to satisfy everyone.
Furthermore Prof. Kalpage described JVP violent attack on NCMC: The JVP which was raising its head and holding the country to ransom in the mid-eighties got into the act. Their aim was to disrupt the work in all universities, cause embarrassment to the government and bring the government down. Dr. Heennilame himself received a death threat over the telephone in Sinhala. If the money taken from the students of the NCMC is not returned your life is in danger, said the anonymous caller. Dr. Heennilame went abroad to England. Dr. Sathis Jayasinghe too received a telephone call which he reported to President Jayewardene. Dr. Jayasinghe left for Pakistan. In 1988, the JVP bombed the administration section of the NCMC.
President R. Premadasa took popular political decision to take over the NCMC. He had sent Army battalion to surround NCMC buildings. Prof. Stanley Kalpage severely criticized Premadasa governments decision to take over NCMC at the last convocation of the NCMC: The UNP government of 1989 must take full responsibility for the manner in which they capitulated in the face of a challenge that had only to be faced and overcome. Those directly responsible for depriving the private sector of continuing to manage the North Colombo Medical College which they had established caused, in my view, a disservice to our country.
We can hear same allegations that rose against the NCMC are once again being raised against South Asian Institute of Technology & Medicine (SAITM). GMOA, Inter University Students Federation and JVP led extreme political groups repeat the same slogans and allegations after more than two decades. It seems like they didnt learn anything from history.
They destroyed Sri Lankas first non-profit oriented private medical college, which maintained significant academic quality. These extremist forcers thriving on social discord try to repeat the mistake time and again. Once, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said: Those who fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.

Application made to Court seeking suspension of sale of Malwana land
An application was made to Court requesting a suspension of the earlier order to sell the 16 acre plot of land in Malwana allegedly belonging to former Minister Basil Rajapaksa in keeping with a Cabinet decision to consider whether it could be utilized for a public purpose, said Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC.
The Attorney General noted the above replying to a question raised by the Daily News.
He said the Pugoda Magistrate recently issued order suspending the sale of the said land by public auction because the Cabinet had decided to consider using it for a public purpose.
Earlier, the Magistrate ordered the sale by public auction because the person whose name was mentioned in the deed pertaining to the land disclaimed ownership.
The Cabinet of Ministers held discussions over the possibility of using this land for a public purpose and Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said in a Cabinet memorandum that the Attorney General should consider this.
When the Cabinet decision was forwarded to the Attorney General, he ordered Police to seek an order from the Magistrate to suspend the auction. When Police informed the Cabinet decision to the Pugoda Magistrate on the orders of the Attorney General, the Magistrate thereafter issued order suspending the auction.

Atkinson resurrecting Mr Bean in Chinese film
Rowan Atkinson has proved to fans hes alive and well hours after being the victim of a sick death hoax.
The actor, 62, is currently in China for the premiere of film Top Funny Comedian which is only being released in the country and sees Rowan playing his infamous Mr Bean role.
While he happily got into character and posed for cameras, elsewhere a fake Twitter account had been set up to look like Fox News was spreading that he had been killed in a car crash.
The tweet  which got his age wrong, read: FOX BREAKING NEWS : Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) died at 58 after car accident. -March 18, 2017.
It has since been shared and liked more than 300,000 times.
However website Hoax Alert was soon hot and the case and quickly debunked the rumour.
They stated: Celebrity death hoaxes are nothing new on the internet yet this one is special in that it managed to be liked/shared over 300,000 times in a short period of time by employing some devious technical tricks.
The first one is the video player embedded in the site. At first sight this is just a normal YouTube video from a Fox News broadcast (which is about a death but not about Rowan Atkinson).
The report adds that the scammers were likely to have made money from the cruel prank.
The scammers are making money by sometimes not showing the video or the share dialog when visitors click but instead redirecting them to pages full of deceptive ads and popups. It is unclear at this time how much they walked away with but it is probably a substantial sum by now based on the amounts of likes and shares we have been seeing.
However many fans still took to Twitter to express their sadness.
One wrote: Rowan Atkinson has died. Hes most known for Mr Bean but Blackadder will always be my favorite. He was always fun to watch. RIP
And another added: Absolutely crushed to hear about Rowan Atkinson. One of the few comedians that illicited the same uproarious response from me my whole life The Sun

Awakening musical vibes
It is obvious that everybody cannot become a singer or a musician. However indulgence in music and listening to good music nurtures the saint within people. It has been researched and found out that music can be used as a therapy to reduce stress and anxiety.
Music in its broader perspective bestows good values such as compassion and empathy within persons who indulges in it. Thus music teachers could be treated as a rare breed of humans who induce warmth to this world. Pradeep Bogahawatte, a music teacher with a strong background values enhancing appreciative skills of his pupils apart from making them professionals. Bogahawattes pupils of Crescendo Institute of Music will unleash their talents at Crescendo Night 2017 to be held at S de S Jayasinghe Hall, Dehiwala on April 8 at 6 pm.
Q: Could you elaborate on your journey towards becoming a fully fledged musician
A: When I was a student at Isipathana College my mentors in music were Lakshman Wijesekera and Ananda Wijesiri. Dhananjaya Somasiri and Mahendra Pasqual, who are now top musicians, were my classmates.
My favourite instruments were the flute and guitar. While schooling I used to play flute for recordings of professional artistes. Lakshman Wijesekera gave me the opportunity to learn music at Kala Bhumi, Nugegoda and there I met veteran musician Rohana Weerasinghe. He offered me the chance to play instruments in his recordings. I got the opportunity to work with Mahinda Bandara, Ananda Perera of Siha Shakthi fame, D D Gunasena and Jagath Wickramasinghe at recordings. That was a great learning process.
Q: How did you become a music teacher
Experienced music teacher Pradeep Bogahawatte
A: I sharpened my talents by working with Maestro Khemadasa, Sarath Dassanayake and H M Jayawardene. While working as a music practitioner I formed the music band, Zenith.
I have composed music for songs of Milton Mallawarachchi and Ranil. I worked at the Kotelawala Defense Academy for 17 years and in that period contributed immensely towards musical events of the three forces. Simultaneously I worked at Kala Bhumi as a music teacher for 18 years.
Further I worked as a teacher at Vishadha Deepika Pryadharshinis and Keerthi Pasquals music academies for seven years as a voice trainer and keyboardist.
Q: You now have your own music academy called Crescendo Institute of Music. Why did you decide to go solo
A: I wanted to teach my students for long hours and my academy facilitates that. I pay individual attention to students who have diverse talents.
I induce academic knowledge to them in a subtle manner. All my students who sat for Visharada exam have got through.
Even actors have become my students saying that they acquire peace of mind by learning music. I teach singing, music while enhancing appreciative skills of students.
I am one hundred percent satisfied now with my teaching methodology since it serves the broader purpose of grooming sensible individuals.
Q: Every year you showcase talents of your students
A. Yes. Annually we do this concert. The seventh consecutive one will be held on April 8 this year.
Students who participate in my Music therapy workshop team up every year to do this concert. We showcase many innovations in this event which is a novel experience for audience.
Q: What are your views on local music sphere in the present context
A. Music has become a lucrative profession but now it is in the hands of media stations. More than creations, money is playing a major role in the music field. Music videos are playing havoc in the sphere.
Q. Students of your academy too will fall prey to this mafia once they get into the field
A. No. The main thing I teach them is the universal value in music and its scope.
Anyone in the present context can record a song, do a music video and become popular overnight. But music has a broader meaning. You cannot become an artiste overnight. I am very strict in my method of teaching and my students are well disciplined to adhere to that.
Rukantha Goonetilleke is a trend setter. He cancels his voicing sessions in studios if he is not in the right mood to sing on a particular day. He does that because he respects the profession.

BT fined record 42m for late installations
BT has been hit with a record fine from telecoms regulator Ofcom and has set aside 300m to repay providers for delays in installing high-speed lines.
Ofcom has issued the firm with a 42m fine, which it said was the largest it has ever handed down. It found BT's Openreach division had cut compensation payments to telecoms providers for delays in installing the lines between early 2013 and late 2014.
Openreach said it "apologised wholeheartedly" for the mistakes.
The investigation found BT had broken rules about its "significant market power" by cutting the payments.
Gaucho Rasmussen, Ofcom's investigations director, said: "These high-speed lines are a vital part of this country's digital backbone.
"We found BT broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time. "The size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses."
Openreach provides the wires and cables that powers the UK's broadband and landline phone network. In this case, it failed to pay full compensation to providers when it was late installing ethernet lines - high-speed cables used by large businesses, and mobile and broadband providers, to transmit data. Earlier this month, BT agreed to Ofcom's demands for it to legally separate Openreach from its main business.
Under the changes, Openreach will become a distinct company with its own staff, management and strategy "to serve all of its customers equally".
BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said the investigation "revealed we fell short of the high standards" for serving telecoms providers.
"We take this issue very seriously and we have put in place measures, controls and people to prevent it happening again," he said.

Buddhas Way of Governing
Ven. Dr. Walpola. Rahula, in his book What the Buddha Taught says, Those who think that Buddhism is interested only in lofty ideals, high moral and philosophical thought, and ignores any social and economic welfare of people, are wrong. The Buddha was interested in the happiness of men. To him happiness was not possible without leading a pure life based on moral and spiritual principles. But he knew that leading such a life was hard in unfavourable material and social conditions.
Buddhism is primarily a contemplative religion. Nevertheless, from its earliest times there has been a strong social justice ethic, born from the fundamental principle of compassionate action. According to the Buddha, as human beings we make choices that have consequences. If these choices are made with wisdom and compassion, the outcome will be happiness; if they are made with greed, hatred, and delusion, the outcome will be suffering.
In the sphere of social justice, the Buddha pointed out that, while it is normal for people to want to experience the pleasures of life, when greed becomes excessive it creates conflict. This conflict is rooted in the reality of limited resources: the earth is generous and abundant, but can only supply so much. When some decide to take for themselves beyond what is reasonable, others go without. Thus, inequality is born, from which stem jealousy, distrust, lies, crime, and violence. To manage these stresses, humans invent social constructs such as laws, customs, classes, private property, and government.
Dhamma Rajya
From the evidence of the Buddha's discourses, or suttas, it is clear that early Buddhists were very much concerned with the creation of social conditions favourable to the individual cultivation of Buddhist values.
Our history shows us when Buddhism became the shaping ideal of the State, and Buddhist ideas and ideals were used to build a just and righteous society, a period of great prosperity will be ushered. It consists of material, moral, and spiritual. It is the only true solution to the manifold problems in the modern world.
A truly noble and righteous ruler would live in accord with dharma, ruling without violence or coercion. Here is a succinct summary of a kings duties according to an early Buddhist text. What is the duty of a Noble emperor Depending on the dharma, honouring it, revering, cherishing it, one should establish guard, ward and protection according to dharma for ones own household, troops, nobles and vassals, for Brahmins and householders, town and country folk, ascetics and religious, for beasts and birds. Let no crime prevail in the kingdom, and to those who are in need, give property.
The Buddhist texts give many parables of kings who exceeded the bounds of dharma, and who through their greed brought their people to suffering, and ultimately sealed their own fate as well.
Good governance
The Buddha preached non-violence and peace as a universal message. He did not approve of violence or the destruction of life, and declared that there is no such thing as a just war. He taught: The victor breeds hatred, the defeated lives in misery. He who renounces both victory and defeat is happy and peaceful. Not only did the Buddha teach non-violence and peace, He was perhaps the first and only religious teacher who went to the battlefield personally to prevent the outbreak of a war. He diffused tension between the Sakyas and the Koliyas who were about to wage war over the waters of Rohini. He also dissuaded King Ajatasattu from attacking the Kingdom of the Vajjis.
The Buddha discussed the importance and the prerequisites of a good government. He showed how the country could become corrupt, degenerate and unhappy when the head of the government becomes corrupt and unjust. He spoke against corruption and how a government should act based on humanitarian principles.
The Buddha elaborates the point, When the ruler of a country is just and good, the ministers become just and good; when the ministers are just and good, the higher officials become just and good; when the higher officials are just and good, the rank and file become just and good; when the rank and file become just and good, the people become just and good.'(Anguttara Nikaya)
In the Cakkavatti Sihananda Sutta, the Buddha said that immorality and crime, such as theft, falsehood, violence, hatred, cruelty, could arise from poverty. Kings and governments may try to suppress crime through punishment, but it is futile to eradicate crimes through force.
In the Kutadanta Sutta, the Buddha suggested economic development instead of force to reduce crime. The government should use the country's resources to improve the economic conditions of the country. It could embark on agricultural and rural development, provide financial support to entrepreneurs and business, provide adequate wages for workers to maintain a decent life with human dignity.
In the Jataka, the Buddha had given to rules for Good Government, known as Dasa Raja Dharma'. These ten rules can be applied even today by any government which wishes to rule the country peacefully. The rules are as follows:
1) be liberal and avoid selfishness, 2) maintain a high moral character, 3) be prepared to sacrifice one's own pleasure for the well-being of the subjects, 4) be honest and maintain absolute integrity, 5) be kind and gentle, 6) lead a simple life for the subjects to emulate, 7) be free from hatred of any kind, 8) exercise non-violence, 9) practise patience, and 10) respect public opinion to promote peace and harmony.
Moral duty
Regarding the behaviour of rulers, He further advised, (1) a good ruler should act impartially and should not be biased and discriminate between one particular group of subjects against another, (2) a good ruler should not harbour any form of hatred against any of his subjects, (3) a good ruler should show no fear whatsoever in the enforcement of the law, if it is justifiable, (4) a good ruler must possess a clear understanding of the law to be enforced. It should not be enforced just because the ruler has the authority to enforce the law. It must be done in a reasonable manner and with common sense. -- (Cakkavatti Sihananda Sutta)
The Buddhas emphasis on the moral duty of a ruler to use public power to improve the welfare of the people had inspired Emperor Asoka to do likewise. Emperor Asoka, a sparkling example of this principle, resolved to live according to and preach the Dhamma and to serve his subjects and all humanity. He declared his non-aggressive intentions to his neighbours, assuring them of his goodwill and sending envoys to distant kings bearing his message of peace and non-aggression.
He promoted the energetic practice of the socio-moral virtues of honesty, truthfulness, compassion, benevolence, non-violence, considerate behaviour towards all, non-extravagance, non-acquisitiveness, and non-injury to animals. He encouraged religious freedom and mutual respect for each other's creed. He went on periodic tours preaching the Dhamma to the rural people. He undertook works of public utility, such as founding of hospitals for men and animals, supplying of medicine, planting of roadside trees and groves, digging of wells, and construction of watering sheds and rest houses. He expressly forbade cruelty to animals. Sometimes the Buddha is said to be a social reformer. Among other things, He condemned the caste system, recognized the equality of people, spoke on the need to improve socio-economic conditions, recognized the importance of a more equitable distribution of wealth among the rich and the poor, raised the status of women, recommended the incorporation of humanism in government and administration, and taught that a society should not be run by greed but with consideration and compassion for the people.

Chills and thrills for supper!
Naserah Tyebally, the founder of the Colombo Supper Club, has always loved food. Every time she travels abroad, the first thing she does is scout out a citys interesting restaurants, upscale food trucks, and famous marketplaces. Tourist attractions are often secondary to delicious delights.
And while she isnt overly critical of Colombos food scene, she has kept track of international food trends, especially that of the supper club, a fast growing craze in international culinary capitals. These clubs differ in style and purpose, but many function as one-night pop-ups in unusual locations that feature the fare of prominent chefs. They tend to skew fancy, but there are some that feature everyday foods as well.
Many of Tyeballys friends in foodie havens across the world had told her about this phenomenon, and she began thinking about trying to bring a similar dining experience to Colombo.
Naserah Tyebally and Chef Sun Kim
There was little movement on the plan until last August, when she ate at Singapores Cheek by Jowl, a hot table serving modern Australian fare, owned and operated by Sri Lankan chef Rishi Naleendra. After a lovely meal, Tyebally asked to speak with the chef.
I just wanted to say thank you and that my friend and I had had such a great time. But we started talking, and he turned out to be a lovely, personable fellow, and my friend said that the two of us should take each others numbers down. He even told Rishi that I would have him come cook in Sri Lanka, she said.
Nothing came of this meeting until Tyebally, back in Colombo, decided to contact Naleendra about actually cooking here if she organized it. He responded with a resounding yes, and the Colombo Supper Club was born.
I started looking into how I could put it together, and I made it happen. It was a right place-right time situation, but it was fueled by a love for tasty food and interesting eating experiences, she said.
Operating by herself, Tyebally has now held three separate one-night events featuring prominent chefs based in Singapore. The inaugural dinner was held in November at Rock Villa, Bentota, and starred Naleendras cooking. The second one took place in February at Semondu at the Dutch Hospital. Andrew Walsh, the Irish chef-owner of Singapores Cure, was the featured chef at the second event.
Because the chefs do all the cooking on these occasions seating is limited, and the events thus far have been limited to just over 30 diners.
The dinners are small because my chefs actually do the cooking. Its as if you are in their restaurant, wherever that may be, she said.
Furthermore, the dinners have featured tasting menus with wine pairings that bring an upscale, modern eating experience to the Colombo food scene.
The aim of my project is to bring a bit of pop and variety to the dining scene here in Colombo. The project will certainly continue to evolve, but no matter what it will showcase food in all its forms and glory, Tyebally said.
The clubs third supper took place on Sunday, March 19 at the Independence Arcades Asylum Restaurant. The featured chef was Sun Kim, the chef-owner of Meta, who cooks up French-inspired food with a Korean twist.
Born in South Korea, Sun trained at Waku Ghin in Singapore and Tetsuyas in Sydney, Australia. This was his first visit to Sri Lanka, and he brought his whole bag of tricks in order to cook up a memorable meal for 34 lucky diners at Asylum.
The menu featured Hokkaido scallop sashimi with yuzu, apple, and basil, butternut squash with prawns and asparagus, smoked quail with mushrooms and potatoes, and a New Zealand lamb loin with parsnip and kale, among other treats.
Its very fun for me to come down to Sri Lanka and cook something new for people here. I like to showcase what Im working on in different places, Sun said.
Asylum was closed to the public in order to accommodate the event, but the restaurant looked lovely: long tables featured place settings with several wine glasses, delicately folded napkins, and a smattering of flower petals.
While the chefs do all the cooking, Tyebally is responsible for securing and decorating the venues as well as providing the wine. She does, however, have beverage sponsors who help her out.
Its a ton of work to put these dinners together, but its definitely worth it. These chefs are so amazing. They really are artists serving up delicious, creative foods. Delivering that experience to Colombo makes this all worth it, she added.
Her efforts seem to be paying off, as there were seventeen people on the waiting list for Walshs dinner and ten on the waiting list for Suns.
Though the first three dinners have been rather upmarket, Tyebally noted that she plans to hold some events that are less expensive and open to more people. Her next dinner will be at Caf Kumbuk and will feature the cooking of Karishma Sakhrani, an Indian chef who specializes in innovative vegetarian fare.
She is also in touch with chefs from Thailand and others from Singapore to keep the food coming. Currently, Tyebally plans on holding Colombo Supper Club meetings once a month or every six weeks.
I dont want to confine myself to the fancy, upscale wine paring degustation menus. Ill have a little of this, a little of that as I move forward with the project, she said.
Each event sort of guides me to where I should go or what I should do next. On one hand its great to have a vision, and I do think about where I want to go with the Supper Club. But on the other hand I dont want to limit the possibilities in any way because you never know how it will eventually pan out, she added.

Chinas central bank chief sees end of monetary road in reforms
Central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan on Sunday called for greater use of fiscal policy to grapple with domestic growth and structural problems.
Monetary policy, he said, could be left to handle reflation, prevent an outbreak of financial risks and counter the spillover effects of an interest rate upcycle across the Pacific. At a panel session at the Boao Forum for Asia, Zhou, 69, was reluctant to promote more liquidity support and appeared in favour of forcing painful restructuring.
"After so much quantitative easing in monetary policy, we may have reached an end of this period," he said in what could be his last appearance at the forum as central bank governor. Zhou took the helm of the People's Bank of China in 2002 and is the longest-serving chief in its history. Widely regarded as a reformist and capable technocrat, Zhou revamped the state banking system, developed the country's central banking scheme, liberated interest rates and promoted yuan internationalisation.
His one black mark is the loose monetary policy associated with former premier Wen Jiabao's all-out stimulus response to the global financial crisis.
Some critics say the stimulus created a debt mountain equivalent to 261 per cent of gross domestic product and generated huge financial risks from shadow banking to asset bubbles. Critics say the crisis was a missed opportunity to resolve structural problems and help the country transition from export-oriented and investment-led growth to an economy driven by consumption.
"If you have a period to emphasise structural reform and other long-term development strategies, you should not have overreliance on monetary policies," Zhou said, adding that fiscal policy should play a key role in such reforms.
"We [also] need reform to streamline the relationship between central and local governments as well their responsibilities," he said.
Zhou said the country could use monetary policy to address domestic reflation and various external pressures.
He said reflation was already taking place in some countries and there had been "obvious changes" this year.
China's producer price index ended a four-year contraction in September and rebounded sharply, raising worries about consumer inflation as well. In face of the US Federal Reserve's three interest rate rises in the past 18 months and more possibly on the way, the PBOC has changed its tone to a neutral policy with a tightening bias.
China has also imposed tighter capital controls to prevent outflows and rapid depreciation of the yuan.
Tsinghua University finance professor Li Daokui, who is a former member of the PBOC's monetary policy committee, said reforms were going slower than most wished and the government was worried about spillover effects from Fed moves on the Chinese economy.
"Zhou has tried to support the reform process," he said.

Colombo, second most expensive city in South Asia

Research from the Economist Intelligence Unit indicates that Colombo is the second most expensive city in South Asia, and 108th most expensive in the world.
A total of eight South Asian cities, including New Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karachi and Bangalore, were included in the Economist Intelligence Units survey.
Results showed Dhaka was the most expensive city in South Asia, followed by Colombo and Kathmandu.
The survey compares over 400 individual prices across 160 goods and services in 133 cities around the world.
The goods and services include food, drink, clothing, household supplies and personal care items, home rents, transport, utility bills, private schools, domestic help and recreational costs.
While Asia is home to some of the cheapest cities, it also hosts some of the worlds most expensive - Singapore, for instance, is the most expensive city in the world, followed by Hong Kong.
Asia now accounts for half of the 10 most expensive cities, including Tokyo, Osaka and Seoul, the Kathmandu Post reported.

Current Sri Lanka equity valuations attractive
Despite the general hawkish sentiment in the central banks of developed countries, equity markets hit record highs during February including emerging markets ,the Guardian Acuity Asset Management Equity Fund report for February shows.
The Colombo Stock Exchange also experienced a marginal recovery during February supported by positive earnings announcements. The Central Bank keeping policy rates steady despite a gradual uptick in secondary market rates and also with Fitch rating revising Sri Lankas outlook to stable from negative.
Meanwhile foreign interest returned with a net foreign inflow of Rs 2.1 billion during the month with the notable inflows in John Keells Holdings, Hemas Holdings and Melstacorp Limited.
Accordingly ASPI closed the month with a marginal 0.03% gain. Corporate earnings releases for December quarter were encouraging with most of the counters we hold showing impressive net earnings growth, namely Sampath bank 67%.
Tokyo Cement 130%, Dialog Axiata 101% , Ceylinco Insurance 38%. Some of these stocks yet trade at low multiples and hence still carry substantial upside permitting investors who enter the fund now to secure good returns on market recovery.
Your fund recorded 0.16% return in the month of February and -0.16% year to date, outperforming the benchmark ASPI . Since the funds inception approximately five years ago, The annualised return (CAGR) was 10.75% by the end of February compared to benchmark ASPI (CAGR) return of 2.29%, amidst very subdued conditions, the report says.
Sampath Bank, Tokyo Cement, Chevron Lubricants, Dialog Axiata were the leading contributors to Funds positive return for the month whilst Aitken Spence Hotels , Hayleys Fabric and Ceylicno Insurance were the main detractors.
Given the volatility in the market we remain focused on companies with substantial discount to their intrinsic value and stable growth in earnings. We expect the macro economy to stabilise towards the latter part of the year which should improve sentiment for the local investors.
The report also says current drought experienced by the country and its impact on the economy, however current valuations level are very attractive compared to historical and peer countries multiples.

Cyclone Debbie: More than 3,500 evacuate in Queensland, Australia

More than 3,500 Australian residents have been evacuated as a cyclone carrying winds up to 240km/h (150 mph) moves towards the Queensland coast.
Cyclone Debbie is expected to intensify into a Category 4 system before it arrives early on Tuesday local time.
Some people have refused to leave despite warnings the destructive core could be as wide as 100km (62 miles).
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the storm would rival the devastatingCyclone Yasiin 2011.
"This window of opportunity to leave is drastically closing," she told a press conference on Monday.
"I am just pleading to everyone, please, listen to authorities. I do, you must as well. This is about your safety, it is about the safety of your family and the safety of your children.''
A state on edge
The cyclone is expected to make landfall sometime after 07:00 on Tuesday (22:00 GMT Monday) anywhere in a 265km zone from Townsville to Proserpine.
"That is the uncertainty of cyclones," said Bureau of Meteorology regional director Bruce Gunn.
Gunn warned the cyclone could hit the coast at high tide, bringing waves up to 8m and flooding for low-lying areas.
The Whitsunday holiday islands were already being buffeted by 100km/h winds, he said.
Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said the weather was also responsible for a fatal car crash, believed to involve a tourist.

Deputy CB governor wants PDD subjected to forensic audit
The Deputy Governor of the Central Bank P. Samarasiri called for a forensic audit yesterday to examine massive irregularities that have taken place in the Public Debt Department when issuing Bonds under direct placements.
He said the forensic audit should not be carried out internally but by an external audit firm.
Samarasiri was testifying before the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Treasury Bond Issue. Additional Solicitor General Yasanta Kodagoda led evidence.
Up to 2015, the PDD has done Rs. 5 trillion worth direct placements of which 95 percent are placed with primary dealers.
The procedure followed by the PDD in issuing direct placements have caused serious discrepancies, Samarasiri pointed out.
He also said that over the years, any officer in the PDD were able to decide on an interest rate upon which the direct placements are issued.
There was no reporting to the public with regard to the issuance of direct placements as well, Samarasiri pointed out.
Then how did the Monetary Board of any other body get to know about the value and the volume of the bids made, identity of the successful bidders, direct placements yield rates the Presidential Commission questioned. Nobody knew, Samarasiri answered. There have been 2,600 direct placements taken place throughout the course of time, which should be examined by a forensic audit, Samarasiri pointed out.

Dialog hosts Lets #ngage! Meetup 4.0
The #ngage is an open forum organised by Dialog, where tech and social media enthusiasts can come together, interact, and engage ideas.
On March 22, Dialog hosted its 4th edition of its #ngage meetup at the Dialog HQ in Union Place.
'Social Media' was the theme of #ngage 4.0, which aimed at providing those who are actively involved, or perhaps looking to expand their social outreach, an invitation into the lives of people that have used social media and digital channels to create and or improve their own brand.
The topics covered were: creating visual stories on social media, the difficulties of growing a startup digital media company, and what strategies you can use to make your content go viral.
Storytelling Using Instagram
Instagram has become a premier social media platform, and while it may be better-known for your everyday photos of food, to post make-up selfies, to travel shots and humour, local Instagrammer Amalini De Sayrah isn't one to join in the crowd.
With over 2,000 loyal followers and over 1,000 posts, Amalini caters to a niche of Instagrammers who are looking for visual stories beyond memes and selfies. As her presentation played, the audience was shown an image of a young man staring out into the sunlight from a corner of the Rio Cinema. This photo, like many of Amalini's other snaps, intends to show how urban decay has affected some of Sri Lanka's most historic buildings.
Amalini's story snaps attract both praise and censure. By highlighting the problems the less-privileged face in Sri Lanka, Amalini noted that she has had to deal with a lot of criticism for supposedly portraying Sri Lanka in a negative light. But this criticism has not deterred her: Amalini continues to bring to light the many social and environmental issues that Sri Lankans face, without sugar-coating it to appease anyone.
So how does one find a compelling story to tell via pictures
When photographing people, Amalini says, the key is to make sure that the subject is comfortable with being photographed. It is also important to identify whether you're taking a photo for its perceived beauty, or because you feel there is more to the picture, a story behind it. To truly convey a story, depicting your subject in its natural environment is important.
Unlike some Instagrammers who have entire digital teams behind them, Amalini doesn't have any form of marketing or growth strategy; rather, her focus is strictly on presenting Sri Lanka as it is. It's a whatever-happens-happens approach with little to no care on monetising, with more focus on starting a discussion that will result in social change.
For those interested, Amalini is working towards organisingInstameet, an Instagram-based meetup for those that use the platform. The next meet will be held in Negombo, and you can contact Amalini through her social channels for more details.
Roar's Journey
Roar Media's growth from a digital media startup that catered to the local English-speaking audience, to its current status as a media platform that provides content in five different languages across seven different sites, has not been a walk in the park.
Like most startups in Sri Lanka, Roar did not have the millions of dollars that are regularly pumped into startups over in the US by VCs and Angel Investors. The struggle to find a revenue stream in Sri Lanka whilst maintaining integrity has always been a slippery slope, and has resulted in many media platforms becoming a mouthpiece for its sponsors. So how did Roar go about avoiding this pitfall
Funding for Roar had been been tricky from the start, but with Roar's prioritisation of quality over quantity, and its growing viewership, Roar has grown in popularity over years despite the myth that clickbait sells and that online readers only want quick, substance-less content. For other media companies looking for revenue, Roar's model may not be commonplace, but it allows them to keep their vision alive.
Speaking at #ngage, Editor-in-chief, GazalaAnver, pointed out that while the temptation to increase revenue by aiming for quantity over quality will always be knocking at the door, Roar has shown no interest in resorting to the usual models available to digital media.
How To Go Viral Overnight
With an audience seemingly filled with his fans, Kasun Gunasekera, better known as Kalumalli, took to the stage to provide a few pointers on how he has managed to take his ideas and make them go viral.
Kasun hasn't necessarily filled a niche, for his content varies in nature, ranging from videos about misheard Sinhala lyrics, to Donald Trump attuned to a Sinhala song, to memes of Sri Lankan pickup lines. Kalumalli makes it clear, and his content speaks for itself, that his focus is purely on Sri Lanka.
With his day job as a software engineer at Zone 24/7, Kasun is not a full-time YouTuber like PewDiePie or NigaHiga. Kalumalli's viewership on a global scale may seem small, but he has a loyal following on his social media channels and his fanbase continues to grow as his content spreads. So what are Kalumalli's tips on going viral
Kallumalli believes that keeping it simple is the best approach. A simple idea or a premise seems to have worked for him. He also adds that it is crucial to understand your target audience well, and to get a feel of what's trending to make sure your content is relevant. Shots in the dark may not work. By understanding your audience and targeting them, the chances of going viral are much higher.
Another simple tip is to ensure that your content matches your audience. Using an example based on his own experience, he explained how one of his older videos was initially distributed with its thumbnail in English, despite the video content being in Sinhala. After making the decision to edit the video and re-upload it with a Sinhala thumbnail, the video instantly went viral. It was clear that this minor change made his content approachable to his target audience and that minor details can be in the world of viral videos.
Like with any content, there is an element of luck involved, too. It's not an easy landscape, although many may believe it to be, nor is it a case of becoming successful overnight as it is often portrayed.
Given that the digital boom is slowly catching up with Sri Lanka, it will be interesting to see how these insights into digital content would change how newcomers to the field approach it.
Dialog is Sri Lanka's No.1 Brand on Facebook (1.7 million Fans), Twitter (260K followers) and Viber Public Chat (235K followers) making it the largest and most popular brand online.
Dialog was recently awarded the Most Connected Brand by LMD, in a digital study conduct by TNS Lanka, and its latest Viber Sticker Pack 'RidmetaRockwela' has reached over 2.5 million Viber users.

Doctor Bashing: The New Indian Pastime..!
As Carom and Monopoly, Cricket and Hopscotch become old and redundant, Indians are looking for more exciting games! What shall we play today asks India.
Doctor Bashing! reply the people as they walk to a hospital with iron rods and sticks and beat up the doctors. Last evening I had a visitor, a young medical student from one of Indias medical colleges where doctors are getting bashed up with increasing frequency! I had seen her as a child, studious, intelligent, an intense public speaker, had watched as shed put heart and soul into her books, finally to win a seat in medicine. She had won. Was overjoyed.
And now fearful.
I knew the doctor they beat up, she whispered, He was an excellent teacher, and an insightful physician, now the mob have made him a cripple! Is that whats going to happen to us
Yes, is that what is going to happen to some in the medical profession More and more cases of doctor thrashings are happening literally every day throughout India!
Its better than cricket! shout the people.
More exciting than Monopoly! cries the crowd.
And its happening all over India.
In the days of old, when an influential patient fell ill or was injured badly, the monarch of the realm summoned his physician and informed him on pain of death, the patient should be cured. If the patient dies, you die! shouted the King or Lord.And so the doctors of yore worked under the threatening shadow of hangmans noose, sword or guillotine!
As civilization evolved, people grew educated, realizing doctors were not magicians; they healed as much as science had developed. They were limited also, if equipment was not available, or specialist not on call. The world understands this, but the Indian mob doesnt. Not only have the cries of medical students, doctors and nurses for protection, gone unheeded, but they have been told emphatically to stop protesting or they will lose their jobs!
Its like telling a politician that if you ask for security, you will be disqualified as a representative!
Or telling a learned judge, that if your life is at stake, we, the state are not responsible!
But, and this is a big but, if the government continues, with this unhealthy trend, I repeat what I saw in that little girls eyes, a reluctance to serve in rural areas, or even in cities, without security. If this happens, the same government can build the best hospitals, equip it with the best machinery, but such will be staffed by
Empty corridors!
Empty consulting rooms!
Empty operation theatres!
Then one day soon, India will ask again, What shall we play today
Politician Bashing! will scream the tired, sick and ailing, hysterical, mob, as they look at hospitals without doctors, and vote these politicians out..!

E-Log books for nearly 1,500 fishermen to keep track of fishing data
E-Log books (electronic tablets) costing Rs. 149 million would be provided to 1,490 fishermen within the next three months to keep track of the data related to fishing in international waters, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The failure to keep track of data in relation to fishing was the main drawback which caused the European Union (EU) to ban Sri Lankan fish exports, the minister said.
He said the government agreed to 52 conditions of the EU, including facilitating local fishermen to ease the procedure of data collection related to fishing by providing an electronic tablet.
Amaraweera said, These tablets will be designed to withstand rough handling. The waterproof tablets will also enable the fishermen to use it underwater where it enables the fishing community to update data relation to fishing.
The minister also instructed to install a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) to the E-Log book with the aim of minimising illegal activities in international waters.

Ensure release of 38 fishermen, TN CM tells Modi
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palanisami on Sunday asked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure the release of 38 fishermen from Tamil Nadu arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.
The number of fishermen includes 12 picked up on Sunday after they set sail from Jegathapattinam and Kottaipattinam fishing bases in Pudukkottai district, according to Deccan Chronicle. It is unfortunate that these incidents have taken place at a time when our fishermen are hopeful that a pragmatic and permanent solution to this issue would emerge as was discussed at the meeting with Swaraj, Palanisami said in the letter.
"The recent act of the Sri Lankan Navy again creates anxiety and unrest in the minds of our fishermen and vitiates the atmosphere of hope which was generated as a result of these meetings," the CM said, asking the PM to send a firm, clear, unequivocal and unambiguous message to ensure that these apprehensions are stopped.
I reiterate that the issue of apprehension of our fishermen and release of their boats be taken up at the highest diplomatic level and the Government of India take necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of our fishermen, the CM said. - Deccan Chronicle

Five hundred new model villages countrywide
The Housing and Construction Ministry will build 500 new model villages throughout the country this year, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The minister was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone for the Ethrajagama model village in Hambantota to mark Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes 68th birthday recently.
Minister Premadasa said the village will consist of 68 houses and those will be handed over to 68 homeless families.
He also said that a certain peoples representative had opposed the setting up of the new model village, saying that it would dispose of valuable land in the region which could be put to more profitable use. This person was responsible for the clearing up of 20 acres of valuable forest land by using bulldozers. He would not be allowed to cause such destruction of land anymore, as they would take legal action against his operations.
The minister said, During the previous regime, Sri Lankan representatives visited the UNHRC in Geneva, fearing its challenges and accusations. But once the Good Governance Government had established good friendship and relations with all countries, Sr Lankan representatives who visited Geneva this time were awarded a red carpet welcome by all nations. The President and Prime Minister were raking vast benefits to the country today by establishing good relations with all nations.
Although the previous regime protected our war heroes only by word, the present government has protected them by deed by announcing in no uncertain terms that foreign judges would be unwelcome to sit on any local panel investigating alleged human rights violations in Sri Lanka during the war period, he added.
He said, The expenditure on the construction of the Hambantota port, airport, and cricket stadium, had far exceeded the real estimates. Question is: Whose pockets were filled with the excess money

Special attention has been paid on the development project of the Galle Port, Deputy Minister of Ports and Shipping Nishantha Mutuhettigama said.
Mutuhettigama stressed that all the possible steps will be taken to face challenges and to provide solutions for them when the initial phase of this project is implementing.
All of these development projects are implemented based on the Green development concept declared by the President.
He expressed these concerns while addressing a progress meeting organised to evaluate the Galle Port development activities held in the Ports and Shipping Ministry last week. Secretary of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping L.P. Jayampathy, SLPA Vice Chairman Prof. Prasanna Perera, Managing Director Sarath Kumara Premachandra and several other officials took part in this event.
Galle City is a world heritage site and in accordance with the standards of the UNESCO, when development projects are carried out inside an ancient city historical values of the city should be protected. Hence, already a plan has been formulated to develop the Galle Port in a way it doesnt create environmental pollution and harmful impacts. Funds will be allocated from the JICA Project and is being implemented under Japanese funds. It is expected to construct the new wave breaker of the Gall Port through these funds. Increasing the depth around the piers, construction of the piers, and expansion in the infrastructure facilities are to be implemented under Galle Port development project.
Galle city is well known for tourism, because it is a World Heritage City.Plans have made to construct a yatch marina in the Galle Port since 15 to 20 sail ships arrive daily at the Galle Port. Primary objective of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping is to provide guidance to enhance these rates.
Deputy Minister Mutuhettigama advised officials to take technical support on the cement production carried out around the Galle Port for a more environmental friendly industry. When cement manufacturing materials are unloaded in the Galle Port, it should be carried out in a way it doesnt spread particles to the surrounding environment, Minister Nishantha Mutuhettigama added.
Many companies prefer to invest, to provide technical support needed in the procedure of turning these industries and mechanisms more environmental friendly. Mutuhettigama advised officials that agreements should be signed with these firms to obtain technical support required in these projects.

Hathuru without Hathuro will be the one to watch
Our recent failure at the P Sara Oval against Bangladesh will still leave a bad taste in our mouths, it may even look spineless to the experienced reader, but for those who have played the game even at school level should understand the appalling pressures a fairly rookie side like us had to face.
Armchair critics will go to town and paint it with rainbow colours. Therefore one can go to the extent and say only by complete non participation do we have any chance of retaining our self-respect.
By the time this article is out, already the first ODI would have taken place.However it would be interesting to look at this narration of how Bangladesh qualified for the quarterfinals of the 2015 World Cup, on 9 March 2015.
England won the toss and elected to bat, skipper Morgan thought that the wicket and the atmospheric conditions would suit swing bowling, opened with James Anderson, one of the best swing bowlers in the world.
He did not disappoint, his skipper, he swung the ball away late, to the Bangladeshi top order, resulting in danger man Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayess nicking to slips and getting out early, both were gone for two runs apiece. Mahumudullah and Sarkar avoided further damage to the Bangladeshi innings by batting sensibly and consolidating, they put on 86 invaluable runs together, and then a Chris Jordan bouncer got Sarkar out caught behind for a well compiled 40. In walked Mustfiqur Rahim, the pocket rocket arguably the best batsman in the side then, he gave support to the inform Mahumudullah and started turning things around in favour of them, Rahim was cheeky he cut good length balls past point for fours and slog swept the English bowlers at will, Mahumudullah the more orthodox in approach kept piling the runs to reach a well-deserved century, a first by a Bangladeshi player in a World Cup, but he was unable to extend his innings further, getting run out to a brilliant piece of fielding by Chris Woakes, a direct hit! He scored 103 off 138 balls; soon after, Rahim who was going great guns at the other end, fell at 89 off 79 balls, Broad got him caught by Jordan, their partnership produced 141 rapid runs which were invaluable to the team.
The English bowlers came into their own at the death, to restrict Bangladesh to 257 for 7 at the end of their innings. James Anderson bowled best for England capturing 2 for 45.
England were confident of passing the Bangladeshi total which was gettable and started with Ian Bell and Moin Ali, Ali went for the bowling from the word go and played some streaky shots and at 19, a terrible misunderstanding between the two batsmen and Ali was run out. Alex Hales newly installed to the side walked in and did not last long, caught behind off Mortaza the skipper, who bowled well, Hales contribution was insignificant. Bell was subdued at the other end, finding runs difficult to come by, and Rubel Hossain who was the fastest bowler from both sides got one to lift and Bell went caught behind edging. Hossein with his tail up bowled two bouncers to Morgan the new man in, he managed to get out of the way to the first one but got hold of the next one and what looked like a six was magnificently taken by Shakib Al Hassan in the deep. Root came and went edging, and England was 163 for 6. In came the danger man Butler, who was showing his class not only as a pinch hitter but batted with responsibility.
Just as he was taking England towards their goal with a half a century under his belt, unfortunately Taskin Ahmed had other ideas and bowled a beauty and he edged it and he was gone, the game tilted towards Bangladesh but Chris Woakes, showed aggression and had other ideas. But the other end was exposed, and Rubel Hossein bowled two reverse swinging balls knocking the stumps of both Broad and Anderson, Bangladesh won the match and qualified for the quarterfinals and their crowd was jubilant. Mahumadullah was the Man of the Match.
Even at that time Bangladesh was coached by Chandika Hathurusingha. It was mentioned in some quarters that if Hathu had his say in team selection, he was confident of winning the World Cup for Bangladesh in 2015. Hathurusinghas name is splashed across newspapers in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at present and everybody wants him to coach Sri Lanka.
His coaching at Bangladesh has been outstanding for some time and he deserved all the praise that was lavished upon him. Chandika Hathurusingha if he makes up his mind to take up the job of coaching Sri Lanka, he might clear the kitchen first cause too many cooks could spoil the broth.
I feel that Chandika Hathurusingha has all the ingredients such as tactical insight, man management skills, a firm chin, endless patience and a powerful set of lungs to become one of the best coaches in the cricketing world.

Healing hands of Reiki
The origins of Reiki, an alternative medicine practice, are somewhat hazy, though most trace it back to Dr. Mikai Usui. Dr. Usui opened an energy healing clinic in 1921, in Japan, and coined the term. Though the tradition is not tied to any single religion, its origins are connected closely to Buddhist beliefs and practices. In Reiki, the healer is thought to transfer energy to a patient, treating a wide range of illnesses and diseases, both chronic and acute. This energy helps dispose of the toxins in the body that cause these conditions.
Reiki is now practiced all over the world, and around 50 hospitals in the United States reportedly offer treatment programmes.
Reiki Master Wijayasena Gangodage of Kiribathgoda came to the practice somewhat later on in life. A director of education who oversaw the administration of schools in Mahara, Biyagama, Kelaniya, and Wattala, Gangodages life changed when he temporarily migrated to America in 1989.
It was during this time that he became interested in Reiki and received instructions in the art of Reiki from his wifes younger brother, who lived in Wisconsin. After moving back to Sri Lanka in 1990, he returned to his old job, but after retiring in 2000, he turned his attention to treating patients using the skills he had worked on for 10 years.
Here are the excerpts from
the interview with Wijayasena Gangodage:
Q: Can you explain the practice of Reiki
A: Reiki is an old practice of healing through energy. There is a lot of energy in the universe, and this practice allows you to channel that energy into patients to heal them. We understand that Rei is the universal energy field, and Ki is the subtle energy that you give to a person for healing purposes. Normally, 90 percent of people can feel this energy. That energy is the main source of healing. In Sri Lanka, most people dont know much about this, but all over the world, people practice Reiki.
Q: How do you treat people using Reiki
A: First, I ask the patient about their illness. It can be anything, ranging from cancer, to infertility, to psychological disorders. Then I ask them to sit down on a chair, and I stand behind them and meditate while directing energy from my hands to the patient. I control the flow of energy. It goes all around the body. There are seven chakras in the human body: the root chakra at the base of the spine, the sacral chakra between the navel and the genitals, the solar plexus chakra, the heart chakra, the throat chakra, the third eye chakra at the centre of the forehead, and the crown chakra on top of the head. These form a straight line down the torso. The chakras are located near important glands, and they can control healing. The pineal gland, which is near the crown chakra, controls balance and brain function, and the third eye chakra is near the pituitary gland, which controls the endocrine glands. Next, the throat chakra is surrounded by the thyroid and parathyroid glands, where you get thyroxin. Chakras are places where energy comes and goes into your body. Energy comes from the universe, and I direct it through my hands to the patients body. But its also important to use your mental power with the energy stream. The results are better this way, because the mental power and the universal power get synchronized and react well with the patients body. I also use another way of healing, by getting rid of toxins. People get sick because the toxins that are absorbed into the body create blockages in various places. Depending on the location of the blockage, you get various infections or symptoms. A big issue is accumulation of toxins near the heart that block arteries. If you do Reiki, the blockages can vanish very quickly. There is almost no massage in Reiki, but sometimes you have to do some massage on the spine to elongate it and make it more flexible. Cases of scoliosis can be resolved through Reiki massage techniques.
Q: Is there any western medicine involved in the treatment at all
A: No medications or drugs whatsoever.
Q: Can you explain the normal course of treatment How many times do people come for treatment
A: That depends on the illness. People who have diabetes must come for at least eight months, and sessions during that period of time. People with heart issues should come for 6 weeks. They should receive treatment for five consecutive days for the first week, and then three days per week for the other five weeks. Sometimes, people see results in as few as two or three days. Each treatment takes about an hour, so I see no more than seven patients per day.
Q: Are you the only person involved in Reiki treatments in Sri Lanka
A: No, not at all. I have taught about 120 students. Out of them, about 10 to 15 are practicing in different parts of the country. I taught them right here at my home.
Q: How did you get involved with and learn Reiki
A: In 1989, there was some confusion in Sri Lanka, and some people threatened me. So I went to America, because my wifes brothers and sisters were there. I lived in Staten Island, New York. First, I went to California because her brother was there. He was attached to an American Airline. After staying there for two weeks, I came to New York. I stayed nearly two years in America. One of her younger brothers, who has a doctorate in food science, learned at Hawaii University. He then he came to Wisconsin and was attached to Madison University.
I went to Madison to learn because he was a master. This is the certificate I got from Ranga Premaratne, my brother-in-law. I got my first degree from him in Madison. After that, he went to Australia. My final degree, that is a Reiki mastership, I got from him in Australia. I got my first Reiki degree in 1990, and in 2000, I got the mastership.
Q: Why were you drawn to this practice What about it interested you
A: Well, my brother-in-law was talking about Reiki, and I found it very interesting. I knew I wanted to learn it. Also, my mothers father was a navy doctor, and my eldest brother is a medical doctor. At that time, I thought of doing medicine, but it was a little too late because I had gone to the Arts Faculty and got a Bachelors degree in arts. But I wanted to do some kind of healing work, and I thought this would be good. Before 2000, I was a director of education, but after retiring, I started my practice here. I have treated more than 800 people.
Q: Have all of them made progress
A: Most people who come for the entire course of treatment do better afterwards. Some people come for a couple sessions and stop, and they tend to have problems later on.
Q: Is Reiki related to Ayurveda, or other eastern medical practices
A: No. Ayurveda also uses energy, but it comes through trees, plants, and nature. The energies are fundamentally different. Plants have specific energies. So practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine boil plants and make mixtures that have different energies. But here, with Reiki, we channel the energy through the palms of our hands.We make use of normal energy that is present in the universe. In Buddhism, there are four elements, matter, water, heat, and air, that are also the basic energies. Energy is everywhere, and it exists in our bodies, animals bodies, and plants.
Q: How has your life changed since you started Reiki
A: I am 77 now. This is Reiki Jin Kei Do. Reiki you know, but Jin means compassion. Kei means wisdom, and Do is the pathway. You take the path with wisdom and compassion. As Buddhists, we must be compassionate. When you learn Reiki Jin Kei Do, you must become more compassionate so that you can heal people better. If you engage in Reiki, the energy that comes from the universe helps us to maintain healthy bodies. But Ive also noticed that I have become healthier through doing Reiki, as the energy I transfer to the patients is good for both the patients and me. I think thats one of the reasons why I look and feel young. In Buddhism, they say that you need compassion to help people. And then you need wisdom to see what is really happening.

Before I Fall : A drab affair
Samantha keeps reliving the day of her death over and over again, until she figures a way to break the cycle.
Can we be done with movies using Groundhog Day as a narrative tool, please The idea of a person reliving the same day lost its novelty on February 13, 1993, a day after the Bill Murray-starrer hit theaters. Its 2017 now, and were still being served the same cheap knock-offs, and we dont know how to escape this loop.
Just like Samantha (Deutch) doesnt know how to escape her own Groundhog Day - the day of her death. Sam is your regular high-school girl with a blindingly stereotypical group of friends: the sassy mean girl (Sage), the drunk girl (Rahimi) and the Asian know-it-all (Wu). She wakes up on her judgement day, is mean to her parents, rides to school with her baes, breaks hearts, attends a party, gets into a fight, rides back home, meets with an accident and dies. Rinse and repeat.
If you must tell a story where the character is living through the same day every day, must you make it such a drab day Must the protagonist wear the same outfit every day Must they fall into the predictable pattern of rebelling on one day, and being saintly on the next Why is this story even worth telling Before I Fall leaves you with more questions than answers.
That said, the movie does talk about bullying and the importance of self worth. The concept is done-to-death, but handled with sensitivity. And Deutchs performance makes you root for Sam, her heartbreaking eventuality aside. Some of the banter between the girls might even crack you up. If youre a Gossip Girl fan, you may like the setting and take to the characters, unoriginal as they are.
However, nothing can compensate for the fact that its a movie about repetition that is, unintentionally, highly repetitive.

ICRA reaffirms Vallibel Finance long term ratings
ICRA Lanka, a group company of Moodys Investors has reaffirmed the issuer rating of [SL]BBB- with stable outlook for Vallibel Finance.
ICRA Lanka also has reaffirmed the [SL]BB+ rating with stable outlook for the Rs 500 million unsecured subordinated redeemable debentures programme and the [SL]AA-(SO) rating with stable outlook for the Rs 1,000 million guaranteed subordinated redeemable debentures programme of the company. SO suffixed to a rating symbol stands for Structured Obligation. An SO rating is specific to the rated issue, its terms and its structure.The SO ratings do not represent ICRA Lankas opinion on the general credit quality of the issuers concerned.
The rating for the guaranteed subordinated redeemable debentures is based on the strength of the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee from Hatton National Bank covering the principal and two interest instalments (semi-annual) and, the undertaking from the Trustee to declare the entire guaranteed amount as payable in the event the issuer does not meet the scheduled interest payment on any due date or in the event the issuer does not redeem the debenture in full on any redemption date. The guarantor undertakes the obligation to pay, on demand from the Trustee, Rs 1,102.5 million, being the total principal sum and two half-yearly interest instalments of the proposed Guaranteed Subordinated Redeemable Debentures.
The rating also assumes that the guarantee will be duly invoked by the Trustee, as per the terms of the underlying Trust deed, Trustee undertaking and guarantee agreements, in case there is a default in payment by VFP (Issuer).
The issuer rating takes note of the expected financial and managerial support from the Vallibel group of companies, its experienced senior management team, adequate internal controls and systems, comfortable asset quality profile (gross NPA at 3.15% as in Dec-16) and good profitability indicators (RoA1 at 2.58% and RoNW2 at 31.66%in 9MFY2016).

India set for win after Australian batting collapse
Dharamsala: All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja starred with both bat and ball on the third day of the fourth Test on Monday to put India on course for a series-clinching victory against Australia in Dharamsala.
The left-hander top-scored with 63 to help India surpass Australias first-innings total of 300 and then snared three wickets with his spin bowling as the visitors crumbled.
Indias pacemen did the early damage, with Umesh Yadav picking up two wickets and Bhuvneshwar Kumar dismissing the in-form Australian skipper Steve Smith for 17 to leave the Aussies reeling on 31-3 inside 10 overs.
A short ball from Kumar hit the bottom edge of Smiths bat before crashing onto the stumps in spectacular fashion.
Smith ended the four-Test series with 499 runs including three centuries, only the sixth visiting batsman to have scored so many hundreds in a series in India.
The spinners then got down to business on a lively track that offered plenty of bounce, with Ravichandran Ashwin also grabbing three wickets to help his side skittle out Australia for just 137 in the final session.
At stumps the top-ranked home side were 19-0, needing 87 more to win the match and clinch the Border-Gavaskar trophy with a 2-1 series scoreline. With two days of play remaining and all their wickets intact, India appear all set to seal a memorable win, capping weeks of controversies and verbal volleys between the top sides.
Day three also had its share of drama when Murali Vijay claimed a catch off Josh Hazlewood at the fag end of the Australian innings. Replays however showed the ball had spilled onto the grass.
TV cameras then showed Smith fuming in the dressing room and appearing to mumble angrily at Vijays attempt to claim the catch.
Australian batting coach Graeme Hick sought to play down the incident after the days play.
We were watching it on our own little pads and the ball definitely touched the ground, Hick said.
Having fielded in slips myself, sometimes youre not 100 per cent sure. He would have felt that go into his fingers and felt it was a clean catch.
At times this series has been heated but this game has been played in very good spirit.
India got their first breakthrough when Yadav had David Warner caught behind cheaply for six, just after the opener had been dropped in the slips by Karun Nair.
Nair had also dropped the same batsman in the first innings. Warner ended the four-Test series with an average of 24.12 -- his lowest in a series of four or more matches, and his third lowest overall.
The Indian fast bowlers exploited the pace offered by the wicket to put relentless pressure on the batsmen. Yadav also accounted for Matt Renshaw before Glenn Maxwell put on 56 for the fourth wicket with Peter Handscomb to steady the ship briefly.
But Handscomb was brilliantly caught by Indias stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane off Ashwin while Jadeja dismissed Shaun Marsh for one.
Jadeja had played a crucial knock with the bat earlier in the day, starring in a seventh-wicket stand of 96 with Wriddhiman Saha (31) to help India post 332 and swing the momentum their way.
You couldnt have asked for more. Jadeja and Saha batted really well. This morning was really special. The way they batted was fantastic, said Ashwin.
I told Jadeja there was a hundred for the taking. He is a very talented batsman: if he puts his head down, he can get that hundred. AFP

Sri Lanka annually imports close to US$ 60 million worth of yarn and US $ 300 million of fabric from India.Fernando said the removal of non tariff barriers and all other loopholes in the Indo - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement will also help improve imports and exports between many others sectors in both countries.
The Sri Lankan apparel industry currently employs half a million Sri Lankans and provides 44 percent of all manufactured goods exported by the country.
Fernando was speaking at the inauguration of IIT Expo 2017-(India International Textiles Expo-Colombo 2017) organised by the Powerloom Development and Export Promotion Council (PDEXCIL) (under Ministry of Textiles, Government of India) at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo yesterday. As part of export promotion activities, PDEXCIL has organised this Buyer Seller Meet (BSM) at Colombo, which is held on March 27 and 28.The event will be an opportunity to interact the stakeholders of textiles in both country and develop business opportunities on mutual benefit.
Sixteen Indian exhibitors are displaying their products in this two day event which is an unique opportunity for manufacturers and exporters to showcase their products before Sri Lankan buyers to interact with them and explore business relations and export opportunities.
This is in line with the Government policy of boosting exports from small and medium manufacturers of India. Exhibitors from various state clusters of India with their specialty products are participating in the event.

Insider information leakage, a possibility
There is possibly of an insider information leakage from the part of Public Debt Department or otherwise when issuing Treasury Bonds, the Deputy Governor ex officio Chairman of the Tender Board P. Samarasiri said yesterday.
He said he believes the true reason behind the Treasury Bond issue is not the introduction of purely an auction system but a leakage of insider information.
The unusual bidding patterns taken place at the questioned Treasury Bond auction bear witness to the information leakage, Samarasiri said.
A proper examination of the bid sheet prepared for the auction held on February 27, 2015 will expose the unusual bidding patterns, he pointed out.
When I examined the bid sheet of the questioned auction, I thought some people may have known that a higher volume than advertised will be accepted, Samarasiri said.
In previous bond auctions, the EPF bid has come first, which is not the case at the questioned auction. The EPF usually bid for the whole volume that is being advertised prior to the auction. In this case, they have bid at a later point and for a different amount, he explained.
Samarasiri said the officers of the PDD or outsiders to the PDD who are in demanding decision making positions have divulged the insider information regarding the questioned auction to parties who are not entitled to have these information.
Samarasiri highlighted that the establishment of certain offices at the PDD can question the transparency with which they hold Treasury Bond auctions.
The front office which handles auctions, receives information that normally the back office has, such as bond maturing dates, market pressures and who have or have not money in their hands, Samarsiri pointed out.
The front office, middle office and the back office of the PDD are all established in the same space. This is not the standard condition in setting up these offices. Back office should be in another department outside the PDD, Samarasiri explained.
Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane then questioned Samarasiri as to why steps were not being taken to change the incongruities that he has noticed.
Samarasiri pointed out there is not yet an environment conducive for him to bring forth large scale reforms to PDD.
Justice Jayawardane questioned as to why Samarasiri was not able to apply basic administrative measures such as introducing call record systems, ban mobile phones and so on, Samarasiri said, from his personal experience, such large scale reforms may have given rise to trade union actions.
I would have had to step down from my position if I have done all the preventive measures.
Asked by Justice K.T. Chitrasiri if trade unions are controlling the CBSL, Samarasiri said it indeed seems the case.
Thus, we are awaiting the impartial report from the Presidential Commission based on which it is possible to make the much needed reformations to uproot the improprieties taking place in the PDD, Samarasiri added.
Meanwhile, the Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda, who was leading evidence for the day, also observed there are sectors and institutions which are under trade unions severe control.
If I get a proper environment to impose regulations, it will only take me two or three months to improve the transparency and overall operation of the PDD, Samarasiri assured.
The Supreme Court Justices P. Jayawardane and K.T. Chitrasiri praised Samarasiri for testifying before the Presidential Commission inquring into the Treasury bond issue, with much sincerity, frankness and candidness.

Jones Bootmaker sale saves 840 jobs
The bulk of footwear chain Jones Bootmaker has been sold to investment firm Endless, saving 72 stores and 840 jobs.
However, the remaining 31 stores will close and about 260 jobs are expected to be lost.
Jones was owned by Alteri Investors, whose "value" shoe chain Brantano collapsed earlier this week.
Endless bought the profitable parts of the business under a "pre-pack" administration deal.
Under a pre-pack agreement, a buyer for a firm or its profitable assets is lined up in advance of the administrators being called in.
"We are delighted that we have been able to rescue such an iconic UK footwear brand as Jones Bootmaker, including a high proportion of stores and preserving a large number of jobs, especially given the current economic pressures faced by retailers across the UK," said Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator.
"This deal recognises the value of Jones as a strong and popular High Street brand with a loyal customer base."
Alteri Investors acquired Jones Bootmaker and Brantano in October 2015. About four months later, Brantano went into administration and Alteri bought it back, minus a few stores.
The chain subsequently faced "difficult trading conditions", and was put into administration on Wednesday after Alteri failed to find a buyer.
A pre-pack administration is one in which the insolvent company has already lined up a buyer for its profitable assets before it enters administration, allowing a sale within daysIt allows a firm to write off its debts and helps it close down loss-making parts of the businessCritics say pre-packs "stitch up" unsecured creditors and can allow directors to shed liabilities and buy back the business (under a new company)Others say that if a firm is by definition insolvent, unsecured creditors are unlikely to get their money back anyway, and that pre-packs allow for a quick rescue of the business and help secure jobs.

KAIR Airlines opts for A320s
South Korean start-up KAIR Airlines has placed a firm order for eight Airbus A320ceos. The new low-cost carrier is based in Cheongju and will operate international services throughout North East Asia.
We see enormous potential for the development of a low-cost model linking central South Korea with destinations in China, Taiwan and Japan, said Byung Ho Kang, KAIR Airlines Representative Director and Chairman. KAIR Airlines will focus on point-to-point services at low fares while offering passengers a modern and fun product offering. Brand new A320 aircraft will be perfect for our business model and customers, combining the lowest operating costs with the widest cabin in the single aisle segment.
John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers, said: We have been impressed by the business model developed by KAIR Airlines. We are confident that the efficiencies offered by the A320 will contribute to a successful launch by KAIR Airlines, bringing more choice for passengers flying in the North East Asian region.
The selection of the A320 by KAIR Airlines underscores once again the position of the Airbus single aisle product line as the preferred choice for low cost airlines in Asia.

Laws and regulations introduced to protect pilgrims
Laws and regulations pertaining to the safety of people going abroad on pilgrimages have been introduced by the Buddhist Affairs Ministry and the Department of Buddhist Affairs.
If the investigations into the recent deaths of three pilgrims in India proved that the institution that organised this particular pilgrimage had breached these laws and regulations its registration will be cancelled, said Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakshe.
The minister said a fair investigation would be made into the three deaths after obtaining information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Sri Lanka High Commission in New Delhi.
Minister Rajapakshe said several important factors are taken into consideration before granting registration to institutions involved in organising and conducting pilgrimages abroad.
Although their performance and compliance to these laws and regulations can be closely observed locally, it was difficult to observe whether they strictly adhere to them after taking pilgrims abroad.
However, steps would be taken to conduct a proper investigation into the three recent deaths, he emphasized.

Lee Mi-Rim runs away with LPGA Kia Classic
LOS ANGELES: South Korean Lee Mi-Rim fired seven birdies in a seven-under par 65 on Sunday to post a record-equalling triumph in the LPGA Kia Classic in Carlsbad, California.
Lee's 20-under par total of 278 matched the tournament record set by Cristie Kerr in 2015 -- when the American powered past Lee for a two-shot victory.
Determined not to be disappointed again, overnight leader Lee opened her round with a birdie and birdied every other hole on the front nine as she pulled away from the field.
She finished six strokes in front of compatriot Ryu So-Yeon, who carded a 66, and American Austin Ernst, who posted a 67.
I was a little nervous, but I made it, said Lee, who also added birdies at 15 and 16 before she was done.
Lee said her ball-striking was better this year than it was two years ago, when she couldn't hold on to her third-round lead.
She claimed her third LPGA Tour victory and her first since winning twice in her rookie season of 2014.
Her total could have been even more impressive. At 16 she left an eagle attempt short, and she had a good look at a long birdie at the last. Throughout much of the round it was Ryu giving chase.
She started the day five-strokes off Lee's lead, but pulled within three shots with three holes to play.
Although she was unable to convert several birdie attempts on the back nine, world number five Ryu said she was encouraged by her performance.
I think everything is right there, Ryu said. I just need to keep it patient and need to trust myself I'm good. Even though I haven't won any tournament I just cannot really blame anything. I felt like everything is pretty great. Ernst had five birdies in her bogey-free effort. She started the day four off the lead and said she kept an eye on the scoreboard -- where she saw Lee racing away from the field.
She was at 20-under, Ernst said. I knew at that point you're basically playing for second place unless she does something coming down the stretch.
My game was really solid.
Today was really a solid round of golf. Hit a bunch of greens. Gave myself a lot of the good looks.

Lyca Productions deny links with Rajapaksa
Lyca Productions, on Sunday, waded into the raging controversy over the now-cancelled visit of Indian superstar Rajinikanth to Jaffna, charging politicians who opposed the goodwill trip of doing nothing to help the Sri Lankan Tamils.
The production house also punched holes in the accusations that it had links with former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, saying, Our continuous actions to date have proven that such reports are untrue and unfounded.
Rajini was to participate in a function organised by Lyca Productions Gnanam Productions on April 9, during which 150 homes were to be handed over to war-displaced Tamils in Vavuniya in northern Sri Lanka.
We are saddened by the development of a negative environment surrounding aid programmes of a charity to further the political gain of some elements. We dont want the Superstar (Rajinikanth) to be subjected to an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation, the production house said in a statement.
Tearing into those accusing it of having links with Rajapaksa, the production house said some Tamil Nadu politicians who repeatedly speak out in support of those accusations might have been indebted to its competitors who want to defame their firm.
We suspect that these politicians are repeatedly spreading these fabricated and baseless rumours due to their obligations to our business competitors These politicians have done nothing for the betterment of Sri Lankan Tamils. However, there are politicians who are really concerned about the plight of ethnic Tamils, the statement said.
The production house also appealed to all concerned to let the company continue its efforts to alleviate the suffering of Sri Lankan Tamils. After the news of Rajini participating in the programme stoked a raging political row, the superstar cancelled his visit, though he expressed displeasure over the opposition.
VCK, PMK, MDMK and Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK) are some of the political outfits that opposed Rajinikanths visit to Sri Lanka. - Deccan Chronicle

Minister slams port union leaders as corrupt
Most of the port union leaders are connected with corruption that occur in the port, but they are pretending that they want to protect the Port, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranathunga said.
Addressing the passing out ceremony of Port security personnel held in the Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy at the Ports Authority, Ranatunge said similar to the previous government period, in this period too there are corrupt persons who were connected to the previous period.
We should establish a methodology to stand rigidly against those illegal practices, he said.
He said under his guidance they have terminated most of the fraud and corruption which took place in the port. But we have not archived 100% success but are working towards it.
He said that if corruption is not stopped, Sri Lanka cannot be rebuilt.We will never able to build this country if corruption is not contained.

Mobs opposite prisons
The public have been treated to the most bizarre scenes since NFF leader Joint Opposition firebrand Wimal Weerawansa commenced his hunger strike last week. While supporters of the MP were demonstrating outside the Welikada Prison, urging the authorities to release the MP, a group of Buddhist monks were shown chanting seth pirith on a makeshift stage to invoke blessings on the remanded politician. The MP is on a hunger strike protesting against what he calls government interference in his case. This amounts to a direct accusation against the court, the implication being the courts are taking direct instructions from government politicians. How the court will view the MP's claim will be eagerly watched in legal circles. Has the MP let himself in for a contempt charge
Be that as it may, Weerawansa who prides himself as a true socialist should not hesitate to take the rough, not losing sight of the fact that he is not alone in his predicament and that there are countless fellow inmates who are made to suffer for their follies. By staging hunger strikes the MP has exposed himself badly and has shown himself to be a person who cannot stomach the discomfiture of a remand cell. Perhaps, the luxury living Weerawansa is said to have indulged in when he was a powerful Minister under Rajapaksa, has made him soft.
The MP should submit himself to the law instead of trying to wriggle himself out of his present situation by staging hunger strikes and getting crowds to protest on his behalf. The MP was placed in remand custody following a court order for alleged misappropriation of state property that caused a Rs 90 million loss to the government. This was after a due process of investigation by the law enforcement, as in the case of any other investigation, following a complaint. Weerawansa cannot claim that he was being subject to a witch-hunt because he was put through the due process of law. His plea to the court to consider his daughter's mental anguish as special circumstances too is untenable given that a majority of our prisoners too have left behind their loved once who in all probability would be going through the same trauma. The MP had the opportunity to defend himself through his lawyers and in fact even made a dock statement in court where he accused the government of politically victimising him.
Hence, the Buddhist monks, now chanting seth pirith opposite the Welikada jail, cannot complain that the MP was denied an opportunity to present his version of the events, unlike in the case of war winning former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka who was subjected to a Kangaroo court trial. Neither was there any seth pirith chanting, then, by any of the Buddhist monks now active to secure the release of a politician who was afforded every opportunity to defend himself but refused bail after the court found the evidence sufficiently serious.
The monks may have only been invoking blessings to ensure no harm may visit the fasting man. But it also amounts to an attempt to secure his release. The chanting crowds and the slogans they shouted were indicative of this. If that is indeed the case, the action of the monks in trying to secure the release of an individual who has been subjected to the laws of land, through divine intervention cannot be accepted. It certainly is going to send the wrong message to would be felons that crime pays and that the gods will be at hand to secure their release. Today, some of Buddhist monks are seeing chanting seth pirith for the wrong reasons and at the wrong places. It would not be surprising if another group of monks repeat the Welikada prison act, to also secure the release of Duminda Silva, now on death row, or some other criminal who have fallen foul of the law and serving time behind bars. All religions enjoin that one has to suffer the consequences of once actions. Besides, no god would condone theft or felonies and by seeking the intervention of religion to attempt to set wrong doers, who have been duly punished under the law, free, those involved in the whole exercise would only be causing disrespect and dishonour to that religion and its founders.
It is time that the government takes firm action against those trying to challenge the due process of the law being implemented. If crowds are allowed to converge opposite prisons, accompanied by members of the clergy, to create scenes, demanding the release of convicts, there will no knowing where it will all end up. The day will not be far when unruly mobs will be seen going berserk in front of the country's prisons to secure the release of inmates. The public, was not so long ago, witness to similar scenes near our court houses. Now the scene apparently has shifted to our prison houses.

MR files objections against amended plaint filed by SLTB

Three defendants including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, named as defendants in connection with misappropriating a sum of Rs.142 million owed to the SLTB, whose buses were used to transport people to election rallies of former President during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign, yesterday filed objections against the amended plaint filed by the SLTB.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, presidential election committee members Gamini Senarath and Amal Senadhilankarawere among the respondents who filed objections against the amended petition.
Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne directed the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) file their objections on May 23.
At a previous occasion SLTB decided to exclude Minister Susil Premajayantha and Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa from the defendant list.
According to the amended plaint SLTB has named five UPFA 20015-presidential election committee members, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) election committee members Gamini Senarath and Amal Senadhilankara as respondents.
The SLTB earlier named seven parties including SLFP former general secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha as defendants.
The plaintiff said the UPFA hired buses from the SLTB for the January 8th, 2015 Presidential Election rallies but failed to settle the payments after obtaining the services.

Nadal rallies to reach fourth round in Miami
MIAMI: Rafael Nadal came back from an awful first set to defeat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 0-6, 6-2, 6-3 and advance to the fourth round of the Miami Open on Sunday.
The Spaniard, playing his 1,000th ATP match, suffered just the 14th 0-6 set of his career, claiming just 33 percent of first serve points won and making a string of unforced errors.
After looking badly out of sorts, Nadal was able to rediscover his form in the second set and in the end ran out a comfortable winner. Nadal will next face France's Nicolas Mahut, who beat Argentine Guido Pella 6-4 6-3.
Japan's Kei Nishikori came through a tough test against Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 7-6 (7/2), 6-7(5/7) 6-1.
Last year's beaten finalist, Nishikori will face Argentine Federico Del Bonis, who beat Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff 7-6 (7/5), 6-1.
Verdasco has yet to post a win against a top ten opponent this year but showed plenty of spirit in a two hours 44 minute contest on center court at Crandon Park fighting back to win a second set tie-break.
But Nishikori stepped up in the third, running away with the set to ensure his progress.
I knew it was going to be a tough one, Nishikori said. Fernando is a very solid player. He has a great serve and great groundstrokes. I knew it was going to be long rallies.
But it was a shame when I was up a break in both first and second sets and both went to 7-6. I made some mistakes when I was up a break. But in the third set I was very focused, he added. Injury-plagued world number five Milos Raonic pulled out of the tournament shortly before his match against American Jared Donaldson, citing a recurrence of a hamstring injury.
Canada's Raonic originally suffered the injury in the semi-final at Delray Beach and was forced to forfeit the final against American Jack Sock. He then missed this month's Masters event at Indian Wells. -AFP

Newspaper pundits - best of the bad word bandits!
As far as I can recall I have always been captivated with the printed word. And to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they say on Hulftsdorp Hill I have also been fascinated by some decidedly unprintable ones as well. That would be no surprise to any journalist of my vintage who will endorse my assertion that proficiency in profanity was once a sort of norm, a prerequisite of the trade, so to say.
I have never been a fan of outright blue humour or excessive vulgarity. Okay, I concede that I can out-swear the best of them in all three national languages and as an additional facility in Chinese and Malay. Swearing is universal. Even world leaders are not immune to it. Sir John Kotelawala, one of Sri Lankas most admired and controversial prime ministers of the time, was not averse to emitting a tirade of cusswords when the occasion demanded it. Media mythology has it that he castigated some photographers while he accompanied Queen Elizabeth II on her first visit here in April 1954.
Legend has it that Sir John was holding a parasol over the Queen who was taking in the panorama of the countryside through a pair of binoculars at Sigiriya. Fascinated by some object in the distance, the Queen handed the binoculars to Sir John while taking the umbrella from him and inviting him to take a look.
Delighted at the prospect of the Queen of the Commonwealth holding an umbrella over him the prime minister took his time observing the scene while muttering to the photographers in local parlance to capture the unique moment. Finally becoming incensed because he thought they were too slow with the shutters the feisty knight lambasted them with a litany of Sinhala expletives which would have constrained a trooper to blush. A totally bemused Queen kept asking: I beg your pardon, Sir John! To which he answered: Just telling the people behind us to watch their step, your Majesty. Mercifully for diplomatic protocol his dirty diatribe was confined to choice Sinhala vernacular.
I must disclose that my lingo even as a lisping toddler was not exactly considered the paragon of propriety. That is because of my encounters with some vagrant urchins who were allowed the freedom of romping and foraging in our family back yard. They were congenital exponents of shockingly shameless vocabulary. But to give them credit their vituperatively colourful banter was scandalously skilful in a dubiously creative sort of way.
I was always a fast learner particularly where languages and taboo subjects are concerned. When it comes to sheer authentic swearing few languages can be as colourful and eloquently expressive as both the Sinhala and Tamil vernacular. I was enlightened at a tender age that certain idioms in both national languages were the diametric opposites of what they sounded like in Anglo-saxon. For example, phrases that sounded remarkably similar to, say, hooks and eyes were decidedly not referring to the clothes fasteners you would find in your mothers needlework basket.
Reprimands such as having my mouth rinsed out with soapy water and bottom-smackings notwithstanding were never an effective deterrent. I must add that the early aberration has held me in pretty good stead in the newsrooms of journals and in the streets of Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. And in the newsrooms the closer to the perilous deadlines the thicker and more imaginative the swearing became.
Not surprising, really, because we hacks are usually dragooned into all kinds of ungodly nocturnal shifts enjoyed by certain other professionals such as cat-burglars, twilight women and body-snatching ghouls, to name a few. That is evidently why the language of editors, sub-editors and reporters, particularly around the witching hours of 2 am or thereabouts, could never be the subject of polite parlour conversation.
Although many did not possess the same refined vocabulary of a literary genius such as Mark Twain, they certainly appeared to have been on a similar plane of thought as the great American author who once said: Under certain circumstances, urgent circumstances, desperate circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer.
Yes we the wordsmiths who forge out the best for our readers, are often called upon to perform delicate surgery on badly written copy and sheer butchery on the more horrendous contributions. It goes without saying that the surgeons of the written word mind every other persons language but our own.
Some of the best, most colourful expletives have been fashioned by bored and frustrated journos. Yes, we are quite a breed apart. And we conjure up the more exotic abuse while prowling the stone (pre-production line) to exorcise those beastly little printers devils. By this time one is assailed by myopic eye strain and it often becomes difficult to spot the most obvious faux pas even when the font is staring you in the face in all its immense 60 point glory.
Years ago when I was a young sub-editor on this very newspaper I almost missed a typographical headline blooper in titanic type that should have read: Woman jumps in front of train. The problem was that the letter p had been mistakenly interposed for the character j in the word jumps.
No need to state the obvious in a single letter gaffe in the word Luck for the lottery results headline also intercepted in the nick of time by a crusty old duty editor. It was supposed to read: Luck of the draw. The duty editor, unrivalled in his range of outrageous curses came charging at the offending sub-editor who had missed the slip yelling a string of imaginatively coined swear words with a poetic touch: You darn blind idiot. Do I always have to save us the blushes just because you are such a complacent cross-eyed son of a hooksie who simply cant take a proper looksee!
In an environment peopled by a bunch of versatile opponents in the art of vituperation was the deaf and dumb sub-editor colleague I once worked with who could lip-read and expressed himself quite effectively with hand signs to make his point. Despite his deficiency in hearing and unable to mouth the spoken word he could out-cuss the best of them in the same offensive faculty with dramatically communicative hand gestures.
After one such episode following his gesticulated hurling of vile imprecations at a whole bunch of colleagues one of them posed the pertinent question: Does his mother ever wash his filthy fingers with soap

Neymar declares Brazil the best team in the world, rejects Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo comparisons

Neymar, in his first press conference for the national team in nearly a year, insists Brazil and re the best team in the world.
Brazil are top of the South American World Cup qualifying for Russia next summer by seven points having won nine of their 13 games so far.
But the 25-year-old also admitted he had to mature and promised Brazil would be one of the favourites in the next World Cup in Russia.
But while the 25-year-old promised Brazil would be among the favourites for a sixth World Cup triumph next summer, he also admitted he had to mature a lot since they hosted the tournament in 2014.
"There was never a dependency on Neymar. This is Brazil. If focused, our team is the best," he said before the World Cup qualifying match against seventh-place Paraguay on Tuesday.
"There has been a big change. We now have more confidence to seek our identity and we did it. No matter when or where, Brazil will always be one of the favourites for titles.
"We know this, we are humble enough to respect our adversaries, we have to play. Sometimes one part or the other didn't fit. But coach Tite arrived and made adjustments. We are playing football. The players are not so different  it is the way of playing. Now everyone turns up."
But Neymar also accepted he had to change to get to the current level of play.
"We only learn when we get hurt or do something wrong. I already argued unnecessarily. I got yellow and red cards, harmed myself, harmed my teammates. But time makes us more mature. Nowadays I only think about playing football, I am better in every aspect," he added.
"Everyone needs time to get their heads straight so things calm down. I had my moment of being a little more silent, but now I am speaking again."
Although some already put him as future best player in the world, including big names like former Italian defender Alessandro Costacurta, Neymar rejected comparisons with multiple Ballon D'Or winners Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi.
"I don't feel comfortable to compare," he said. "They are two geniuses who have had colossal performances. I admire both. One is on my side every day, is the best I've played with."
"I was having a lot of difficulties in my beginning (at Barcelona). Then the best in the world said 'Calm down, it will all fall into place, play your game.' It was great for me.
"I was reticent about talking to an idol, but Messi helped me relax. We are friends and that helps on the pitch. I also get along with Luis Suarez, we always help each other. I am very happy for this moment that I am living."
Brazil will qualify for the World Cup with four games in hand at the Arena Corinthians if they beat Paraguay and see Chile and Ecuador fail to win.

Nigerians boycott Coca-Cola drinks after court rules them 'poisonous'

Consumers of Sprite and Fanta have more to worry about than rotting teeth according to a Lagos High Court judge, who ruled that the Coca-Cola products could be "poisonous."
The court held that high levels of benzoic acid and sunset additives in the popular soft drinks could pose a health risk to consumers when mixed with ascorbic acid -- commonly known as vitamin C -- according tolocal media reports.
Justice Adedayo Oyebanji ordered the Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) to place written warnings on Fanta and Sprite bottles against drinking them with vitamin C, and awarded costs of two million naira ($6,350) against the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) for failing to ensure health standards.
"It is manifest that NAFDAC has been grossly irresponsible in its regulatory duties to the consumers of Fanta and Sprite manufactured by Nigeria Bottling Company," the judge said. "NAFDAC has failed the citizens of this great nation by its certification as satisfactory for human consumption products ... which become poisonous in the presence of ascorbic acid."
Incendiary judgement
The incendiary judgment followed a lawsuit brought against regulator NAFDAC and the NBC -- a member of Coca-Cola Hellenic group which bottles Coca-Cola products in Nigeria -- by Lagos businessman Dr. Emmanuel Fijabi Adebo.
The claimant's company, Fijabi Adebo Holdings Limited, attempted to export Coca-Cola products to the United Kingdom for retail in February 2007.
But authorities in the UK seized and subsequently destroyed a shipment, Adebo claimed, because the products contained excessive levels of sunset yellow and benzoic acid. The latter substance can form the carcinogen benzene when combined with ascorbic acid, according to the USFood and Drug Administration (FDA).
Lawyers for the NBC argued that the products were not intended for export, but Justice Adedayo Oyebanji rejected this defence.
"Soft drinks manufactured by Nigeria Bottling Company ought to be fit for human consumption irrespective of colour or creed," the judge said.
Adebo was pleased by the verdict but vowed to pursue further damages.
"I'm happy that I'm victorious and we've alerted Nigerians and the entire world to what is happening in Nigeria," the businessman told CNN. "What the court fined NAFDAC is not one tenth of the amount I've spent on litigation ... We should have been awarded at least the amount that we spent in purchasing that product and in exporting it to UK. We are entitled to special damages for what we have gone through."
Different standards
Both the NBC and NAFDAC are appealing against the ruling, arguing that the Coca-Cola products do not exceed benzoic acid limits for Nigeria or international limits set by Codex, the international food standards body administered by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
"The UK standards limit benzoic acid in soft drinks to a maximum of 150 mg/kg. Both Fanta and Sprite have benzoic levels of 200 mg/kg which is lower than the Nigerian regulatory limit of 250 mg/kg,"wroteSade Morgan, legal, public affairs and communications director of the NBC.
"The permissible ingredient levels set by countries for their food and beverage products are influenced by a number of factors such as climate, an example being the UK, a temperate region, requiring lower preservative levels unlike tropical countries."
Codex recently reduced its international limit for benzoic acid volume from 600 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg, and is considering a further reduction in the coming years.
"The previous levels are still considered as safe -- they are just not necessary," says Tom Heilandt, secretary of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, explaining the change. "More work will be done over the next few years to see if the levels could be further adjusted."
The levels found in Nigeria Coca-Cola products should not pose health risks, according to Dr Markus Lipp, a senior food safety officer at the FAO.
"The current acceptable limit for benzoates by the Codex Alimentarius Commission is set to be 250mg/kg," he told CNN. "This maximum use limit has a temporary designation, but nevertheless is considered for now to be appropriately health protective."
"There simply does not seem to be health concern from our perspective," Lipp said of the Lagos case.
Nigeria's health ministry alsoreleased a statementclaiming that the products are safe.
"NAFDAC and SON (Standards Organization of Nigeria) regularly monitor the manufacturing practices of food industries and conduct laboratory analysis to ascertain continuous compliance with required national standards," said the statement.
However, Health Minister Isaac Adewole insisted that the government is responding to public concerns, and has opened an investigation into the safety of Coca-Cola products made in Nigeria.
Consumer backlash
Attempts to downplay the controversy are unlikely to succeed, at least in the short term, as alarm spreads among consumers.
Nigeria's Consumer Protection Council (CPC) has opened itsown investigation.
"(The council) is extremely concerned about the questions that have arisen from, and on account of this judgement," said Director General, Dupe Atoki. "Fanta, Sprite and Coca Cola have arguably and consistently been the most widely consumed beverages in Nigeria. The spectrum of consumption is also perhaps the widest, with consumption starting as early as age four and far into adult years."
On social media, citizens expressed dissatisfaction with the way NAFDAC is handling consumer safety in the country. Several citizens accused the agency of placing more priority on generating revenues than protecting citizens.
The NBC acknowledge they face an uphill struggle to contain the scandal and rebuild their reputation.
Coca-Cola hope that appeals against the ruling will be successful and rehabilitate the brands.
"The Ministry of Health communique could not be more clear that there is no issue with the safety of Fanta and Sprite," says Hamish Banks, Coca-Cola VP for Public Affairs and Communications, Eurasia and Africa. "The levels of all ingredients in these products, including benzoates and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), are well within the conservative guidelines of the Codex Alimentarius and the Nigeria Industrial Standards."
"While it is not appropriate to comment further on a pending case and while the court considers appeals by NBC and NAFDAC against the ruling, it is evident that there is no safety issue associated with these ingredients," he added.
For one of the world's most successful and global brands, the hope is that the backlash does not travel beyond Nigeria's borders.

NPHCTF to highlight Hill Country Tamils grievances
An organization by the name of Northern Province Malayaha Makkal Onriyam or Northern Province Hill Country Tamil Forum (NPHCTF), has been formed to represent the grievances of the Hill Country Tamils who are living in the Northern Province.
The Organization formed last week met Northern Province Chief Minister, C.V. Vigneswaran and submitted a memorandum to him, highlighting the issues Hill Country Tamils have faced since settling in the North after the ethnic riots in 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983.
According to the Director of the Institute of Social Development, P. Muthulingam who led the delegation together with former Northern Provincial Council Member M.P. Nadaraja, the Chief Minister welcomed the idea of forming an organisation to represent the issues of the marginalised hill country Tamils who live in the Northern Province and regretted to hear the problems faced by the Malayaha Makkal in the Northern Province. Further he assured to take action to address the issues of the Malayaha Community.
The Hill Country Tamils at present reside in 40 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Kilinochchi district, 86 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Vavuniya district and 38 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Mullaitivu district; overall they consist of 40 percent of the Northern Province. But, the NPHCTF alleges that though the Hill Country Tamils became part and parcel of the 30 year war, soon after the war, some initiations were taken to provide infrastructure development by the government and provincial council but the said attempts excluded the Hill Country Tamils who lived in the Northern Province.
Hence, the Hill Country Tamils live in the area with their distinguished cultural identity. The native Tamils also look at them as a distinguished separate Tamil community.
In terms of livelihood, they point out that the Hill Country Tamils were settled in the upper part of the lakes and tanks and are not in a position to engage in agriculture due to the unavailability of water, This made them rely on others for agriculture or work as daily labourers in their lands. As a result, the community is unable to engage in agricultural activities which is their main livelihood. This resulted in them having no opportunity to increase their income, Muthulingam said.
Similar problems also exist in the areas of housing, education, political representation, employment and infrastructure development; where the NPHCTF feel that the Hill Country Tamils have been discriminated and dealt with a poor hand.
They have thus requested the Provincial and National authorities to identify and address the development needs of the Hill Country Tamils to ensure their inclusion as a focus group in divisional development plans.

Odiliya Residencies set off ground breaking for ALTEZZA Wattala
Odiliya Residencies (Pvt) Ltd, the latest addition to the Odiliya Group held the ground breaking ceremony for the construction work of Altezza luxury apartments amongst some distinguished guests, customers, staff and well-wishers on March 23, 2017 at the project site, Aweriwatta Road, Wattala.
Altezza, as its name suggest, is the highest building in the Wattala area with 60 luxury apartments of different floor areas and with all luxury amenities.
All 60 apartment units in the project Altezza are well designed by a renowned firm of Chartered Architects and all construction work will be done using quality building materials from cement to paints and electrical work to plumbing. At the roof top- you find a state-of-the-art gymnasium, club house and a swimming pool exclusively for the use of the residents. Being first in the Wattala area, Altezza Residencies will stand tall with a blend of urban outlook in a countryside atmosphere, which sets an ideal footing for a halcyon life.
The project is expected to be completed within two years and prices of the apartment units are starting from Rs.12 million and all the two bed room apartment were sold out.
Briefing to the media Rohitha Abeygunaratne, Managing Director of the Odiliya Homes Group of Companies told that Altezza is one of the remarkable milestones of the gradual and steady progress of the group. He further added that apartment business is the fast growing business segment of the country in present context and the government has taken some positive steps to foster this segment, namely complete removal of the restriction imposed earlier on the purchase of apartments to the foreigners from fourth floor onwards, exempting the sale of apartments from VAT, relaxation of resident visa system for foreigners who invest in Sri Lanka, to quote a few.
According to Rohitha Abeygunaratne, with encouragements given by the government to this segment, customers could look at purchasing an apartment in two angles; one is the residential purpose and the other being the investment purpose. Whatever the objective that could be, the customer will be benefitted ultimately in terms of value appreciation and guaranteed actualization of capital gain each year. So this is a golden opportunity for the customers that should not let go out of their investment plans, he said.
Rohitha Abeygunaratne attributed the reputation earned by the name Odiliya in the real estate industry and the confidence reposed on the company by customers of different social strata over the past years triggered by the untiring efforts of the staff of the group are the root causes for the growth of the group.
Dhammika Dissanayake, Sales Manager of Altezza Residencies said that since the highest quality materials would be used for the project there should not be any concern in the minds of the customers as to the strength and durability of the apartments. He also told that the even before the commencement of the constructions, 40% of the units was sold and reservations were done by customers, which itself provides good credentials on the customer demand.

Oil nations look at extending supply cut
Major oil producers are considering extending their recent cuts to output in a fresh bid to boost prices.
Countries in the oil cartel Opec and several other oil nations started to reduce production at the start of 2017.
The move initially pushed up the oil price, but it has dropped in the last few weeks on fears the limits would not be enough to deal with an oil glut.
A group of ministers agreed on Sunday to review extending the cuts by six months, taking them to the end of 2017.
At a meeting in Kuwait, they requested that officials report next month "regarding the extension of the voluntary production adjustments".
Opec countries and 11 other oil-producing nations, including Russia, agreed in December 2016 to slash production, the first time in 15 years that a global pact had been struck.
The price of Brent crude peaked at over $57 a barrel in January, before slipping back to below $51 a barrel in recent weeks.
That was after Opec revealed a surprise jump in global crude stocks in February, and US oil producers - who are not part of the cuts - started to increase production again. Abhishek Deshpande, an oil analyst at Natixis, told the BBC the price had fallen after oil traders became "jittery" about the market.
In particular, they were uncertain about the commitment of Russia and Saudi Arabia, Opec's biggest member, to the cuts, Deshpande said.
The oil countries now need to show "discipline" and cut back on production in the coming months because stocks are still too high, he said.
"The chances remain high for an extension to the supply cuts, as long as there are more stockpile withdrawals," he added.Formed in 1960, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) coordinates the energy policies of member countries, who produce about a third of the world's oilIts members include Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and VenezuelaA number of other major oil-producing nations such as the US and Russia are not Opec members.

Power Rangers director comments on major film cameos
While the Power Rangers live-action reboot is reimagining the series for a new generation, it doesnt leave longtime fans in a lurch either. Iconic items like the Power Coins, the Zords, Alpha 5 and Zordon are along for the ride, including two fan-favorites from the original Power Rangers series.
Spoilers ahead for Power Rangers, so if you dont want to know you might want to head to our Power Rangers hub for more news. The film is currently enjoying an out of 5 rating on ComicBook.coms anticipation rankings.
CinemaBlends Conner Schwerdtfeger recently screen the film and noticed two familiar faces within Angel Groves city limits. Those would be actors Amy Jo Johnson and Jason David Frank. Johnson of course played Kimberly the Pink Ranger while Frank played Tommy the Green Ranger. The two were always a fan favorite couple in the original series, and Power Rangers director Dean Israelite recently commented on their appearance in the film.
Yeah, you saw them. ... Those were really the two that we thought were important to put in there and you know obviously were teasing something at the end that relates to [Tommy] so it sort of all felt organic.
That tease happens in the mid-credits scene, but it only pertains to the character of Tommy, not Frank in particular. Naomi Scott is now in the role of the Pink Ranger, and the franchise will cast someone else to be in the Tommy role. Still, its a delightful passing of the baton while still embracing part of what made the series great.
Sabans Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove  and the world  is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late.
Power Rangers stars Bryan Cranston (Zordon), Elizabeth Banks (Rita Repulsa), Naomi Scott (Kimberly/Pink Ranger), David Denman (Sam Scott), Becky G. (Trini/Yellow Ranger), Sarah Grey (Amanda), RJ Cyler (Billy Cranston/Blue Ranger), Emily Maddison (Rebecca), Ludi Lin (Zack Taylor/Black Ranger), and Dacre Montgomery (Jason Lee Scott/Red Ranger).

Raviraj Murder: Court of Appeal orders CID to find whereabouts of three acquitted Naval officers

The Court of Appeal today issued an order directing the CID Director to provide information regarding the whereabouts of three navy intelligence officers who were acquitted and released fromthe Ravirajmurder case.
At a previous occasion, three navy intelligence officers were noticed to appear before Court regarding a revision petition filed by the wife of former TNA Jaffna district MP NadarajaRaviraj.
When the revision petition came up before Court of AppealJustice H.C.J. MadawalaandJusticeL.T.B.Dehideniya, the Court was informed that the notices had not been sent to the three navy officers because the authorities have still not been able to locate their whereabouts.
Accordingly, the CID Director was noticed to appear in Court on May 19 by Court of Appeal to submit a report regarding the three navy officers.

To Russia with Love Buoyant Brazil on brink of World Cup
Montevideo: A buoyant Brazil could book their place at the 2018 World Cup on Tuesday while Argentina will attempt to give their qualifying campaign more breathing space with a game at altitude against Bolivia.
After sinking into a protracted depression after the trauma of their humiliating 2014 World Cup exit, Brazil have undergone a transformation since new manager Tite took over last year.
Tite, who was appointed after the debacle of the 2016 Copa America Centenario, when Brazil failed to qualify from the group stage, has overseen a record-breaking run of seven straight wins.
The latest of those victories came on Thursday, when Brazil shrugged off an early Edinson Cavani goal to destroy Uruguay 4-1 in Montevideo.
That win marked a new record for Brazil in qualifiers, surpassing the six straight victories recorded by the fabled Pele-led team which went on to win the 1970 World Cup in Mexico.
Brazil's magnificent run of form under Tite means they now lead the South American standings with 30 points from 13 games, seven points clear of second placed Uruguay who have 23 points.
It is all a far cry from the state of the table last September. When Tite took charge of his first qualifying game, Brazil were languishing in sixth place overall, with only nine points from six games.
But on Tuesday, if Brazil beat Paraguay in Sao Paulo, and Chile and both Ecuador and Chile lose their games, the five-time World Cup-winners will have secured their berth in Russia. -AFP

Sadaharitha launches mobile office to promote forestry
Sadaharitha Plantations, has launched a novel promotional vehicle that doubles up as a mobile office for the convenience of customers. The concept of a two-in-one vehicle to promote forestry as an investment is a first time in Sri Lanka.
"Ours is much more than just a promotional vehicle" Sadaharitha Brand Manager Janaka Opallage said. "We use one side of the exterior surface of the vehicle to focus on the extent of land that we own, the valued customer base we have and the diverse crops we offer, which projects our corporate profile in a nutshell.
On the other side we highlight the newest, most popular and lucrative crop, Agarwood from which originate most of the high end perfumes and scents in the world. The display appears to attract potential customers to our innovative mobile office. The retractable roof expands the vehicle into a comfortable office space where customers can learn about the investment in comfort."
The vehicle has high definition TV with a movable bracket allowing a 180 degree rotation for customers to view the videos and understand the advantage of commercial forestry the company offers investors.
This provides value added support to the company's sales team who now has the advantage of ensuring that documentation can be completed on the spot wherever the mobile office happens to be and ensure a hassle-free investment for the customer.
"Once the mobile office wraps up for the evening, it becomes an entertainment centre offering music, fun and games as well as gifts with a propagandist on board to interactively communicate with the audience and extend the activation to a memorable customer experience. We plan to have the two-in-one vehicle visiting all our branches on its route and also visit the north and east to discover the unexploited market" Janaka Opallage said.

Saying it with flowers
Flowers have always inspired me since childhood says Samitha Wijayasekara of The Wedding Flowers, a successful floral designing company. Samitha has always been fascinated with the emotions brought out by flowers and their symbolism. Daily News features Samitha who has blossomed alongside her chosen vocation.
Q: Why are you passionate about flowers
A: I decided I needed to do something about my passion for flowers and floral dcor. Thus here I am - the owner of a successful floral designing company, brightening people's lives every day and bringing joy to newlyweds on their wedding ceremony.
Q: What does floriculture mean
A: Floriculture, or flower farming, is similar to that of horticulture, the difference being that it is concerned with the cultivation of flowering and ornamental plants for the floral industry. As an event decoration company, we use these flowers in various floral designs and incorporate them into our events.
Q: Tell me a little about this new venture of yours
A: Academy of Floral Design was launched after much thought and careful effort. It was always my wish to educate students on the concept of flowers and the important role it plays in our lives.
A: Firstly floral design is not at all recognized in Sri Lanka nor is the floral industry. It is believed that floral designing can be attempted by simply anyone; however a floral structure requires a lot of knowledge and careful technique which can only be acquired through learning and experience. It is most difficult to create a structure that fits well into the setting and which is also pleasing to the eye. Due to this I decided that it's time that Sri Lankan students realize the importance of floral designing and launched the first ever Floral Designing Academy which will change the fate and history of the floral industry.
The School academy is important. Involved in so many international workshops, we update our knowledge whenever we learn. I thought of sharing the knowledge I learnt.
There are so many talented people, and nowadays everyone wants to do something creative.
Q: You were an accountant. Why did you change your career
A: Yes I was an accountant for quite some time at a leading company. I left to start up my own company as I've always had a blazing passion for floristry and floral design and this is the sole reason for my career change. Hence I switched to floral designing from accounting in 1995 and I havent looked back since.
I chose to be an accountant in the beginning as I was unsure whether my love for flowers would really take me anywhere, so I unwillingly became an accountant to support my family. However had I started my path then, I would have been even more successful than I already am. But I guess everything happens for a reason and this probably happened so that I re-discovered my passion for flowers.
Q: Would you encourage any youth to join the floral industry Is it a lucrative field
A: The sole reason of launching the Academy of Floral Design is to educate young minds and for all those interested and to improve the floral industry. By doing this not only will the industry be recognized but it'll also open up many new startups and will lead to more entrepreneurs to support our economy. At the moment the floral industry is rather dull, however when more students recognize its value, the industry will thrive and flourish. The aim of creating such an academy is to discover the potential of this field hence it's certainly a successful line to be in.
Q: What is the floral industry like in Sri Lanka and how do you compare it to the west
A: The floral industry in Sri Lanka is steady but not extremely successful as in the West. This is due to lack of awareness as most people want to take on a more professional job in fear of not doing well in terms of progress and finance. Also the floral industry has received minimal support from the government and less funds to encourage young entrepreneurs to break into the market. This in turn makes it a least favorable job among youngsters. However it is being recognized since the past 6 to 8 years and the number of entrepreneurs emerging in the market has also increased. With the introduction of the academy there will definitely be an increase of entrepreneurs in the floral industry.
Q: Tell me a little bit about the awards that you have won.
A: I was awarded The Woman Entrepreneur of the year 2015 under the Bronze category organized by WCIC, Merit award for Entrepreneur Awards Western Province 2016 organized by NEDA and my company was also recently placed 2nd runner up in The National Business Excellence Awards 2016 organized The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.
Q: As a person do you feel you have that flair for floral designing because you need to deal with customers
A: Well of course as with experience comes great expertise. I believe that I have that extra spark when it comes to dealing with customers. The uniqueness and style of my floral structure is what gives me that advantage.
Q: What are your future plans
A: Well for now I'm focusing mostly on the company and the academy, and I'm currently working on introducing more courses so that our students have different courses to select from.
Q: Your message to the society
A: I would like to call out to everyone out there who have a passion for everything floral. Please nurture the talent you have. Always look to expand knowledge and understanding.
This is entirely why I launched my floral academy as I want youngsters to hope for something beyond a desk job, something that would make them happy and keep them content in the long run. I would like those interested to take this step forward to create something exciting and new.

SL needs more institutions akin to SAITM
Sri Lanka should open higher educational institutions like the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe and not try to close them or entice the government on taking over them, said Sri Lankan born Dr. Shirani M. Perera now based in USA .
On a holiday in Sri Lanka she said that unwanted controversies created on this issue is not at all acceptable. Look, Sri Lanka needs more doctors and what is wrong in private universities producing them. Some of the Sri Lankan doctors who are practicing in Sri Lanka also have had their education in foreign medical colleges. If they can learn in private universities in foreign countries why the local universities cant produce them, she asked.
She also said that sending a child for medical education overseas is a very costly affair for a Sri Lankan parent and it also drains foreign exchange out of Sri Lanka. She said universities of this nature can fill the vacuum of doctors and also attract foreign students to study in them and earn foreign exchange.
Dr. Shiraniwho is also the Assistant Professor, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, USA said however that standards should be maintained in medical education, examinations as well as in the entry levels.
Dr. Shiranialso said she was very surprised to note that Sri Lankan doctors do not pay taxes during private practice in Sri Lanka unlike in the US and some other countries.

Sri Lankas international image will bring benefits to people: Ravi
A positive international image built by Sri Lanka subsequent to its ability to make changes to the economy during the last two years should be used to build up the country, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
Minister Karunanayake was addressing a ceremony at the Finance Ministry
yesterday to mark the conferment of the award for the Best Finance Minister of Asia Pacific Region on him by an internationally recognised London based Financial Magazine The Banker.
The minister said the difficulties faced by the people are a commitment that made to ensure a better tomorrow. Taxes will be reduced. Benefits will be passed on to the people soon, he said.
The minister said positive changes in the local economy have been recognised internationally although it is not palatable to extremist politicians.
Minister Karunanayake said: The country wouldnt have been able to achieve this victory without the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. I made a request soon after I assumed duty on January 10, 2015 to work together like one family and take the ministry activities forward. My request was honored. Certain groups in Sri Lanka looked at our work with a crooked eye, but our work has been assessed an appreciated internationally.
He said: This award is evidence to our good work and our journey forward. We should use this international recognition in building up our country. A country cannot run on loans. Loans should be turned into investment. When independence was declared for our country in 1948, Japan remained equal to Sri Lanka. However, per capita income in Japan is US$ 55,000 today while ours is US$ 4000. What is the barrier standing before us It is the way of our thinking, our work and the way of how we negotiate with the rest of the world.
We have a good opportunity to think anew. When we assumed office, the countrys revenue was not sufficient to repay loan installments. But unity and the commitment by the people helped us to make achievements. We are earning more than that of the recurrent expenditure. We do not need to obtain loans to repay loans, Minister Karunanayake said.
Parliamentarians Nalin Bandara, Hector Appuhamy and Finance Ministry Acting Secretary Chandra Ekanayake, Deputy Secretaries S.R. Atygalle and A.R. Deshapriya were also present.

Sri Lanka is at an exciting time of transformation and transition. The country is seeking to reconcile and prosper, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking at the 60th anniversary celebration of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and the Russian Federation recently.
The minister said the country is on a new path towards good governance, reconciliation and development.
He stressed the importance of transmuting peace dividends into tangible economic and social progress for all Sri Lankans.
We recall with great appreciation the development assistance that contributed in no small measure to support Sri Lankas economic and social development, he said.
The minister said the former Soviet Union remained a principal bilateral development partner in the 1960s. The technical assistance provided built the foundation of Sri Lankas manufacturing sector, the minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said Sri Lanka is proud of the Russian literary giants, philosophers, political thinkers, scholars, artists, explorers and musicians, who have richly contributed to global culture and education.
Sri Lankas own literary and political traditions have been enriched by Russian literature and political movements. We continue to celebrate Chekovs plays, and commemorate his visit to our country in 1890, he said.
Sri Lanka continues to commemorate the October Revolution, he said.
Russias generous gift to Sri Lanka has been the educational opportunities provided for thousands of Sri Lankan students for nearly three decades since the 1960s. In the early days, Sri Lankan students were awarded annual scholarships to pursue medicine, engineering and other technical fields at the Peoples Friendship University. Many of the beneficiaries of these scholarships contributed to Sri Lankas overall development, he said.

A stitch in time saves nine
Students violence in the country has reached alarming proportions. The other day , it was reported both in the electronic and print media that an unruly herd of black sheep had had a skinful in the holy precincts of their school and got intoxicated to the fullest and admitted to the nearest hospital by their own teachers. They were virtually in disgrace. The teachers are so pupil-friendly and it is said that the teacher is a caretaker and a facilitator in the modern sense.
Liquor is generally associated with the so called big Matches of the prestigious schools. The past pupils gather under the school flag on that day for some time and leave the match for a nearby rendezvous to have a fag and a drink. They return to their places having drunk and start cheering quite unconsciously. If their great alma mater seems to get defeated they encroach on the pitch and make a big pandemonium. This is the situation that I have witnessed for several years and now I avoid most of the big matches due to disgust. They become the role-model for the young children and they develop a certain idea how to behave at a big match when they become grown up children. This is how liquor got associated with the school system. The Dutch courage tradition has come to stay. Yet, no one can raise the accusing finger at all the past pupils because they represent only a small segment. Yet, that negligible faction could spoil the system. They do an irreparable damage to the whole education system of the country.
Student violence
Student violence in the present context depicts a different picture and the immediate attention of the higher authorities seems to be paid, because it is advisable to nip it in the bud before it makes a cancerous effect on the whole system paving the way to a total collapse. Mihintale Maha Vidyalaya goes into the educational map of the country as the first school where without even the first hairs on their yet to come out moustache, students consumed liquor in the very holy premises of their education. Above all, Mihintale is a sacred city and the holy land of the Buddhists as Arahant Mahinda consecrated the land by touching the earth with the sublime feet. Pilgrims from every nook and cranny visit Mihintale with pure feelings of Shraddha. These students spoilt the spirit of the Buddhists not in uncertain terms.
Yet, the incidents of this nature are not really rare. I had a very authentic piece of information from a teacher in the southern province which would straighten the eye brows of any civic minded person. Once, the teachers of a certain big school had organised an educational excursion as a part of the annual school calendar. It had been a three day tour to Rajarata. On the eve of the tour, some pupils in Grade Eleven had brought a sample bottle of toddy to the school classroom. They had started sipping the fresh toddy with loud cheers. Vigilant teachers had reported the matter to the principal and the discipline master had rounded off the little rascals. Lo and behold, a girl had supplied the sample to the boys. At the inquiry it had come to light that the girl students parents had run the business of moonshine in the locality with the blessings of the authorities. Their due share had been readily supplied free of charge.
Sil campaign
Let me relate my own experience to convince the gravity of the situation. Once I had the good fortune to work in a big school. The principal and the staff organised a Sil campaign and observation of Sil was made mandatory for all the students. Some black sheep publicly declared that they would not come. The arrogant principal told them that deterrent punishment would be meted out. Lo and behold again, on the day of the Sil campaign those students came having had a skinful and started vomiting in the main hall while the Buddhist sermon was in progress. Next day, they were to be punished at the morning assembly.
When the first name of the culprits was announced and the punishment was about to be given another culprit fainted. The rest of the culprits took him away from the assembly ground and the principals plan flopped. What I noticed was that the children of the new generation possess ultra-active intelligence and imagination and it should be exploited for the good of the country. If proper guidance could be given, they could be made the partners of progress. In a way, there is a sound message to be given to the school authorities. SPARE THE ROAD AND SPOIL THE CHILD, Awareness of the human rights could play havoc in certain situations. When I was on a UNO teaching assignment in the Republic of Maldives, a young student phoned the police there and complained of punishing by his father. The immediate response was that the police arrived at the scene and in a fraction of a second they handcuffed his father. The rest is history.
Now, it seems that it is high time to reconsider the implementation of human rights for the good of the country. Our ancient system of child rearing seems the best for our country. We should not allow the west to make our country the guinea pig for human rights experiments and let the country ruin. We have our own cultural identity in these matters. I am convinced that it is not human rights education that should be introduced to the curriculum, but Sociology, Psychology, Criminology and other relevant disciplines that speak to the very hearts core of the affective domain of the children. Otherwise our childrens psycho motor domain would ruin the country in the near future. The very recent, pandemonium and the fracas at YASODARA would reoccur and make a cancerous effect.
I would like to put another pertinent matter on record here. The teaching of General English has become an utter failure throughout the country. Because of the weight of the other three subjects, most of the A/L students dodge the General English periods. Some truly intelligent students spend their time usefully, but most of the unruly students play havoc in the school premise. The educational authorities turn a blind eye to this alarming situation and parents requests fall on deaf ears. Once a soft spoken fair woman on the staff where I worked was crying bitterly. On my asking she told that some filthy words had been hurled at her in the general English lesson. It is the ground reality.
University system
The crux of the matter is that those who are in ivory towers are not aware of the ongoing situation in the school system. So, they come out with unworkable solutions to these problems in the most vital department of life.
A pragmatic approach is of paramount importance to arrest the situation. The problems of the university system too should be immediately heeded, unless the whole country would have to face the music in the near future.
The influence of the social media and the unprecedented violence on the small screen, aggravate the already calamitous situation in the society.
The deterioration of the decorum in the august assembly and the politicians at the local level fuel some other disastrous situations. In a nutshell the whole country is going to be embroiled in a treacherous bog of an acute moral paralysis.
This situation is not confined to our country. In our own neighbourhood and also in the west the gravity is the same. The other day, I happened to know over the internet that a female teacher had unethically engaged with a student to get her carnal desires satisfied.
To clinch over, it seems that some clouds of gloom are floating in the eastern sky not allowing the evening star to shine to dispel darkness. The leopards and lions would pounce on our lambs. A severe catastrophe seems to be in the offing.

Trade deficit expands in December
The trade deficit expanded as a result of the considerable increase in import expenditure which more than offset the growth in export earnings during the month of December 2016.
Earnings from tourism and workers remittances grew at a healthy rate, year-on-year, during the month, the Central Bank said yesterday.
The government securities market witnessed a net outflow in December, while some inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) were observed.
Earnings from exports amounted to US dollars 859 million in December 2016 registering a 4.7 per cent growth, year-on-year, reflecting increases in all major categories of exports. The performance of industrial and agricultural exports, appears to have benefitted from the gradual improvements in global economic conditions and improved trade relations with major trade partners, which in turn, led exports to expand in December.
The largest contribution to the growth in exports was from industrial exports supported by the substantial increase in exports of printing industry products and rubber products.Earnings from industrial exports, which account for about 76 per cent of total exports, grew by 4.4 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 655 million in December 2016. Export earnings from printing industry products increased by more than two fold compared to the same month in 2015 mainly as a result of the increase in exports of currency notes. Continuing the year-on-year growth trend observed since August 2016, export earnings from rubber products increased by 6.7 per cent, mainly due to growth in exports of surgical and other gloves.
However, earnings from garment exports, which account for around 43 per cent of total export earnings, declined marginally by 0.3 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 368 million due to lower demand from the USA market, despite the growth in exports to non-traditional markets, such as Canada, China, Australia and the UAE as well as to the European Union (EU) market. Earnings from all categories of industrial exports increased during the month, except food, beverages and tobacco.
Earnings from agricultural exports, which account for about 23 per cent of total 2 exports, grew by 5.1 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 201 million in December 2016, led by spices, coconut and tea exports. Earnings from spices exports grew notably by 31.1 per cent, year-on-year, reflecting a growth in relation to all varieties of spices, particularly pepper and nutmeg.
Sound performance of both kernel and non-kernel coconut products led earnings from coconut exports to grow by 20.4 per cent, year-on-year. Earnings from tea exports in December 2016 increased by 4.4 per cent, year-on-year, due to a higher average export price despite the decline in export volume.
In addition, earnings from seafood exports continued its impressive growth momentum observed since July 2016 after lifting the ban on seafood imports from Sri Lanka to the EU.
On a cumulative basis, exports earnings during 2016 at US dollars 10,310 million, contracted by 2.2 per cent, compared to the previous year, despite the positive growth recorded in the latter part of 2016.
The largest contribution to this decline came from transport equipment as a result of the base effect, while petroleum products, tea and spices also contributed negatively. Low commodity prices in the international market and reduced domestic output of export oriented agricultural products contributed to the decline in exports.
However, export earnings from textiles and garments, base metals and articles, leather, travel goods and footwear and machinery and mechanical appliances increased in 2016 when compared with 2015.
The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during 2016 were the USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy accounting for about 52 per cent of total exports.
Import Performance
A double digit growth in imports was recorded for a third consecutive month in December 2016. Accordingly, expenditure on imports at US dollars 1,816 million increased by 10.4 per cent, year-on-year, during the month, due to the increase in expenditure on the import of intermediate goods followed by investment goods.
However, the year-on-year declining trend in expenditure on consumer goods that started in December 2015 continued in December 2016.
Earnings from Tourism
In December 2016, tourist arrivals increased by 9.1 per cent, year-on-year, to 224,791. Accordingly, tourist arrivals during 2016 grew by 14.0 per cent to 2,050,832 from 1,798,380 during 2015. India, China, the UK, Germany and France maintained their positions as the top five sources of tourist arrivals during the year 2016. These five countries accounted for 51.0 per cent of total tourist arrivals during this period. Meanwhile, earnings from tourism1 increased by 12.9 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 385.7 million in December 2016. On a cumulative basis, earnings from tourism increased to US dollars 3,518.5 million during the year 2016 from US dollars 2,980.7 million recorded in 2015.
Workers Remittances
Receipts from workers remittances improved by 10.7 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 684.6 million during December 2016 from US dollars 618.5 million in December 2015. Accordingly, cumulative inflows from workers remittances during 2016 amounted to US dollars 7,241.5 million, recording a growth of 3.7 per cent, in comparison to US dollars 6,980.3 million during 2015.
Financial Flows
Foreign investments in the CSE recorded a net inflow of US dollars 27.8 million in December 2016. Cumulative foreign investments in the CSE during the year 2016 recorded a net inflow of US dollars 19.1 million. This included a net inflow of US dollars 4.9 million from the secondary market and an inflow of US dollars 14.2 million to the primary market.
Foreign investments in the government securities market continued to record a net outflow for a third straight month amounting to US dollars 95.9 million in December 2016. On a cumulative basis, the net outflow of foreign investments in the government securities market amounted to US dollars 324.3 million during the year 2016 in comparison to a net outflow of US dollars 1,093.4 million during 2015. Long term loans to the government increased to US dollars 1,287.0 million on a net basis during 2016, in comparison to a net inflow of US dollars 469.6 million during 2015.
Overall BOP Position
During 2016, the overall BOP is estimated to have recorded a deficit of US dollars 499.7 million, in comparison to a deficit of US dollars 1,488.7 million recorded during 2015.
International Reserves and Exchange Rate Movements
Sri Lankas gross official reserves as at end December 2016 amounted to US dollars 6.0 billion, equivalent to 3.7 months of imports. Meanwhile, total foreign assets, which include gross official reserves and foreign assets owned by deposit taking corporations, stood at US dollars 8.4 billion, equivalent to 5.2 months of imports.

Trinity runs riot with 94/9 demolition of POW
Trinity College rucked, drove and powered their way to outclass Prince of Wales College by 94 (7 goals, 9 tries) to 9 (3 penalties) win in their last first round inter-school rugby match played at the Pallekelle Stadium yesterday.
It was the highest victory margin ever achieved by a school this season.
Trinitys good team work helped them to dominate this game. They dished out a good brand of rugby to lead 41-3 at half time.
The Trinitians were fast, open and ever ready to fling the ball about, and showed a marked superiority over their opponents in every department of the game. They used their superior weight and binding much tighter and lower and had the ball back far more often. Trinity controlled the game from the very first whistle.

Udawalawe Elephant Transit Home goes global
An official website for the Elephant Transit Home (ETH) in Udawalawe, hosted through the Department of Wildlife & Conservation (DWC), and developed and sponsored by the Hemas Holding was launched at the Hemas House among a distinguish gathering from the ministry of Wildlife, the Department of Wildlife and the Directors of Hemas. This follows a dire need to bring greater awareness among both the local and international community of this world renowned rehabilitation programme.
Elephant Transit Home (ETH) in Udawalawa is the first and one of its kind in Asia, and the second such rehabilitation programme in the world for orphaned little elephants. The ETH gives an opportunity to these orphaned little elephants to continue living free.
The Elephant Transit Home (ETH) situated close to the Udawalawe National Park, was opened in 1995 as a rehabilitation centre for orphaned little elephants in Sri Lanka. The first little elephant inmate was named Komali. Since its inception this transit home has been a shelter for around 300 orphaned elephants.
They are brought from different parts of the island and looked after at the ETH until they are of an age or fit to survive on their own and then released back into the wilds  to where they belong. While at the ETH, they are nourished, comforted and looked after with love and care, while at the same time with minimum human contact to facilitate easy re-integration into the wilds. This is due to the fact that the ETHs ultimate goal is that, once released, these elephants need to be able to join a herd and live a life as any other elephant born in the wilds would enjoy.
This website www.eth.dwc.gov.lk which was solely developed and sponsored by the members of Hemas Green Club showcases a gallery of four short videos sponsored by Hemas Leisure, Travel and Aviation. This is a must see, for everyone with a soft corner for elephants. It gives an insight into the working of the ETH since its inception, a few success stories of the rehabilitation, and what goes on behind the scenes to maintain and look after these little elephants.
A special page has been allocated to Namal, the five year-old elephant who lives at the ETH. Namal is very unique since he is the first ever elephant in the world to have a prosthetic hind leg. Once again the ETH creates history by providing a prosthetic hind leg and giving this elephant a second chance in life.
Once you have browsed this site, we have no doubt that you will look for the Donation Page, for ways and means by which one can contribute towards this worthy cause. Sponsorship of orphaned elephants, donations in cash, equipment for the ETH or volunteer service is listed in the Wish List of the ETH.
Hemas, through its Green Club, has taken it upon itself to sponsor a little orphaned elephant named Abiman. Little Abiman, now aged two years, is still under the safe protection at the ETH. His name is derived from Abimana which is the Hemas core value programme for its staff. The Hemas Green Club comprises a dedicated team of staff members whose main focus is to protect our environment in whatever way we can.Along with the sponsorship of little Abhiman, they have also successfully embarked on tree planting, recycling of e-waste and many other initiatives including nature treks to encourage their membership.
Rehabilitation programmes such as the ETH, and conservation efforts in Sri Lanka will be given a boost with the launch of this official website. The Hemas Green Club is proud to be associated with this project and thankful to the Department for giving them this opportunity to help a worthy cause.
Please visit the website www.eth.dwc.gov.lk If passing Udawalawe please drop in at the ETH and experience heart-warming scenes of the feeding of milk to these little elephants which takes places at 9 am, noon, 3 pm and 6 pm daily.

U.S. oil investment to hit $61 bn
The global oil industry is slated to make some big investments in 2017 following a painful two-year spending slump. And the U.S. specifically Texas is expected to lead the recovery.
Industry research firm Wood Mackenzie predicts U.S. oil sector spending will grow by 23% to $61 billion this year as American companies capitalize on rising crude prices.
Fracking in Texas and parts of New Mexico will really ramp up as American drillers look to extract more oil and gas from the Permian basin, said Malcolm Dickson, a principal oil analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
"The Permian is the hottest play around and it's driving this growth in production and growth in spending," he said.
If crude prices keep rising and business owners feel good about the economic effects of a Trump presidency, there could be even more spending, according to the report.
Wood Mackenzie expects global spending on oil exploration and production to rise to $450 billion, up 3% from last year. It expects 20 major oil projects to get the green light, more than double the number approved in 2016.
Spending is still well below the record $774 billion set in 2014. But that boom was supported by oil prices that surpassed $100 per barrel.
Crude is currently trading just above $50 per barrel. It hit a 13-year low around $26 a barrel nearly one year ago but has been recovering ever since. Prices got a big boost when major producers - led by oil cartel OPEC - agreed in late November to limit production.
Barclays also sees a case for increased spending in 2017. The bank released survey results Monday that shows global industry insiders expect investments to grow by 7% this year, on average.
"With OPEC putting a floor on oil prices, operators have greater confidence to drill although the early stages of the recovery will be uneven," Barclays analysts wrote in the report.
Not all analysts are quite so optimistic about prospects for 2017.
Per Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at oil consulting firm Rystad Energy, forecasts that approvals for major oil projects will take longer than expected and many may only materialize in 2018. He expects 2017 global spending to be roughly on par with last year.

We didnt ask Rajini to cancel Sri Lanka visit, says VCK
Refuting Lyca Productions charges, VCK and Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK) said their motive was not to oppose Rajinikanths visit to Sri Lanka, but only asked him to reconsider his trip since the atmosphere was not conducive.
Our motive is not to oppose Rajinikanth or Lyca or seek publicity. If Lyca thinks so, it is sheer imagination, VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan said, while appreciating the superstar for his maturity in understanding the issue in the right context.
Meanwhile, Union Minister of State for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan said the actor should have gone to Lanka to hand over the houses to the Tamils there.
I will appreciate whoever does good for the Tamils, he said. Radhakrishnan tweeted. Even during his interaction with media persons in Nagercoil in Kanyakumari district where he is currently touring, Radhakrishnan did not find any reason to find fault with purport of Rajinikanths visit.
The actor had, on Saturday, announced to cancel his visit in the wake of calls by political parties. BJP State President Dr Tamilisai Soundararajan speaking in similar vein had said that the superstar could have undertaken the visit to the island nation as it was meant to give away houses to the Lankan Tamils. Earlier in the day, VCK leader Thirumavalavan in a statement said, It is laughable if one believes opposing Rajinikanths Sri Lanka visit or an anti-Lyca stand will endear people to them. In fact, the fears of Tamils in the Northern Province is that the Sinhala rulers are trying to derive political mileage out of the issue, he said in a statement. - Deccan Chronicle

Wimals hunger strike not against court decision: Vasudeva
The National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansas hunger strike in prison should not be misinterpreted as a slur against the Court decision to remand him, parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said yesterday.
Speaking to the media in Colombo, Nanayakkara said Weerawansa was protesting as he had no other ways to propagate his opposition against several harmful decisions taken by the government.
Nanayakkara said Wimal was protesting against the rising cost of living, attempts to sell key state assets and harmful clauses in the proposed new constitution.
The parliamentarian said Weerawansa believes that he is being politically victimised.
Nanayakkara said Weerawansas family is under a great distress because of the current developments and his daughter was hospitalised due to mental stress. The government should take responsibility if either Weerawansa or any of his family members come to harm, Nanayakkara said.
