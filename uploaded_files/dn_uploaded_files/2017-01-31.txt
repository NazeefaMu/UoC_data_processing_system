My role in BCCI is that of a night- watchman, says Vinod Rai
NEW DELHI: Former Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) Vinod Rai, who will head the Supreme Court-appointed four-member panel of administrators, called himself a night-watchman whose only job will be to ensure a smooth transition to an elected body in BCCI.
The Supreme Court appointed a four-member committee of administrators to run the affairs of the BCCI and implement the court-approved recommendations of the Justice R M Lodha panel. Asked Rai about his new role, he said: Any such honour from the Supreme Court, one will have to accept and try to put in his best of abilities.
I am a true lover of the game of cricket. My role is that of a night-watchman in a sense that we need to put in place good governance, good system and structure in place to ensure a smooth transition to an elected body which in future will bring about good administration in BCCI, he said.
The game deserves it (good governance), the players deserve it and public at large, who are so fond of the game.
Besides Rai, other three members of the committee are famous historian and scholar Ramachandra Guha, Vikram Limaye, Managing Director of Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) and former Indian women cricket captain Diana Edulji, who would interact with BCCI CEO Rahul Johri for supervision and smooth functioning of the cricket Board (BCCI).
Widely considered as symbol of the anti-corruption movement in India, Rai, said cricket needs good governance but he will be in a position to comment anything on BCCI only after resuming his duties.
Its too early to comment on anything at the moment because I am not familiar and have no exposure to the functions of BCCI. But any institution must conform to good governance.
The game of cricket requires good governance so that we are able to deliver to the country at the public at large, Rai said.
Asked how long it will take for him and his team to put BCCIs house in order and declare elections, Rai said: I have no idea at all. I can only say something when I have some idea. - PTI

New licence for Ayurvedic products outlets and Panchakarma Centres
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has decided to issue a new licence for all Ayurvedic products outlets and Panchakarma Centres in 2017 cancelling the current licence to make the licence issuing system accurate and methodical, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
The spokesman said Dr. Senaratne had taken this decision after considering the large number of complaints received from the public and the police in connection with those institutions.
Another reason that led Minister Senaratne to make this decision was the information he received from Central Province Health Minister Bandula Yalegama in connection with Babul being sold among schoolchildren by registered and unregistered persons, the spokesman said.
Ayurveda Commissioner A. H. Thilakaratne informed Dr. Senaratne that houses of ill fame operate countrywide on the pretext of massage parlours. He also said most operate with fake licences of Ayurveda issued to run Panchakarma Centres.

Play with your pout!
Want to step up your make-up game this year If yes, the first step is to give your matte lipstick a break. Gloss and glitter are clearly back in action. So, stack up on them to make a statement.
The hot trending colours for your pout are peaches, electric oranges, corals and the deeper shades of violet.
Liquid matte lips dominated the last few years, but in 2017, lip gloss is the refreshing change to exude a youthful appeal - while enhancing the dimension of the pout.
Also worth trying would be lip glosses with translucent plumping serum, incorporating a range of pigment to the formula. Such glosses trigger a slightly intense tingling sensation that can (and most likely will) last up to 10 minutes, creating temporarily fuller and high gloss lips with each application.
For those willing to go bold and experimental, heres what you ought to try - 3D, statement lips from ombre effects to an overlay of glitter.
If you are thrilled about carrying the look to work; play it up minimally. Begin by layering two different effects, such as a base layer of a satiny lipstick with a dab of high-glitter gloss - right on the centre of your lips to create new dimensions!
Make-up trends are fleeting. But, if theres a classic pick which wont disappoint, its got to be the bold red lip - which never goes out of style.
The deep red lip still finds a major spot in the beauty block. Jazz it up with a hint of gloss to let your lips do the talking!

## Title: Pricing a war against smuggling

Pricing a war against smuggling
A little over two weeks ago, Customs officials arrested three persons at the Colombo International Airport for attempting to smuggle 70,000 sticks of illicit cigarettes into the country.
This seizure follows a similar incident in November last year when 36,600 sticks were seized at the airport, after two women were also nabbed carrying 80,000 sticks.
They were all travelling from Dubai and the value of this latest consignment of contraband caught at the airport was over Rs. 3.5 million. Besides the action at the airport, in January this year police have already conducted over 150 raids on illicit cigarettes island wide yielding 1,460,576 sticks valued at Rs. 73 million.
The numbers and the level of action are overwhelming, but we are only scraping the surface here. Annually, authorities confiscate over 100 million sticks smuggled into Sri Lanka worth over Rs. 4 billion. While Customs officials together with police are doing a commendable job with detections, estimates indicate that 200 million illicit sticks still make it to the market resulting in over Rs. 8 billion in losses to the government.There are of course other ways of access besides the regular ports of entry.
It is safe to assume that everyone everywhere is aware that no government in the world would let anyone walk-in to a country with 80,000 sticks of tobacco, so, why do it It would at most be limited to five cartons which is 1,000 sticks.The driving force is price.
For international smugglers and even any unscrupulously enterprising individual, at Rs. 50 a stick Sri Lanka presents ample opportunity for profit when price of production, packaging and logistics will not set them back past Rs. 8 a stick.
The Middle East,Dubai, Turkey in particular,Malaysia and Eastern Europe are popular production hubs closer to Sri Lanka, producing counterfeit products replicating reputed global brands and some of their own.Using cheap tobacco leaf and unsafe production methods, these criminal elements reach a vast global base earning millions/billions of dollars illegally.
A KPMG study on the illegal cigarette trade published in 2015, points to a 7.3 per cent growth (30 billion sticks) in the illicit trade in 41 countries between 2008 and 2013, which amounts to over US$ 200 billion in uncollected taxes.
According to the report,in most countries a reduction in affordability of legal products was accompanied by an increase in illicit, whilst 14 countries that increased taxes but also invested significantly in counteracting illicit saw a reduction in consumption overall.
Therein lies the Sri Lankan predicament.To control and safeguard its populations against the ills of smoking, successive governments chose pricing as its panacea.But in doing so it also created a lucrative market and opportunity for tobacco smugglers. Have we invested enough effort and resources on countering the illicit trade At our ports of entry, Sri Lanka Customs assures they keep a tight watch with a well-entrenched network to spot and nab offenders, and to their credit have reeled in impressive numbers at the harbor and international airport.
In 2015, Customs detected a container at the Colombo port with 4.4 million illegal sticks valued at over Rs.130 million, but can some get by. Reports also reach us of large scale smuggling via fishing boats in the straits off Jaffna and Mannar, and even the East Coast, with an unprecedented number of sticks reaching the local market.
In addition, the problem of illicit is not just imports.There lies a domestic element too. Beedi, while being a licensed product, is manufactured by a handful of producers in the country and enjoys the slimmest of tax margins. But Customs data point to 3.3 billion beedi sticks consumed in 2015 up from 2.2 billion the year before.
The spike in consumption is delivered not only by licensed manufacturers, but also a growing number of racketeers capitalising on Sri Lanka's increasing unaffordability of legal cigarettes. With cigarette prices rising 43% within a space of a month just last year, the beedi trade is poised for exponential growth, but with little or no gain for depleted government coffers.
The KPMG report quotes Adam Smith from The Wealth of Nations. When the diminution of revenue is the effect of the encouragement given to smuggling, it may, perhaps, be remedied in two ways; either by diminishing the temptation to smuggle, or by increasing the difficulty of smuggling. The temptation to smuggle can be diminished only by the lowering of the tax; and the difficulty of smuggling can be increased only by establishing that system of administration which is most proper for preventing it.
The Sri Lankan government's effort to control tobacco harm via pricing is laudable. But we must take adequate precautions to ensure that we don't give wings to criminal elements. Colombo is teeming with illicit. A mere walk down the streets of Fort, Mount Lavinia, Wellawatte, Nugegoda and Kirillapone gives consumers access to a multitude of products and brands that have escaped paying dues to government and are here via illegal means. Besides lost revenue, what troubles is the presence and reach of criminal elements feeding off the many loopholes that exist in our system, corrupting the fabric of society. Criminals breed criminals. Retailers presented with an extra Rs. 3 in margin will undoubtedly find selling illicit a lucrative option and therein stems the rot, as they then dive to hide their wares from authorities, plus, entice customers to buy and smoke illicit.
Pricing is a key facet to ensure controls alongside a planned and empowered approach by law enforcement authorities. Canada poses a good example on the impact of tax and pricing on smuggling. In 2011, the seizure of illicit cigarettes were still 1,560 per cent higher than the year 2000, the year before large tax rate increases were implemented. The evidence to date is consistent with the notion that in order to curtail a large scale illicit trade problem, improved enforcement measures can make a substantial difference, KPMG reports.
To combat illicit, governments need to revisit tax policies to ensure law and order, plus, achieve their health and revenue objectives. Combatting illicit may not necessarily result in reducing total consumption, but if we were to allow the uncontrolled growth of illicit markets it will certainly render further tax hikes irrelevant to policy objectives. Measures to improve enforcement should reduce expected profits earned from illegal trade and reduce the scale of the problem. This includes any measures that increase either the likelihood of criminals being caught or the penalties received when they are.
Smuggling is a global pandemic, and with Sri Lanka's rising prices due to a myriad of factors it has become and will continue to be a hotspot for criminal elements. This is by no means restricted to the tobacco trade, but it serves as ample example of the length and breadth of the global pandemic. It's here and very real in all parts of Sri Lanka,producing social and market impacts right down to the grassroots of this country. Enforcement is critical, and enforcement will be empowered further with the adoption of pragmatic pricing and social policy. We trust that governments will take good note.

Purge the Gentlemans game
Cricket in the countries played the world over has over recent times seen turbulence in its administration. Struggles to democratize, equalize representation, accountability, long term development, professionalize, stamp out nepotism, depoliticize etc. have all been causes in some form or another.
Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is worth US$ 295 million. Indias win of the 1983 world cup changed the fortunes of the Indian cricket. In 2008 the Indian Premier League or IPL started and the BCCI began to make more money.
Cricket South Africa (CSA) is the second richest, worth: US$ 69 million.
The Relevance of the Public Function Test in Indian Constitutional Law
Under Articles 32 and 226, the Constitution authorizes access directly to the Supreme Court and High Courts for allegations of fundamental rights violations.
In Zee Telefilms v. Union of India, the Supreme Court distinguished Article 32 from Article 226 stating under Article 226 even if a body does not represent the State, it is susceptible to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court if it performs a public function.
The Court held that BCCI performs a public function and authorized fundamental rights violation claims to be brought against BCCI even though its legal status is only that of a society registered under a statute.
The Court in Sukhdev v. Bhagatram analysed state action and private action stating when given function is of public importance and closely related to governmental functions or activities which are too fundamental to the society financial aid from government is not a prerequisite relying on case law from the United States Constitution on the same subject, including Marsh v. Alabama, New York v. United States and Nixon v. Condon.
Why does the BCCI perform a public function
The BCCI formulates rules, regulations, norms and standards covering all aspect of the game of cricket. It enjoys the power of choosing the members of the national team and the umpires. It exercises the power of disqualifying players, which may at times put an end to the sporting career of a person. It spends tens of millions of rupees on building and maintaining infrastructure like stadia, running cricket academies and supporting State Associations.
The BCCI also frames pension schemes and incurs expenditures on coaches, trainers and team staffs. It sells broadcast and telecast rights and collects admission fees to venues where the matches are played. All these activities are undertaken with the tacit concurrence of the State Government and the Government of India which are not only fully aware but supportive of the activities of the BCCI.
Further, the Court also made a rather intriguing observation while concluding that the BCCI performs a public function:
Such is the passion for this game in this country that cricketers are seen as icons by youngsters, middle aged and the old alike. Any organisation or entity that has such pervasive control over the game and its affairs and such powers as can make dreams end up in smoke or come true cannot be said to be undertaking any private activity.
Intervention of the Indian Supreme CourtMay 2013-January 2017
The arrest of S Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila (all Rajasthan Royals players) revealed a nexus between bookies, players and franchise members. CSK team principal, Meiyappan was arrested after being questioned for spot-fixing charges. To further investigate the spot-fixing scandal and to a matter of BCCI, Supreme Court appointed a committee headed by Justice Mukul Mudgal. The Supreme Court appointed another panel headed by Justice (Retd) RM Lodha to determine punishments for those found guilty in IPL spot-fixing scandal. The Lodha panel was also tasked to suggest reforms for BCCI.
The Lodha panel recommendations
The Committee  in which Lodha was aided by retired Supreme Court judges R Raveendran and Ashok Bhan suggested several reforms that aim to shake up the power structure in the board and redistribute power more equitably among officials, state representatives and also future administrators, as election of office-bearers was also a subject of review.
* States would be limited to one cricketing body or association for representation on the BCCI electorate, only members of the board with a defined territory would be full members. Non-territorial members  such as Railways, Services and All India Universities  would be limited to associate status with no voting rights. Multiple members from the same state would also be limited to associate status.
* To improve transparency, the recommendation of three new independent officials was also made. These include an ombudsman (the already-appointed Justice AP Shah, selected by the BCCI in November 2015), an ethics officer and an election officer.
* A nine-person Apex Council. This would include representatives from amongst the players themselves, establishment of players associations, whose members would be Indian internationals and several first-class cricketers who retired not sooner than five years ago. Office holders to undergo review of eligibility criteria and tenure. Individuals barred from holding positions on the board would include ministers and bureaucrats currently holding office, those holding positions in various state associations and those above the age of 70.Fo that BCCI clout may be lost
* Five elected members on the Board  a president, a vice-president, a secretary, a joint secretary and a treasurer. These persons would serve a maximum of three terms of nine years apiece, with no person permitted to serve two consecutive terms.
* Nomination of a Comptroller and Auditor General to check the exercise of the Boards monetary muscle, restricting the power of the president (for example, eliminating the presidents involvement in team selection) whilst granting power, permitting the board to decide its own broadcasting policy and contracts.
* The court has also directed the Parliament to decide the matter of legalising betting and placing the BCCI under the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI).
* The panel also suggested to set up a separate players associations (men and women).
Lodha panel had given BCCI time till January 31 to get back with suggestions, but they did not. The SC gave the board a deadline till March 3 to respond to guidelines suggested by Lodha panel. In a 55-page counter-affidavit submitted in the court, BCCI stated that it partially accepted some of the reforms, but had concerns on many of the recommendations presented by the Lodha panel. The Supreme Court criticised BCCIs method of disbursing funds to state associations saying it was being done without any particular mechanism. During this particular hearing, the court also turned down BCCIs request to review one-state-one-vote recommendation made by Lodha panel. The Supreme Court observed that the BCCIs constitution was incapable of achieving the values of transparency, objectivity and accountability. While hearing a matter related to implementation of Lodha reforms by BCCI, the Supreme Court said: The inherent constitution of the BCCI is such that it is highly incapable of achieving the values of transparency, objectivity and accountability (such) that without changing its structure it cant be done so.
Lodha Committee asked the Supreme Court to direct the immediate supercession of the current BCCI top brass for blatant violations of the July 18 Supreme Court judgment directing them to implement the panels recommendations for transparency in cricket administration.
Referring to Justice RM Lodhas suggestion to remove BCCIs top brass, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India TS Thakur blasted the cricket board. BCCI thinks they are a law unto themselves. They are wrong. You behave like lords. Fall in line or else we will BCCI rejected some of the Supreme Courts key recommendations aimed at administrative reform.
BCCI after an emergency meeting decided to distribute Rs 1,100 crore to state associations. But on learning the development, Lodha panel stepped in and asked the banks to stop disbursing money to state associations. BCCI president Anurag Thakur told in a press conference that the third Test between India and New Zealand in Indore is in jeopardy because of this order. However, Justice Lodha himself clarified that banks will release funds required for daily operation of the board and the Indore Test doesnt faces the threat of being called off.
The Supreme Court barred BCCI from releasing any funds to its state affiliates until they give an unconditional undertaking that they will comply with the organisational reforms as recommended by the Justice Lodha Committee.
The Supreme Court directed Thakur to file an affidavit and clarify whether he had asked the ICC to write that Lodha Recommendations amounted to government interference. This was reportedly claimed by ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson in media interactions. Thakur had, according to International Cricket Council CEO Dave Richardson, asked the international cricket body chairman to furnish the Indian board with a letter that indicated the Supreme Court order was like government intervention.
The ICC does not allow government intervention in the functioning of its member boards and they could even be suspended. However, Thakur and BCCI have denied asking for any such letter from the ICC.
At a SGM, the BCCI agreed to implement some important recommendations but they remained defiant of some key reforms.
The members decided that the age restriction of 70 years for board officials, the tenure cap of nine years with cooling-off periods, and the one-state-one-vote policy, among others cant be implemented.
After continued defiance, the RM Lodha committee recommended the sacking of all office bearers of the BCCI and its state associations. The Supreme Court suggested the appointment of former Home Secretary Gopal Krishna Pillai as an observer in the apex body. In a fresh status report filed to the Supreme Court, the panel asked that Pillai be appointed as observer with power to appoint an auditor, and guide the BCCI administration, particularly on the award of contracts and on transparency.
BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke said there was no change in their stand on the recommendations made by the RM Lodha Panel after a meeting. Only three state associations - Hyderabad, Vidarbha and Tripura - had agreed to implement the recommendations in full, while others rejected it.
Board of Control for Cricket(BCCI) president Anurag Thakur and secretary Ajay Shirke were removed by the Supreme Court in January for not complying with its order to implement administrative reforms within the body.
The Indian narrative is a fascinating account of the Supreme Court defining public functions, intervening in the affairs of the richest cricket board in the world involving a sport which captures the attention of a huge following and setting right anomalies in its administration.

Queen in-between
Icons have always been prone to brickbats, at times much heavier than the bouquets. Venerable Dharmasena Thera, the official biographer of Sri Lankas medieval history, of course, cannot be an exception. The main accusation levelled against him is to be biased in chronicling the pre-Ceylonese history.
Mohan Raj Madawala not only accuses this much revered chronicler, but also challenges his version of history. His latest novel Rejina (The Queen) turns the Mahawamsa account upside down.
Madawala is no stranger to Sri Lankas cultural scene. He has openly challenged the view that Sri Lanka does not have a proper book market. He claims to have his copies sold over 10,000, whereas an average established author can manage to sell a over 1000, and 2000. The figure is maximum 5000, followed by awards, media hype and other kinds of recognition.
Queen Anula is considered Sri Lankas first queen who reigned between 47 and 42 BC. She is more remembered as a woman for her lust than the first ever female head of state in the Asian region. Her first posting in the royalty was as consort of King Chora Naga, son of King Valagambahu. Mahawamsa narrates an account where Anula happens to poison four husbands in a row.
What is laid down in Mahawamsa about Queen Anula is quite insufficient. That meagre account pictures her as a licentious woman. Even today when we hear the name of Anula, we picture a woman who had slept with many men. I had been wondering if that could really be true. So I spent a long time studying about Kings Kudatissa and Makalantissa who reigned before this lady, Mohan Raj Madawala recalled the source of his interest.
Apparently the social order proves to have been exceedingly patriarchal. Anulas rise to power could have been a pain for most males who were already privileged with a dominant role in governance. They would probably have disliked the idea of being governed by a woman.
When Venerable Mahanama Thera chronicled Mahawamsa, he had a purpose: to narrate a massive success story about the royal patronage offered to Buddhism. That said, he allocates 11 chapters to the rule of King Dutugemunu. Mohan Raj Madawala shares a conflict of interest with this Buddhist author, and observes worthier kings than Dutugemunu.
I think the greatest king we ever had was King Mahasen. He was a decisive factor in our royal lineage. When you go to Uva and Wellassa areas, even today you will find people revering him as a god. Most people worship him as Minneri Devio. You can also see devalas dedicated to him. In one particular devala, you will find a sword too believed to have been used by King Mahasen, Madawala noted.
How does Mahasen outsmart Dutugemunu
Madawala sees him as a ruler who focused more on self-sufficient economy. Tanks, reservoirs and paddy fields come to the fore during Mahasens rule.
You cannot force a personality into a hero, Madawala notes. Heroes are born, not forced into a surreal existence. King Dutugemunu had been forced to be revered, whereas Mahasen has retained a special natural place in the peoples heart for generations. Paradoxically, Mahawamsa author pens only a few paragraphs in favour of King Mahasen.
That leads to an interesting conclusion.
History is a part of fiction. No one can challenge what is written down about a period when none of us was alive. That triggers many questions of reliability. This unreliability provides us with a free licence.
The licence to violate history Even if you are to debate on grounds of a possible sacrilege, Mohan Raj Madawala is never to be stopped from executing what he wants. He identifies history as a part of fiction as well as an admixture of folklore and folktales.
Take Gotas War for instance. That book does not have a single reference about Sarath Fonseka. Forget about Fonsekas political platform, but he was an instrumental figure in the fourth Eelam war mission. In 100 years, this book will be a historical source of the current period. The then readers will have a distorted idea of this period. But we cannot blame anyone for that. This type of activities can happen at any period in any land. We need to look at Mahawamsa in the same vein.
Mohan Raj quotes Dan Brown of Da Vinci Code fame to elaborate that history is written according to the requirements of the winner in order to suppress the defeated. Any historical document is written according to the needs of the writer as well as the patron, most likely the incumbent rulers. Sometimes the written history could change according to the findings of the contemporary historians. History is a combination of facts as well as imagination.
I was well positioned to write the account of Anula based on my imagination. I can easily challenge history, because that too is imagination. Queen Anula, in my imagination, is a lady who demands our respect. She was no prostitute. In a few years following her rule another lady ruler emerges as a Pharaoh Queen. Her name is Cleopatra. I try to link them in my work. 
A bulk of Mohan Rajs books have been shortlisted for the mainstream awards, but never won any. He accredits it to the controversial nature of his books. It does not suit the traditional writing style followed by the traditional writers of this country.
They mostly point out that I have a lot of sex scenes. Well, sex is a basic human requirement. I dont see any fault in writing erotic scenes.
Madawalas previous novel, Lovina, though shortlisted, missed the award because of profaning scenes.
I have a different writing style. It is not the reality style. It is the magical reality. Our life is too complicated. I resigned from media to dedicate myself to books. Right now the authors are doing it as a side business. But it should not happen that way. It should be professional. The authors come up with some book and all they can do is only approach a publisher. Finally they have to be happy with the 10 percent royalty. But I do not have faith in that system.
We should be like Dan Brown, Garcia Marques and Harry Potter author. They have a wide market. They can survive with the royalties because they have a wider readership, hence a good market. But with the limited readership in Sri Lanka, we cannot survive. We have to think of new marketing strategies.
A book is a marketing commodity. It has to be marketed, Madawala believes. Rejina is the first book that was launched with a visual trailer.
Most people do not agree with me on that. But remember, Paulo Coelhos The Spy publicity campaign started six months before the actual launch. People knew it long before the launch. Our publishers are lazy. They are not interested in giving publicity. My copies sell over 20,000 because I take an extra effort in promoting it. True, the campaign demands money, but still it is fully worth. Because you are promoting a commodity. It needs to be professional, Mohan Raj Madawala observed.
Queen Anula is no longer a licentious female head, as the Mahawamsa author narrates. Who is in the right path  is it Mahawamsa author or Mohan Raj Madawala hardly matters now, because both works are now baptised as fiction.
Those who loathe Mohan Raj Madawala can continue to believe that Queen Anula was a shameless woman. If you are on the other side of the path, you can now begin to revere this great-grandmother. One thing is certain: Queen Anula is definitely an in-between.
Because facts are sacred in history, but anything can afford to happen in fiction.

Ranjan steals the show
The Yahapalanaya government has this penchant for walking from one crisis to another, scoring own goals and providing ammunition to its critics to haul it over the coals. Recently it was the Director Agriculture who recommended croton and Jak leaves to the people as an alternative diet to overcome the crop failure due to the drought. The Joint Opposition lost no time in seizing on the opportunity to ridicule the government. Prior to that it was the UNPs muscle bound Palitha Thevarapperuma who, most said, had taken over the mantle from Mervyn Silva, clowning himself in front of the TV cameras. When it appeared that the Deputy Minister had been duly chastised and was at last behaving himself without causing further embarrassment to the government we have another macho man from the same party flexing his muscles being violently uncivil to a lady Divisional Secretary serving in his own constituency.
Film star turned politician and Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake by no stretch of the imagination would fall into the category of a Mervyn Silva or a Thevarapperuma. The flamboyant actor, though often in the news for his unorthodox ways in dealing with issues confronting the public, nevertheless, is a temperate individual not given to flying off the handle. But what the public witnessed on television the other day would have shocked even the ardent film fans of Ramanayake, not to mention his party supporters.
True, the ebullient politician is well known for his no nonsense attitude in dealing with matters that impinge on the interest of the public. He is commended in many quarters for his crusade against the hardships confronting the Lankan housemaids in the Middle East. He has also won laurels for his hard line stance against corruption even in government and openly expressed his views on the alleged Central Bank bond scam.
On this occasion too, the Deputy Minister was fighting on the side of the public against the large scale destruction to the environment as a result of indiscriminate and illegal sand mining carried out under political patronage in his Divulapitiya constituency. Television showed the Deputy Minister, surrounded by his supporters, arriving at the scene to view the scale of destruction and to ascertain the facts. In the melee a call was taken to the lady Divisional Secretary, who, obviously was the villain of the piece, for allegedly aiding and abetting the illegal operation, in the opinion of Ramanayake. Hot words were exchanged by both parties with the Deputy Minister going slightly overboard in a threatening vein.
The whole issue was obviously painted as a David and Goliath affair with a cornered and highly vulnerable lady state official at the receiving end of a bullying government minister. The bulging pectorals of the Deputy Minister did not help matters either. It is not clear if the lady Divisional Secretary had indeed been in cahoots with the culprits. But a bit of circumspection on the part of Ramanayake would have been in order given the fact that he was addressing a lady, known to be the weaker sex, though this assumption would be contested in this day and age.
All public servants in the Gampaha district, in solidarity with the lady DS, staged a walk out yesterday demanding an apology from the Deputy Minister. Ramanayake for his part is unrepentant insisting that no apology would be forthcoming from him unless steps are taken to halt the ongoing destruction. Whether such an incident would have a fall out on his political fortunes is too early yet to say. But Ramanayake, it is certain, would carry on his crusade against injustice, corruption and environmental destruction, come what may.
To begin with, the Deputy Minister need not have to depend on a political career for his financial stability, being in the film industry now for over three decades. He is also the first MP who declined the Rs. 100,000 special allowance granted to all parliamentarians. Some would even venture out to say that Ramanayake would be the ideal person to even keep the present government on its toes as regards corrupt deals. He has never held back on revelations against his fellow Ministers in the UNP and has taken to task a minister in the east for forest destruction, publicly.
Be that as it may, Ramanayake, a committed member of the UNP, should learn restraint without giving into precipitate action. Being a marked man of the Opposition, from the very inception, he would do well not to give ammunition to his opponents to cast himself as a bully, muscling his way through things. There are of course different schools of thought as regards the action taken by politicians of the kind Ramanayake took the other day. Some would say it is such action, unhampered officialdom, that would get work expedited and serve the well being of the people or as in the Divulapitiya case effectively prevent harm and destruction to the environment that would take a heavy toll on the people.

Record crowds at Jaffna International Trade Fair
The 8th consecutive Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF 2017), the largest Consumer Exhibition concluded at Jaffna last week, ended with a record of over 300 stalls.
One of the highlights of the event was the presence of a special 75 member delegation from India to explore the trade and investment opportunities. This delegation was sponsored and hosted by ASSOCHAM of India (The Associated Chamber of Commerce in India) with a member base of over 475,000.
The Northern Province has been a fast growing province among all provinces. For example in 2011-2012 Northern Province GDP growth was a huge 26%. In 2012-2013 it was 12.1%. In the latest 2014-2015 data the highest provincial GDP growth reported equally by two provinces and I am pleased to say that the Northern Province is one of these two leading GDP growth provinces, at 12.1% YoY growth, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen.
Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Vinay R Sharma addressing the event stressed the entry of his Chamber to Sri Lanka in a pioneering initiative. This is the first time ASSOCHAM is entering Sri Lanka in this way and we are here to partner with Sri Lankan businesses in joint ventures, partnerships and even new business openings in many sectors including automotives and textiles said Sharma.
Founder Chairman of Jaffna International Trade Fair, Kosala Wickramanayake reminisced of the humble beginnings of LECS: JITF was launched in 2010 in Jaffna with less than 50 stalls and amidst many obstacles such as the inability to easily enter the peninsula from Colombo as a result of lack of access through A9 Highway, said Wickramanayake.
Consul General of India in Jaffna Shri. A. Natarajan hinted of the need for drawing more FDI to North. An aluminium production facility has been commenced in the North successfully. Still, this is not enough. Jaffna has much more potential to grow and Indian investors from ASSOCHAM are here to support so that the countrys production and exports would grow further.
National Chamber of Exports (NCE) CEO, Shiham Marikar said that NCE has been regularly participating at the JITF during last four years. We support the objective of this event - bringing economic prosperity to the people in the North.
He said that the NCE endorses the JITF because the event as it provides us the opportunity to further develop business linkages between member exporters of the Chamber and Producers in the North.
The event also provides the platform to meet business partners, and investors, establishment of linkages with the different state institutions and policy makers for business development at a time when Sri Lanka is focusing policy and political approaches to promote reconciliation and opportunities for private investments in the region.
This year members of the chamber have taken 10 stalls and they are exhibiting at the event.

Risky rewards
Kianoush Ramezani is a seasoned Political Cartoonist who is very experienced in his chosen profession. An Iranian artist and activist living and working in exile as a political refugee since 2009 in Paris, Kianoush spoke to the Daily News about his love for Political Cartooning and his passion which sustains him, though he faces such life threatening risks.
I have been living in France since 2009. I am a political refugee. I had to leave Iran, my homeland because of my activities and my cartoons. And now I am involved in many projects in France. I also run an international cartooning organization called United Sketches, which is a very active network of professional cartoonists in the world and we are promoting freedom of expression in the world of professional cartooning and we are trying to support exiled cartoonists in the profession, said Kianoush Ramezani
Why political cartooning What is it that inspires him to take us such a profession
Since my childhood I was very sensitive about what was going on in my society. I always had some ideas and I had visuals which means I could see some images in my head and I loved to just bring them out and share it with people. I did not like the regime at all in Iran. I started drawing when I was five and when I was 18, I just discovered my aptitude for political cartooning. Then I started really working as a cartoonist when I was 20, explained Kianoush.
For Kianoush, the importance of being involved and passionate about ones job, 100 percent is paramount.
I couldnt have done a better job than Political Cartooning. I love photography, I am just enjoying photography but I am not passionate 100 percent. We need to select a job or career only if we are 100 percent passionate about it. I was just passionate about cartooning. I love to take risks. Some people like risks and others just like to lead a calm life. If my two days look like each other then I am already bored! I really love to see change all the time and excitement in my life. In cartooning you can always get this excitement, pointed out Kianoush.
A man of the people Kianoush has a duty towards himself and towards society at large.
I feel a responsibility to society, I do not feel myself as obliged but I see a huge responsibility to be in contact with the society and to communicate with the society. I always need society as my audience, added Kianoush.
The field of Political Cartooning is ever evolving and changing.
I am optimistic about the future of political cartooning. Because of the new technology and the impressive gadgets that people have  smart phones and tablets, they are always connected all the time anywhere. Now people dont have the time reading big articles or a book. When it comes to cartoons I believe it has a better chance now because also it has humor, it can surprise people and people like to laugh and be provoked to think, to see what they dont expect, and I believe the future of cartooning is positive, informs Kianoush.
The danger to Media in this world is always there. It is field of great risk, but one that holds great promise.
After the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, many newspapers and main media, they preferred not to publish or publish very less cartoons than before, which means that a lot of cartoonists they had the potential to get a salary or get paid, they are going to lose their job. This is the risk right now cartoonist are suffering, but at the same time because of alternative media now cartoonists have more visibility and more independence lets say. For example now I am a cartoonist for Courrier International. It is a French Language international magazine which is a unique one- they are using a lot of cartoons even in their cover. The way I am working with this magazine helps me to keep my independence and also get paid, elucidated Kianoush.
It is very good to be a cartoonist and live in Paris. Because of the history, people respect cartoonists a lot. Even if they dont understand or even if they are not educated in Art, whenever you present yourself as a Cartoonist, they really respect you.
I was always welcomed when I was introduced as a Cartoonist. It does not matter which level of education. After the Charlie Hebdo attack, this respect also was added to fear as well. People started to fear as well, you could see if you were introducing yourself as a political cartoonist, sometimes it makes them panic. They were not comfortable to sit beside you. Unless you say  by the way I am not working with Charlie Hebdo. Then they can stay beside you and sit with you. But now after two years now the situation again is kind of normal, clarified Kianoush.
For Courrier International there are more than 50 cartoonists, who are working with this magazine from many countries.
In my travel I am hoping to and I am searching for Sri Lankan Cartoonists. To invite him/her to be part of our association. Because we need Sri Lankan ambassador for our organization. Also I would like to propose one Cartoonist from Sri Lanka for Courrier International, said Kianoush
United Sketches is a new born international organization of Cartooning.
I founded this organization in 2015. Now we have more than 100 active members. They are some of the most talented political cartoonists in the World. They are from 33 countries. Usually we appoint one ambassador for each country. Which means we share the responsibility. The Cartoonist who is the ambassador, he/she is responsible to observe the situation of other cartoonists and bring potential members to United Sketches. Also to send us an alert if a Cartoonist is in danger. In this way we can help by just raising a voice, stressed Kianoush.
Kianoush has accepted the risks in life
When I look at the world right now it is a mess. The people who are ruling it they are stupid. I strongly believe in that. This conflict in Syria, Iraq and Libya, it should not have happened, if the world politicians could have better ideas. We are all connected to each other. We cannot ignore one part of the world. In the current world we cannot avoid the consequences, argued Kianoush.
Stating that he thought ISIS is a cancer, summed up the interview
A very developed cancer, always comes from inside. Some bad mistakes made Islamic State a huge cancer. Occupying Libya and killing Gadaffi was a historical mistake. And now you see the consequences. When we involve ourselves in a country without knowing the country, this will happen. We killed a country like Iraq. We already killed Syria and Libya. Ideologies was used to get revenge by ISIS leaders. I hear some of the leaders were some of the former commanders and officers of Sadaam Hussein. ISIS must be removed from the face of the earth.
However not by war. We need the local people to fight against Islamic State and we need to educate the other people not to join Islamic. We need to educate European, African and Australian youngsters. Because they are becoming ISIS soldiers, summed up Kianoush.

Ronaldo turns boos to cheers for Real as rivals slip up
BARCELONA, Sunday - Cristiano Ronaldo shrugged off the boos of his own supporters to fire Real Madrid to a 3-0 win over Real Sociedad on Sunday as Zinedine Zidanes side took advantage of slip ups by Barcelona and Sevilla to open up a four-point lead at the top of La Liga.
Ronaldo teed up Mateo Kovacic for the opener in the 38th minute to cool tensions at the Bernabeu after supporters had grown impatient with an uninspired display and then secured victory with a strike of his own in the 51st.
Substitute Alvaro Morata then put the finishing touch to the win by adding the third in the 82nd minute.
With Barcelona only able to snatch a 1-1 draw at Real Betis with a late Luis Suarez equaliser after earlier having had a clear goal disallowed and 10-man Sevilla losing 3-1 at Espanyol, Real strengthened their position at the top of the table.
They have 46 points with Barca second on 42, ahead of third-placed Sevilla on goal difference. Zidanes side also have a game in hand on both their title rivals.
Ronaldo had been one of the scapegoats for Reals recent stuttering run which saw them win one of their last four games and exit the Kings Cup in midweek to Celta Vigo.
He was whistled after giving the ball away early in the game and responded by shouting back at the crowd although all was forgiven when he latched onto Kovacics through ball and coolly chipped it into the net.
After a few difficult days we were back doing our thing. It was a good night because our rivals drew and lost. Youre always more motivated when your rivals slip up, Zidane told reporters.We had some difficult moments but at the same time we played well. Its not easy to score three goals against Real Sociedad.
Suarez snatched a late equaliser for Barcelona but their title hopes were dented as the champions were also denied a goal despite the ball clearly crossing the line.
Betiss Alex Alegria gave the home side a deserved lead in the 75th minute after they had hit the woodwork twice in quick succession although Suarez secured a point for the visitors by arrowing home Lionel Messis through ball in the 90th.
Before the equaliser, Barca were left incensed when Aleix Vidals cross was deflected towards goal and the ball crossed the line by about a metre before Aissa Mandi scrambled it away.
Unlike the English Premier League, there is no goalline technology in La Liga to help the referee.
I have nothing to say about the ghost goal, Ive seen the pictures. Technology could help, and its obvious that referees need help, Barca coach Luis Enrique told reporters.
Betis striker Ruben Castro missed a gilt-edged chance to seal an unlikely win but failed to beat Marc-Andre ter Stegen after racing through on goal unchallenged.
Suarezs goal came too late for Barca to score another as their five-game winning streak in all competitions ended.
We did not play well, we made lots of errors in the first half and in the second half they were completely superior to us, we were nowhere near our usual level, Luis Enrique said.
The final minutes changed our sensations but this feels like a point gained.

The next property will be in the South for which we are looking for a property. Our plan is to build 20 rooms.
He said that they will also launch an aggressive marketing campaign both locally and internationally from next year and will also invite travel agents to visit their properties.
He said the Sinharaja Green Eco Lodge now offers the spacious large rooms with attached bathrooms which can accommodate ten guests. In addition we have also built two elevated cabanas to accommodate honeymoon couples and people who prefer separate living. Each room has cable TV, hot and cold water and many other facilities. We will invest a further Rs. 25 million to add more rooms, restaurant and a swimming pool by the end of this year.
The lodge is also equipped with a large terrace with a spectacular view of the rain forest. The hotel also offers several excursions to the Sinharaja forest, mountains, tea factories, waterfalls and other places for nature lovers.
One of the biggest attractions is the 3 k.m. ride up to the rain forest in a special safari jeep provided by the hotel. We also have a car park for guests vehicles
Hotel Manager Prasanna Manjula said that they offer a 24 hour check in and checkout basis for accommodation. We also provide meals or guests could also bring in their food so that we could provide a cook.

SLIC ties up with Gulf Insurance and Reinsurance
Grand Hyatt Colombo to be ready by March 2018
The Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLI) has tied up with Gulf Insurance and Reinsurance Company (GIRI) in Kuwait to offer a comprehensive insurance cover for Sri Lankans employed in the Middle East. Joint Managing Director T. M. R. Bangsa Jayah SLI told the Daily News Business that they are already launching this scheme in Kuwait with GIRI. It is very successful and we have very positive comments from it.
He said soon they will be entering the UAE and Saudi Arabian market and the whole of the Middle East would follow. He said that the biggest advantage in this scheme is that the Sri Lanka employee does not have to pay for this insurance.
When a house maid is being requested from the Gulf, the Employer has to pay for the insurance.The SLI gets a commission and this will further help our bottom line.
He said that in addition in case of an emergency GITI also pays for litigation and the Sri Lanka employee will get paid in the Gulf itself.
It is estimated that there are over one million Sri Lankan migrant workers employed in the Gulf. Sri Lankas expatriate workers, mainly housemaids and unskilled labourers,send back around $7 billion annually.
Asked to comment the Hyatt Hotel he said that it would be ready by 2018 March. It will have 556 keys including apartments and would consist of 44 floors. The Brand value of Hyatt will be Rs. 21 billion.
Grand Hyatt Colombo is a project undertaken by Canwill Holdings and is owned by Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Litro Gas Lanka (which is also a subsidiary of SLIC). SLIC has a successful track record of investing in hotels both public and privately held. These include SLICs investment in Club Robinson (now known as Club Bentota) which SLIC exited in 2002.
EPF has also turned positive on the tourism sector, and has invested into many hotels. Other projects it has invested in recently include Marriott Weligama.

Hyatt Hotels Corporation is a leading American hospitality company and manages hotels under several brands/categories. Grand Hyatt is the flagship brand reserved for large properties in major cities and major holiday destinations

Some recollections of the distant past
To compose this article in the proper format, I will have to repeat only a small paragraph of what I have written earlier.
During my days at Ananda College there were a few great innings played by schoolboy cricketers, some of which I can vividly recollect.
In 1961, under late Yatagama Amaradasa, Ananda won its first three matches beating Royal, Dharmapala and Trinity and in the fourth match against S Thomas, Ananda gave them a fair lead in the first innings. Ananda then lost five wickets cheaply and seemed to be heading for defeat, till Amaradasa strode in like a colossus all 6 foot 2 inches of him, took charge of the proceedings to score 100 not out. He batted with authority making the strong STC attack look innocuous, he then declared the innings closed setting STC to get 160 odd runs in about 100 minutes. The boys from Mt Lavinia chased this target but were tottering at 48 for 8 when the clock came to their rescue at 6.00 pm.
Amaradasa was in his thirties, when an incident occurred which is worth mentioning. T.D. Rajapakse who was batting with him at the bowlers end set off for short single to a shot played by Amaradasa who was late in responding. He ambled a few yards down the wicket, then realizing that he had no chance of getting safely to the bowlers end, Amaradasa stopped running knowing that there was a fielder attempting to have a go at the wicket at the bowlers end, (was it Lareef Idroos) who was near the stumps. The bowler broke the wicket with one hand and simultaneously tried to catch the ball with his other hand.
(In soft ball parlance this was known as current stumping). He missed the ball and a fielder some distance away from him collected the ball and threw to the bowler, who again tried to catch the ball with one hand while taking one stump out of the ground and he failed to catch the ball again! This was butter fingers at its very best.
According to the rule book, which to my mind sounds absurd, under these circumstances, the fielding side had to put all three stumps together and place the ball on top before they could affect a run out . Rajapakse who was out of danger batting at the other end then took off to the bowlers end while telling Amaradasa to turn around and take a few steps to the safety of the crease at the end where he had originally been.
This peculiar incident is still etched in my memory. Amaradasa survived and they were still batting together when the declaration came. At the same venue, Campbell Place and Ananda/STC again, two years later. STC batting second scored a few more runs than the Anandians in the first innings. They were led by Keith Labrooy.
He was a left-arm inswing cum leg-spin slow bowler, who troubled the Anandians in the first innings. Sarath Wimalaratne, one of the best all rounders produced by Ananda captained the Campbell Place boys. When Ananda batted the second time they lost two wickets to Labrooy, who was threatening to run through the batting line up again. Realising an early threat, Wimalaratne walked into bat determined to hit Labrooy out of the attack.
He accomplished his mission to the brim. It was one of the best innings I have witnessed. Diminutive but barrel chested, Wimalaratne quite often used his twinkling feet to get to the pitch of the ball and hit Labrooy for several sixes over extra covers head and played scorching drives between mid-off and cover. This compelled Labrooy to take himself off the attack. Ultimately, Wimalaratnes little gem of an innings terminated, which included a run a minute fifty which served its purpose.
STC had to get a mere hundred odd runs to win the match. Wimalaratne then went on to run through the powerful. Thomian batting line up. He ended up with 8 wickets and a match bag of 14 wickets. A newspaper head lined it the following day as Wimalaratne beat STC.
At present our players are eating humble pie in South Africa, but all is not lost when you consider players like Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva who are clocking valuable mileage in the battle field. Lahiru Kumara who can steam roll any batting line up on any given day, should be carefully nurtured. Although the skies are gloomy at present, these stars will rise and shine in the future.

Stax anticipates continued private equity interest in SL through 2017
Stax, a global strategy consulting firm that advises leading private equity (PE) funds worldwide, noted that investment and merger & acquisition (M&A) activity in Sri Lanka has increased over the past two years.
An ongoing high level of activity is expected in the near-term, mainly fueled by continued interest in the countrys healthcare, hospitality, education, and export sectors.
Stax noted that M&A trends in Sri Lanka mirror those in Asiasome of the largest PE deals in the region (within the past two years) have been in the B2B and healthcare space. For example, leading PE firms General Atlantic, Bain Capital, and Warburg Pincus acquired a stake in MedPlus Health services, a private healthcare player in India, for a value of $370M in 2015. Overall, M&A activity by PE firms within the Asian region saw an increase of 13% from 2015 to 2016.
Deal value sizes in Sri Lanka often do not match those within the broader region, as mature APAC economies are such dominant forces. However, there is still scope to attract smart investors to the island if local businesses think big and position themselves attractively as high-growth options.
Sri Lanka is currently at an economic crossroad and the next few years are crucial. It has experienced stable GDP growth in the past and is expected to move to the upper middle income category by 2020. However, FDI inflows have decreased and the CSE is still not a mature exchange in comparison to heavyweights such as Singapore.
A continued focus on hard infrastructure, increased emphasis on soft infrastructure, targeted trade promotion, and a renewed focus on an export-driven economy will be vital for Sri Lanka in attracting more investment capital, said Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera, Director of Stax.
Private secondary education, universities (foundation, pathway and degree programmes), and technical colleges are ripe for foreign investment, as there is increased spending on education, limited capacities at public universities and schools, and narrow study streams.
Investors will also be eyeing earmarked export areas, which include knowledge-based exports (IT/BPO), and manufacturing-based wholesale and branded products.
Healthcare investment in Sri Lanka generally focuses on developing infrastructure such as hospitals, wellness centers, laboratories, and institutes for medical tourism. However, there is also scope within services oriented to address healthcare needs. By 2030, one in every five Sri Lankans will be over the age of 60, and the 80+ cohort will account for over 5% of the countrys population by 2050. With the combination of rising incomes and ageing populations, we will see increased private healthcare expenditure, added Dr. Gunasekera.
Aspects of hospitality such as support industries are also at a nascent stage and should be monitored for investment opportunities, he concluded.

Trade pact: India, Sri Lanka to iron out differences in services, rules of origin

India is trying to fast-track negotiations on the proposed Economic Technology Cooperation Agreement (ECTA) with Sri Lanka, which would result in an expansion of the existing free trade pact in goods and also include services and investments, by striking a balance between services and goods. With China, too, seeking to conclude a similar economic pact with Sri Lanka this year, New Delhi is eager to ensure that it doesnt fall behind, a government official toldBusinessLine.
India and Sri Lanka had initially resolved to conclude the pact by the end of the last calendar year but couldnt do so due to some niggling issues in services and rules of origin. The third negotiating round in Colombo earlier this month was encouraging and we hope to take it forward in March in New Delhi and conclude the talks soon, the official said.
New Delhi is keen to enter the services sector in Sri Lanka, but there are apprehensions in the country that the strong Indian companies could uproot local businesses. We understand Sri Lankas concerns, but services remain our strong area. That is why we are trying to reach an agreement on areas within services, like IT or ship building, where Sri Lanka needs service professionals and India would not be disrupting anything, the official said.
Flexi rules
Sri Lanka also wants more flexible rules of origin  the rules which determine to what extent a partner country needs to add value to imported inputs for it to qualify as originating from that country.
While Chinas efforts to conclude a free trade pact with Sri Lanka has put India on its toes, New Delhi has been assured that it would not be discriminated against. Sri Lanka has assured that its pact with China will in no way affect the countrys strategic and economic ties with India, the official said.
India and Sri Lanka signed their free trade agreement in goods way back in 1998, which resulted in higher imports from Sri Lanka in the initial years, with India catching up later and the country also benefiting on the investments front.
Although there was no provision of investments in the FTA, India became largest sources of FDI into Sri Lanka because of the linkage between goods and investments. Indian companies, taking advantage of the free trade regime and the literate work force started investing in the country, pointed out Ram Upendra Das from Delhi-based think-tank RIS, which played an instrumental role in signing of the initial FTA.
Das said that even services, for instance tourism in both countries, has flourished in the absence of an agreement in the area. A wider pact encompassing both services and investments will give a further boost to bilateral economic relations, Das said.
Indias exports to Sri Lanka amounted to $5.3 billion in 2015-17 whereas its imports from the country were at $743 million.

Trump fires acting attorney general for refusal to enforce 'extreme vetting' order

President Donald Trump has fired acting AG Sally Yates, making Dana Boente, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia the new acting attorney general.
Yates was relieved of her post Monday, just hours after news broke that she was instructing Department of Justice lawyers not to defend the executive order.
Yates"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,"a press release from the Office of the Press Secretary read.
Boente, an Obama appointee, was confirmed by the Senate to his previous US Attorney post. The Trump administration told reporters Monday evening that was good enough to allow him to signForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants authorizing surveillance of perceived foreign threats in the US.
This is unprecedented, as Boente's Senate confirmation did not grant him FISA approval power. That authority is reserved to the US attorney general and deputy attorney general, who until now have been directly confirmed by the Senate to those posts. It remains to be seen if this move will face a legal challenge.
"I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed. I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected,"Boente said as Acting Attorney General in the press release.
I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institutions solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,Yateswroteinaletter, according to the New York Times.At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful.
Trump responded to Yates' move on Twitter, calling it an example of Democrats' obstruction"for purely political reasons."
Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served under President Obama, tweeted support for Yates after her termination.

Watford, Hull and Leeds suffer Cup upsets
LONDON, Sunday - Premier League clubs Watford and Hull City, and Championship side Leeds United paid the penalty for fielding weakened teams when they were all knocked out of the FA Cup in the fourth round on Sunday -- but holders Manchester United won comfortably.
Like Liverpool, beaten at home by Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, the three beaten sides miscalculated in resting so many players ahead of league games in midweek and could have no complaints at going out of the competition.
Yet United went through, winning 4-0 despite making nine changes at home to Wigan Athletic, who are in the bottom three of the Championship.
Watford lost 1-0 to League One (third tier) side Millwall and Hull, FA Cup finalists three years ago, were humbled 4-1 by Championship (second tier) side Fulham after missing two late penalties.
Leeds, fourth in the Championship and giving greater priority to returning to the Premier League after a 13-year absence, lost 1-0 to Sutton United, who joined fellow fifth-tier National League club Lincoln City in the last 16.
It is the first time two non-League clubs have progressed that far since the competition was reorganised more than 90 years ago.
At Old Trafford, Marouane Felliani broke Wigans dogged resistance in the 43rd minute by heading in a cross from former German international Bastian Schweinsteiger, making a rare appearance.
Anthony Martial, criticised by manager Jose Mourinho last week, then set up goals for Chris Smalling and Henrikh Mkhitaryan before Schweinsteiger added Uniteds fourth.
The first half was not very, very good but we managed to be 1-0 in front, Mourinho said. The second half was much better and the job was done.
Millwall, who beat another understrength Premier League team, Bournemouth, in the previous round, fully deserved the win earned for them with a goal by Steve Morison in the 85th minute. Watfords manager Walter Mazzarri had made seven changes, leaving experienced players like captain Troy Deeney and midfielders Etienne Capoue and Tom Cleverley among the substitutes.
They also lost goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon to injury just before halftime.
Manager Neil Harris felt his mid-table League One team fully deserved their victory over a side 40 places above them.
We could easily have been three or four up by halftime, he said.
This club and this team epitomise what the FA Cup is all about.
At Craven Cottage on the bank of the River Thames, Hull, who had made six changes, fell behind to a goal by their former forward Sone Aluko after 16 minutes.  Agencies

Welcome to the year of the chanticleer
Happy Lunar New Year! Friday January 28, was the Year of the Fire Rooster. The Chinese zodiac moves in a 12-year cycle, and those born in 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993 and 2005 are also known as Roosters.
I have never considered myself a fancy cock-of-the-walk by any standards. But my Chinese zodiac birth sign insists that I am. That is because I came squealing into this world in the Year of the Rooster. In Chinese astrology the animal signs assigned by year represent what others perceive you as being or how you present yourself.
My uncle Rory taught me all about chickens quite early in life. By the time I was able to lisp in baby talk I was aware that baby chickens were chicks. Also that female chickens were pullets until theyre old enough to lay eggs and become hens. Male chickens are called roosters, cocks or cockerels, depending on the country youre in.
Much later I learned in life that a man with a roving eye for the opposite species was termed a rooster which sounded rather uncharitable in the Sinhala idiom, kukula. Conventional wisdom, not my own, had it that roosters only cock-a-doodle-doo in the mornings. That fallacy was dispelled soon enough when a whole flock of roosters consistently heralded false dawns with alarming crowing at midnight and even noon.
Another misconception was that they were generally gentle and kept to themselves. That too was a cockamamie myth that held no credence as far as some of the cocks I was acquainted with displayed positive naked aggression to anyone they suspected were interlopers.
A clutch of roosters on my grandfathers suburban estate used to sneak up on me, charge and dig their talons into me. That is why I believe my entire concept of a living and let live policy changed dramatically overnight. I never knew the roosters were at my heels until I suddenly heard a flapping noise and they were attacking me with hackles up. The last time a gorgeously plumed bird named Rio attacked me I took my shoe off and flung it at him. It hit him right in the chest with a thump. But he came right back for more, neck feathers bristling with indignation.
I threw my other shoe at him but he still kept charging and trying to take me on in an aerial attack. Completely depleted of improvised ammunition of any kind my yells brought the cross fox terrier bitch Vixen to my rescue. She chased the cackling bully all over the lawn and pulled out some of his feathers for good measure.
Vixen looked kind of loveably dandy with some of the birds tail feathers sticking out of her mouth. From then on I never ventured into fighting cock territory without backup of my shadow dog. Rio and his aggressive clutch of cockerels soon began waddling off at top speed in the opposite direction whenever they saw me approaching.
Many Roosters crave love and intimacy. But for sure they are the most promiscuous creatures on earth. Their hormones kick in quite rapidly when in love. As a result, many of them often have numerous mating affairs. Romantic problems are often frequent in their life.
Another chicken myth that was exploded was the one that roosters leave female ducks alone. Wrong! Its not always that birds of a feather flop together. Although Rio had an entire harem of hens to choose from he became obsessed with Daffy a female Muscovy duck. He simply could not keep his eyes off her, much to the chagrin of Daffys legal mate Donald the drake, who usually summoned her to the pond when Rio became overly romantic. That was a pretty good ploy because Rio appeared to be hydrophobic.
And naturally when it was observed that the big rooster had somehow managed to cover Daffy duck with lusty regularity Donald Drake must have felt cuckolded. And particularly so when egg-laying time came around. Well, even the most savvy breeder cannot rightfully determine a sire by examining an egg.
Despite my earlier experiences with aggressive cock-birds I soon realised that not all roosters display belligerent behaviour. Sure they may seem an odd choice for a pet but they can be extremely engaging, friendly and entertaining. .
When I was around eight I received a fuzzy black chick from my uncle Rory. It turned out to be quite a chic chick and began ranging the house and large garden. It was not difficult to hand-raise him. He turned out to be a bantam cockerel and I named him Bravo. The iridescent feathers of his green and red tail and wings against his black body shimmered with his cocky walk when he followed me around. As for Bravo, we may have been the cocks-of-the walk but although we did have our differences he deferred to me in the pecking order. His absences were constrained by his overwhelming passion for romancing the neighbouring free-ranging hens. Bravo was a plucky little fellow and displayed his fearlessness among the domesticated roosters, many of them twice his own weight. He may have been a Bantam but he would never hesitate when taking on the ruffled heavyweights.
People often commented that the pet bird had an uncanny resemblance to its little owner, or was it the other way around They claimed we demonstrated the same feisty and insufferable characteristics. They stressed on the likeness of the swagger, the full-throated crowing, the cockscombs and the confrontational attitude. And never mind the wicked, insinuating hints of the birds personal pleasurable proclivities they predicted I would inherit in the future. I was not amused. After all, it was inconsequential cockamamie chicken talk and humour most fowl! But to my utter annoyance they never mentioned that he was as handsome and flamboyant as they come.
After all, going by the old parody of sticking feathers up where Yankee-Doodle stuck his does not make you a fire rooster. You have got to have flair. So all you kukula types out there simply shake a tail feather and start strutting your stuff. So, Chinese astrology doesnt seem all that cockeyed as far as the positive aspects of your rooster personality are concerned. As for the negative viewpoint I would say its a whole lot of poppycock! You can be cocksure of that.
Happy Lunar New Year to all you kukulas out there! Welcome to the year of the Fire Rooster, and may all your dreams come true.

Where Obama failed
It is impossible to know what a presidents foreign policy legacy will be until long after they have left office. But there is good reason to believe that the pivot to Asia will come to be seen as President Barack Obamas greatest foreign policy mistake.
Obama once referred to himself as the first Pacific president and the pivot is touted by Obamas defenders as a great success that properly rebalanced Americas foreign policy focus away from costly interventions in the Middle East to Asia, the prophesied centre of the 21st century economy. The reality is that the pivot was a failure that caused serious negative side effects in other parts of the world.
The pivot was based on a series of flawed assumptions, namely: That U.S. foreign policy had previously neglected the Asia Pacific, that Asias rising importance in the global economy called for the assignment of more military resources to the region, and that the United States could afford to pull back from the Middle East and other regions. By taking the approach it did, the Obama administration managed to make tensions in the Asia-Pacific worse while also allowing the Middle East and Europe to fall into even deeper chaos than before as a result of neglect.
First, it is simply wrong that the United States was ignoring the Asia Pacific when Barack Obama came to office. Far from being neglectful, the Bush administrations Asia policy was a success. The Bush administration helped get tensions between China and Taiwan to a historic low. It concluded free trade agreements with Australia, South Korea, and Singapore and began talks on what became the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It also concluded a civilian nuclear agreement with India and forged a new relationship with that country while simultaneously managing to build a partnership with Pakistan to deal with Afghanistan. Some of these policies were later repackaged by the Obama administration as part of the pivot.
The pivot did include some new diplomatic initiatives (such as the rapprochement with Myanmar) but the real problem was the shift in security and defense policy. By putting Asia at the centre of its security strategy, the Obama administration inadvertently made the entire enterprise seem to Beijing like an effort to contain China militarily. This led China to respond by becoming more aggressive, helping to undo the general tranquility that existed before 2008.
Hostile intentions toward China
Emblematic of this mistake was the roll-out of the Air-Sea Battle doctrine. First outlined in a then-classified memo in 2009, ASB became official doctrine in 2010. From the beginning, it was an effort to develop an operational doctrine for a possible military confrontation with China and then-Secretary of Defence Robert Gates openly discussed the need to counter Chinas growing military capabilities. The signal received in Beijing was the United States had hostile intentions toward China and was trying to contain it militarily. The result was that the entire pivot was seen by Beijing as part of a broader effort to encircle China.
If the first flaw in the pivot was the prominence of its military component, the second flaw was that there wasnt a compelling reason to have a military component at all. The premise of the pivot was that Asia was more important relative to other parts of the world because it was home to a rising proportion of global GDP and was now at the centre of the world economy. But this called for an economic response to take advantage of an opportunity, not a military response to counter threats. Yet, the pivot to Asia contained a robust military component.
This led China to view the entire enterprise, not just its military components, as part of a broader effort at containment. For example, when the TPP was finalized in 2015, Obama said, TPP allows America  and not countries like China  to write the rules of the road in the 21st century. Even trade deals were being presented as a way to counter the threat from China. It is no mystery why Beijing believed U.S. strategy in the region centred on containing Chinas rise. The United States publicly said this is exactly what it was doing.
It didnt have to be this way. One obvious opportunity for a different approach was Chinas invitation for the United States to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The United States refused to participate and even objected to the U.K. joining the AIIB. As Leland Lazarus explained for The Diplomat, this decision was an enormous error. If the United States had pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership by publicly emphasizing it hoped China would one day join while also joining the AIIB, the entire perception of any pivot in Beijing would have been radically different.
Instead of appearing to be a strategy to undermine China it would simply appear to be an effort to take full advantage of the economic opportunities presented by Asias dynamic economic growth. Instead, the United States chose a path that heightened military tensions and missed out on economic opportunities.
Obama administration
The third grave error was the United States took its eye off the ball in Europe and the Middle East.
The Obama administration appears to have believed that the United States could not walk and chew gum at the same time and focusing on Asia meant losing focus somewhere else. This was both untrue and highly dangerous.
American neglect of Europe was followed by Russian adventurism in Ukraine, an increased threat to the Baltic states, and the erosion of democracy in Poland and Hungary.
After America pulled back from the Middle East, the Syrian Civil War displaced 11 million people and caused a refugee crisis, Islamic State moved into Iraq, and Americas relationships with its Gulf allies frayed as Iranian influence expanded throughout the region.
The final tally is not pretty. The pivot did not contain the rise of China. Instead, China became more aggressive, pressing its claims in the South China Sea and to the Senkakus. China also continues to close the gap in military capabilities with the United States. Its economy continues to grow, as does its share of global GDP. The TPP looks to be dead in Congress while China pursues trade deals of its own with key countries in the region.
The pivot failed to achieve its key goals in Asia while inattention helped make matters worse in Europe and the Middle East.
The pivot to Asia has been a failure on all fronts. Given the importance of the Asia-Pacific, this failure is likely to be remembered as President Obamas greatest mistake in foreign policy.

World leaders criticise Trump immigration move
FRANCE: Several world leaders and governments have hit out at the immigration restrictions imposed by US President Donald Trump.
Here are some of the top reactions:
BRITAIN
Downing Street said on Sunday Prime Minister Theresa May does not agree with the restrictions and would intervene if they affected British nationals.
While US immigration is a matter for Washington, we do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking, London said.
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted Britain will protect the rights and freedoms of UK nationals home and abroad. Divisive and wrong to stigmatise because of nationality.
EUROPEAN UNION
European Union foreign policy supremo Federica Mogherini pledged the bloc would continue to support, welcome and take care of those who flee from war.
We will continue to celebrate for every wall that is torn down and for every new bridge that is built up. We will keep working for peace and coexistence. This is our history, this is our identity, our work and our commitment, added
Mogherini.
CANADA
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not directly criticise Trump but said on his official Twitter account: To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.
This tweet was followed by one showing him with a young refugee at a Canadian airport and another that used the hashtag #ACanadianIsACanadian, as his office confirmed Canadian passport holders including dual nationals were unaffected by the ban.
IRAN
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif slammed Trumps move as a clear insult to the Islamic world and said it will be recorded in history as a great gift to extremists and their supporters.
Zarif said Trumps decision only serves to provide a fertile ground for more terrorist recruitment by deepening the ruptures and fault-lines which have been exploited by extremist demagogues to swell their ranks.
His ministry said earlier it would reciprocate with a ban on Americans entering the country, though it will not apply to those who already have a valid visa.
GERMANY
Angela Merkels spokesman said the German chancellor regrets the entry ban and is convinced that even in the
necessarily resolute battle against terrorism, it is not justified to place people from a certain origin or belief under general suspicion.
Berlin will now examine the consequences of the ban for German citizens with dual nationality affected by the decision, added the spokesman.
INDONESIA
Indonesia deeply regrets the move because we believe it would affect the global fight against terrorism and the refugees management negatively, foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told AFP.
It is wrong to link radicalism and terrorism with one particular religion, Nasir said.
FRANCE
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said: Welcoming refugees who are fleeing war is part of our duty.
We must... ensure that this happens in a fair, just way and with solidarity ... This decision can only cause us concern.
SWEDEN
Swedish Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Margot Wallstrom called the decision deeply unfortunate.
This decision increases mistrust and tensions between people. Not since World War II have so many people fled war and conflict, she wrote.
It is the joint responsibility of all countries to help them, including the US.
SWITZERLAND
Trumps decision is wrong, Swiss Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Burkhalter said.
We have always been opposed to discrimination against human beings on the basis of religion or nationality, he said. In that sense, the US order clearly goes in the wrong direction.
Burkhalter said the Swiss government would confer with American representatives to find out how the order would affect Swiss residents, especially dual nationals from countries affected.
Burkhalter also invoked the Geneva Conventions, saying they mean that all countries welcome people affected by war for humanitarian reasons.
It is therefore contrary to the Conventions to stop welcoming people coming from Syria, he added.
THE NETHERLANDS
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said all refugees fleeing war and violence deserve a safe haven, regardless of their ethnicity or religion.
He added that while his government is conscious of the potential to abuse the refugee system, we regret the US decision to ban the travel of people from seven Muslim countries and we reject it.
However, Geert Wilders, a lawmaker from the far-right Freedom Party, tweeted Sunday: Less Islam means more freedom and No more immigration from an Islamic country is exactly what we need. Also in The Netherlands, Islam and freedom are incompatible.
CZECH REPUBLIC
Going against the grain of global condemnation, a spokesman for Czech President Milos Zeman came out in favour of the ban.
US President Trump protects his country, hes concerned with the safety of his citizens. Exactly what EU elites do not do, Jiri Ovcacek said.
POLAND
Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski also refused to condemn the ban, saying its the right of every sovereign state to determine its own immigration policy.
The scale of this phenomenon is so large that in many countries at the moment the immigration issue is a matter of government policy and should remain government policy, he told Polish private news channel Polsat News on Sunday.
No country currently has the obligation to welcome immigrants. Countries have the obligation -- in accordance with international conventions -- to welcome refugees, if they arrive, he added. - AFP

Seized illicit timber at Customs for three years without investigation
The Sri Lanka Customs was yesterday ordered by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to carry out an investigation into a load of timber lying in the Customs custody for nearly three years without an investigation.
Minister Karunanayake said the Customs had not investigated the matter and failed to prosecute the offenders.
Under whose authority, they remained dormant the minister asked.
The Customs reportedly had seized the illicit timber load in 2014.
Minister Karunanayaka charged the Customs of depriving the government of revenues from fines from the offenders in the case .
If any officer of the Customs is found acted in violation of law, steps will be taken against them, he said.
I have directed Customs Director General Chulananda Perera to submit a report on this, he said.
I do not know whether some Customs officers are on a role to invent topics to please those who call themselves Joint Opposition, he said.

Twilight star helps create new AI system
Twilight actor Kristen Stewart has co-authored a research, along with an Indian-origin engineer, describing a new artificial intelligence system that can make movie shots look as though they were painted.
The process relies on machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence. It gave a look of an impressionistic painting to certain shots in the film short, which uses allusive images to follow a man through his day.
The shot is about 15 seconds long, and the painting is by Stewart herself. The technique described in the paper, called neural style transfer, differs from Instagram or Snapchat filters. What current filters do is, they work with the information in the image. A global operation like Instagram is just a colour lookup, said lead author Bhautik Joshi, a research engineer at Adobe Systems in the US.
To create effects, Snapchat and Instagram use filters that are based on rules created by a human being; if you come across this condition, do that to the image, Joshi said.
For example, in Snapchat, the software is trained to recognise eyes in a photo, so if you want to make a persons eyes look like a cartoon characters, it can do that.
In contrast, style transfer, in this context, works by taking an image and breaking it down into blocks to identify its components and then comparing it to a reference image.
For example, if a user wants to make an image look as though it were painted in the style of Van Goghs Starry Night, the software would look for corresponding features in the image that you want to alter, using a technique based on so-called neural networks.
Sometimes, the results can be unpredictable, because unlike with the Snapchat filters, the computer is learning as it goes through the images, Joshi said. The study was published in the journal ArXiv.

Access Engineering completes work on the Kapparatota jetty
The opening of the first concrete jetty built into the open sea, Kapparatota Jetty was held on January 20 by Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. The design and construction work of the Jetty has been completed and commissioned by Access Engineering.
The new Jetty will bring significant benefits to the local fishing industry with the increased anchoring facilities for the boats and the development of a new market place to trade the yields of the local fishermen.
The Government accorded and funded the project with the forward vision to revitalise the fishery based livelihood of the communities in and around Weligama. The project was executed under the guidance of Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development.
Access Engineering designed and constructed the 128m long jetty on a pile foundation which extends from the land into sea enabling the local fishermen to anchor their boats within the sea area without facing the trouble of bringing the boats to the shore.
The piers of the jetty were furnished with new fenders and bollards to facilitate safe docking at the jetty. The pile and structural designs were executed by the in-house design team of Access Engineering.
It is a pleasure for us at Access Engineering to be able to involve in this project which has direct impact towards strengthening the livelihood of coastal communities in and around Weligama. The fishermen within this community have been economically vulnerable due to the absence of a proper fishery harbor that facilitates easy landing and anchoring of boats, project manager Chandimal Kumara said.
He further added Access Engineering being an expert contractor in port and marine construction, strictly adhered to the environmental regulation during the construction activities in this marine environment. Stingiest quality control measures were thus undertaken when carrying out steel fabrication and concrete works.
Numerous environmental and infrastructural development measures have also been executed by the organization under their CSR framework during construction process to uplift the environment and social standards of the surrounding community.

Anti-corruption troubleshooter to oversee BCCI
New Delhi: Indias Supreme Court appointed a top anti-corruption troubleshooter on Monday as head of a team to oversee the running of the powerful cricket board after sacking its top officials for failing to implement reforms.
Former government auditor Vinod Rai, who exposed major corruption scandals under the previous government, will head the new committee of administrators to run the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
He will be joined by the prominent historian Ramachandra Guha, banker Vikram Limaye and former Indian womens cricket captain Diana Edulji.
It was not immediately clear how long the four would be in place or their exact titles.
I think its a huge, huge responsibility put on my shoulders and being the only cricketer -- male or female -- I think I have to really put my head into it and think about its future, Edulji told the CNN News18 network.
The appointments follow a court order to sack BCCI president Anurag Thakur and his deputy from their positions on January 2 over their failure to implement reforms recommended by a panel headed by former judge Rajendra Mal Lodha.
The court then asked two lawyers, known as amicus curiae (friends of the court), to suggest nine names to run the board after ruling that government employees, ministers and anyone aged over 70 cannot be part of the organisation.
The judges however later trimmed the proposed new team from nine to four and rejected a suggestion from a government lawyer that a top official from the federal sports ministry be included in the line-up.
Former India skipper Bishan Singh Bedi said he hoped the new team would improve the functioning of the board, which would benefit the game as a whole.
I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that they are the right people for the job. All four of them are people of integrity, Bedi, who has been one of the boards most outspoken critics, told AFP.
Rai, who was the Comptroller and Auditor General of India between 2008-2013, is hailed for bringing accountability in the functioning of government after exposing scams in the allocation of coal mines and 2G mobile spectrum bidding by the previous centre-left government.
Rais expose became one of the focal points of the election campaign by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014, which ended with its leader Narendra Modi taking power with a huge majority.
Rai has faced criticism in some quarters that he was too close to the BJP and worked for its benefit during his stint as Indias top auditor.
Crickets massive popularity in India has helped the BCCI become by far the wealthiest of all of the sports national boards.
Charges of corruption and nepotism have dented the image of the board in recent years, leading many activists to urge the court to intervene to reform the privately-run organisation.
The board has been embroiled in a series of scandals, including accusations of corruption in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and a betting scandal involving an IPL team linked to its former head Narayanaswami Srinivasan. AFP

Certain individuals are trying to achieve their personal political ambitions by deceiving the people and putting them in trouble, Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Silva said.
"A political leader should try to serve the people instead of trying to serve himself. Some are trying to regain their lost political and personal privileges by placing people's future at stake, he said.
There is no harm if people tried to regain their lost privileges provided they did not place innocent people in trouble," he said.
Dissanayake was addressing a Jana Hamuwa after opening a rehabilitated road leading to a farming village in Dutuwewa, Galenbindunuwewa.
Dissanayake said certain former SLFP local government members were under the impression that the SLFP would suffer if they received nominations from another party to contest elections.
"If they think so, they are sadly mistaken. A large number of people were flocking round the SLFP in the village areas. There were many people among them who were willing to contest elections to render a dedicated and selfless service to their areas without restricting to personal agendas," the minister said. He said although no announcement had been made about an election so far, the SLFP was fully geared to face an election any time and win it.
Dissanayake said it was strange to see individuals who had robbed the country to the tune of millions of rupees trying to pose as heroes by displaying their manacled hands to the public when they are hauled before courts.
"One such person had even gone to the extent of displaying his posters countrywide with a verse depicting him as a patriot. Today the environment in the country had turned for the better and everyone was considered equal before the law," the minister said.

Aussies fall to NZ despite Stoinis heroics
AUCKLAND: New Zealand scraped home in the first one-dayer against Australia Monday, but only after rookie all-rounder Marcus Stoinis fell agonisingly short of dragging his team to victory with an unbeaten 146.
In just his second ODI, Stoinis took three wickets then flayed the New Zealand attack as the Australians chased a target of 287 runs at Aucklands Eden Park.
He came to the crease with Australia reeling at 54 for five and calmly set about rebuilding after his more experienced teammates had squandered their wickets. His 146 was a record ODI score for an Australian number seven batsman and included 11 sixes and nine fours.
Remarkably, the 27-year-olds last partnership with Josh Hazlewood was worth 54, but Hazlewood did not face a single ball as Stoinis stayed on strike trying to guide Australia home.
His heroics prevented a trouncing in the opening match of the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, sparing Australias blushes after they rested their star batsmen for the series.
The tourists left David Warner and Usman Khawaja out of the squad to protect them for the upcoming Test series in India, then lost captain Steve Smith and wicketkeeper-batsman Matthew Wade to injury.
But the players expected to offer leadership in their absence failed to step up and the Australians crumbled before Stoinis arrived.
Their woes were largely caused by rash or careless shots, not demons in a pitch on which the New Zealanders had batted solidly. Relative newcomers such as Travis Head (5) and Peter Hanscomb (4) could be forgiven for a rush of blood to the head at the sight of the short Eden Park boundaries. AFP

The Colombo High Court was yesterday informed that Australian businessman Brian Shaddick and his wife were yet to receive summons in connection with an indictment filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 20 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction that took place in 2000.
When the case came up before High Court Judge J. Gurusinghe, the Court was informed that the Ministry of Justice has dispatched the summons to the Foreign Affairs Ministry in order to serve them to the two witnesses residing in Australia. The matter was fixed for a calling date on February 16.
Parliamentraina Udaya Gammanpila is currently out on bail. The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has cheated Rs. 20 million and misappropriated another Rs. 21 million along with Sydney Jayasinghe, the second accused when selling shares of Digital Nominees to a businessman named Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shadick.
MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016.

Austria to ban full-face veil in public places

Austria's ruling coalition has agreed to prohibit full-face veils in public spaces such as courts and schools.
It is also considering a more general ban on state employees wearing the headscarf and other religious symbols.
The measures are seen as an attempt to counter the rise of the far-right Freedom Party, whose candidate narrowly lost last month's presidential vote.
The centrist coalition nearly collapsed last week amid crisis negotiations over the government's future direction.
'Symbolic' step
Detailing the package of reforms, the coalition devoted just two lines to the planned ban on the Islamic niqab and burqa.
"We are committed to an open society, which also presupposes open communication. A full-face veil in public places stands in its way and will therefore be banned," it said.
An estimated 150 women wear the full niqab in Austria but tourism officials have expressed fears that the measures will also deter visitors from the Gulf.
One government spokesman told an Austrian newspaper that the ban would apply for ski resorts such as Zell am See as much as the centre of Vienna.
Several European countries have imposed similar bans but the Austrian move is, according to the vice chancellor a "symbolic" step.
Integration Minister Sebastian Kurz said it was important to be seen to be neutral, especially for anyone dealing with the public in the police or schools.
France and Belgium introduced a burqa ban in 2011 and a similar measure is currently going through the Dutch parliament.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said last month that the full-face veil should be prohibited in Germany "wherever it is legally possible". The UK does not ban the niqab or burqa.
Further measures agreed by Austria's Social Democrats and their conservative People's party partners include electronic tagging of former jihadists and a proposed curb on foreign workers.
Many of the plans must be hammered out in detail and receive parliamentary approval before they can come into force, BBC Vienna correspondent Bethany Bell reports.

What is a niqab and a burka
Theniqabis a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. However, it may be worn with a separate eye veil. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf.
Theburkais the most concealing of all Islamic veils. It is a one-piece veil that covers the face and body, often leaving just a mesh screen to see through.

Brilliant Bumrah secures Indias thrilling win
NAGPUR, Sunday - Jasprit Bumrah kept his nerve to send down a brilliant final over and secure Indias series-levelling five-run victory against England in the second Twenty20 international on Sunday.
Chasing 145 to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, England needed eight runs from the last over but the 23-year-old Bumrah bowled with ice in his veins, conceding only two runs while claiming two wickets.
Both Ben Stokes and Joe Root made 38 but their contributions were not enough to get England across the line.
Root, though, was unlucky to be given out leg-before on the first ball of the eventful final over with replays suggesting an inside edge.
There was no argument, however, when Bumrah bowled Jos Buttler with his fourth delivery of that over.
Needing six runs of the last ball, Moeen Ali failed to connect with the Bumrah delivery.
Earlier put into bat, India posted a modest 144-8 with opener Lokesh Rahul (71) supplying nearly half of the total in an otherwise insipid batting display by the hosts.
Chris Jordan (3-22) drew first blood dismissing Virat Kohli for 21 in the fifth over but Rahul propped up the Indian innings with some crisp hitting, which included six boundaries and a couple of sixes.
The right-hander added 56 with Manish Pandey (30) to set the stage for a late assault which never came.  Agencies

Care to listen
The countrywide cancer counselling hotline (011-2363211) launched recently in memory of Indira Jayasuriya (the late daughter of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya) is operational for 12 hours a day from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm. The helpline will be made available round the clock. Efforts are being made to offer a four digit number in the future that can be easily remembered by all, the founder and current President of the Cancer Care Association of Sri Lanka, Dr. Samadhi Wishwanath Rajapaksa told the `Daily News'.
According to Dr. Rajapaksa, the main objective of this helpline is to provide cancer patients in Sri Lanka with physical and mental support. Cancer patients, their family members, the public, health staff members, etc can call this line and obtain information on cancer care. Anyone who wants information, befriending, share their grief, anxiety, fear, etc can call this number where a listener will listen to him/her and provide help.
The Cancer Care Help Line was launched to uplift the physical and mental status of cancer patients as well as provide them with medical consultations and advice on treatment. Information on any related matter, such as the specific clinics available, whether specific facilities are available or not, whether it is good to take a shower/bath while undergoing radiotherapy, what is radiotherapy, the side effects of radiotherapy, whether consuming specific food during specific treatment is good or bad etc. can also be obtained through this hotline. The hotline will provide emotional support to callers, he said.
Indira Jayasuriya
"The staff who provide information to callers are highly professional nursing officers who are currently working at the National Cancer Institute, Maharagama. They work during their free time and they have over 15 to 20 years experiences in caring for cancer patients and dealing with them. We have the Board comprising expertise of consultant oncologists, oncological surgeons, radiologists and other specialists. When specialised service is required to answer questions, callers will be referred to the specialised panel," he said.
The hotline was launched recently based on a concept of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in memory of his daughter, Indira Jayasuriya, who died recently at the age of 40, due to breast cancer.
In addition, there are two more projects that had been launched in the name of late Indira Jayasuriya. They are Indira Jayasuriya Care Service and Indira Jayasuriya Pediatric Care.
Indira Jayasuriya Care Service
Indira Jayasuriya Care Service will be a unique effort that will enhance the availability of mammograms, especially for low-income families of Sri Lanka. The state sector has only 11 mammography machines at the moment, whilst the private sector has 15. The price of a Digital mammography film is priced at Rs. 8,000. Digital Mammography, is the state of the art mammography with minimal discomfort to patients and produce higher levels of accuracy.
The proposal through the Indira Jayasuriya Care Service is to mobilise a mobile mammography unit in a specialised bus that would screen/diagnose patients in a systematic population screening. As per the WHO the only breast cancer screening method that has proved to be effective is mammography screening.
Indira Jayasuriya Paediatric Care Project
There are approximately 200 children at the National Cancer Institute at Maharagama receiving treatment and even the terminally ill children tend to remain in the ward until their eventual demise.
A centre will be initiated under the Indira Jayasuriya Paediatric Care Project for such cancer victims. It will be able to house approximately 25 children with terminal cancer. The atmosphere at the centre would enable them to be attended to by a multidisciplinary team, so that the child's body, mind and spirit is uplifted. This would also free hospital beds that could cater to acute cancer patients. In addition, there are monthly activities proposed at the National Cancer Institute Maharagama children's wards and will be facilitated by the counselling unit at the hospital.
The proposed activities will include monthly activities ranging from art and craft, music therapy, movie day, kids' yoga, entertainment such as magic shows, etc so that one particular item happens every month. Further, measures will also be made to provide a birthday cake to cancer victims to celebrate their birthday like normal children, even while receiving in-house treatment.
Registered NGO
The Cancer Care Association is a registered voluntary NGO founded by Dr. Samadhi Wishvanath Rajapaksa in 2003 (13 years ago) and operates in Colombo, Galle, Matara, Vavuniya and Anuradhapura.
The society has already implemented several projects and programmes in order to uplift the physical, mental, social and spiritual well-being of cancer patients and their family members.
The association also intends to boost cancer prevention via awareness building and on healthy living and early detection. A palliative care services are already available at Karapitiya and will be extended countrywide. Cancer Care Hospice at Anuradhapura, the home-based palliative care service (Karapitiya), the cancer drug and chemotherapy port project and breast prosthesis project are among the other services offered.
The public can contribute towards these programmes by obtaining membership of the association and volunteering in CCA activities. The public can contribute towards a meal at the Cancer Care Hospice. The public can also set up a monthly standing order of the desired amount (preferably Rs. 150 or more) for the Pain Relief Fund. A one-time donation of the desired amount can also be made.
The association at No. 55, Munasinghe Mawata, Galawilawatta, Homagama can be contacted on 0113155229, 011253890357, 0773409787.

A part of the duties of the JP is taking steps to protect street children, children of unmarried parents, children in fatherless families etc. There are civil defence committees in villages but it seems they are not vigilant enough, he said.
There are persons in all villages who are eyeing vulnerable children. Vulnerable children should be protected from them.
Vigilance can reduce the number of court cases getting added to the existing lot, Samaraweera said.

Future Mobility, an electric car company jointly invested by Tencent and Foxconn and run by foreigners in China, plans to invest CNY11.64 billion, which is about USD1.7 billion, to build a plant in Nanjing.
The nascent technology company aims to seize opportunities brought by the growing demand for electric cars in China and other countries.
On the completion of this new plant, its final production capacity will reach 300,000 vehicles per year. Future Mobility did not reveal when they can realize this production capacity; however, the company said that the first-phase project will be completed in 2019 and its annual production capacity will reach 150,000 vehicles by then.
Future Mobility said based on the plans of the company, their first product made in the Nanjing plant will be a pure electric medium-sized smart SUV, which will be sold worldwide.
A spokesperson from Future Mobility revealed to local media that this smart SUV may be priced at about CNY300,000 and it is expected to put into the Chinese market in 2019.
The company only officially started in March 2016. The company is different from other Chinese EV start-ups in that its chiefs are foreigners working in China: Dr. Carsten Breitfeld, a former BWM executive is the CEO, and Dr. Daniel Kirchert, a ex-Infiniti China executive is the chief operating officer.

CIOB launches www.greenbuild.lk website
The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), the premier professional body, which actively promotes Green constructions in the country, launched its website www.greenbuild.lk at an official ceremony held in Colombo recently.
This website is the comprehensive portal totally dedicated to the Green buildings concept in Sri Lanka. Entrepreneurs and professionals in Sri Lanka's construction industry can log on to www.greenbuild.lk to gather more information on the diverse programs launched by the CIOB to actively promote and give a big boost to Green constructions.
The official ceremony to launch the www.greenbuild.lk website was held under the patronage of Deputy Minister of Finance, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena. 'Construction Expo2017', the premier Construction Exhibition jointly organized by the CIOB and LECS, was also formally introduced at this ceremony. 'Construction Expo  2017' will be held on June 2, 3 and 4, 2017 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo.
This key event will be hosted on a grand scale for the 6th successive time this year. As Sri Lanka's premier Green Constructions Expo, the salient feature of 'Construction Expo2017' will be the creation of a separate exhibition zone for Green buildings.
This Exhibition affords a progressive opportunity and an invaluable platform to construction companies, which have secured the Green Mark certification from the CIOB, to further promote Green Buildings, Green Building Products and Green Building Services.
Expressing his views at the official launch, Deputy Minister of Finance, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, said that the prolonged drought faced by the country at present has impacted adversely on the construction industry as well. At a time the ongoing drought reflects the vital importance and dire necessity for more and more environment-friendly Green constructions, the initiative taken and the keen interest shown by the CIOB regarding the Green concept should be deeply appreciated, the Deputy Minister stressed.
Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, President of The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), said, During the past few years, the construction industry in Sri Lanka witnessed a decline to some extent. But, now this vital sector has picked up significantly and is on a progressive upward trend. We took the initiate to launch this website with the core objective of giving a bigger impetus to Green constructions. The modern trend in the construction industry is the concept on Green buildings. In this backdrop, we decided on the apt theme Towards a Green Sri Lanka for the forthcoming 'Construction Expo2017' Exhibition.
One such initiative is the conferring of CIOB Green Mark certification to large-scale Green constructions following a due process of inspection. In addition, a Green Awards presentation ceremony is organized annually.
At this event, CIOB Green Mark certificates and awards are presented to Green Buildings, Green Building Products and Green Building Services. Apart from this ceremony, an Advanced Certificate Course for Green Project Managers targeting executive grade officers of construction companies is also conducted by the CIOB with the aim of taking Green buildings in Sri Lanka to accepted international standards.

CTC closes two leaf depots in Anuradhapura, Sigiriya
Ceylon Tobacco Company said it will be closing its leaf depots in Anuradhapura and Sigiriya.
In December 2016 the company announced that it was considering the closure of four leaf depots, due to the sharp drop in demand for tobacco leaf as a result of declining volumes.
In the first phase CTC will wind down operations in Anuradhapura and Sigiriya starting with the closure of the two leaf depots. Shutting down the two depots is estimated to impact the livelihoods of around 2,000 persons depending on tobacco farming, who stand to lose close to Rs. 200 million in annual income.
The excise and VAT hikes in October and November last year, led to a 43% price increase in legally manufactured cigarettes and had an impact on our business and manufacturing operations in Sri Lanka. We have, on several occasions, highlighted that any impact on our business will have a ripple effect on the livelihoods supported across our value chain. It is unfortunate that policy makers ignored these facts when increasing taxes on the legal tobacco industry and we are now seeing the unintentional results of such actions, CTC Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Michael Koest said. The company also underwent a 20% head count reduction at the start of 2017 as a result of reducing one shift at its Colombo factory.
The increase in retail price of cigarettes and the resultant decline in volumes has jeopardized the sustainability of a business that has been legally operating in Sri Lanka for over a hundred years. This could spell disaster to the livelihoods supported across the companys value chain. Currently CTC directly and indirectly employs over 46,000 persons and supports around 300,000 livelihoods at various stages of our operations from farming tobacco to the distribution and sale of its products.
We source all our tobacco leaf locally from over 20,000 farmers and infuse around Rs. 2 billion to the rural economy annually through our farming activities alone. We partner with these farmers and guarantee the purchase of their full crop at a pre-agreed competitive price. No other farming community in Sri Lanka enjoy the amenities and support that our farmers have enjoyed for decades. We are concerned that the impacts faced by our business will have far reaching impacts on the local communities and rural economies dependent on the legal tobacco industry, Koest said.

England add Mark Wood to Lions squad for Lanka tour
Durham seamer Mark Wood and Northamptonshire left-arm spinner Graeme White have been added to the England Lions squad for the five-match one-day series against Sri Lanka A which begins in March.
Wood, currently in South Africa as part of Englands Pace Programme, will join the squad to further increase his workload after recuperation from ankle surgery last year and White has taken the place left open by the England selectors when they announced the squad in December.
Both players have already been included in the North squad for the three-match 50-over series against the South, that will be held in Dubai and Abu Dhabi after the Lions one-day series in Sri Lanka. James Whitaker, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) national selector, said: We believe these selections will work well both for the Lions and for the players involved.
We had always been planning to add a left-arm spinner to the 14 players we named last month for the one-day series, and Graeme White deserves this chance after his performances for Northamptonshire in county cricket last summer which had already earned him a place in the North team through the PCAs [Professional Cricketers Association]
Most Valuable Player rankings. After an injury hit year, it is the selection of Wood which is the most interesting for England. Capable of bowling in excess of 90mph and skilled at reverse swing, the Durham man will be a valuable weapon, if he remains fit, as England look ahead to the summers Champions Trophy at home and next winters Ashes.
Mark Wood will also be a valuable addition to the Lions squad, said Whitaker. In his case, the one-day series in Sri Lanka is a good opportunity for him to start bowling again in competitive cricket before the North-South series and then the domestic 2017 season. The England Lions, who will be led by Durhams Keaton Jennings, begin the one-day series on March 2 in Dambulla. Before that, the Lions play two four-day matches against Sri Lanka A, the first of which begins on February 17 in Kandy.

Eurocars unveils 718 Cayman at motor show
Eurocars, the official importer and dealer of Porsche cars in Sri Lanka, unveiled the 718 Cayman with the German Ambassador of Sri Lanka, Jrn Rohde at the CMTA Motor Show in Colombo.
The 718 Cayman and 718 Boxster are the new names of the two-door mid-engine sports cars from Dr.Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG.
The fourth, redeveloped generation of the mid-engine 718 Cayman has a more striking, athletic and efficient appearance. Just a few weeks after the debut of the new 718 Boxster, the new 718 Cayman is extending the new model series.
The same new four-cylinder flat engines with turbo charging as in the 718 Boxster are being deployed in the 718 Cayman. As a result, they both have an identical engine output for the first time.
The Stuttgart car manufacturers 718 designation is a reference to the ground-breaking sports car of the same type of the year 1957, which enjoyed great success in renowned car races. The 718 Cayman and Boxster show more and more similarities  both visual and technical. In the future, both will have equally powerful four-cylinder flat engines with turbo charging.
The 718 model series is a continuation of the proven four-cylinder concept and the history of distinguished Porsche sports cars. The latest example is the 919 Hybrid LMP1 race car, which also has a highly-efficient, turbocharged four-cylinder engine with just 2 litres of displacement.
Porsche finished first and second in the 24 hours of Le Mans, the worlds most competitive sports car competition, but most recently it also won the manufacturers and drivers championship titles in the WEC World Endurance Championship.
Eurocars has been the official agent of Porsche cars for over 18 years and continues to serve its exclusive clientele with services that are on par with global standards. Eurocars is part of the IWS Holdings Group, which manages a varied portfolio of industries across Automobile, Aviation, Communication and IT, Food Processing and Packaging, Industrial, Leisure, Warehousing and Logistics and Mass Media.

Farah relieved he can rejoin family in U.S. amid new travel rules
LONDON, Sunday - British Olympic champion Mo Farah said he was relieved he would be able to rejoin his family in the United States after the British government said late on Sunday the new U.S. travel restrictions did not apply to UK nationals born, like Farah, in one of the countries listed.
Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said earlier on Sunday he was worried he would be unable to return to his home and family in the United States. He is currently training in Ethiopia.
We understand from the statement released this evening by the Foreign and Commonwealth office that the executive order will not apply to Mo and we are grateful to the FCO for urgently clarifying the situation, a representative for Farah told the BBC. Mo is relieved that he will be able to return to his family once his current training camp concludes.
The representative added that Farah still fundamentally disagrees with this incredibly divisive and discriminatory policy.
On 1st January this year, Her Majesty the Queen made me a Knight of the Realm, Farah said in a statement earlier on Sunday. On 27th January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien.
Farah is Britains most successful track athlete, winning gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres at the London Olympics in 2012 and repeating the feat in 2016 in Rio, as well as at the World Championships in 2013 and 2015.
He is a British citizen, but his birthplace of Somalia is one of the seven countries subject to Trumps immigration restrictions.
The 33-year-old has been based in Portland, Oregon, for the past six years, where he said he had been working hard in training, paying taxes and bringing up his four children.
Its deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that daddy might not be able to come home - to explain why the president has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice, he said.
Trump announced a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and a temporary ban on travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, which he said would protect Americans from violent Islamists.
Farah said was been proud to represent Britain and to have received a knighthood from The Queen earlier this year. My story is an example of what can happen when you follow policies of compassion and understanding, not hate and isolation, he said.

Fashion Bug continues CSR  initiative with Sri Lanka Railways
Fashion Bug, one of Sri Lankas leading retail clothing chains with over 16 outlets island-wide,together with the Sri Lanka Railway Department recently refurbished signage and direction boards at the busiest train terminal, Fort Railway Station.
Fashion Bug has been involved in this annual initiative since 2013 and hopes to continue and commence many more similar projects in future.
These initiatives exhibit how private corporations contribute to public services, even in their least possible ways and the retail clothing chain has notably placed social responsibility at the core of its day to day operations including being a prioritized pillar in its corporate strategy.
"We feel obliged to give back to the society. The resources, time and funds invested in this extensive project was definitely a worthy investment considering the tens of thousands who would be guided and assisted by the sign and direction boards in their daily traveling to and forth," said Dr. S H M Faraaz, Deputy General Manager of Fashion Bug on this occasion.
The company spends millions on this initiative and completes the refurbishment within a two month time frame, with the cooperation extended to them by the authorities at the Sri Lanka Railway Department.
Fashion Bug spends over Rs. 20 million annually on various CSR projects that are carried out throughout the country, ranging from sports and education through to health, public services and beyond.
Additionally SisuDirimaga, an award winning CSR program by Fashion Bug, has successfully benefitted over 12,000 students as of today, and continues all the way till it achieves its goal of spreading amongst 120 schools and over 100,000 students across the country.

Follow in Virandas footsteps
Being the youngest competitor at the contest, and having faced extremely tough competition, Viranda Bandaras heart skipped a beat when she was announced as the Designer of the Year at the Chokolaate Mother Daughter Fashion Designer Contest for the year 2016.
Only sixteen years of age during the competition, Viranda was introduced to the competition when a teacher from her school, Gateway College, Rajagiriya, who had seen her sketches, suggested that she should give it a shot. After many rounds of competition, she found herself in the finale of the contest, which she ultimately won.
Viranda had always been very fashion-forward during her childhood. Dissatisfied with the clothes she found on the shelves which didnt quite suit her style, as a young girl, she took up the challenge of tweaking up the clothes that she bought into what she desired. Fortunate enough to be equipped with artistic abilities, she was known among friends for being able to sketch beautiful designs. It was while in the Art Society of her school that her teacher recognised her exceptional talent and told her about the Chokolaate Mother Daughter Fashion Contest.
Speaking of the competition, she was full of praise. It is the perfect opportunity for new, prospective fashion designers to have their first glimpse of the industry and slowly widen their horizons. All the competitors were very talented with designs of high standard. They were all very friendly, creating healthy competition, all-in-all.
The designers were expected to compete in three different segments: Sportswear, Casual Wear, and Evening Wear for awards. Besides the all-important Designer of the Year Award which she won, young Viranda was also the winner of the Sportswear segment.
Taking part in the competition during her O/L examination, attending all the training sessions and rehearsals was quite a challenge, she said. However, the experience she gained from the competition, the insights she received into the fashion industry, both modelling and designing was worth it.
Being the overall winner of the competition opened many doors for Viranda. She was offered many opportunities especially in her education. On a scholarship that she received because of her achievement, Viranda will soon be flying to Holmesglen Institute in Melbourne to pursue a foundation course in Fashion Designing, after which she will study for her Bachelors Degree. A commerce student while in school, Viranda hopes to one day own her own business with her very own designer brand focusing in Wedding Couture and lingerie.
Participating in the competition is no easy task. She expressed her gratitude towards her mother without whom her success would not have been possible. When she was unable to attend rehearsals due to her examination, her mother would go on her behalf and take care of the needs of her models. She was also grateful to her sister and brother-in law for helping her in every possible way.
As the winner of last years contest, she will have her own segment at this years finale. With Miss Sri Lanka 2016 as her model, she hopes to showcase some of her latest styles which she has designed after her scope of the fashion world increased post-competition.
I was just 16 when I took part and I ended up winning the contest. The competition is the perfect platform for anybody to take part. Regardless of your age, its worth giving a shot, says Viranda encouraging all those like her who aspire to be designers.
Applications for Chokolaate Mother Daughter Fashion Designer Contest 2017 are now open and will close on February 28. For more information and to obtain application forms please contact Michelle on 0777 224645 or visit the Chokolaate Facebook fan page www.facebook.com/chokolaate

Fuelled by Diesel
Vin Diesel has a penchant for adding fuel to any franchise hes attached to  if youll pardon the pun, and xXx is no different. True to form, xXx: Return of Xander Cage pushes the action to the max with extreme sports, gun fu, bike chases on land and on water, jumping off a plane with no parachute  to name only a few tropes. A treacherous villain, a sharpshooting sniper (Ruby Rose), a bumbling yet adorable hacker (Nina Dobrev), an enduring mentor (Samuel L. Jackson), and a charismatic DJ (Kris Wu) for the sheer heck of it; practically all the action movie clichs have been crammed into this flick to make it quite the spectacle.
The ethnically diverse cast is great for racial representation, yet the considerable talents of the ensemble arent exactly put on display. Donnie Yen is a legitimate Mixed Martial Arts fighter, as is Tony Jaa and even Micheal Bisping, but the fluidity of their fight sequences is stifled by the infuriating, twitchy editing technique that currently plagues Western action movies.
Choppy style
This choppy style is usually reserved for actors who cannot perform their own stunt work, so its an odd decision considering Yen and Jaa have repeatedly proved they can hold their own. Speaking of which, Deepika Padukones highly awaited Hollywood debut is refreshing - she has a significant role that she plays with ample confidence and without a forced American accent, who can throw down with the rest of the boys, showcasing an Indian heroine who has come a long way on the big screen.
Crowd-pleasing
One does not simply walk in to a Vin Diesel movie expecting compelling storytelling and thoughtful cinema, and although xXx exists in an alternate reality where the laws of physics simply dont apply, there are enough crowd-pleasing moments to distract you from a predictable plot and departure from logic. That said, the movie has enough star power to perform well enough, particularly in Asian markets, to ensure yet another insane outing soon.

Hayleys  Jeevadhara to improve rural livelihood with one million murunga plants
Committed to improving rural livelihoodand nutrition throughsustainable agriculturaldevelopment, Hayleys Agriculture the agriculture arm of the leading multinational conglomerate Hayleys PLC, launched the Jeevadhara programme to provide one million Moringa (Murunga/Drumstick/Moringa Oleifera) plants to families in Jaffna and neighboring areas of the Northern Province via a network of 100,000 out-growers.
Jeevadhara intends to enhance farmer incomes and livelihoods while creating a sustainable supply of pods and leaves for domestic consumption and value added exports. The project intends to reach 100,000 households in Jaffna, Killinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya providing around 10 plants per household.
The initial batch of one thousand farmers, were given 10,000 Moringa plants at a handing over ceremony at Navatkuli Maha Vidyalayam in Kaithady, Jaffna, in the presence of several key dignitaries of the region.

Considered natures gift to human-kind due to its many nutritional properties and traditionally grown in a small scale in Northern Sri Lanka for centuries,Moringa oleiferais catching on as a miracle tree with the leaves and pods classed as super-food, globally. Gram for gram, Moringa is known to have two times the protein of plain yogurt, four times the calcium of milk, 25 times the iron of spinach, four times the vitamin A of carrots, and seven times the vitamin C of oranges.
Hayleys Agriculture is confident that a farmer could earn an additional income of around LKR 50,000/- per year from 10 mature trees.
Hayleys Chairman Mohan Pandithage said the Jeevadhara programme underscores the Groups philosophy of continuously engaging and supporting local communities to help improve their lives and livelihoods.
The agro ecological conditions in the North, where Jeevadhara is being rolled out, is conducive for Moringa cultivation said Mr. Rizvi Zaheed, Managing Director of Hayleys Agriculture Holdings and so we found a natural fit to have home-owners in and around the Jaffna peninsula to make the cultivation commercially viable for them he explained.
Moreover, Moringa can provide an initial harvest in six to eight months. It is fast-growing, drought tolerant and the tree remains evergreen with exceptionally nutritious leaves, pods and roots. From the root of the plant to the leaf, every part is valuable. added Zaheed. Hayleys Agriculture will engage with government institutions, university and research agencies and community based organizations to support the Jeevadhara programme.

Hollywood courts China
One of the most breathtaking visual stylists of our time, Zhang Yimou (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) directs the Universal Pictures and Legendary Pictures action-fantasy The Great Wall, marking his first English-language production and the largest film ever shot entirely in China.
In the film, when a mercenary warrior (Matt Damon) is imprisoned within The Great Wall, he discovers the mystery behind one of the greatest wonders of our world. As wave after wave of marauding beasts, intent on devouring the world, besiege the massive structure, his quest for fortune turns into a journey toward heroism as he joins a huge army of elite warriors to confront this unimaginable and seemingly unstoppable force.
Zhang Yimou is one of the planets most celebrated filmmakers. Among his two dozen feature credits, he directed the first Chinese production to earn a Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award nomination, Ju Dou (1990), with two more nominations for Raise the Red Lantern (1991) and Hero (2002).
Among many career triumphs, he won global accolades for his magnificent staging of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympiad, a feat that fan and fellow filmmaker Steven Spielberg called the grandest spectacle of the New Millennium from this creative genius. That accomplishment landed Zhang as runner-up for Time magazines 2008 Person of the Year.
Producer Charles Roven raves, The Great Wall has all the visual splendor and spectacle of an extravagant film, and it is shot amazingly by one of the most iconic filmmakers working today. His visuals are stunning, the colors that he uses are incredible, and the shots that he designs-whether theyre regular 24 frames or slow-motion-are art.
Roven also appreciated that Zhang Yimou embraced the throughline of cultural collaboration that permeated the story. Watching Yimou, with his cinematic vision, translate the script into a unique way of creating spectacle is an unforgettable memory. He was quite interested in blending the cinema styles of Western tent-poles with Chinese filmmaking, notes Roven. Here was material that was completely conducive to it, and we were thrilled that he wanted to join the production.
The Great Wall is in the lyrics of our National Anthem, so it symbolizes the same thing in the heart of all Chinese, which is our people, our country and our history, reflects Zhang Yimou. We use it to express many things spiritual. To all of us in China, The Great Wall is a symbol of Chinas national spirit. It resonates in every Chinese person, as a symbol of our traditions and our flesh-and-blood.
The filmmaker believes that applies to this story as well. In the movie, The Great Wall symbolizes the safeguard of peace and national spirit, he continues. I thought the screenplay was a special story, especially when you look at The Wall from a different angle. The Wall was built to protect our homeland from invaders. From this perspective, it makes little difference whether the enemy is people or monsters.
For Zhang Yimou, to mount this undertaking would be to celebrate enormous pride. This is a movie about Chinese history and culture shot entirely on location in China, he reflects. What attracted me most was the Chinese cultural elements. Yes, it is a monster movie, but I believed I could still express myself through it. It is a fascinating story with interesting themes and emotions.

The Great Wall 3D will be screening from February 3 at Savoy Premier, Excel Cinema, Vista Lite, Liberty Lite, Sky Lite Malabe and Sky Lite Matara

The Justice Ministry every year receives a large number of complaints on JPs' misconduct. Charging money for services is one, Justice Ministry Additional Secretary Sunil Samaraweera said.
According to Samaraweera, some JPs come to Colombo and loiter around the court complex.
"Some others travel in three-wheelers and charge money for their services from the public. JPs are volunteers and should not do any of these things," he said. JPs should certify relatives' documents and not sign documents outside their assigned areas. They should not display the sign of the state opposite their homes, on their rubber stamp or anywhere else. They should resign from the service if they do not carry out their duties properly, Samaraweera said.
Justice Minister Coordinating Secretary Dasun Nagassena said an inspection will be carried out on the conduct of JPs to make sure that they do their job properly and serve the people as expected by the state. The system is already in place at district level, he said.

According to the gossip site TMZ, all three artists object to the award shows representation. Neither Bieber (who has four nominations) norDrake(who has eight) find the awards relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers, according to TMZs sources.
Meanwhile, West  who has criticised the lack of diversity at the Grammys  is reportedly upset that he has received 21 Grammys but never when he was head-to-head against a white singer. West had already said he may not attend the ceremony if Frank Ocean wasnt nominated. Ocean, however, chose not to submithis last album, Blonde, for consideration.
Speaking to the New York Times in November, Ocean said: It just doesnt seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from and hold down what I hold down.
He added: I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated. Id rather this be myColin Kaepernick momentfor the Grammys than sit there in the audience.

Lankas growth to remain  stagnant at 5% till 2020 - IPS
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) program has been successful in helping Sri Lanka to sort out its fiscal problems, but the program has not been successful in getting the country into a more stable position of the external front, Institute of Policy Studies Deputy Director Dr. Dushni Weerakoon said.
Weerakoon said Sri Lanka has very thin policy levers with regard to exchange rate management.
Sri Lanka is exposed to any kind of external shocks with four months of import cover and the country needs an urgent injection of foreign capital.
The potential for external shocks has also increased with the global political situation and sudden spike in oil prices, Weerakoon noted.
The IMF program in Sri Lanka is more of a stabilisation program which looks at fiscal targets and inflation targets to rebalance the macro economic stability.
In terms of medium term macro framework, it is very clear that growth is expected to remain stagnant at 5% during the 2016 to 2020 period .
She also emphasized that Sri Lanka needs to adopt broad-based economic reforms to restart economic growth; Otherwise, Sri Lanka may have an extended period of low growth in a low inflationary environment.

LAUGFS Eco Sri expands  87th VET Centre in Moratuwa
Further expanding its islandwide coverage, LAUGFS Eco Sri recently launched its 87th Fixed Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) centre in Moratuwa.
The new VET center will service motorists in the Moratuwa and surrounding suburbs, providing them with the convenience of hassle-free vehicle emission testing.
The event took place with the participation of Eco Sri DGM - Administration, Daham De Silva, together with the Management team. Speaking on the launch of this newest centre and its benefits to the environment, De Silva explained, The establishment of a VET center in Moratuwa will allow motorists with the convenience of fast and easy access to vehicle emission testing in a more efficient and comfortable setting. Not only will this centre save motorists valuable time, it will also expedite the testing process and ensure vehicles are accurately assessed. Our aim is to provide faster, more convenient service for motorists not only to obtain their VET certifications, but also to create awareness on the importance of effective maintenance of vehicles to improve performance efficiency in terms of improved petrol consumption, enhanced engine performance, reduced maintenance costs and increased vehicle durability.
Elaborating on the importance of obtaining regular emission testing certifications, De Silva further added, The mandatory vehicle emission testing program is implemented and monitored by the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) in collaboration with Air Resource Management Centre (AirMAC) and the Ministry of Environment. We believe this plays a critical role in enhancing the quality of air in Sri Lanka, which is increasingly becoming polluted due to high number of vehicles operating in the country. By keeping the levels of vehicle emissions under control, we are also able to mitigate health risks such as respiratory hazards, while contributing to environmental preservation. Therefore, we urge all motorists to be more mindful of emissions and carry out regular maintenance of vehicles to ensure emissions are minimized. He further added, its not possible for us corporates or the government alone to do this task, but it requires a voluntary action from motorists to keep their vehicles emission levels down.
Eco Sri, a subsidiary of LAUGFS Gas PLC, is a pioneer in air quality management in Sri Lanka. Since the opening of the countrys first ever vehicle emission testing center in Gampaha in 2008, it has expanded rapidly with 87 fixed VET centers and 27 mobile testing units, serving over 150 locations across the country.

He was speaking to the media after attending a school equipment distribution ceremony at Bogaswewa, Vavuniya on January 28. Wijewardane said the two main political parties had joined hands to form a consensus government to resolve the problems of the people.
The Joint Opposition would be performing a great service towards the country and the people if it assisted in this noble endeavour without trying to disrupt this good intention, he said.
The best national service at this crucial moment in the countrys history would be for all parties and groups to join in the endeavour to resolve longstanding national problems and ensure better living conditions for the people. It was the greed for power which led certain parties and groups to disrupt the countrys forward march, Wijewardane said.

Mel Gibson staged a major Hollywood comeback with his World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge bagging a surprise six nominations, signaling that the industry has finally forgiven the actor-director for his many controversies including his infamous anti-Semitic.
The 61-year-old blue-eyed actor, who created an impressive filmography as an actor by starring in action franchise Lethal Weapon, What Women Want and Mad Max, easily morphed into one of the most talented directors in Hollywood by helming critically-acclaimed films like Bravheart, The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto.
However, it all came crashing down with Gibsons DUI arrest in 2006, during which he unleashed a drunken tirade capped with anti-Semitic comments against the police officer.
He was later sentenced to three years probation. Many saw the rants as a potential career suicide for the actor but that was followed by another embarrassment on the personal front when his abusive phone call to ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva became public.
Gibson was barred from going near Grigorieva or their daughter by a restraining order, and later plead no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge. He apologised for his anti-Semitic rant and found support in many in the industry as he starred in Beaver, a small-budget drama directed by Jodie Foster.
His latest directorial venture Hacksaw Ridge tells the story of conscientious objector Desmond Doss and how he saved 75 people during the Battle of Okinawa. It has racked up six total nominations best picture, best director, best actor (Andrew Garfield), film editing, sound mixing, and sound editing.
Hacksaw Ridge is Gibsons fifth directorial effort, following The Man Without a Face, Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto. The Hollywood Reporter

Miss France crowned Miss Universe
THE PHILIPPINES: Miss France was crowned Miss Universe on Monday in a made-for-television spectacle free of last year's dramatic mix-up but with a dash of political controversy as the finalists spoke out on the refugee crisis and other hot-button global issues.
Iris Mittenaere, a dental surgery student from Lille in the north of France, beat 85 of the world's most beautiful women at the event in the Philippines scheduled for primetime viewing in the United States.
Mittenaere, 24, edged out Miss Haiti, the first runner-up, and Miss Colombia the second runner-up.
In the final question round, Miss France highlighted the benefits of open borders when asked about the global refugee crisis.
"In France we want to have the most globalisation that we can. We want to have the biggest exchange of people that we can.
Maybe someday that will change but now we have open borders," Mittenaere said.
"Having open borders allows us to travel more through the world and to find out more about what's out there in the world."
Miss Kenya, another finalist, said Donald Trump's presidency "may not have been the choice of many people" and divided the United States.
She also spoke out in support of former US president Barack Obama and said she backed Hillary Clinton to be America's first woman President.
"I feel once he took up his position, he was able to unify the entire nation," said Mary Esther Were, 27.
Miss Colombia appeared to allude to Trump when asked why violence was prevalent in the world.
"Although there are presidents who don't get along with others, we work together to unite. Campaigns, respect and inclusivity to be able to have a social transformation that would educate our children," said Andrea Tovar, 23.
Monday's show was headlined by US performers including Grammy award-winning rhythm and blues group Boyz II Men and rapper and Grammy award nominee Flo Rida.
Pia Wurtzbach of the Philippines won last year following a major blunder in which the host -- Emmy Award winner Steve Harvey -- mistakenly awarded the title to Miss Colombia.
Harvey corrected the error minutes later, apologising on air to Wurtzbach and Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutierrez.
The mistake featured prominently on Monday's show, with candidates and the home audience often ribbing Harvey about it.
"Steve, I never got to thank you but thank you for making me the most popular Miss Universe," Wurtzbach told Harvey at the opening of show.
Harvey this year got through the closing moments of the ceremony smoothly.
The Philippines agreed to host the pageant as part of efforts to draw tourists and investors.
Beauty pageants are also hugely popular in the Philippines, particularly among the tens of millions of poor who see the contests as a chance for their beautiful compatriots to live a life of fame and luxury.
But allowing the Philippines to host has proved controversial, with critics claiming the pageant would whitewash Duterte's brutal drug war, which has left more than 6,000 people dead.
Environmentalists also hit out at pageant organisers for letting the bikini-clad contestants swim last month with endangered whale sharks.
Despite the controversies, excited fans from across the globe lined up before dawn to watch the pageant, which was held in the morning Manila time for the coveted prime American evening viewing audiences.
Fans dressed in evening gowns with a sash took selfies outside the seaside arena where the competition was held while others organised viewing parties in hotels and restaurants in the capital.
