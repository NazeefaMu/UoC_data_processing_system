Delhiites urged to accept controversial car ban plan

NEW DELHI: Delhi's firebrand Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called on residents of India's capital Thursday to cooperate with his ambitious plans to clean up the toxic air of the world's most polluted city.
His plea came as the city's government gave final details of a trial plan announced this month which will only allow car users to drive on alternate days for the first two weeks of January.
"Pollution is becoming a very serious problem... And it's a problem that all of us need to solve together," Kejriwal said at a press conference at his New Delhi residence.
"We have to make this a movement, a people's movement. We cannot implement this with the fear of punishment," he added.
Under the scheme any cars with odd-numbered licence plates will only be allowed to drive in the capital on odd-numbered dates and those with even-numbered plates on the others.
Traffic police and 10,000 volunteers will monitor cars at checkpoints across the city and violators will be fined 2,000 rupees ($30) -- extremely steep for the average resident.
The government will also add thousands more buses to bolster creaking public transport in the city, where more than 8.5 million vehicles jostle for space and 1,400 new cars are added daily.
It has ordered schools to close saying it needs to co-opt school buses to help people travel to work.
"My family and I are not exempted from anything," the activist-turned-politician said, adding that he and his ministers would carpool.
The ban, which runs from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm, has several exemptions -- it will not apply on Sundays, and exempts dozens including dignitaries, women driving alone or with young children, and motorcycles.
It has met a mixed response, with many looking forward to the novelty of congestion-free roads and clearer skies while others, especially in Delhi's vast commuter belt, complain that getting to work will be impossible.
Sceptics have said Delhiites will deploy the famed Indian skill of "jugaad" -- creating a cheap alternative solution -- by forging number plates or buying second-hand cars.
But Kejriwal's deputy, Manish Sisodia, urged Delhi residents to swallow the scheme as "a bitter pill right now rather than die from breathing this poison". The Indian capital is ranked as the most polluted globally in a World Health Organization survey of more than 1,600 cities.
The city has been shrouded in a toxic blanket of smog in recent weeks as winter sets in, cutting visibility and pushing PM 2.5 levels more than 10 times over the WHO's recommended safe limit. AFP

Mali pro-govt armed group accuses France of killing four fighters

BAMAKO: A pro-government armed group in Mali accused the French military on Wednesday of killing four of its fighters during a weekend clash with an Al-Qaeda-linked movement in the country's restive north.
The French defence ministry said on Tuesday that its Barkhane force killed or captured around 10 Al-Murabitoun jihadists in heavy fighting.
But Mohamed Ould Mataly, a senior figure in the pro-Bamako Movement of Azawad (MAA) militia, said four of his men had lost their lives under French fire, despite nominally being on the same side. "This weekend, near Meneka, the French army killed four of our fighters," Ould Mataly told AFP.
"They call it 'collateral damage'. These are our people who have been killed. And what is really serious now is that (they) do not want us to go near the area," he added.
The MAA is one component of a coalition of armed groups calling itself the "Platform" which supports the central government as it attempts to enact a peace deal to end decades of conflict.
"After introducing ourselves and welcoming Barkhane (French) forces as friends, a Platform outpost came under fire from these forces, causing several deaths and injuries and leaving others still missing," a statement from the coalition said.
"The Platform, while condemning religious extremism, attacks and terrorist provocations of all kinds, calls on international forces to act with discernment in order to avoid confusion and any further deterioration of an already difficult situation," the statement said.
A French military source, who asked not to be named, denied the coalition's accusations when questioned by AFP. AFP

## Title: Not such a merry Christmas in Bethlehem this year

Not such a merry Christmas in Bethlehem this year
BETHLEHEM, WEST BANK: The city celebrated as the birthplace of Jesus is usually filled with parades and parties this time of year. There are fireworks, carollers, feasts. Revellers drink a little wine. They dance.
This year It's not exactly like Christmas was cancelled, but it is a sombre, dutiful affair.
"It's a sad Christmas to be honest," said Nabil Giacaman, a Palestinian Christian and owner of a souvenir shop, who a few days before the holiday hadn't bothered to decorate his store.
"I'm just not in the mood," he said.
The Palestinian leadership decided to tone down the celebrations this year out of respect for the dead.
Since the beginning of October, there has been a surge in Palestinian assaults against Israelis, accompanied by tough countermeasures at the scene of the attacks and at clashes between rock-throwing demonstrators and Israeli forces.
Eighteen Israelis have been killed by Palestinians using knives, automobiles and guns. Some 125 Palestinians have been shot dead - 81 during assaults and 44 during violent demonstrations.
Four of the dead came from Bethlehem, including a 13-year-old boy, Abdel Rahman Obeidallah, who was killed by a sniper's bullet to the chest. Israeli officials have suggested that the killing was a mistake.
Israel has so far refused to return two of the bodies of the Bethlehem dead, saying they will be celebrated by the Palestinians as martyrs when they should be condemned as terrorists.
The violence here and elsewhere has also reduced the number of pilgrims and tourists, both international visitors and Palestinian Christians who come from Israel and the West Bank.
"We had the most famous bar in Bethlehem. We had to close it down" because there wasn't enough business, said Johnny Kattan, a manager at Jacir Palace Hotel, a luxury property that has the misfortune of being located a few hundred yards from an Israeli military checkpoint that is the target of violent demonstrations.
There's often burning tires and tear gas fired right outside the hotel. This week, the sidewalks outside the lobby still smelled of the odious "skunk water" that Israeli soldiers spray to disperse rock-throwing crowds.
The hotel's gala Christmas dinner was also cancelled.
"We're booked at maybe 50 per cent, but we should be 110 per cent during Christmas," Kattan said. The number of tourists to Bethlehem in October and November were half the number of previous years.
It's not just the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that's keeping visitors away, Kattan said. "It's the Paris attacks, it's the tensions between Russia and Turkey, it's the crash of the Russian plane," the Metrojet flight that crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in late October after a bomb went off, killing all 224 passengers and crew.
"We've lost the Russians," Kattan said, who were known in Bethlehem to be big spenders.
Although the parties were cancelled, the religious events will go on. They lit the Christmas tree in Manger Square last week, but instead of the usual fireworks, the churches rang their bells. The annual procession from Jerusalem's Old City to Bethlehem will proceed. "Pilgrims should not be afraid to come," Fuad Twal, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, said in his Christmas message. "Despite the tense situation in this land, the pilgrim route is safe and they are respected and appreciated by all sectors in the Holy Land."
There will be a Christmas Eve Mass at the Church of the Nativity, the 1700-year-old basilica built above the grotto where tradition says Jesus was born and visited by Bethlehem shepherds.
Earlier this week, Bethlehem Mayor Vera Baboun was watching work crews erect a stage at Manger Square.
"The Israelis are suffocating us," she said. "The city of peace has no peace."
The mayor complained that Israel was taking more land to complete the separation wall at Bethlehem's perimeter. The Jerusalem City Council also approved the construction of 891 units in Gilo, a Jewish settlement that abuts Bethlehem.
Earlier Baboun, herself a Christian, defended the Palestinian leadership's decision to play down the festivities. "At Christmas we celebrate life, but this year we must show respect for our dead."
For their part, Israeli officials say the Palestinian leadership has done nothing to stem the violence or dissuade the young from committing attacks.
At Manger Square, a group of Palestinian activists erected a "resistance tree", the living trunk of an ancient olive tree bulldozed by the Israeli army. They've decorated their tree with empty tear gas canisters fired by Israeli troops. "All we want for Christmas is the end of the occupation," said Marwa Fararjeh, one of the activists.
Earlier this month, a group of Palestinians dressed up as Santa Clauses, ringing bells and wearing gas masks, confronted Israeli troops at the separation wall in Bethlehem. The Santas offered the troops candy, but eventually the crowd began throwing rocks. The demonstrators and Santas were dispersed with tear gas.
At the Church of the Nativity, often packed with visitors, a tour guide led a group from Singapore right to the shrine that marks the manger where tradition says Jesus of Nazareth was born. "Usually we have to wait three hours to get here," the guide told his charges. He urged them to take their time and pray. "Many miracles have happened here," he said.
Anthony Tay knelt and prayed. Then he and his fellow pilgrims sang When a Child is Born. Tay said the violence of recent months should not keep people away. But he said it was sad that the Israelis and Palestinians could not make peace.
"You wonder when it will end," Tay said and sighed. "All we can do is pray for them and pray for peace."

Sydney photographers give Christmas present to homeless family

AUSTRALIA: Wildlife photographers Chris and Jess Bray had just landed on the tarmac at Sydney Airport when they got an email from Dick Smith.
The couple, from Avalon in Sydney's northern beaches, keep in contact with the businessman and philanthropist as they travel around the world taking photos. They were almost home after running a photo safari in the Galapagos Islands and the Amazon when Mr Smith's email proposed a new adventure: go to India to find a homeless family he saw from a train several weeks earlier.
"Chris looked at me and said 'do you want to go to India' I was like 'sure'," Mrs Bray said with a laugh.
Smith, the 71-year-old businessman who has become known for his philanthropy, was on a trip to the Indian state of Gujarat with his wife Pip early in December when his train was stopped for around 20 minutes under a bridge in the city of Vadodara.
From the carriage, he watched as a family who lived there went about their daily life. He was drawn to an eight-year-old girl who wore nothing except a pink bracelet.
Taking out his phone, Smith took a photo of the family, a picture of a nearby billboard, and noted the location on Google Maps so he could help the family some time in the future.
After his email, Chris and Jess Bray accepted his challenge.
The pair travelled to India, arriving on December 15, and set aside a week to search for the little girl who was quite literally one in a billion.
The photographs detail how the couple emailed ahead and asked friends of friends for contacts in the area who could help locate the family.
With the help of a local bank manager and a professor from a nearby university, they managed to find the bridge and locate the young girl on their second day in Vadodara.
They learned Divya, whose name means 'divine light', was born under the bridge where she lives with her parents Krishna and Naresh and her two younger brothers. Though Naresh worked hard as a plasterer, his wage wasn't enough to rent a house, and they had lived there for 12 years.
When Naresh arrived home from work, the photographers made their generous offer: to pay for the family to move into a house, deposit rent money into a bank account for at least two years, and give them school supplies, tools and clothes.
The family agreed.
Over the next two days, Mr and Mrs Bray opened a bank account for Divya, depositing the equivalent of three months' rent ($417), and drew up a contract saying it could only be used for rent and education.
Then they took the family shopping for clothes, shoes, school supplies and plastering tools which would help Naresh earn more money.
On Facebook, they described the experience as "amazing" and "life-changing". For his part, Smith said he was "amazed" the Brays were able to find the family he briefly saw weeks earlier.
"In the past I've tried to help people in developing countries but we've never been able to get anywhere because it's almost impossible to find the people or to find a way of assisting them," Mr Smith said.
"It was extraordinary that they actually found the little girl who lived under the railway bridge, purely because she had a pink band on her right wrist."

Divya was attending school erratically while she lived under the bridge, but her family said with stable accommodation she would attend every day from now on.
The search for the family was covered by The Times of India, after someone who helped with the search suggested it might inspire others to be similarly generous.
After their whirlwind trip, the Brays arrived back in Sydney on December 20.
Mr Smith said it was wonderful to help the family out just before Christmas. He has pledged he will support them for at least two years and has offered to pay for tutoring for Divya if she needs it.
"It's so wonderful that the girl's family now have a chance of some definite income, and instead of having to remain under the railway bridge to be able to get into some reasonable accommodation," he said.
"It's wonderful that we've been able to help this young family at Christmas time, because it's a time of giving and helping people."
