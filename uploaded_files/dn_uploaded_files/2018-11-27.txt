Central Bank scam
Wimal urges President to release names
Housing and Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa has requested President Maithripala Sirisena to disclose the list of names connected to the Central Bank Bond Scam, so far not released, for the public to know them.
Addressing a public meeting held yesterday at Homagama Town, Minister Weerawansa said that he would also request the President to disclose the outcome of Presidential Commission Reports on the conflicting situations both in Dharga Town Aluthgama, and Teldeniya in Kandy.
He said as in the days of the British Monarch controlling the affairs of Sri Lanka, those following in their footstepps, try to impose their will in our decision making. But we are no more colony under the British Empire but a sovereign state, the Minister said.
They are trying to change government here by changing heads from one side to the other. But it would be a futile effort on their part, he added. Minister Weerawansa also criticised the attempts made to interested parties to promulgate a Federal Constitution and touching on the current administration he emphasised that what Sri Lanka has at present is a temporary government and Ranil, Sumanthiran and the clan know not what they talk.
Referring to the present state UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe is in, Minister Weerawansa said that he feels sorry for not even Sajith Premadasa uttered a word in favour of him, but only Anura Dissanayake of the JVP and Sumanthiran of the TNA speaks on behalf of him.
Addressing those present, Minister Weerawansa asked whether the three and a half year government under the Premiership of Ranil, they got everything that he had promised to deliver in political platforms. He pointed out that under the UNF led government, Hambantota was given to foreigners and if had continued to rule, he would have given the Mattala Airport, the Kankasanthurai Port; Palali Airport, Trincomalee Harbour, East Terminal of the Colombo Harbour, all Expressways and permission would have been given to foreigners to claim ownership of land.

Working magic!
Even if you have visited Yosemite National Park dozens of times, youve probably never seen Yosemite Falls like this.
A video shot on Oct. 30, 2017, shows the famous falls transformed into a cascading rainbow by unusually strong winds.
Photographer Greg Harlow told Cater News Agency that he and a buddy were sipping coffee at Glacier Point while waiting to shoot the classic view at sunrise. Suddenly they glimpsed a flash of red at the falls.
First it was red, then it worked its way across the spectrum to a full rainbow, Harlow said. We were two of only about ten people to witness this. The spot was empty because it was so windy that morning.
The extremely high winds, rare for Yosemite Valley, buffeted the waterfall, creating clouds of spray just as the sun began to rise. The diffraction of low rays of sunlight hitting water droplets resulted in a undulating rainbow extending the entire length of the 1,450-foot waterfall.
Multi-tiered Yosemite Falls, recharged by rain and snowmelt, and photographed from Sentinel Meadow, is one of several waterfalls that has turned Yosemite Valley into the showpiece of the world.
Small waterfall rainbows are often seen in the mist kicked up by Yosemites Vernal Falls, but a rainbow of this magnitude on Yosemite Falls is rare indeed.We lost it when we saw what was happening. It was beautiful, Harlow said.
Harlow, who travels year round to shoot images of natural beauty year round, called it the most jaw dropping moment of my career so far. SF Gate

You can now pay to attend a strangers Indian weddings
Weddings are generally considered personal events reserved for family and friends, but some couples in India are more than happy to have total strangers from all over the world attend their traditional weddings, for a fee.
Paying hundreds of dollars to attend the wedding of two total strangers in a foreign country may seem strange to some, but according to JoinMyWedding, a company specializing in wedding tourism, its the ultimate cultural immersion for tourists looking to experience as many elements of Indian culture in the shortest time possible. Clients get to put on traditional Indian clothing, taste exotic food, witness and take part in beautiful wedding customs, and soak up the unique atmosphere. As for the couples getting married, they get to share the happiest day of their lives not just with family and friends, but with the world and make some extra money in the process.
If you think about it, theres nothing more cultural than a wedding because you have every cultural element present: The local people, local food, customs, the outfit, the music, basically every cultural element is right there, Orsi Parkanyi, the founder of JoinMyWedding, told CNBC.
Experiencing all the cultural elements at once, meaningfully connecting with the locals in India, thats a huge motivating factor for the travelers, the Australian entrepreneur added. Its a safe experience. You attend an event with hundreds of people, youre a distinguished guest, people look after you.
Tourists interested in attending a traditional Indian wedding through JMW have to pay a fee of $150 for one days attendance, or $250 for two days, which covers the entrance to the wedding plus food and drinks, as well as a a dedicated person to welcome them and explain all the traditional customs. Transportation to the wedding, accommodation and traditional costume rentals are extra.
While the idea of attending the wedding of strangers takes some getting used, wedding tourism in India is a growing business, and Parkanyi says that demand among tourists all over the world is high.
The first time that we got tourists to attend an Indian wedding was two years ago and since then we have helped scores of international travelers  around 100 at least  attend over 25 weddings in India, she told India Times. The demand is growing. There are hundreds of travelers who we know are keen to attend these weddings.So, would you be interested in selling tickets to your wedding to tourists Oddity Central

New measures to strengthen rupee, spur investment
The new government will take meaningful measures to reverse the negative trend on the Sri Lankan rupee and appreciate it to Rs. 160 in 2019 and by 2020 bring it up to Rs. Rs. 140, said Minister of International Trade and Investment Bandula Gunawardana. He added that they are also working towards appreciating it to Rs. 160 against the Dollar within a year.
He said that the appreciation of the US dollar is not something that is happening in Sri Lanka and the present political scenario is not related to it.
The Minister also said that the new government is not only keen to encourage foreign direct investments but also egg on local entrepreneurs to invest in Sri Lanka. The government would offer series of tax holidays and other encouragement especially to those approved by the Finance Ministry to woo FDI to Sri Lanka. This is the best solution to control the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee.
A special tax holiday of five years would be given to investments approved by the Finance Ministry, he said. The minister said that Sri Lankans based overseas were reluctant to remit their hard earned money back to Sri Lanka fearing that unwanted taxes would be imposed on them. We estimate that more than $ 8 billion has not been disclosed due to those tax policies.
The recently imposed taxes that discouraged people from sending remittances back to Sri Lanka would be taken off in the next Appropriations Bill, he said. The minister said that tax concessions would also be offered to imported raw materials for apparel products, including machinery.
He also said that local entrepreneurs too had second thoughts to re-invest due to high and uncalled-for taxes and these too would be removed and a special incentive package would be spelled out soon.

Legislature at loggerheads with Executive
All eyes on SC to resolve crisis
All eyes are set upon the Supreme Court now to resolve the existing rift between the legislative arm and the executive arm of the government, political analysts, social engagers, intellectuals, critics and top notch politicians yesterday said.
They said neither the legislative arm, that is Parliament nor the executive arm, whose head is the President, are unable to resolve the present crisis, therefore all eyes are on the Supreme Court to resolve the current crisis.
The people of this country will look at the Supreme Courts with high hopes that it will give due consideration to where those two pillars of democracy, the legislature and the executive are emanating from, which is sovereignty of the people, they said.
The 225 representatives in Parliament are at their wits end and Parliament is in a blind alley with the conduct of the Speaker in disarray, they pointed out.
An election would be inevitable, said senior politicians and social engagers. The situation, however, would have been different, had the Speaker got his act together and had respected the countrys Parliamentary traditions.
He has turned Sri Lankas Parliament into a United National Party rally, said Minister Gamini Lokuge. According to international law Prof. Dinesh K.Gunasekara, Speaker Jayasuriya is conducting an international Parliament for foreign ambassadors.
The Speaker has worsened the situation by having sessions in Parliament following the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court to suspend the dissolution of Parliament by the President. The Courts granted leave to proceed until they hear the case on December 2, 3 and 4, and pass a verdict on December 7.
Judicial officer of the European Court of Law, Prof Gunasekara asked what if the Supreme Courts decided to dismiss the petition and allowed implementation of the dissolution of Parliament on the coming days.
Who will take the responsibility for all those chaos created in Parliament and tensions created in the country up to now he questioned.
Foreign Affairs analyst and critic Mohan Samaranayaka said, the countrys Parliament should be dissolved without delay for the reason that almost all the public representatives in there, have become partly or fully sold out.
An election must be given to the people to select their representatives as there is hardly any representation of the people in Parliament as of today, he said.
The country is now in a quagmire, that the judiciarys deliberations and its verdict on FR petition on the dissolution of Parliament by the President is of great consequence to the stability of the country.

BARRIER FROM OPPOSITION TO ITS OWN NCM
A Writ petition submitted by 122 Members of the Opposition against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Cabinet of Ministers yesterday, prayed the Court of Appeal to issue an order in the nature of Quo Warranto declaring that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has no right to hold the Office of Premiership, has prevented Parliament arguing the No Confidence Motion.
Giving his studied opinion on this issue Prof. Prathibha Mahanama said that when matters are referred to courts for consideration such maters could not be discussed in Parliament.
If one does, it could be interpreted as intervening to courts, the Professor. said.
The Court of Appeal yesterday(26) considered the petition submitted by the UNP, TNA, JVP, SLMC and numbering signatures of altogether 122 Members of Parliament. The petition was considered by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena (President) and Justice Arjuna Obeysekera and it to be taken up for further consideration on November 30 and December 3 respectively.
The Court also ordered lawyers appearing for the petitioners to provide copies relevant to the case filed, to the defendants prior to the next hearing date. The petition submitted to courts has stated that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa does not command a majority in Parliament and hence in relation to amended Article 13 of the Constitution, Rajapaksa does not have the right to hold the post of Premiership.
Thus, the petitioners have prayed to courts to declare that Mahinda Rajapaksa has no right to hold office of Premiership legally and to issue orders nullifying his appointment to the post invalid. Petitioners have sited 49 persons including Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The very same group that petitioned Courts against Mahinda Rajapaksa holding Office as Premier is scheduled to take up the No Confidence Motion (NCM) tabled against the Prime Minister when Parliament meets on November 29 and we posed this question to Prof. Prathibha Mahanama, to get his view as to how the two institutions operate in this scenario.Prof. Mahanamas studied view was that Parliament would not table the No Confidence Motion.
Parliamnt has to wait until the court gives its verdict, the Professor said.Clarifying why he said so, the Professor reasoned out that when an issue is before Court for consideration, no discussions were held in Parliament. In the present context, the Courts will not entertain an issue to be taken up in Parliament for discussion, he opined.
In accordance with the Sri Lanka Constitution, it prevents Courts from examining, inquiring and ordering, issues that are related to Parliament. At the same time the petitioners have not properly worded the No Confidence Motion, tabled in Parliament.
The decision in respect of the said No Confidence Motion is purely an act of Parliament and Not of the Judiciary. Although former Chief Justice Sarath N.Silva ordered Parliament to reduce the price of petrol, it was very clearly manifested that Parliament took no note of it, Prof. Mahanama said.
Also, the Sri Lanka Parliament ignored a request of the Supreme Court in respect of a former Lady Chief Justice. In the same breath, one must know that Parliament has no powers to give orders to the Courts, Prof. Mahanama explained, as such actions tally with the fundamentals of the Constitutional law.

Champions Australia already eyeing home soil T20 defence
SYDNEY: Australias women cricketers are already eyeing the defence of their World Twenty20 crown on home soil after cruising to victory over England, with skipper Meg Lanning saying their focus must now be on consistency.
Their eight-wicket win in Antigua on Saturday was Australias fourth world title in the short-format and they are desperate to make it five when the tournament is next played in early 2020 at home.
The T20 World Cup is in Australia in 2020, which is going to be massive and I think weve shown that we can be the worlds best team, Lanning said Sunday. We want to be a very consistent cricket team and I think we have done that over the last few years without the success at world tournaments. So hopefully this win is sort of the start of something.
Weve really put together an amazing squad and support staff to be able to move the game forward and be part of the womens game, which is going to grow so much over the next couple of years, she added.
The popularity of womens cricket in Australia has soared in recent years and organisers of the next T20 World Cup are confident more than 90,000 fans will watch the final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Eight cities across Australia will host games.
All-rounder Ashleigh Gardner starred with bat and ball in Antigua with the English restricted to 105 all out off 19.4 overs. In reply, Australia reached the target with the loss of just two wickets in the 16th over.
Lanning said the win was particularly sweet after defeat in the 2016 T20 final in Kolkata and last years 50-over World Cup semi-final exit. AFP

Cheesy music
A cheese maker from the Emmental region of Switzerland has been experimenting with various musical genres to see if they can make his cheese taste better.
Since September, cheese maker Beat Wampfler has been blasting musical masterpieces by legends such as Led Zeppelin and A Tribe Called Quest to his wheels of Emmental cheese, hoping to prove that music can influence the development, characteristics and, most importantly, the flavor of the cheese. He is convinced that humidity, temperature and nutrients are not the only things that can have an impact on the taste of cheese, and that sounds, ultrasounds and music can make an impact on flavor as well.
While Wampflers idea may sound a bit crazy, he actually managed to get some scientists from the University of the Arts in Bern involved in his experiments. They were skeptical at first, but later learned that there was a field called sonochemistry that looks at the impact of sound on solid bodies and chemical reactions, and decided that the cheese maker may be on to something.
We are trying to answer the question: in the end is there anything measurable Or something that has an effect on the taste Michael Harenberg, a music director at the University of the Arts, told AFP.
To test out his theory, Beat Wampfler has been installing small speakers under the large wheels of Emmental cheese and split them into several groups, by musical genres. Some cheeses are aging to techno beats, others to ambient music, or classic pieces like Mozarts Magic Flute. The effects of rock and hip-hop on the taste of cheese are also being tested, with some wheels of cheese listening to Led Zeppelin or A Tribe Called Quest.
Will the cheese taste better Its hard to say, Wampfler said, adding that if it turns out that a certain music genre can make his Emmental taste better he hopes it will be hip-hop.
A jury of expert cheese tasters will assess the effect of the various musical genres on Wampflers wheels of Emmental cheese, next year, on March 15.

Foreign envoys fishing in troubled waters
With regard to the current political situation in Sri Lanka, last week, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Baronness Patricia Scotland had called the President and made inquiries. The President had clearly indicated that he had acted in accordance with the constitution.
The foreign envoys had been very inquisitive after the sacking of PM Ranil on October 26. Since then, they had meetings with Ranil, the Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition, the JVP and so on. Then followed by all this, this week, a comment made by the Canadian High Commissioner to MP Namal Rajapaksa had led to a furore.
This comment has drawn the attention of the Sri Lankan Envoy in Russia, Dr. Jayan Dayatillake. He had said that the Canadian High Commissioners reply shows interference in a domestic debate.
It is obvious that the so-called International Community would prefer Ranil as PM because PM Mahinda Rajapaksa is an ally of China. In this connection, people have noted that China and Russia never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries while the Western countries are notorious for fishing in troubled waters. They claim that their concern is to safeguard democracy. But how serious are they about safeguarding democracy For example, when Sri Lanka was threatened by the LTTE, so-called Sri Lankas allies of the West turned their back. It was countries like China and Pakistan which came to rescue Sri Lanka.
The International Community will not hesitate to bully smaller countries, but will never behave in the same way if it was India, Russia or China. This reminds of an incident that happened during the time of President Premadasa. In May 1991, just after the elections, the British High Commissioner David Gladstone took the upper hand and made some comments about conducting of the elections. President Premadasa deported him without much ceremony for interfering in local politics.

Cozy canine cottages
The lucky pups at Luvable Dog Rescue live in colorful, private cottages instead of cages. Founder Liesl Wilhardt builds the shelter dogs private cottages on her 55 acres of land in Eugene, Oregon. She thoroughly researched to learn what the most comfortable, healthy environment is for rescue dogs.
A quarantinable, private, quiet space is what she came up with.
Ive been doing this for a long time. It began as a labor of love and doing what I could afford on my own, Wilhardt told ABC News. I started with just fostering dogs in my home 17 years ago. This has been a long process evolving and I was able to do fundraising and donated a lot of my own resources and time and money.
I realized in researching what dogs needed to be happy; the standard requirements that exist. I realized that doing individual cottages can meet some of those requirements.
She decorates the cottages with upholstered furniture, paintings and televisions so the pups have background noise.
There is a local furniture store that donates used furniture called Edgewater, she explained. They donate furniture to families and friends and they do used televisions and radios. Dogs loves having the TV on. To hear human voices and have that background noise is great. We put artwork on the walls. We try and have upholstered furniture so its cozier for them.
We have flower boxes with flowers in the summer. We try to create a really cozy atmosphere because kennel stress is a really big stress for a dog. They can be fine when they get there and three months later theyre deteriorated. We have 55 acres of private trails for hiking and walking the dogs, she said. We have country roads to go down the road to see horses and chickens and goats. Were only 10 minutes from town so the dogs go for field trips to town.
There are six cottages in total for the 10 pit bulls, 24 little dogs and four litters of puppies at the shelter.
The mama cottage was for my mama, Wilhardt said of the bright, yellow cottage. When she died we started using it for pregnant dogs, for the mama pit bulls instead of my mama. We tiled the floors and made it into more a dog-friendly environment.
It takes a long time to find pit bulls homes, she added. Theres a much smaller pool of potential adopters for pit bulls. And then of course we have really strict standards of adopters. We dont want them to wind up in another bad environment. All of the adoptable dogs Wilhardt shelters were rescued from kill-shelters.

Shania Twain is writing a new tune for fellow Canadian Celine Dion. The country queen admits she has dreamed of Celine recording one of her tracks for years, and now she's so determined to make it happen she is writing songs she thinks Dion might like to call her own.
"One of my dreams has always been that she would record one of my songs. I'd love her to sing one of my songs," Twain told news show Entertainment Tonight. "I'm going to write one for her! I love her, she's extraordinary."
But she insists it won't be a duet, "I could write the song and she could sing it." Meanwhile, Shania is helping others achieve their dreams as a judge on new TV singing competition series Real Country, where the Man! I Feel Like a Woman singer, Jake Owen and Travis Tritt are hoping to find the next Carrie Underwood or Chris Stapleton.
"We've got so many great artists out there that need to be discovered," Twain, who also serves as executive producer on the show, explained. "We need to make room for them, especially for diversity. We need to make room for diversity. We need more women, stylistically, we have to take advantage of all the different styles that fall under country music. So this is my passion, Real Country."
Shania reveals stints as guest judge and mentor on American Idol and The Voice gave her the inspiration to create her own singing competition: "It gave me the bug," she confessed.

England handled tough situations well
Difference between the two teams was very little  Hathurusingha
Head coach Chandika Hathurusingha summarising the three-Test series against England which Sri Lanka lost 0-3 at the SSC grounds yesterday said that it was a very closely fought out series especially in the last two matches and fielding was one reason for his team to come second best.
The difference between the two teams was very little. I thought England handled tough situations well. Ben Stokes was the difference in the last two games I thought when things were going our way, said Hathurusingha. He was brilliant with the ball and on the field. He took the game away from us in both games. When we were 173 for one he took the initiative away from us. Our fielding is another reason for us to come second best in this series.
We are doing lot of work with regards to fielding. When you are saying fielding, our catching has been a big concern. Certain individuals we have to keep an eye on. Certain individuals when they come to the national set up, they come two weeks before or one month before to us, said Hathurusingha.
Doing drastic changes in short course during a series is hard work. We need to put more emphasis on fielding. Especially when we select players we need to think about their fielding as well.
On the batting front Hathurusingha said: This is what we have got. Maturity comes with the continuous opportunities we give players. I am hoping that they learn quickly. On these kinds of surfaces it is tough for batsmen. Everyone who got a start got a decent score. Batting second and fourth is tough. While batting we took some wrong options and that is the reason why we lost. Had certain things gone our way, the result could have been different. Moving forward in conditions we will get, I am sure we will show more skill. This is the best batting unit we have.
On the positive side Hathurusingha said, I thought in these last two games, given our inexperienced attack due to the absence of Rangana (Herath), we competed well. The big difference is the three hundreds they scored and no hundreds from us. The toss has got a lot to do as well when you are playing on these types of wickets. Of course we should have used the DRS better on hindsight. But all in all, England played better.
WE HAD ALL BASES COVERED  ROOT
Englands winning captain Joe Root said the beauty of his squad was that they had all bases covered which contributed to their 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka in the three-Test series that ended at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Everyone was in a position where they were fit and raring to go. Whatever team we went with would have given us a great opportunity but those three spinners have dovetailed extremely well, built pressure and not necessarily taken their rewards, said Root in praise of his three spinners Moin Ali, Jack Leach and Adil Rashid who played a dominant role in the series capturing a total of 48 wickets out of 56 that fell to bowlers.
Moeen in particular has really stepped up as a senior bowler and led the way. Hes been quite vocal at times on plans and trying to get the best out of the other two guys and he deserved a lot of credit, said Root.
The most enjoyable thing about it is that it has been a complete squad effort. I said at the start that it was going to be the case and whether it is guys on their first tour in these conditions or the senior players they have really taken that tag and stepped to set an example for the young guys.
Expressing the feeling of winning a Test series in the subcontinent Root said: It felt like relief, the way it was going towards the back end. Its been a thoroughly enjoyable trip from start to finish. The way the group has approached it in general, weve done things differently, everyone has bought into that and if they hadnt we wouldnt be sitting here 3-0 up.
From start to finish weve planned very well, weve obviously had the experience of Trevor (Bayliss) and Farby (Farbrace) in these conditions which was very important and a great learner for us. We found a formula to be successful very early on. Then with the strength of the squad we had so many different options depending on the conditions.

Single window implementation in SL
Do not bite off more than you can chew
Sri Lankas National Single Window (NSW), when implemented, will allow businesses to lodge information and documents with a single entry point, to fulfill all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. The implementation of the NSW is also a legal obligation under the World Trade Organisations (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which Sri Lanka ratified to improve its business competitiveness.
NSW initiatives are complex and lengthy projects, involving many different stakeholders and activities. When it comes to NSW implementation, it can be interpreted in several ways. For the purposes of this blog, implementation is defined as the period from when the NSW is made operational or rolled-out after being developed. Currently, Sri Lanka is at the very beginning of the project life cycle in the establishment of a NSW, with the development of a NSW Blueprint to be released soon. At this point, some thoughts on the implementation process are warranted.
Big Bang or gradual approach
It is often appealing to contemplate an all-at-once type implementation, referred to as a big bang, where there is a fast and deep change within a short period of time. This is politically appealing because of quick delivery of results. However, in the majority of circumstances, it is impractical to implement comprehensive ICT-based projects in such a radical manner. This is mainly due to practical limitations on the capacity to manage a broad change.
The alternative is a more phased implementation, where change is gradually introduced over a longer time frame, starting on a small or limited scale. A gradual implementation offers the advantage of overcoming resistance to change from stakeholders, whilst reducing the cost of change. As such, a NSW project usually starts with a selected number of stakeholders, functions, and geographical coverage, and is later scaled up.
The implementation of the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW) provides a good example of gradual deployment of the NSW. During the trial period, which ended in 2007, INSW was limited to three government agencies (GAs) in the port of Tanjung Priok.
The second stage in July 2008 covered five seaports, while the third stage expanded the INSW to all import procedures in the ports. The fourth stage in July 2009 covered import procedures for GAs in a seaport, airport, and dry port. In January 2010, the fifth stage made the INSW mandatory for all import procedures in five ports. In the final phase, the INSW was extended to 21 ports and all importexport procedures in the country.
However, the risk of a gradual deployment is that it may result in limited transformation and insufficient change to make a significant impact on the overall trade facilitation in the country. It is, therefore, necessary to carefully undertake changes which will have a high impact on trade facilitation, whilst signalling future (and more difficult) changes to the NSW. Using a gradual approach leads to an overall longer implementation process and there is also the risk that political support can wane in the process, or the champion that drove the process disappears with time. Thus, both options have their advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered in the implementation of a NSW in Sri Lanka.
NSW implementation in SL
At a recent publicprivate consultative on the NSW implementation in Sri Lanka, organised by the International Trade Centre (ITC), in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL), this issue was deliberated amongst stakeholders. Based on the experience of NSWs in other countries, it was suggested that Sri Lanka should take a gradual approach and not try to bite off more than it can chew. More specifically, it was discussed that improving the functionality of a NSW is more important than extending the service to all traders and geographical locations in the country, at the start of operations. In terms of mode of transport and geographical coverage, maritime transport and the Colombo Port should be given priority from the onset.
Opinions varied on prioritising exports and imports at the start of operations. Some stated that imports should be included from the outset, as most exports in Sri Lanka are import dependent and import procedures and processes are far more complex than exports. However, others thought it would be easier to start the NSW implementation with exports as it is less complex and there could be quick benefits to the trading community. Similarly, it was observed that transhipment is subject to a few and simple procedures, and therefore should be available from the start.
In terms of export sectors to be prioritised in NSW implementation, agricultural products and apparels were highlighted in the discussion, given that they are governed by a number of GAs (government agencies) and their importance to the economy, respectively. Those who preferred imports to be covered at the start of NSW operations added that products such as raw materials and inputs for industries (for example, building materials, fertilizer, textile inputs, and oil) be included. However, some stakeholders believed that there should not be a sectoral preference in the roll-out of the NSW.
Of the 37 government regulatory agencies, it was suggested that a number of heavy traffic agencies should be included in the NSW on a priority basis, while others are added over time based on resources available. Some of the notable heavy traffic agencies include Sri Lanka Customs, Department of Import and Export Control, Animal Quarantine Office of the Department of Animal Production and Health, National Plant Quarantine Services of the Department of Agriculture, Food Control Administration Unit of the Ministry of Health, National Medicines Regulatory Authority, Sri Lanka Standards Institution, Board of Investment, ports, and airports.
While it was noted that some traders and agents have the necessary technical, knowledge and infrastructure to use the NSW, especially larger businesses, training, information and infrastructural support need to be provided to SMEs together with a lower user fee to encourage their participation in the NSW.
The discussion underlined that to successfully implement the NSW, there must be strong political will and commitment in Sri Lanka from the beginning. Moreover, to sustain the implementation process over time and move things forward, it was suggested that there should be a strong lead agency, interagency coordination, proper communication channels, as well as collaboration between government and the trade community.
(Under the EU-Sri Lanka Trade-Related Assistance project, funded by the European Union (EU), and implemented by the International Trade Centre (ITC), in collaboration with GOSL, ITC together with the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka organized four publicprivate consultations (PPCs) to foster stakeholder discussion on the NSW. A PPC on the implementation of the NSW was held on September 26 in Colombo with the participation of both public and private stakeholders.)

Despite spirited Lankan fightback
England completes 3-0 whitewash
Sri Lankas misery was complete at the SSC grounds after tea on the fourth day when they were beaten by 42 runs by England in the third and final Test  a result that gave Joe Roots men a 3-0 whitewash of the series.
Root became only the third visiting captain to win a Test series by a 3-0 margin after Ricky Ponting of Australia in 2004 and Virat Kohli of India in 2017.
Chasing a target of 327 Sri Lanka were eventually dismissed for 284 in the fourth ball after tea to spark of celebrations from the England camp and the players in the middle. It was a well-deserved series win for Roots men for the way they outplayed Sri Lanka in all three departments.
There were moments yesterday when Sri Lanka looked like turning the game in their favour but each time England found a way to get back.
After losing nightwatchman Lakshan Sandakan in the tenth over of the morning, Sri Lanka deprived England of a breakthrough for over two hours when Kusal Mendis and Roshen Silva carried the fight to the opposition with a stand of 100.
The partnership was reaching dangerous proportions with England trying everything they had to separate the two and desperation creeping in as the two batsmen were well set and playing the bowling with ease finding the gaps and picking up the runs with the odd boundary whenever there was a loose ball.
Then out of the blues came a breakthrough for England in the most unlikely manner  a run out.
Mendis who had been batting brilliantly and looked well set for a century was unfortunately run out going for a second run by a direct hit from Jack Leach at backward square leg.
It was a cruel blow and it only proved how things have worked out for England in their favour right throughout the series. That run out brought England back into the game and despite a late resistance from the tail there was never any doubt of a win.
Mendis departed with his head bowed for 86 scored off 129 balls with a six and eight fours to his name in what was his best performance of the series.
Niroshan Dickwella (19) and Dilruwan Perera (5) didnt last long  both out to the brilliance of Keaton Jennings at short leg.
When Roshen Silvas 190-minute vigilance was ended at 65 falling lbw to Moeen Ali, the writing was on the wall for Sri Lanka who at the time still required 101 for victory with the last pair at the wicket.
But Malinda Pushpakumara injected life into the chase with a career best knock of 42 not out of 40 balls (6 fours, 1 six) and indulged in a last wicket partnership of 58 off 75 balls with stand-in skipper Suranga Lakmal that saw an extended afternoon session by half an hour.

General Election only way out of the crisis - GL
The Attorney General has already made a request from the Supreme Court to appoint a full Bench to hear the case in connection with the gazette notification issued by the President dissolving Parliament, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L.Peiris said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLPP Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said that he made a request from the Supreme Court to appoint more than three judges to hear the case. The entire country will get to know the decision of the Supreme Court on December 7. The Supreme Court only issued a Stay Order and it is not the final judgement of the Supreme Court.
The UNP tries its best to mislead the public by stating that it is the final decision of the Supreme Court which is not.
According to Prof. Peiris, no political party in Parliament has the majority and the Government has 103 and the UNP has 101. The JVP said it will not vote to appoint the UNP Leader as the Prime Minister. The TNA has not declared that it will vote to appoint the former Prime Minister as the PM again.This type of Parliament is useless because it cannot function. The people have the sovereignty. The people should be allowed to use the universal franchise and elect a new Parliament according to their choice, the SLPP Chairman said.
Prof. Peiris pointed out that since no political party has 113 seats, the best option is holding a General Election. There are no many choices to solve this issue. The Speaker has pushed this country to anarchy because he favours the UNP and his family ties with the party.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will inform Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Chamal Rajapaksa in writing about the possibility of a possible dengue outbreak in the country, GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo last evening, he said there is a possibility of a dengue outbreak occurring in the country in next four to six weeks, according to the entomologists.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the entomologists have reported that the mosquito density of several areas in the country is increasing with the on going rains. This can lead to a dengue outbreak. Special attention should be paid to the Western Province, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kurunegala and Kandy.
There is a significant increase in the number of dengue patients during the past week and special attention should be paid to destroying dengue mosquito breeding sites located countrywide to prevent a possible dengue outbreak. Dengue control programmes should be implemented early and proper coordination should be maintained among all relevant authorities and institutions, he added.

Govt. mulling Parliamentary boycott
The Government is seriously thinking about boycotting Parliament. One political party should have a minimum number of 19 seats in the Parliament to have a seat (place) in the Parliament Select Committee (PSC) and therefore the Speakers appointments are not acceptable at all, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLPP Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said that both the JVP and TNA cannot have places in the Parliament Select Committee because when 225 seats are divided by 12, one political party must have 19 seats to claim a place in the Committee.
It is the accepted system all over the world and in Sri Lanka too, that the majority of seats of the Committee be allocated to the Government. As stated by the UNP Leader, Parliament cannot decide whether to hold the Presidential Election or General Election first. Parliament does not have that legal power, Prof. Peiris said.
According to Prof. Peiris, the Speaker is favouring the UNP. It is the Leader of the House who makes the Order Paper and now he cannot do it because of the biased attituded of the Speaker.
The Opposition cannot bring in any proposals/acts related to finance into Parliament and only the Government can do it. Therefore, the Opposition can bring nothing into Parliament on the 29th. Parliament cannot cut down monetary allocations for the PM because the relevant allocations have already been passed and allocated from the budget, he said.
Prof. Peiris pointed out that the Presidential Election can be held after January 9 next year only if President Maithripala Sirisena contests as a candidate. Parliament does not have the power to decide on it. Under Section 42.4, of the Constitution, the President appoints the Prime Minister according to his preference.
If the President appoints the former Prime Minister again, it will be a violation of the Constitution because the President has already revealed to the country how corrupt he was, Prof. Peiris said.
The only way out from this complicated situation is holding a General Election and allowing people to decide who their representatives are and which Government they want. There is no other option to solve this issue. All must thank former Minister Basil Rajapaksa for his dedicated service which brought a landslide victory for the SLPP within 16 months of its establishment. The SLPP won 71 percent of electorates at the Local Government Election held in February, he added.

Hassan takes the ultimate endurance test
|Hassan Esufally
Adventure marathoner Hassan Esufally is fully geared up to tackle the Antarctic Ice Marathon, the only official marathon run on mainland Antarctica, taking place at 80 South, just a few hundred miles from the South Pole in the interior of Antarctica, on the 13th of December 2018. The 42.2 km marathon event will require a superhuman effort by participants to overcome the grueling conditions under which they undertake the race. Training diligently for the event over the last few months, Hassan will race a groomed and marked course with snowmobile support, aid stations and medical personnel at hand for the duration of each race along with participants from many countries. Running a marathon is an arduous task. Running on snow, in sub zero temperatures is even more challenging, something Hassan is keenly aware of, but feels equal to the challenge, his aim being to bring pride to Sri Lanka. He has followed an extraordinarily rigorous training schedule leading up to the time he departs for the marathon.
Commenting on the challenge ahead, Hassan said, The Antarctic Ice marathon is one of the hardest marathons in the world! Personally, I feel it will be the hardest one because of the massive temperature difference. I dont really like the cold, but sometimes in order to achieve your goals you have to go outside your comfort zone and do the things you arent comfortable with. You have to be amongst the fittest people in the world to even stand a chance to get in, because you have to compete in a temperature of -20 C, with 24 hour sunlight, sleeping in igloos or mountain tents, while running with spikes in your shoes for the entire race. Furthermore, the race allows for competitors only, so its the first time I am traveling without my wife since I embarked on this journey to complete the seven continents; which is tough because she is a great support system during those times. A time limit of 6 hours may be imposed on the half marathon and 10 hours the marathon. Another challenge will be that the participants have to deal with strong Katabatic Winds as well.
Elaborating further, he said, The marathon follows a stringent selection process, with only 50 people selected per year in this exclusive marathon. I am lucky to be within this select few.
Generally, people visit Antarctica via a ship from the southernmost tip of Chile to King George Island, an island off the coast of Antarctica. But since the race is close to South Pole and very much in inland Antarctica, the Race Director flies competitors to Union Glacier from Punta Arenas via a private plane.
Esufally has already completed marathons in the continents of Europe (Stockholm Marathon in June 2017), Asia (Colombo Marathon in October 2017), Australia (Melbourne Marathon in 2014 and 2016) and this year he has completed the Boston Marathon in USA (April) and the Big Five Marathon in South Africa (June)  making his country proud!

Sri Lankan apparel manufacturer, Hela Clothing Group, has secured a capital infusion of Rs. 1.2 billion by way of a mix of shareholder and new private equity investment funds from a private consortium whose lead investor has a wide portfolio including private equity investments in the fashion and retail space.
A. R. Rasiah, the former Finance Director at Nestle Lanka PLC, former Senior Director of Nations Trust Bank PLC, former Chairman of Atlas Axillia (Pvt) Ltd and director at many other listed and non-listed entities, has been a long-standing director of the company and will now assume the role of Chairman thus continuing to bring a strong hand to commercial strategy, governance and the finances of the group.
Overwhelmed by the interest from private equity funds to invest in Hela, Rasiah together with the companys board of directors were pleased to secure an anchor partner with a wealth of retail and supply chain expertise.
The focus for the past twelve months was to right-size the business and drive free cash flow generation through operational excellence, prudent cost management together with customer and supply chain optimisation strategies. With the business now having made significant progress in those areas the focus is now around balance sheet strengthening both through raising equity and building cash reserves through operations, said Rasiah.
Hela plans to use this capital infusion on several fronts. The majority of the proceeds will be used to repay debt and replenish working capital thus, strengthening the companys balance sheet.
The balance of the funds will be utilized to fuel growth by enhancing and expanding its manufacturing footprint in Africa and for further operational streamlining through investments into IT and Innovation, beginning with the groupwide ERP system being upgraded in partnership with SAP solutions.
Commenting on the utilization of funds, Rasiah added, Hela will continue to evolve and will be persistent in looking for avenues to become a renowned global apparel solutions provider which embodies the true Sri Lankan spirit.

Irelands Johnny Sexton wins rugbys world player of year
PARIS: Irelands Johnny Sexton was named world player of the year on Sunday for leading his nation to the Six Nations Grand Slam.
Sexton beat All Blacks fly-half Beauden Barrett -- the winner for the last two years -- South Africa scrum-half Faf de Klerk, New Zealand try machine Rieko Ioane and Springboks hooker Malcolm Marx.
The 33-year-old Leinster fly-half is only the second Irish player to win the award after hooker Keith Wood in 2001.
It was an Irish triple at the ceremony in Monaco as Ireland were named team of the year and Joe Schmidt won coach of the year.
Jessy Tremouliere became the first French winner of the womens player of the year award having helped Les Bleues win the Six Nations Grand Slam.
With Sexton at their heart, Ireland only lost once all year, to Australia in June, and bagged a memorable Grand Slam against England on St Patricks Day at Twickenham.
They also beat the All Blacks on Irish soil for the first time with a 16-9 win on November 17.
Sexton lost his voice so Ireland teammate Rory Best had to read out his acceptance speech, saying: If a No.10 wins an award like this, it is due to the team around him and his coaches making his job easier.
We have some of the best coaches in the world and are led superbly by Rory Best. New Zealander Schmidt is expected to announce by the end of this month whether he will remain in charge beyond next years World Cup in Japan.
But first he will aim to guide the Irish to the last four of the global showpiece for the first time. AFP

JVP and UNP have single agenda - Minister
When Parliament met last Friday, the government group withdrew from the chamber owing to the irresponsible actions of the Speaker. After adjournment of the session was announced the UNP, TNA and the JVP continue the debate. This action was similar to that of a bull in a china shop, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amarasweera said.
He was speaking at several ceremonies in Ethbatuwa, Lunugamvehera, Padawgama and Beralihela to mark the distribution of fruit plants, under the Ministrys Api Wawalai, Api Kanne (we eat what we grow) programme recently.
Minister Amaraweera said today the JVP and UNP could not be considered as two different parties as they worked according to a single agenda. The JVP seemed to be more interested in protecting former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe than the UNPers themselves. There was no tradition to continue the debate after Parliamentary proceedings were adjourned.
The usual Parliamentary tradition was to give the governing party more weightage when appointing members to a Parliamentary select committee. But what the Speaker did was to offer the majority membership to the Opposition over the government group. This prompted members of the government to leave the chamber.
Minister Amaraweera said opponents of the government were spreading rumours about an impending food crisis. He said he categorically states that this was a false alarm and nothing of the sort would happen. There was a long drought from 2015 to the 2018 Maha season, but not a single person in the country was left in hunger. The last Yala cultivation season had been successful.
The country was now receiving adequate rainfall with tank and reservoirs filled to the brim. This would assure a successful harvest during the current Maha season and people should not heed rumours spread by political opponents.

Keells launches new campaign
This November, Keells ushered a new campaign that embodies two core values of the brand identity- Freshness and Quality. Keells launched their Fresh Guaranteed: Double Your Money Back campaign recently reflecting the Brands promise and commitment towards providing good quality fresh produce. With this in mind, the initiative allows customers to return Keells fresh produce bought within 24 hours which they are not satisfied with for double the price of the quantity brought back.
Keells guarantee of freshness begins at the very source working directly with farmers and sourcing from collection centers in Sooriyawewa, Pannegamuwa, Keppitipola, Sigiriya, Jaffna and Thambuththegama, said Head of Fresh Foods, Mifrah Ismail, Keells. Extension officers work in partnership with the Keells Fresh team to educate the farmers on both pre-harvest and post-harvest techniques as well as implementing Good Agricultural Products (GAP) certification among its farmer base.
Back in 2016, Keells pioneered Fresh Chilled Chicken in Sri Lanka offering customers freshness, nutrition and taste. The project involved working with their suppliers to create a process that would optimize freshness and deliver chicken from farm to store under stringent hygienic standards and within 24 hours. To date, 78 outlets maintain Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards while over 60 outlets maintain Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLS) standards which emphasize Keells commitment towards providing customers with high quality produce.
In addition to fruit, vegetables, fish and meat, the brands standard of freshness now also includes their recently added range of hot food counters and juice bars as well as a customer favourite- the bakery. For Charitha Subasinghe, President, Retail, John Keells Group the Fresh Guarantee is a testament to the Keells identity as a newly relaunched Brand and a reflection of their core purpose- to improve the quality of life for the nation.

Lack of information and awareness drawback in attracting Japanese investors  JETRO
JETRO, or the Japan External Trade Organization, is a government-related organization that works to promote mutual trade and investment between Japan and the rest of the world.
Originally established in 1958 to promote Japanese exports abroad, JETROs core focus in the 21st century has shifted toward promoting foreign direct investment into Japan and helping small to medium size Japanese firms maximize their global export potential. JETRO has set up branches in identified countries with Sri Lanka being one of them.
The Daily News caught up with Senior Director for Global Strategy, South West Asia Planning Department of the JETRO, Kazuhiko Obama in Tokyo to seek his views on needs and strategies and JETROs plan of action to promote Japan  Sri Lanka business. The following is based on views expressed by Obama during a discussion with this writer at the JETRO head office in Tokyo recently.
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND PROPAGANDA CAN ATTRACT JAPANESE INVESTORS
In my opinion lack of awareness and information both on Sri Lanka and business opportunities in Sri Lanka is the biggest drawback to attracting investors from Japan. There are a lot of good opportunities for Japanese businessmen in Sri Lanka. But unfortunately lack of information is a hurdle.
Currently there is no Japanese media in Sri Lanka. Japanese media usually reports heavily on India. When it comes to Sri Lanka at times only negative information is published in the Japanese media. In Japan more than 95 percent business are Small and Medium sized Enterprises. SMEs get information from media or the banking corporation.
Unfortunately there is no Japanese banking corporation either in Sri Lanka. Large companies can get information from their agents or partners. For Example Mitsubishi Company has a partnership with Hayleys in Sri Lanka. 
But the SMEs do not have such facilities or contacts. Indian market is so large that Japanese press identifies Sri Lanka as a small country in comparison. This is misleading. Whenever I speak in a seminar or forum I introduce Sri Lanka as not as a mall country but a big one with a lot of potential. Sri Lanka has the same population as Taiwan, Australia or New Zealand, but the Japanese investors are not aware of this fact. If Sri Lanka was located in East Asia for example, Sri Lanka may not have been identified as a small country. Sri Lanka is being identified as a small country because it is so close to India.
JETRO CAMPAIGN TO RAISE AWARENESS AMONG JAPANESE FIRMS ON ADVANTAGES OF DOING BUSINESS IN SRI LANKA
So we at JETRO concentrate on providing proper and correct information to Japanese companies, especially for SMEs. JETRO branch in Colombo is spearheading these efforts. Also we hold seminars in Japan to introduce Sri Lankan business environment and promote investment in Sri Lanka to Japanese companies. We also publish information in our website and newsletters about business opportunities in Sri Lanka and other general information. When Japanese businessmen want to visit Sri Lanka to explore opportunities we provide individual consultation.
At individual consultations we give a thorough briefing not only about business but other information such as politics, culture, challenges when setting up business, market potential and capacity etc. These awareness activities I believe are most important to Sri Lanka. We also arrange interviews with Sri Lankan businessmen and key persons through our office in Colombo. We provide information about Sri Lanka in Japanese language as well. This is very important to some SMEs in japan where key officials may not be fluent in English.
When we organize seminars a lot of business people attend them and they also ask a lot of questions. At a recent seminar in Tokyo we even had an issue with the seating facilities. There were more business people than we expected and we had to expand seating facilities in a hurry. This means Japanese companies are hungry for proper information about Sri Lanka.
SRI LANKA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A HUB FOR SOUTH ASIA
Japanese companies are focusing business in ASEAN countries. Many set up their regional head office in Singapore. They call it the hub office. In South Asia many Japanese companies dont have such a hub office.
They expect the News Delhi branch in India to become the hub office. But what usually happens is that hub office becomes an Indian hub office ONLY and not South Asian hub office due to the size of the Indian market.
Sri Lanka is strategically located in the Indian Ocean. It is so close to India so that Sri Lanka can be used as a hub to doing business in India. Also the country can be used as a bridge to Africa due to transportation capabilities. Also Sri Lankan companies are doing good business in Africa, especially in the IT sector.
Japan is yet to explore Africa in a business perspective and Sri Lanka could be the bridge. Sri Lank has a living environment that compares favorably with both India and Japan. It has high quality human resources, good education, English is widely spoken, and most are Buddhists and have even-tempered personalities. These are all positive qualities
JAPANESE STYLE HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN SRI LANKA 
JETRO has embarked on a programme to identify new markets in Sri Lanka. Healthcare services are one area we have identified as having great potential. In Sri Lanka non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for about 70 percent of total deaths. This is also affecting productivity standards in companies. In order to decrease the number of NCD patients, JETRO is planning to collaborate with Lankan companies and health related organisations to introduce a Japanese style health and productivity management system among Sri Lankan companies, which will include the application of regular health check-ups etc.
In Japan, the company is responsible for employees health. An employee has to provide a comprehensive health assessment report to the employer every year. Companies heavily invest in their employees health. We JETRO want to create a similar mechanism in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas public health service is very good. However, Sri Lankan people generally think about hospitals as a destination for cure. So they mostly visit hospitals when they get ill.
But in Japan health checks are very popular. So people go to hospitals before they get ill to assess their health. So we are looking to create and popularize the health check-up market in Sri Lanka. Japanese are very health conscious people. Some even check their daily calorie intake. Last year and once again this year we organized workshops in Colombo for Sri Lankan company CEOs. We urged them to adopt a good health-checkup service for their employees.
Many Lankans like going to the gym, running or walking. This is good. But they only engage in action and no measurement or evaluation. We have this system PDCA which stands for Plan, Do, Check and Action. In Sri Lanka it is mostly P (Plan) and D (DO). But no C (check) or A (action).
LEARNING ELDERLY CARE FROM JAPAN
Japan has the worlds oldest population. Also the population growth is very low. Sri Lanka too has a similar trend which shows signs of increasing. In future we also want to focus on the elderly care market in Sri Lanka which is growing fast.
Japan is suffering from lack of human resources in the elderly care market. After creating a good elderly care system in Sri Lanka we can even import human resources in the field from Sri Lanka. India is not suitable for this kind of business because it is too big. Also the Indian population growth is high unlike Japan or Sri Lanka.
JAPAN TO TAP INTO HIGH END CONSUMER MARKET
The Sri Lankan consumer market is growing rapidly. However, I do not think the market has enough high end products or the variety some affluent consumers demand. In future Sri Lanka is becoming a good destination for high end consumer products. Also the variety and choices for consumers are currently lacking. Sri Lankan consumer should have multiple choices. This is another area which we will promote among Japanese investors.
CHALLENGES TO DOING BUSINESS IN SRI LANKA
Other than lack of information there are many other challenges and obstacles to doing business in Sri Lanka. JETRO as I said earlier has established a comprehensive information providing service to media, banking corporations and business leaders. We provide information to Japanese companies doing business in Sri Lanka as well as Japanese companies not doing business in Sri Lanka. Every year we organize a dialogue between Japanese companies in Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan governments relevant organisations led by the BOI. At times there is lot of changes in Sri Lanka with regards to people heading some key organisations. Constant change is hurting business. Also Japanese investors would like quick hassle free service and may be one stop-shop to get their business going. This is currently lacking. Sri Lanka should effectively address issues such as insufficient skilled labour and high quality industrial human resources for the manufacturing industry.
There also should be a consistent industrial policy and BOI functions should be streamlined for it to be more effective and investor friendly. Attracting foreign investment in the is essential for diversifying export products and shrinking the trade deficit, and now is the best possible time for attracting Japanese companies.

Midas touch in music
Hitha Kohedo Gihin credits
Lyrics - Saman Kularathna
Melody & Music Composed by Sandaruwan Jayasinghe
Mix and Master by Lean Muthukanda
Magnus, meaning "great" in Latin, was sometimes used as a first name among Romans. Our Keerthi Pasquel is our Magnus of Sri Lankan Music  Magnus Keerthi Paquel. He is an amazing balladeer and has no equal in Sri Lankan Sinhalese Music. Pasquel recently launched his music video  Hitha Kohedo Gihin. It is one of the finest musical creations in our culture up to date. Pasquel who recently launched his music video at the National Film Corporation spoke to the Daily News about his music video and his collaboration with the beautiful and talented Yvonne Roshini Bandara. The music video is stunning in its portrayal of beauty. The choosing Yvonne Roshini Bandara was one of the best things that could happen because of her personality.
I do have many people to thank. I met Saman Kularatna in Australia who penned this song and handed it over to me. At first glance I felt the lyrics were relevant to all ages and requested Sandaruwan Jayasinghe to compose the song. He did a beautiful job and I immediately fell in love with the song. I got my Lawyer Niranga Nanayakkara to listen to it, who suggested that we must make a music video and she undertook the task. She was of the view that we must produce a music video that is of high quality and a music video that can be enjoyed by genuine music lovers. A video that proves that commitment, vision and effort is as important as genuine talent, said Pasquel.
Channa Wijewardana needs no introduction. Involving him in the video contributed towards making it a success as he is irreplaceable because of his knowledge and experience when it comes to dance.
I requested Vet. Dancer Channa Wijewardana to choreograph the entire act, who thankfully agreed to my request. It was Channa who introduced me to Saminda Wathawanawithanage and Buddika Wijerathne the directors of 360 Production Group. I was so blown away by their talent and skill and had no hesitation in immediately entrusting them the task of producing the music video. In my honest opinion both Channa and 360 did a marvelous job. I must thank the entire 360 Production team who gave their 100 percent to this production. Channa was instrumental in putting this entire concept together and I have no words to thank him for his professionalism and love, explained Pasquel. Bandara was extremely amenable and listened well to what was requested from her. Working with her was an extremely enjoyable task as he displayed great resilience and spirit
Yvonne is a frontline dancer of Channa Upuli Dance troupe. I must say this young girl has a great future ahead of her. She was so obliging and took directions so well. It was amazing how she conducted herself in the mountains and the bravery shown by her, pointed out Pasquel. Pasquel has always been loyal to his fans who have made him what he is today. He always wants to do something special for his fans. A man of great humility he understands that the devotion of his fans needs something special in return.
Ive always wanted to present something novel to my fans. My goal was to present something that can reach young hearts too, and at the same time give the message that we can make a quality production with tasteful visuals and win the hearts of our fans instead of trying to gain more views by using tasteless scenes. I feel I just did that. Creating a tasteful music video with an absurd storyline usually destroys the song itself, stated Pasquel.
This is a music video which is the result of love and friendship. It is an example of what happens when a group of dedicated people who mutually respect each other get together, doing what they love doing. It was the 360 production team who suggested that we turn this video into 3D Stereoscopy. They did not charge me an extra penny for converting the video into 3D but the time and effect spent on it day in and day out was priceless. When it comes to selecting the right location the 360 team selected a venue Called Madulsima. Mountainous village 20 km off Passara. Passara is about 25 km from Badulla and at Light of Asia Foundation, Nugadeniya Road, said Pasquel.
Pasquel truly can be called Magnus in Sri Lanka. The mention of his name is enough to give someone Goosebumps as they recall his songs. The mention of his name immediately brings a silence to the room as everyone wants to hear of his latest accomplishments. He says that out of his 600 singles  Hitha Kohedo Gihin is one of the best ever. He points out that he has done about 15 music videos and his favorite songs are Neela Ahase, Rantharu Payana, Sadalatha, Nil Upuli, Sinhala Raja Kale, Kadula, thawa Dawasak and Sitha Kohedo Gihin
I always want to give something new to my fans. At present I am working on forming a trust to set up a BNT center for the benefit of Cancer patients in Sri Lanka. I hope to give my fullest to this project, said Pasquel.

City Planning and Water Supply Minister M. L. A. M. Hizbullah had officially requested Saudi authorities through Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Abdul Naser H Al Harithy to increase the Haj Pilgrimage quota by 2,000.
A letter was sent to Dr. Salih Bin Mohammed Thahir Panthen, Saudi Minister for Haj and Umrah and Dr. Rafath Ibnu Ismail Ibraheem Bathr, Director for Haj and Umrah for South Asian countries to consider the request of Muslims in Sri Lanka, said Minister Hisbullah.
Saudi Arabia provides a quota of 3,000 for Sri Lankan pilgrims annually, but we receive over 13,000 applications for the Haj Pilgrimage annually. We are unable to send all applicants to do the Haj Pilgrimage due to the insufficient quota, the minister stated.
If the Saudi Arabian Government accepts the request, we would be able to send a minimum of 5,000 to Makkah every year to perform the Haj, said the minister.

We were able to yield a bumper harvest during the last Yala season and we are also confident that we would be able to yield a bumper harvest this Maha season, he said.

'Nail'ing It
This festive season, let your nails do the talking with its sparkly ombr patterns, to add glitter to your parties and night outs.
There is something about that glitz on your fingertips that puts a smile on your face and we all know how every girl loves glitter on her nails. Glitter nail designs can give that extra zing and brighten up and send sparkles in your dull moments.
They are always a good choice for the festivals and fun times around the holidays, like the New Year, Christmas and more..!
While some choose to only bedazzle one accent nail, others go all out and add sparkle to every finger to look their best.
This nail art looks tough to execute, but these glitter ombr designs are anything but difficult. The only extra tool you need is a disposable makeup sponge to get this gorgeous look along with the micro glitters or dazzling embellishments.
Here is how to flawlessly nail the look in just a few easy steps:
Prep and paint all your nails with your choice of base coat. For the glitter, choose a glitter of your choice and apply it using a fine tipped brush to your nail three fourths of the way down to the tip of your nail.
This creates the beginning of your ombr look. You may also use a sponge, using the same polish to swipe the glitter from the halfway point of your nail to the tip, building the gradation, concentrating on the edge and tip to finish the ombr effect.
Finish the effect with a top coat. Choose from range of colours from black or white with a gold or silver dazzle being the all time favourites to hues of pink, mint, aqua, mettalic or neon. Deccan Chronicle

Only judiciary can decides legality of Govt.- Vasu
It is the judiciary that decides the legality of the government. No one else has the right to determine it, National Integration, Reconciliation and languages Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara said yesterday.
He said that the United National Party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna or the Tamil National Alliance cannot determine if the incumbent government is illegal or unconstitutional.
Addressing a press conference at the Dr.N.M. Perera Centre in Colombo 8 yesterday, Nanayakkara added that the UPFA is the only group that has the highest number of Members in Parliament.
Nanayakkara added that President Maithripala Sirisena has invited former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to form a government as the latter represents the only group that has the highest number of Members in Parliament.
He said that the UNP is still struggling to collect the signatures of UNP Parliamentarians to get Parliamentarian Ranil Wickemesinghe as Prime Minister, though the party boasts that they have majority in Parliament.
The Minister added that the appointment of new Prime Minister and the Ministers has made in compliance with the Constitution. The President has also apprised the Commonwealth that the appointment is made in keeping the with the countrys Constitution.
UNP and its sinister allies  the JVP and TNA are harping on that this appointment the government is illegal and unconstitutional, he said.
He said that the UNP and its NGO bandwagon are in a desparate attempt to incite the people against the government
The people who faced untold hardships due to the economic policy of the previous government and the people who are against the imperialist policies of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have now rallied around President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rapaksa, he said.
Nanayakkara added that those who were against President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015 with the support of imperialist elements, have regrouped again to work against the incumbent government.
We boycotted Parliament as clashes may erupt due to the arbitrary and undemocratic decisions of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

Emcee Duke Ramachandran got proceedings underway with the traditional lighting of the lamp by some of the distinguished guests and this was followed by a heart warming welcome address by Richie De Silva (convener and player) instrumental in forming the Sri Lankan contingent for these games.

Consul General Lal Wickrematunge also a cricketer of repute welcomed this initiate for senior players and commended the players on their voluntary contributions in coming forward to represent Team Sri Lanka.
Captain Marlon Von Hagt was magnanimous in thanking all the sponsors and stressed the importance of listening to our bodies and staying injury free.

Pakistan sniff win as Yasir spin destroys New Zealand
Dubai, Monday: Leg-spinner Yasir Shah wrecked New Zealand with a career best eight wicket haul as Pakistan sniffed victory on the third day of the second Test in Dubai on Monday.
The 32-year-old grabbed 8-41 in 12.3 overs which annihilated New Zealand to 90 all out in just 35.3 overs before taking two more wickets as New Zealand -- following on -- were 131-2 at close in their second innings.
Yasir dismissed opener Jeet Raval for two before accounting for New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson caught behind for 30 to complete his third ten-wicket haul in the match.
Tom Latham (44) and Ross Taylor (49) were at the crease at close as New Zealand need another 197 runs to avoid an innings defeat while Pakistan can level the series by taking another eight wickets with two days to play.
New Zealand won the first Test in Abu Dhabi by four runs last week to gain a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
Taylor has hit six boundaries and a six in his return-to-form innings while Latham has hit three boundaries as the two have added 65 for the unbroken third wicket stand to take the fight to the Pakistan bowlers.
But the day belonged to Yasir who rocked New Zealand in the first innings.
Rain had delayed the start of the third day by an hour but when the action started Yasir was lightening, bowling to his best ability on a turning Dubai stadium pitch.
Yasir dismissed Latham (22), Taylor (nought) and Henry Nicholls (nought) in his ninth over, triggering a collapse during which New Zealand lost all their ten wickets for just 40 runs after being well set on 50 without loss.
Yasirs bowling figures -- his 15th five-wicket haul -- beat his previous best of 7-76 against Sri Lanka at Galle in 2015 and also the best against New Zealand.
Intikhab Alam (7-52) held the record for Pakistans best bowling against New Zealand, achieved at Dunedin in 1973.
New Zealand, resuming at 27 without loss, lost Raval in an unfortunate way as he tried to reverse sweep Yasir but the ball deflected off his bat to his thigh and hit the stumps.
Raval top-scored with 31.
From 50-1 it became 61-2 when Yasir had Latham caught at short-leg by Imam-ul-Haq off the first ball of his ninth over.
Two balls later he bowled experienced Taylor with a beautiful delivery that turned and beat the forward push by the batsman.
Off his fifth ball Yasir bowled Nicholls through the gap between bat and pad.
It was Yasir who ran Bradley-John Watling run out soon after lunch for one before dismissing Ish Sodhi, Neil Wagner, Ajaz Patel and Trent Boult -- all without scoring in the space of nine balls.
Six New Zealand batsmen fell without scoring, making it the fifth occasion in a Test when six batsmen failed to score in an innings.
Williamson remained unbeaten on 28, watching wickets fell like nine pins at the other end.
With Sodhis wicket Yasir also completed 100 wickets in 16 Tests in United Arab Emirates (Dubai, Sharja and Abu Dhabi).
The third Test will be played in Abu Dhabi from December 3. AFP

Parliament, now a building complex with a HSZ - Abeygunawardena
Parliament is now a building complex covered by a High Security Zone (HSZ) with several circles of Security Forces, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujapa Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said that in Parliament he saw for the very first time in history, a vote taken for the Parliament Select Committee. The UNP Leader is now trying his best to cover up his mistakes by using the Parliament tele drama. The people are waiting eagerly to watch the next episode, Abeygunawardena said.
According to MP Abeygunawardana, all media institutions should provide evidence in connection with alleged great bank robbery of Sri Lanka where the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was robbed by a Singaporean citizen brought to Sri Lanka by the former Prime Minister, appointed by him as the Central Bank Governor and taking over the Central Bank in order to hand it over to the robber. There are records on how the former PM tried his best to white wash the former Central bank Governor using three lawyers.
The UNP Leader says Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated twice while he himself (UNP Leader) was defeated on over 30 times. Now the alleged conspiracy launched to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is now gradually unfolding. We request the Government to conduct this investigation properly. Sometimes, some husbands kill their wives by strangling them and then they hang on to the bodies, he added.

Peace builders unite
In Commonwealth member states, Poppy Day is observed on an annual basis every November, in remembrance of those who died in the line of duty during the first World War. This year saw the commemoration of 100 years since the end of the war, and many special events were held to mark this anniversary.
One such event took place earlier this year at the Peace Village in Mesen, Belgium. As 2018 marked a century after the end of World War 1, the Peace Village in Belgium set up a new project - '18 in 18'. The aim of this project was to bring together young people from each of the countries that had been involved in the conflict during the Great War. Each country would nominate a girl and a boy who turned 18 in 2018. These young people would gather at the Peace Village and work towards creating a contemporary message of peace.
Sri Lanka Unites was approached to help find participants from Sri Lanka, and based on the organizations long term partnership with Elizabeth Moir School, two students Ramudi Samarasekera and Rithesh Sathyanandan were nominated to attend the event.
The participants worked together to create a contemporary peace message, which was then presented and distributed to policy makers from Flanders, Belgium, the European Union, the United Nations and ambassadors from the participating nations.
The contemporary peace message contained 14 statements. They focused on multiple issues such as the improvement of justice systems, effective cooperation, reconciliation and remembrance. We formed the message combining ideas from all the participants. During the final ceremony we presented our peace messages using multiple forms of art, which included theatre, dance, film, practical art and food explained Rithesh.
The students went on several visits linked to the Great War, including the Peace to the World workshops and lectures, and spent a great deal of time in fellowship with other participants. Ramudi says, Meeting people from multiple nations showed us how they haddifferent ideas and opinions.
It exposed us to more ideas and different cultures. It taught us how people should respect other peoples opinions and listen to their ideas. We saw first hand how cooperative and helpful people were even though we were from different countries, especially when we were working on our art projects. I think its safe to say that both Rithesh and I have made life long friends even though we spent seven days togethe

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
Quite a cracker!
At first glance the film is a visual splendour with stunning images, an amiable and competent cast. It is evident that the director and his team has spared no expenses in the making of Walt Disney Pictures latest fantast tale, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms which was released towards November targeting the film buffs for the Christmas holidays.
However unlike the ballet from which it has borrowed a part of its name and inspiration, Lasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnstons movie hardly encompasses any values.
Based on the story of a girl who is unaware of her origins as a princess the story follows the pattern of bringing toys to life and extravagant costumes on display. However despite having all the features that are required of a classic fairytale, The Nutcracker And The Four Realms holds little logic and seems to be a product out of nightmares rather than from the magical kingdom of fantasy.
Clara Stahlbaum is a girl from the Victorian era. Unlike the typical girls of her era, Clara is into mechanical tools and loves to solve puzzles. On Christmas Eve, when her deceased mother leaves her an ornate egg that needs to be unlocked, she's baffled that it came without a key. So she sets out to ask her godfather Drosselmeyer about this mysterious gift. Her quest to find the key leads her to a fantasy world where the Land of Sweets, Land of Snowflakes, and Land of Flowers have banished Mother for her treacherous actions. Clara is suddenly at the center of the action in which she needs to restore peace and harmony across the Four Realms.
A drawback of the film is that it is way too predictable. Even before Clara is pronounced as the heir to her mothers throne we are able to guess the route of her mission. There is too much of dialogues involved in the tale that the characters constant blabbering is a headache rather than a means for the viewers to follow the story.
Even though the cast boasts of multiple Academy Award winners Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren as well as the fiery Keira Knightley their efforts to add any life to the tale falls flat on their faces. Keiras Sugar Plum tries to liven up the situation but ends up being sickeningly sweet. Mackenzie Foy needs to be credited for putting much effort inn trying to portray a spirited Clara but her lengthy dialogues weighs down heavily on her and hinders her performance.
The most interesting and innovative piece in the story is probably the CGI-rendered mouse. Other than that the movie is just not up to Disney standards as it is devoid of suspense and thrills.

## Title: THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DECIDE (R2D) & THE COURTS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DECIDE (R2D) & THE COURTS
One often sees the opinion expressed in print that all hopes are now reposed in the Supreme Court and that the very survival of liberal democracy or even democracy in general, rests upon its verdict. Almost all those who express this view mean that the SC should rule against the decision of the Head of State to dissolve Parliament, in effect paving the way for fresh elections. Put differently, these opinion-makers hope and pray that the courts rule against the newly appointed government and in favour of a restoration of the status quo ante.
I am no lawyer, and strive, mostly successfully, not to speak of subjects I have no formal learning or experience in. Furthermore, I do not wish to debate the legality or constitutionality of a matter that is before the courts.
However, I am a political scientist and a man of some international experience, in addition to having some experience in and around the domain of high intensity conflict and politics as such. During the Premadasa Presidency, at a time of civil wars and intervention, South and North, I was appointed by him as the Director Conflict Studies at the Institute of Policy Studies, though I was only in my early thirties. In other words, political conflict is a subject I do know about. This encompasses what leads to violent conflict and how conflict may be prevented.
Supreme Courts decision
What is at stake politically, not legally, in the Supreme Courts decision It is the question of whether a snap election can be held or not. It is whether the path is cleared for a snap election or it remains barred until later in 2020. It also and more fundamentally, the question of whether or not the President can make that judgement call. Given that he is directly elected by a majority of the people regarded as a whole, i.e. the country taken as a totality, it seems eminently rational to me that the responsibility to decide whether a national political situation is so intractable as to require the surgical intervention of a snap election, should be in his hands and no other.
If the election concerned is a mere whim of the President, then we may incline to one preference, but if not, we should incline to another. I am disinclined to regard the decision to dissolve as a mere Presidential whim if only because it has an important precedent. President Kumaratunga dismissed the same Prime Minister, dissolved Parliament and went for elections. How can one explain that two Presidents, who could hardly be more dissimilar, did the same thing to the same Prime Minister and in much the same manner It is because, in both instances, tremendous social pressure had built up, resulting in intolerable political contradictions.
This present political crisis involving the Parliament is merely the tip of the ice-berg of a larger and deeper social crisis that has been building for three years and manifested itself earlier in the results of the Feb. 2018 local government election.
One must never forget the blood-soaked 1980s. As a direct result of the blocking of the holding of Parliamentary elections scheduled for 1983, the accumulating social tensions generated by the Open Economy exploded in the form of racial violence  actually, racist attacks--in the South, which in turn provided an accelerant for the terrorist campaign in the North, turning the latter into full-scale war, which generated a counteroffensive by the States armed forces, triggering an external intervention, which itself fuelled the ongoing xenophobic insurrection in the South.
The only way in which stability was even partially restored was by the opening up of the closed electoral safety valves, first with the Provincial Council elections of 1988, then the Presidential elections of the same year and the Parliamentary election of early 1989. Even so, peace and stability were fully restored only by Mahinda Rajapaksa almost two decades later.
Thats how long it took to exit the horror caused by the shutting down of the Systems electoral safety valves. Then, the shut-down was by means of a Referendum. The referendum was not the cause of the violence, though the violence came mere months after it, in July 1983. It was the aim, the goal, the objective of that referendumthe non-holding of Parliamentary electionsthat led to the carnage, because the pent up social and political steam had no way of releasing itself.
In the 1980s, large sections of the Sinhala majority felt unrepresented because the electoral system yielded a result in which Mr. Amirthalingam was the Leader of the Opposition who veered between moderation and rhetorical separatism. This was topped with the disenfranchisement of Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike and the jailing of vigorous elements of the Southern opposition such as Vijaya Kumaratunga. The Open Economic policy caused an erosion of the relative status of the native entrepreneurs, while generating socioeconomic inequities and cultural dissonances which were unprecedented. Sinhala nationalist sentiment was affronted by the rise of terrorism and the formal support of the secessionist slogan by the mainstream Tamil nationalists.
The witches cauldron boiled over and hundreds of thousands of lives were lost. Very little of it would have happened had a General Election been permitted in early 1983 instead of being blocked in December 1982. The Presidential election was no substitute. It had been held in October 1982 and won by the incumbent, but sub-national level grievances are ventilated in the arena of the parliamentary electoral process, which if blocked, leads to an explosion.
The cycle of history repeats itself. The profile of the UNP in the 1950s led firstly to the Hartal of August 1953 and only later to the electoral outcome of 1956. Imagine what would have befallen Ceylon if not for that election in 1956 which some see as the beginning of the Great Fall The Hartal would have repeated itself on a vaster scale, commingled this time, with the linguistic and cultural passions that fed into 1956and it would have taken a non-electoral, non-peaceful form. Remember that 1956, just as 1970 after it, were referred to as Silent Revolutions. Those Revolutions stayed silent only because of timely General elections.
The same thing almost happened in 1965-1970. The policies and profile of the sevenparty UNP-led coalition which included the Tamil parties (the so-called Hath Havula), especially those policies of the JR-Esmond faction (the latter was Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghes father) resulted in a chauvinist tinge entering the discourse of the democratic Opposition (SLFP-LSSP-CPSL), Bhikkhu-led protests, and the rise of a serious revolutionary left, preceded and accompanied by a radical university student movement. Violent rebellion erupted in 1971 but it was quelled so swiftly only because it was facing a freshly elected government, with General elections having been held just the previous year, 1970. If not, and if the insurrection was not facing a moderate nationalist Government, the first insurrection would have been as serious a business as it was later in the latter half of the 1980s when the UNP was in office.
pro-Western
Today we are at the same crossroads under which the same explosive mix is buried: a pro-Western minoritarian elite, low economic growth, socioeconomic inequity and hurt majoritarian nationalism. The masses see unrepresentative urban elite attempting to manipulate the System, using institutional means and technicalities, to block a more socially representative dispensation that the people feel less alienated from and are more able to relate to.
In Sri Lanka today, the Children of 56 face the Children of 62 (the abortive minoritarian coup attempt of 1962 which led to a majoritarian policy backlash). If the UNF petitioners succeed, then the present and ancient leadership of the UNP will remain entrenched, with the consequence that political as well as socioeconomic polarization will continue for years to come.
If on the other hand, the SC permits dissolution and an election, the present and ancient UNP leadership will be undermined and possibly overturned, opening the road for a new leadership which is not so alienated from the majority of our citizens and therefore will not provoke a populist cultural backlash. The UNP may become electable again and not dependent upon impossible coalitions and proxy Presidential candidates. The cycle of polarization of Sri Lankan politics will cease and politics will flow back into the usual channels of centre-right and centre-left, neither of which will be too far from the centre.
The global context is one of populist and nationalist backlashes against the neoliberal economic model and Western liberal democracy.
The combination of Sri Lankas local contradictions and the global trends could result in majoritarian alienation and outrage taking violent forms of expression. Far too much steam has built up in the system. It is not a moment too soon to divert this into peaceful channels by promptly unblocking the electoral safety valves.
My wish as a political scientist, who has been all the way through thirty years of conflict as a participant observer and analyst, is that there is a soft landing with a safety net.
I hope the Supreme Court cuts the Gordian knot and ends this political intractability, liberating the citizenry as peaceful electors and collective sovereign; master, mistress and maker of its own democratic national destiny.

Running in the family
To be an offspring of a living legend is a rare gift bestowed by destiny on an individual.
Jayantha Rathnayake being Dr Victor Rathnayakes first child responsibly takes forward many imaginative attributes of his bloodline.
Jayantha has proved his mettle in the sphere as a resourceful music composer, music director and a singer. Jayantha Rathnayake celebrated his 50th birthday recently amidst a gathering of close associates in private and professional spheres. On the verge of releasing a couple of innovative new songs Jayantha engaged in an interview with the Daily News T&C.
Q: Tell me about your school days.
Even when schooling, my passion was towards music. This may be because we had a musical background at home. My parents however wanted me to pursue studies in medicine. I still wonder, what would have been the reason for that. My peers and teachers appreciated my works in music at school events such as concerts.
Being Victor Rathnayakes son brought me many privileges even during school days.
Q: What was your mother Chithras contribution towards the family
With his family
My mother was my guardian angel. She actually shaped me to live like Victor Rathnayakes eldest son, respecting fathers reputation as a senior and popular artiste.
Her priority however was looking after my father not only as a wife but also like a mother.
She was reluctantly compelled to limit the freedom of her children to leave room for my father to indulge in his creative works.
When we schooled my father who was in the helm of his career was taking his SA one-man concert to the nook and corners of the country.
When he is at home mother used to give priority to his leisure while offering hospitality to his peers.
We were instructed to maintain silence at home. We were obedient children though our freedom was compromised.
Q: After leaving school you lead the band Rajantha Miyasiya and joined Shakthi band which became Siha Shakthi eventually.
I had the privilege of associating with seniors like Ananda Perera, Anthony Surendra, Sangeeth Wickramasinghe and Jayantha Gallage while contributing to Shakthi and Siha Shakthi as a musician.
These individuals were unique. They had radical approach to contemporary music and their creations were innovative. The fans loved this music.
Q: SA one-man concert was the most preferred one of a kind concert. The song Podi Kumarihamiye was sung at the concert with just two musical instruments, Tabla and Harmonium. You became the successor to Alien de Zoysa to play the Harmonium for this song in SA.
I was schooling when I played Melodica for the two songs, Thani Wennata Mage Lowe and Thuru Lapalu Lathawo in the SA concert.
I played the Harmonium part of Podi Kumarihamiye with the Melodica initially as a student. Eventually I was groomed to play the Harmonium for the song. That was a memorable experience for me. But I could never reach the heights of Alien de Zoysa to play the instrument for that song. He was a maestro of the instrument. Everytime he played it, he added value to his performance.
Expert musician D D Gunesena too played the Harmonium for the song from time to time.
Q: What were your other experiences with the SA concert
Though my father sang in this solo concert, it was a family event for us. My mother, two sisters, myself and my younger brother did ground work for each show with much enthusiasm. Eventually I was offered to be on the stage as a musician. I was privileged to associate with greats like M K Rocksamy, Edgar Perera, Alien de Zoysa, Dr Rohana Weerasinghe and Wijeratne Ranatunga.
That was a self-learning process for me. Merely watching these experts indulging in music was like attending a university.
They were true masters. Every time they played instruments in SA they used to bring out some innovation and my father liked it.
In time I became the event manager and overall music director of SA concert with my fathers blessings. My sisters Chandani (demised), Manjula and my little brother Lelum too joined as chorus singers.
Q: You are a resourceful music composer and a singer. People say you have a touch of Victor Rathnayake in your creations.
Premakeerthi de Alwis once gave me some lyrics and told me to come up with a tune for my father to sing in Aradhana Swara Dehena radio program. I was just 12 at that time. However I managed to create a melody and my father sang this song live in the programme.
After some years I recorded a few original songs. A patriotic song like Ruwan Bima and a set of romantic songs for which I have composed music and recorded were in my first CD.
Many FM channels do not air songs of the genre I follow. My contemporaries too are exposed to this vicious cycle.
I have recorded some new songs recently and give them to radio channels.
I had the opportunity to contribute to SLRCs childrens programmes with melodies. The late Titus Thotawatte, Somapala Rathnayake (Victors younger brother) and Athula Ransirilal supported me. At present I mostly contribute to corporate events, weddings and parties while pursuing a career as a music director.

Salad cakes make dieting less depressing
Japanese food stylist Mitsuki Moriyasu is on a mission to prove that salads can look much better than they taste. Last year, she introduced the world to the concept of the Vegiedeco Salad, an exquisite preparation of vegetables made in the likeness of a cake. The hybrid dish was initially featured on the menu of a bistro in Nagoya, but it got so popular that it is now being exclusively showcased at a brand new cafe in the city.
The savory dish consists of colorful layers of vegetables, sandwiched between two soybean-flour sponge and covered in a tofu or cream cheese frosting blended with vegetables for natural coloring. The end result is a sinful-looking salad-cake that is not just a visual treat but also packs a nutritious punch. Containing very little to no sugar, each salad also includes a good amount of roots and peels for fiber.A wide range of these cakes are now available at The Vegiedeco Cafe, which opened its doors on April 5. The offerings are dainty and meticulously decorated with great attention to detail. A slice of salad cake starts at 735 yen ($6.50), which comes with a special koji (Japanese sake starter mold) dressing. Diners can enhance their meal with a slice of gluten-free bread (resembling a tea cake, of course) made of a strain of ancient rice, and a cup of healthy Vegie Drop Tea (loaded with phytochemicals).
The Vegiedeco Cafe has a seasonal menu, so its sure to be a hit among health-conscious folks in Japan. After all, who could refuse a slice of cake thats both pretty and healthy Oddity Central

SCs stay order is not judgement - GL
The Attorney General has already made a request to the Supreme Court to appoint a full bench to hear the case in connection with the gazette notification issued by the President dissolving Parliament, Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L.Peiris said.
Speaking at a press conference at the SLPP Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said he made a request to the Supreme Court to appoint more than three judges to hear the case. The entire country will get to know the decision of the Supreme Court on December 7. The Supreme Court only issued a stay order and it is not the final judgement of the Court. The UNP is trying its best to mislead the public by stating that it is the final decision of the Supreme Court which is incorrect.
According to Prof. Peiris, no political party in Parliament has the majority and the government has 103 and the UNP has 101. The JVP said it will not vote to appoint the UNP Leader as the Prime Minister. The TNA has not declared that it will vote to appoint the former PM as PM again. This type of Parliament is useless because it cannot function. The people have the sovereignty. The people should be allowed to use their franchise and elect a new Parliament of their choice.
Prof. Peiris said that since no party 113 has seats, the best option is to hold a general election. There arent many choices to solve this issue. The Speaker has pushed this country into anarchy because he favours the UNP and his relatives.

Shrill thrill of a womans whistling skill!
Can anyone out there tell me what the heck has happened to good old-fashioned whistling It has been suggested that the habit seems to have died out. These days, chaps sauntering in the street are more likely to be on their phones or listening to iPods.
Yes the real culprits are surely the ubiquitous iPods and MP3 players. These infernal contraptions have not only virtually obliterated the art of conversation but also have bitten deeply into the heartlands of traditional whistling. Whistling is a pleasure that those who choose to walk through life with tiny earphones stuffed in their lugholes will never know.
It used to be a sort of self-possessed attribute to whistle. Whistling has been used during peace and war, as secret codes by soldiers and spies and by kids in their backyards. And also by urban street gangs who would whistle for backup when there was trouble in the air. As an object of folklore, whistling ranges from a representation of joy to an omen of evil spirits. The superstitious say that you are not supposed to whistle after dark because its a clarion call for snakes.
My maternal grandfather was a phenomenal whistler. As a child I thought he was the worlds greatest whistling virtuoso. His whistling was powerfully clean and crisp and echoed tunefully throughout the home. He whistled while he worked at his hobbies and even when at the wheel of his Lanchester limousine!
It used to be cool to whistle. And Grand-dad did it with such effortless ease. From those puckered lips surged fluid melodic strains that could have beaten the pants off any accomplished flautists performance. Besides, his music was clear and consistently tuneful and with exceptional control on high notes.
An aunt of ours claimed the old boy came out of the womb whistling Brahms Cradle Song, and as a boy warbled along with his fathers opera albums. When I was around six or thereabouts I asked the old boy how he does it. He said: You just put your lips together and blow.
So I blew and I blew and after months of trying all that emerged was a pathetic pffffff sound. And when I had almost given up huffing and puffing there suddenly emerged a raspy high-pitched shriek reminiscent of an asthmatic cockatoo in full throated song. After a while the tone and clarity improved by tremendous shrieks and trills.
So you see, I have always been an obsessive whistler. As my family points out, its one of the reasons I have so few friends, although, as they grudgingly concede, at least they can always locate me whenever we become separated while shopping. When whistling was in vogue I was one of many thousands of practitioners indiscreetly maintaining this fine old musical tradition. Yet lately I have noticed my habit being commented on with mild amusement by family and friends.
I dont know the origin of the superstitious saying, A whistling woman and a crowing hen will bring the devil out of his den. But it sounds like English rhyming and I suspect is seventeenth or eighteenth century. It may even be older. Whatever it may be attributed to, it is a piece of sexist and misogynistic hideousness.
Basically it is similar to the ancient and hackneyed chauvinistic adage A womans place is in the home. It is indeed implying that a woman who whistles is being gender transgressive. Besides, it suggests with brazen temerity that women should never express themselves assertively nor display their independent enjoyment, which whistling certainly is an expression of.
Additionally it gives permission for men to ridicule a woman for assertive behaviour by likening her to a hen trying to be a rooster. The equivalent of saying Youre just trying to be a man. Youve stepped out of line, get back in your place witch!
I suppose they make men feel inferior because women can do everything they can and more! Whistling universally was once considered to be a male dominated activity. In many societies the theory still holds good. Women attempting to whistle were labelled as unfeminine. I guess thats why, several young lasses, were scolded for trying to whistle and constantly reminded that girls should not indulge in this all male preserve.
I know of three women who can whistle a darn sight better than most men. One was a little neighbour named Maryanne who everyone called Loku Nangi. She could whistle like any male maestro of the art since the time she was nine-years-old. Another whose talents I discovered quite late in life is my charming bosom buddy Yves who certainly retains her feminine charms despite her terrific talent for whistling. And the third is Delys, another childhood friend who doesnt profess to be in the virtuoso category but can nonetheless uncannily imitate twittering bird calls.
But we have already discussed that whistling although not difficult is rarely indulged in by women. One theory is that they don't care for the sound and have better things to do. Another is rooted in female psychology stemming from folklore. Athena is said to have given up the aulos or flute because playing it made her look peculiar and the opposite of beautiful. Perhaps women don't like to whistle because doing so involves something like making faces.
I don't really buy the making faces argument, since the face that's made looks like a kissy-pout. In my view it isn't something anyone would regard as an unattractive face to make.
Whistling can denote many moods, in particular either happiness, or as a way of taking your mind off an unpleasant activity. The song Whistle While you Work was written by Frank Churchill in 1937 for the Disney movie, The Seven Dwarfs. The dwarfs made the notion of whistling while you work popular as they carried out their task of sweeping the room. Whistlers, the bad ones in particular, are often unaware they are producing sounds that annoy and disturb those around them.
Yet theres something about tuneful whistling that is inspiring and exciting. Its an expression of sheer joy. Theres room for anyone with a song in his or her heart and the ability to pucker their lips to indulge in an improvised orchestration. I put the relevant question to the trio of my dear whistling women buddies Maryanne, Yves and Delys: Have we, as a nation, lost our whistle
They shattered the myth of the old male chauvinist saying: A whistling woman and a crowing hen are neither fit for God nor men. The first things they did in answer was to provide a riposte to the old proverbial rhyme with: Girls who whistle and hens that crow will make their way wherever they go! I clapped and whistled my applause. Then I joined their stirring orchestral rendition as we whistled Dixie!

Skills of Retired Tri-Forces needed for countrys progress - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said the mature skills, knowledge and experience of the Tri Forces veterans could be put to good use in the best interests of the country.
The President said as Commander-in-Chief of the Tri-Forces, he would prefer if a solution is brought forward through discussions from within the Tri-Forces and he is ready to implement these suggestions which would be beneficial to the country.
By the time military officers who have served for many years reach the point where they mature in knowledge and experience and reach retirement age, it is our duty to find ways as to how they can best serve the country as highly skilled persons with knowledge, the President said.
The President was addressing the inaugural session of the Conference of Officers of Tri-Forces and Senior Non-commissioned Officers held at Aththidiya Regal Lake Side yesterday (26).
While acknowledging the commitment and service rendered to the country and its people by the Security Forces, he said he had the highest respect and gratitude for all those who serve in the Tri-Forces in all capacities.
President Sirisena noted that irrespective of their posts or ranks, sometimes people serve the country at various levels, while carrying huge personal burdens on their shoulders. The President said he has a great respect and faith towards the Tri-Forces as the Commander-in-Chief and expressed appreciation for the contribution made by the Tri-Forces in national security, development as well as welfare.
The Conference was held under the theme, The professional duty of the commissioned officers of Tri-Forces and senior non-commissioned officers facing challenges.
The objective of this Conference is to build a background for commissioned officers of the Tri-Forces and senior non-commissioned officers, to accomplish duties while maintaining positive inter-relationships and expanding knowledge and to conduct duties with acquired skills and leadership qualities towards the development of the organisation, utilising modern technology and professional expertise.
This Conference by the Sri Lanka Army was held yesterday for the first time, but it is intended to include it in the Army calendar every year from now on.
Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, Chief of Defence Staff and Commanders of the Tri-Forces were present.

Smith and Warner help Aussie bowlers combat Kohli
SYDNEY: Banned Steve Smith and David Warner wont be playing any of Australias upcoming Tests against India, but they are being quietly eased back into the fold to help their bowlers combat Virat Kohli.
The duo, once national captain and vice-captain respectively, were suspended from state and international cricket for 12 months over the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
Despite a run of dire results, Cricket Australia last week ruled out relaxing their bans after a push to do so by the Australian Cricketers Association.
But with batting maestro Kohli and dangerous opening pair Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan awaiting Australia in the first Test in Adelaide from December 6, they have been enlisted to help the pace attack prepare.
Warner was welcomed back on Sunday, spotted in the Sydney Cricket Ground nets facing Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins with coach Justin Langer intently watching on in the umpires position.
According to The Australian newspaper, he was also invited into the dressing room ahead of the teams Twenty20 defeat to India on Sunday evening, where a masterful Kohli smashed 61 to ensure his team levelled the series 1-1.
Fellow pace spearhead Mitchell Starc said Smith had also been asked to help the bowlers get ready this week. Theres talking to bowling coaches then theres talking to the guys youre bowling to. Thats a great opportunity to have him face us in our preparation leading up to the Tests, Starc told the Sydney Morning Herald Monday. AFP

Something to  crow about...
Pasenadi, the king of Kosala, had 16 bad dreams one night. His Brahmin consultants warned harm either to his kingdom, his life or his wealth. They recommended all kinds of sacrifices to avoid danger. However, Queen Mallika suggested that the Buddha should be consulted. The king followed her advice.
His 15th dream of a wicked village crow attended by mallards was interpreted as the rise of the ignorant, cowardly and inferior category of footmen and barbers into kingly stature over kings of genuine royal descent. The kings of genuine descent will have to patiently watch the men of inferior birth and stature tread the royal corridors of power.
Who is the real victim of this analogy The crow, of course! The innocent bird has drawn such similes throughout the oriental folklore history. Even in modern terms, he is portrayed mostly as a scavenger bird. If fox stands for shrewdness, the crow has symbolized the filth.
Fortunately for this unfortunate species of the genus Corvus, someone has come to their rescue, finally! Thats none other than Captain Elmo Jayawardane. He opens up his literary versatility to challenge this unmerited state of affairs. With his latest novel, he forces us all to eat crow: our ideas about the innocent creature have been wrong.
The book is about crows. The narrator is Kakiyan who is the son of Stanley Crow and Alice Crow and brother to Lucille Crow and Rodney Crow. They live in a Jacaranda tree, called the Jacaranda condominium. It was not us humans  or the Great Ones - who first lived in condominiums, but crows. Kakiyan flies about with his friends and lives a carefree life. The book tells about the kind of life they lead. Roy Crow is an old crow who teaches all the little ones how to fly. The Train crow is Victor crow who loves trains so much. He lives in a railway station. In the meantime, a nascent love affair between Mooshu Crow and Rami Crow comes to the surface. They go watch a football match. And the book is titled Kakiyan: The Story of a Cow.
Captain Elmo Jayawardane is more known for his award-winning novel, Sams Story, which deals with social conflicts. The Last Kingdom of Sinhalay earned him the State Literary Award as well as the Gratiaen Prize. The rest of his books bring us to various strata of social conflicts. Yet Kakiyans book pulls us from all such predicaments and perches us with crows.
Crows are birds that are rarely appreciated. No one really notices a black crow unless in annoyance. We see them often and curse them often, but seldom do we sing their praises or voice a word of admiration. Thats a lot of a crow in our known world, Jayawardane takes pains to justify his case.
Kakiyan came to his mind some years ago. That forced him to write his story, the story of a crow.
Best still, he claims to have never read any written word about crows. I do not even know whether there are books about crows. I am sure there must be. What I did was, I watched crows, how they flew, how they walked and how they bathed in mud-puddles, and so many other crow related activities that are common sights in our day to day life.
All that Captain Elmo wanted was to pick up a new subject and write something different to what he had already written. Then he found his muse everywhere in one form. When you hear and watch them, he goes on to say passionately, you will find the species so fascinating. Then it so happened: I just wrote what I saw coining stories around them. No special reason or an incident to trigger me.
On the surface, the Kakiyan is a collection of fables. But where does it take us In his unique featherweight writing style, Kakiyan and his peers take a journey, crowing over their experiences with much delight, stimulating us to be up with the crows.
Mama Alice, Victor Crow, Grannie Vinnie, Roy Crow and some other crow fellows, will come out and share their story through Kakiyan. All this counts perhaps because a crow knows more than you and me. And there is one way to find out more. Captain Elmo Jayawardane guesses you may have to read the book for that.
The book will be launched on December 6.
Whos going to read the story of a crow
That was a common comment in everyones beak when I first mentioned to my friends and folks at home that I am going to write a book about my life. Some voiced it aloud; a kind of protest cum ridicule; some muttered and whispered condemnation, and a few others swallowed their opinion in sympathy and made faces appropriate to this literary nonsense by a crow. That was all frontal, the behind the back admiration I could not know, but I am as sure as the rising of the morning sun that there would have been plenty of voiced or mimed mockery at my expense by some kakos who were waiting impatiently to laugh at me.
Oh, well! That is to be expected. Even in the crow world, it is always the norms that are respected. No one wants to believe in things that havent been done before. And first-timers seldom hear the cheers. I knew I would be no exception. But I was determined to enter the book world and place on record what things we did as kakos, so that the inhabitants of this planet would know more about us, our lives, and what a wonderful clan the kakos were. Of course, there were a few, very few, who supported me and cheered me on to write our story in spite of the fact that the majority thought I was stark raving mad.

Weather and climate forecasting
Uncertainties and challenges
Over the last few decades, the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events have been increasing, especially due to global warming caused by human activities. According to a special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2012, changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of weather and climate extremes can increase peoples vulnerability to natural disasters and become a major threat to global economies.
Weather forecasts, ranging from timescales of few hours to entire seasons, can reduce susceptibility to weather variations and climate-related disasters, improve food security and health outcomes, and enhance water resource management. However, a major challenge is predicting future weather patterns in a rapidly changing climate. The future is intrinsically uncertain. Further, dynamic physical processes of atmosphere and its interactions with surrounding systems (e.g. land, ocean, and ice surfaces) make forecasting even more difficult.
Forecasting future weather patterns
Weather forecasts are prepared in a systematic way, which involves observation, process understanding, prediction, and dissemination. Each of these components has benefitted, and will continue to benefit from advances in science and technology. Over the past few decades, substantial leaps in science have resulted in improved and more efficient methods of making timely observations, using a wide variety of sources including radars and satellites.
The use of such observation tools has dramatically increased the quality, value, and reliability of weather forecasts, assisting decision-making processes around the world. The impact of improved observational capability, increased scientific understanding of atmospheric processes, more sophisticated computer resources, skillful numerical models, and other forecasting tools have gradually changed the publics perception of the accuracy of weather forecasts. Two areas that achieved significant improvements in this regard are numerical weather forecasting and seasonal predictions.
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) is a forecasting method that uses complex mathematical equations, based on well-established physical laws, to predict atmospheric behaviour. This is done by undertaking complex mathematical operations that model the current state of atmosphere, obtained through observations. High speed, high-performing computers are required to carry out the enormous number of calculations involved in this process. To get the current status of the atmosphere, routine and accurate measurements at ground and upper air stations, as well as remote sensing systems, are required.
Seasonal predictions
Seasonal predictions are made in probabilistic terms, such as probability of receiving average, above average, or below average level of rainfall or temperature over a season. Currently, seasonal predictions are made using both statistical schemes and dynamical models. The statistical approach seeks to find recurring patterns in climate, associated with a predictor field such as sea surface temperature. Such models have demonstrated the ability to forecast El Nio and some of its global climate impacts. The basic tools for dynamic prediction include both atmospheric and oceanic models.
Challenges in weather forecasting
Whatever the successes, some level of uncertainty remains and there are challenges that act as barriers against further progress in weather forecasting.
Nonlinearity of atmospheric systems: Successful weather forecasts are possible if the processes are understood properly, and if the current state of the atmosphere is well known. Even though the scientific understanding of atmospheric and oceanic systems has made considerable progress through a variety of research activities, including field experiments, theoretical work, and numerical simulations, atmospheric processes are inherently non-linear. Furthermore, all physical processes cannot be understood or represented in NWP models. Continued research efforts, using computer technology and physical measurements, will improve these approximations. Even then, it will not be possible to represent all atmospheric motions and processes in NWPs, especially over tropical regions.
Limitations in observations: Despite recent advances, there are limitations in making observations, especially in desert areas and oceans. As a result, there is a need for improved observation systems and methods to assimilate these data into NWP models.
Sub-seasonal prediction: Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the development and application of short-range to medium-range weather forecasts and seasonal climate predictions. However, forecasting on the time scale beyond 14 days to season (sub-seasonal time scale) that lies between daily weather and seasonal climate has received much less attention because it is considered a predictability desert. Sub-seasonal to seasonal prediction is a crucial planning window for the agricultural sector, water resource management, and other stakeholders, such as transport planners. There is a growing interest in the scientific community to develop forecasts that would fill the gap between medium-range weather forecasts and long-range or seasonal ones. This interest in sub-seasonal prediction was triggered not only by a growing demand from potential users, but also from the progress in areas such as medium-range forecasting, as well as the predictive sources like Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), over the past decades
Weather forecasting in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka has major challenges in forecasting weather due to its geographical location. Sri Lanka is close to the equator and is surrounded by the Indian Ocean, where observation density is sparse. Some atmospheric processes in the tropical region are not fully understood and impossible to resolve due to technology constraints. Data sparseness in the surrounding ocean, lack of scientific understanding of some weather systems inherent to the tropical region, and frequent, vigorous changes in the equatorial tropical atmosphere hinder the accuracy of weather forecasting in Sri Lanka.
It is important to understand that, even with advancements in science, some meteorological phenomena associated with extreme weather events will remain inherently unpredictable.
However, the advances in computational technology, together with improvements in physical representation of the main atmospheric processes, have increased the accuracy of forecasts. It has prompted the use of short-range NWP forecasts and seasonal forecasts in many activities dependent on weather and climate.
The Department of Meteorology (DoM) runs the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for operational purposes, as a tool in short range and medium-range forecasting. The present system has 15x15 km2 horizontal resolutions for the outer domain, and 5x5 km2 for the inner domain covering Sri Lanka. The DoMs goal is to provide detailed, accurate, and reliable information for weather-dependent customers and stakeholders.
Therefore, the use of a very high-resolution limited area NWP model with horizontal grid size of nearly 1 km, is well justified for countries like Sri Lanka which have highly varying terrain from the central highlands (containing many complex topographical features such as ridges, peaks, plateaus, basins, and valleys) to low-lying plains. To achieve this goal, institutional strengthening, capacity building, strengthening and enhancement of the observation network and enhancement of research activities is important. In addition, improving computer resources, such as high-end computer servers, is needed.
The DoM currently provides seasonal as well as monthly probabilistic rainfall and temperature forecasts, at district levels, using statistical downscaling of global models. Monthly and seasonal climate predictions are valuable in agricultural decision-making, water resource management, and other climate sensitive activities. It is important to provide guidance on how to use probabilistic predictions to support these decisions. Some scientific research has identified that, provided with sufficient information about level of uncertainty, people would take better risk-based decisions. Understanding the limitations of weather and climate forecasts will result in the improved, rational use of forecasts and other weather information by decision-makers.

## Title: UNPs path to economic calamity

UNPs path to economic calamity
Three UNP strongmen, MPs Eran Wickramaratne, Dr. Harsha de Silva and Mangala Samaraweera in a recent public statement declared that the Economy is at edge of an abyss!
The sum total of their predicament is as follows;
* Political turmoil which has led to a credit rate down grading;
* Challenging debt payments leading to higher interest rates;
* As Speaker has said Cabinet is dissolved Finance Minister cannot obtain money from Consolidated Fund;
* Wants the President to accept their decisions so that the budget can be passed;
Except the credit rate down grading, Mangala Samaraweera and company are responsible for all others.
We are aware that the UNP was in complete control of the economic affairs of the Government till October 26, continuously being at the helm, from January 2015.
The current warning and the splash came in the wake of an announcement by Moodys Investors Service stating that they have downgraded the GOSL foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to B2 from B1 and the outlook from negative to stable.
However, the CBSL which is established under the Monetary law Act to administer and regulate the monetary system of the country- Immediately following Moodys statement, announced that Moodys rating decision is unfounded. The CBSL gave the following reasoning;
* There is no change in the macro-economic policies;
* Steps are taken to maintain adequate reserve levels and to raise funds for debt repayments;
* Detailed out the possible swaps with friendly countries;
* Improved domestic financing systems ensuring better debt management;
In absolute economic terms CBSL has confidently reassured the manageable position of the economy based on Active Liability Management initiatives already in place which were even endorsed at the recent review stage of the IMFs Extended Fund Facility.
The country is faced with the dilemma of believing whom on this issue, Mangala Samaraweera and company harbouring a grievance on account of their unexpected termination or the CBSL charged with the duty of securing Economic and price stability and financial system stability of the country.
According to its track record, the CBSL has NOT failed to date in fulfilling any of these wider objectives despite the slamming and tarnishing of its image by Arjuna Mahendran who was appointed as its Governor at the insistence of Ranil Wickremesinghe, the then Minister in charge of the CBSL, who is now a fugitive evading arrest for an alleged financial crime committed during his tenure.
With regard to the political turmoil leading to the so called instability, we are constrained to state that this is an impasse created by Mangala Samaraweera and Company itself. When the President of the country acting under the constitutional provisions appointed a new PM and a new Cabinet (the constitutionality of which is not challenged hitherto), instead of following the normal established parliament procedure they started making a futile attempt to preempt a derogatory course of action by handing over a piece of paper purported to be a NCM against the Government and demanding an immediate voting on it against procedures laid down in the standing orders of Parliament. By their own action of amending the contents of that paper on a subsequent sitting of the Parliament (the purported NCM) it is now proved that they have taken a vote on a worthless paper.
From this it follows that the current imbroglio is the creation of the prosecutors themselves and if there is any economic abyss that the country is confronting it is also due to their own mishandling of the affairs during the period of their control.
We have to examine three things in this regard;
I. Whether the current situation is political instability per se;
II. Whether the rating agencies are accurate in their focus on the issue;
III. The actual reason for the dismissed Government to behave in this manner.
POLITICAL INSTABILITY
One of the basic factors taken into consideration in this determination is the propensity for a regime change. The current scenario in the country is an issue pending before Parliament. The people have given a mandate to all MPs to form a government of their choice according to the constitutional provisions. Any one or more political groups of this Parliament forming a Government should not be considered as an unprecedented political typhoon or a tsunami. In fact the correct perception should be to regard this as yet another political formation among the duly elected members of Parliament.
Existence of violence, assassinations and harmful demonstrations etc. are other reasons for attributing instability to the polity. There appears to be some kind of a concerted effort to purposely create such a scenario.
* Statements made by UNP politicians during the period the Parliament remained prorogued to the effect that there will be a blood bath when Parliament meets,
* Alleged carrying of knives into the floor of the House by two identified UNP MPs.
* The street demonstrations and fast unto death programmes
These appear to be calculated steps towards this ulterior-motive to portray the existence of a tense situation in the country.
There is no coup or any military interventions in the democratic functioning of the Government. Hence it is inappropriate for any agency, organisation or a country to spectacle the current scenario as a political instability!
MOODYS ROLE
Moody is another internationally accepted rating organisation. It is one among the three big credit rating agencies, viz. Standard and Poor (S&P), Fitch Group and Moodys. Their purpose is to rank the Borrowers credit worthiness using a standard rating scale. In the process they measure the investor loss in the event of default. Their authenticity is derived from recognition by the SEC of USA. They are affiliated to NRSRO of USA., known as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization. When a rating grading is given by an NRSRO agency the investors use that as a guide line to evaluate their risk factors and decide on the investment.
Each rating agency has its own nomenclature for ratings. But according to Moodys ratings B1 to B3 are judged as highly speculative and running a high credit risk. Their current downgrading is from B1 to B2.
This shows that even before the downgrading our rating was in the speculative, high risk range.
The UNP which was controlling the economy should be held responsible both for their policies for the state of affairs before the down grading and to their behavioural conduct contributing to create anarchy and a false sense of violence to provide the ground for Moodys to further downgrade it.
It is also pertinent to refer to the operations of these credit agencies in the historical perspective to get a clear idea about the limitations of their applications in the rating exercises. Moody is an old established company with a history of over 100 years. They also had their downgrading at different times. Eg. 1980 - Australia; 1990 - Canada and Japan; 1997- Thailand. In 1907, during a financial crisis Moody was forced to sell his business due to a shortage of capital. Their sovereign ratings too have come under severe criticisms. Several countries had to suffer heavy financial losses due to increased cost of borrowings as consequences to downgrading of the ratings in those countries.
More recently during the Sub-Prime mortgage crisis their role came under heavy attack. In 2007 they were engaged in a critical exercise of downgrading their own Ratings. There were repeated downgrading of earlier rates due to their erroneous nature. Cost of borrowings went up due to the downgrading. This situation worsened in 2008 during the World Financial crisis.
History also records instances where MOODYs were sued by the investors. In worst case scenarios Moodys had to pay heavy settlement claims in litigations against them.
It is reported that they have paid as settlement claims nearly $864 million in 2017.
There have been instances where the rating given by different rating agencies on the same borrower varying considerably. The case of Greece is an example. Because of these factors no investor will take the rating as the only guide line to determine their investments.
If they can rely on independent authentic statistical data they would take such to consideration.
The Central banks and Reserve banks are the best sources in this regard. They normally do not go shopping round the rating agencies demanding favourable rates. Hence the ratings given by Agencies have to be taken with a pinch of salt beyond any attributed infallibility.
DOWN GRADING OF SOME COMMERCIAL BANKS
This is another blow that has flared up during the prevailing calamity. The banking Industry in the country was a completely abandoned field during the past three years of the RW managed government. In the first instance under the shoddy allocation of subjects of ministries, banks were taken out of the Ministry of Finance and were even subject to undue interferences in their operations. The worst affected were the State Owned Banks. The infamous instruction by a Minister of Finance to State banks where they were dictated to make certain predetermined offers at the CBSL bond auctions now stand established at a Commission of Inquiry. The Government has resorted to commercial borrowings from several including local and foreign banks. In this exercise the State Sector banks were virtually compelled to lend to SOEs under tremendous pressure exerted. There have been instances where the Government securitized those borrowings through namesake Treasury papers / comfort letters.
It is in this background that MOODYs have announced their new downgraded credit rates in respect of a few banks. The adduced reasons are;
a. Increasing trend of the Non-Performing Loans (NPL percentages)
b. Tightening of external financial conditions
c. Domestic political instability
These factors have contributed to
I. Capital out flows
II. Increase of exchange rates
III. Depletion of foreign currency reserves
These are a direct result of the economic bungling of the RW/UNP government during the last three years. The unfavourable business climate and corruption activities that went on unabated have caused the banks to increase their NPL percentages. The actual figures show that the cumulative NPL percentage has risen to 3.6% from 2.8% between 2017 and 2018.
The International Industry standards have been significantly increased thus bringing heavy pressure on the local Banks to raise their reserve levels and asset portfolios.
The ever changing economic policy strategies within short spells due to vacillating government planning was the main cause for disturbed business climate in the country. The accelerated economic transformation envisaged under the Ranil Wickremesinghe Vision plan for 2025 prepared on the guidance by Haward Universitys Centre for International Development was a mere stillbirth. It did not serve any purpose other than the satisfaction granted to the bilateral US agencies which were linked to the Institutional network of the policy planning in this country.
Nevertheless the Vision 2025 cost us $ 3 Million in addition to the $2.3 Million spent by RW government to establish a Central programme Management Unit in the Prime Ministers Office.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) Headed by RW and assisted by his adviser Razeen Sally was found to be extremely ineffective and was disbanded by the President. This is the economic scenario that contributed to the stagnating Domestic instability that ultimately precipitated the current stalemate leading to downgrading of ratings.
Mangala Samaraweera and Company has to be reminded of the several utopian strategies like the
* Wi -fi Syndrome;
* Volkswagen episode
* One million new jobs for local and foreign job seekers facilitated under trade agreements
* The creation of a Singapore style Tamasek model Investment fund to invest our EPF, NSB, Insurance and ETF fund monies;
* Land alienations to foreign investors in lots exceeding 50,000 acres in extent;
* Colombo Port and Trincomalee Port programmes which were in the RW vision pipeline.
These are the factors that have apparently influenced the rating agencies to take into account under Domestic Policy instability for rating purposes. The Ranil Wickremesinghe regime is directly responsible for the state of affairs and it is not a matter connected with the recent political changes.
In addition our attention is also drawn to the establishment of several institutions with and without foreign Direct and indirect influences to manage the economic planning and development under the previous government headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The institute of policy studies, initially co financed by the Dutch Government including other donors such as Canada, UK, Norway and several other US corporates, banks and equity funds;
Advocata Institute, launched at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute as an independent Public Policy Think Tank working towards a free and prosperous Sri Lanka.
Millennium Challenge Corporation is a unit located within the Strategic Policy Development Unit of the Prime Ministers Office. The objective of this MCC is to influence the regulatory environment and rule of law in the South.
It is seen that Wickremesinghe has relied on former Sri Lankans including Arjuna Mahendran (Singapore), Razeen Sally (Singapore), Suri Ratnapala (Australia) as well as prominent foreign personalities in the Economic field such as George Soros, Professor Ricardo Hausmann of Venezuela, Joseph Stieglitz (who came as the chief guest of the former Prime Ministers 2023 agenda for economic prosperity) for his Vision to build Sri Lanka.
The sudden change of Government has therefore caused a serious disorientation in his activities as well as his commitments to the Western world.
What we witness today as the response of his party to the changing political scenario appears to be due to this.
So if there is an abyss before us all we can state is When we came abreast of the crevasse, we could see through it to the country beyond!

We will show majority - State Defence Minister
On November 29, the Maithri-Mahinda government will show its 113 majority, State Defence Minister Lakshman Seneviratne said.
He said despite many obstacles, the government is now ready to show its majority in Parliament on November 29.
He also said that within the next few days, the names of unexpected persons would also be revealed in connection with the Treasury Bond scandal.
Addressing a press briefing in Colombo yesterday, he blamed the media for focusing only on the current political crisis, while failing to highlight the issues that led to the President being compelled to take this decision and who created this problem.
The current situation is the result of a crisis that was brewing for the past 3  years.
From the day the President was elected, his initial efforts to appoint a Cabinet of Ministers in a scientific manner had failed miserably.
The UNP was not prepared to listen to any of his proposals. The incidents which took place during the past three years should be looked at carefully, to understand why the President was compelled to take this decision, Seneviratne said.
He noted that today the emphasis is only on the Presidents decision to dissolve Parliament and even the Bond scam has been forgotten.
We need to focus on the sequence of events that took place. The Central Bank which should have been under the Finance Minister was given to another ministry. This was a breakdown of the whole system. As the President puts it, he had tried on more than a hundred instances to discuss these matters with the UNP and come to a solution but all his efforts had failed.
Eventually the President had no choice but to take a drastic decision. Hence, today this crisis is not the problem, it is the result of a long drawn problem, he added.
Seneviratne said that the President had so far acted in the most Constitutional manner, adding that had the Speaker acted in the same manner, this issue would not have gone so far. However, he declined to comment regarding the dissolution of Parliament as it is a matter before the courts, but, said the President had acted based on proper legal advice and in keeping with the provisions of the Constitution.

A welcome move
President Maithripala Sirisenas declaration that he would appoint a special Presidential Commission to investigate into all the corrupt acts under the deposed Yahapalanaya administration is most welcome. Meeting with Colombo based foreign correspondents at his official residence in Colombo on Sunday, President Sirisena said he would appoint another commission to probe corruption and fraud of the last three and half years under the UNP led Government as he did with regard to the Central Bank Bond scam.
The President said he was keen to lead a corrupt free administration after January 08, 2015, but the bond scam put paid to all such efforts. Beginning with that sorry episode there were a string of other corrupt activities which ballooned with time forcing his hand to replace the administration. He said the appointment of a special Presidential Commission would expose new cases of corruption and fraud during the last three and half years. The full report of the Bond Commission findings is yet to be released and only selected parts of it were tabled in Parliament. The public have a right to know the full extent of the biggest financial scam in the post independence history of this country since it is public funds that were involved. The President, it is certain, would take steps to ensure the full findings will be in the public domain before long.
It is also hoped that the Presidents move would signal the start of a process where acts of corruption in Government would be dealt with in all seriousness. We say this because in the past only lip service was paid by political leaders in dealing with corruption. No commitment was shown to firmly deal with the corrupt who skimmed off the national wealth. The underlining theme of Chandrikas 1994 election campaign was to bring all the corrupt elements of the 17 year UNP rule and try them at Galle Face. As is only too well known, nothing of the sort happened. Instead the new Government that took over the reins started from the point where the old one left off as far as corruption was concerned.
However, in this instance there are positive signs to indicate that the President means business. In answer to one of the foreign correspondents, he unequivocally stated that all Rajapaksa era cases that are pending in courts will proceed as before without interruption. He is already on record as having vouched for the independence of the judiciary as demonstrated by the Supreme Court ruling circumscribing his own tenure in office and also by staying the promulgation that dissolved Parliament. Hence there is little doubt that justice would be dispensed to all wrongdoers from either side of the political divide.
The President had also reiterated that he would under no circumstance reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister even if the UNP prevailed at a no confidence motion. Some may consider this harsh considering that President Sirisena was elected through the vast bulk of the UNP vote at the instance of Wickremesinghe. But he (the President) had set out valuable points as to why he had to act this way. He was also magnanimous in acknowledging the fact and offered a way out of the impasse by expressing his readiness to appoint Karu Jayasuriya or Sajith Premadasa as a replacement. This alone showed that the President is not without gratitude. Far from it, he is ready to appoint an alternative from within the Greens, as already indicated.
The President, no doubt, would have come to the end of his tether to have taken this unprecedented move. As President, he could not turn a blind eye to the shenanigans that went around him. It is not that he did not give Ranil a chance to mend his ways as he declared in his first address to the nation soon after the regime change. No doubt the plot to assassinate him was the last straw.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa making a special statement on Sunday said what was in place was a caretaker Government installed for the specific purpose of overseeing the General Election and the skeleton Cabinet was evidence of this. Of course, all actors in the ongoing drama, will have their fingers crossed for the Supreme Court verdict on December 07. Whichever way the ruling goes stormy times are ahead, with a lengthy period of uncertainty and unrest bound to affect the economy in a serious way.
It is therefore incumbent that all parties to the conflict take steps to resolve the crisis without allowing it to drag on indefinitely. Besides, the current situation can only lead to those bent on harming the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity to fish in troubled waters. This is also the time for all religious leaders, irrespective of their political persuasions, to throw cold water to douse the fires of hatred and conflict. Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has condemned the behaviour of MPs in Parliament saying they are setting a bad example where future generations are concerned. That is a warning that all politicians should heed.

Will never reappoint Ranil as PM - President
The political unrest that occurred in the country after October 26 is not something sudden. Although it was not a grave crisis, it occurred with the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM and the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa instead. The removal of Wickremesinghe was a result of several incidents that stretched over a long period of time, said President Maithripala Sirisena, speaking to the Sri Lanka Foreign Correspondents Association (FCA) at his official residence in Colombo, on Sunday.
The President reiterated that he would never reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe to the post of Prime Minister.
Following is the full text of President Sirisenas speech:
As I see it, a certain political unrest has occurred in the country after the October 26 incident. But I dont assess it as a grave political crisis. The reason for this is the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post of Prime Minister.
This was not a sudden occurrence. It was the result of several incidents that stretched over a long period of time. I assumed duties as President on January 9, 2015. Immediately afterwards, Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed Prime Minister even though he had only 41 members of Parliament. This had done after removing D.M. Jayaratne from the post of Prime Minister when he had 162 members out of a total membership of 225 in Parliament. I offered Ranil Wickremesinghe all facilities and privileges to enable him to function as Prime Minister.
Within the first week itself, namely, the third week in January 2015, a disagreement occurred between the two of us about our work plan. It was about the appointment of a Cabinet of Ministers. My election manifesto clearly stated that according to the yahapalana concept, a Cabinet of Ministers would be appointed according to a scientific basis.
This was in keeping with a report formulated by a three-member committee of university dons chaired by Prof. Hettige. I gave this report to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and said Ministers should be appointed according to it. But Wickremesinghe ignored it and divided subjects between Ministers in an arbitrary manner. An example was the Higher Education and Highways Ministry.
When I visited foreign countries within the first year of office and held discussions at diplomatic level to reach development agreements, they questioned me as to whether Higher Education and Highways were in tandem.
From 1947 state banks had functioned under the purview of the Finance Minister. For the first time in history, Wickremesinghe took state banks away from this Finance Ministry. The Central Bank had always been under the Finance Minister. But the Prime Minister took the Central Bank under his wing. Then the Cultural Ministry was bifurcated and one of its sections was created as Internal Affairs and Wayamba Development. Certain institutions were linked to the Education Ministry. Ministers were not divided in a scientific basis. This was the first clash.
Then came the appointment of the Central Bank Governor. When he proposed the name of Arjuna Mahendran, I told him that Mahendran was not a Sri Lanka resident. But as Economic Policy and Planning Minister, Wickremesinghe insisted on appointing Arjuna Mahendran and pleaded with me to appoint him as Central Bank Governor. Finally I acceded to his request and appointed Arjuna Mahendran as Governor against my wish.
As leader of the UNP which was among the 49 parties and organisations which supported my campaign, Wickremesinghe made a great sacrifice. As such, I felt that I should not create clashes and misunderstandings at the very inception. I gave in to him with good intentions because we had to move forward peacefully. Hundreds of these unsuitable occurrences and clashes have happened over the last three-and-a-half years.
People elected me as President to ensure a clean administration and act against bribery and corruption and misuse of power, create a law abiding society and uphold the supremacy of the law.
But as you know, just three months after I became President and he became Prime Minister, the first Central Bank fraud occurred and it was a grave one. Another Central Bank fraud occurred just three months afterwards. A Presidential Commission was appointed to look into it and evidence was heard. Arjuna Mahendran is the first defendant in this case and he is in hiding today. Ranil Wickremesinghe knows Mahendrans whereabouts, because he was his good friend. An international warrant has been issued for Mahendrans arrest. Wickremesinghe did not show any interest in getting Mahendran to surrender to court.
This was the biggest and the largest robbery of state funds which led to mass protests. It was to calm down the situation that I appointed a Presidential Commission to probe the Central Bank bond scam. When protests against the bond scam heightened, the Central Banks functions got disrupted. Arjuna Mahendran, instead of resigning from the post, went on leave. Around 8 am in the morning, I spoke to a Central Bank Deputy Governor and said I will come over around 10 am. When I got ready to visit the Central Bank, an employee informed me that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had arrived to see me. Wickremesinghe never visited me unannounced. But on this day I saw that he was restless and under deep mental stress.
I asked him why he had come suddenly. Then he asked me whether I was going to the Central Bank. I told him I had decided to go there to calm down the situation since the employees there were unsettled. As I got down from my car near the Central Bank, Arjuna Mahendran, who was on leave, came and received me with a sheaf of betel leaves. I didnt not care about it because Mahendran was an accused by then. When I moved a few feet forward, I came across Ranil Wickremesinghe. He must have got Mahendran to come and receive me. I spoke to the Central Bank staff and told them to be calm and start work, promising an investigation to settle all problems.
I hope to appoint a Presidential Commission to probe fraud and corruption committed during the government from 2015 to October 25, 2018, when Ranil Wickremesinghe was Prime Minister. More startling facts may emerge when it starts investigations.
We all entertain an idea about decentralisation of power without dividing the nation and encouraging minority participation in government. We took some steps towards this end, but they were not successful. Ranil Wickremesinghe was a great proponent of decentralisation of power, but during the last three-and-a-half years he tried to withdraw some of the powers given to provincial councils in the sphere of local government Education, Economic Affairs, Sustainable Development and Environment.
World leaders love their country whichever political vision they subscribe to. But as I see it, Ranil Wickremesinghe does not seem to love his country. He loves neo-liberalism.
Another extremely corrupt deal of recent times was the EAP transaction relating to Swarnawahini which belonged to the Central Bank. Ranil Wickremesinghe without informing the Cabinet called for tenders through his economic management committee to sell EAP (Private) Ltd.
The highest bidders were local businessmen who quoted US dollars 65 million and 70 million. But EAP Ltd was sold to a Singaporean company for US dollars 35 million incurring a large loss to the government. Large sums were given as pay offs to several local politicians. The Hilton transaction was another corrupt deal.
Then the proposed Lands (Special Provisions) Act and the Land Bank were not approved by the Cabinet. I halted both because they were against indigenous principles.
When results of the February 10 Local Government Elections were announced, I told Wickremesinghe that we received a such a humiliating defeat due to his political and economic policies and requested him to step down. Several times I invited Karu Jayasuriya to become Prime Minister and he declined the offer.
Three months before appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, I invited Sajith Premadasa to take over the post saying I cannot work with Ranil Wickremesinghe. He too was not prepared to take it.
The situation became more serious when the alleged plot to assassinate me came to light. The individual who gave the information also submitted a tape. The informant also named a Cabinet Minister. The IGP before conducting any investigation said the allegation was suspicious.
Two months had passed after beginning an investigation into the plot, but to date Ranil Wickremesinghe has not asked me anything about it so far.
The IGP had issued firearms to the DIG concerned who is in remand now without any legal or procedural basis.
Social media networks friendly with the Prime Minister were ridiculing this alleged plot as a mere comedy. Against such a background I could not move forward with Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister.
I have been in politics for the last 51 years and I have spurned bribery and corruption. I honour democratic principles and always work according to the Constitution.
With a great sense of humility, I have transferred enormous powers vested in the Executive President to Parliament.
Appointing a new Prime Minister, removal of the former Prime Minister, dissolution of Parliament, proroguing of Parliament, and dissolution of the Cabinet of Ministers have all been done in keeping with the provisions of the Constitution. All these actions have not been challenged in court except the dissolution of Parliament.
I wish to thank all party leaders and the Speaker for using the electronic voting system at the last sitting of Parliament as suggested by me.
I am a person who has always respected the majority decision in Parliament. Today we cannot not predict as to who will command a majority in Parliament on November 29.
If a majority is shown on that day according to the voting system I have suggested, I will have to accept it. Even if the UNF clearly shows a majority in Parliament on November 29, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would decide on the way he should work.
But I will never appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister again in my whole life.
I have told them not to bring Ranil Wickremesinghe to me along with them even if they show a majority because I will never reappoint him. This is not a personal clash, but a clash of principles.
