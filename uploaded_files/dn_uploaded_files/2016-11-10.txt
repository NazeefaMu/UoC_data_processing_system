CH determined to remain in local rugby arena
In 1892 the Colombo Hockey and Football Club (CH & FC) was mooted. Its headquarters was at the Racecourse and catered to rugby with ample playing area and with well kept grounds. It pretty soon attracted some of the best exponents of the game. Before long The Club gathered a reputation for fielding outstanding players in rugby. Many went on to play nationally and represent Ceylon (Sri Lanka). In 1962 when the Army acquired the Grandstand and the Racecourse, CH & FC moved to Maitland Crescent.
In 1959, for various reasons that prevailed at that time there clubs came together and decided to call themselves The Gymkhana Club.. The first chairman elect was FC Rowan. At that time the membership of the club was almost totally made up of expatriates. With the passage of time the Europeans left the shores of Sri Lanka. However, the spirit and soul of Gymkhana never did. Ideals and values that made it outstanding remained stronger than ever. By 1964 Sri Lankans with the same vision took the reins. The first Sri Lankan chairman was P S C Fernando in 1969. The first rugby captain in 1971 was Brian Baptist.
The CH & FC rugby team has been among the top five rugby in the island. During the stellar years of 1990-1994 they won almost all the titles and accolades for rugby.
The Colombo Hockey and Football Club as one of the oldest rugby playing clubs in the country will give out their best in this upcoming 2016/17 rugby season to stay in the local rugby arena. Due to financial crisis they had to withdraw from last years local rugby season.
They have last won the coveted league title in 2000 under the leadership of former Science College captain cum national third row forward Nazeem Mohamad.
CH will be strengthened by the inclusion of their vastly experienced and talented school rugby players this year around.
According to reliable sources, with rugby losing its facilities to practice and play matches on the ground due to the SLRFU changing the local rugby season which clashes now with the cricket and the professionalism coming into the game due to lot of money involvement most of their experienced players have left the club to join other clubs CH have got a very inexperienced and immature rugby squad as most of the players are schoolboys who are playing club rugby for the first time this season. They have to start all over again from zero and are in the process of team rebuilding stage. The players as a team can put up a reasonable show this season. CH players and officials dont want any scenario to happen where they have to stop playing half way through the season like last year. CH will want to prove a point to Sri Lanka rugby lovers and club supporters that they are a strong club hence they will not give up rugby at any cost. They expect discipline to be at its best among their club players and this must be the last chance for them, so if players dont take this years season seriously, then it will be a sorry scenario for CH rugby.
This year the club will be captained by one of their most experienced players in centre three quarter Chanaka Fonseka, an ex Isipathana College ruggerite.
The coaching staff comprises vastly experienced head coach in the caliber of former national captain Namal Rajapaksa and another vastly experienced former CH rugby player Anwar Jayah will function as the manager for this upcoming rugby season.
CH and FC Squad:
Chanaka Fonseka (captain), Anuradha Ekanayake, Ameen Jamail, Cload Chanaka, Gihan Hewage, Charindu Perera, Akila Jayasundara, Lakith Perera, Saranga Uthpala, Niroshan Karunanayake, Dhilshan Fonseka, Andrew Benson, Prabhath Jayalath, Lushan Lankajeewa, Ashroof Muzmi, Akesh Weerakoon, Udara Lakshan, Ashan Indika, Nizmi Nillar, Janith Chandimal, Aquil Nizam, Didula Rajapaksa, Devinda Colombage, Steven Nelson, Viraj Hewage, Ravindu Soysa, Praveen de Silva, Shehan Deepal, Lahiru Weerappulige, Dimal Jayasinghe, Vishva Deneth, Mohamed Rizwan, Inzam Irfan, Lahiru Mudalige, Dinesh Liyanage, Kavindu Sankalpa, Amith Madusanka, Rizkhan Siddiq, Prasad Perera, Andrew Benson, Steive Nelson, Nizmin, Tharindu Hasaranga, Udesh Perera, Ganidu Hewage, Udara Madusanka, Faran, Viraj Hewage, Migara Madugalle, Akash, Gazali Ifthikar, Sajith Bandara, Lahiru Prabod, Shayan Rodrigo.

Herath spins  Sri Lanka towards Zimbabwe sweep

HARARE, Wednesday: Rangana Herath registered his second five-wicket haul in as many days as Sri Lanka closed in on victory in the second Test against Zimbabwe at Harare Sports Club on Wednesday.
Herath followed up his five-wicket haul in the first innings with 5 for 45 in the second as Zimbabwe, set 491 to win, went to stumps on the fourth evening on 180 for seven.
The feat not only took Herath to 50 wickets in the calendar year -- in just his eighth Test -- but also gave him the seventh 10-wicket match haul in his career.
The tourists began the fourth day on 102 for four in their second innings, with an overall lead of 334, and spent the first half of the day extending that advantage.
Sri Lanka batsman Kusal Perera employs the reverse sweep shot which he used quite often during his knock of 62 off 69 balls in the Sri Lanka second innings. AFP

With Dimuth Karunaratne anchoring the innings with a patient 88 and Kusal Perera adding a quickfire 62 towards the end, Sri Lanka were able to declare their second innings on 258 for nine to set Zimbabwe 491 to win.
Left with 136 overs to bat in order to save the match, Zimbabwe were soon reduced to 39 for three before a 74-run stand for the fourth wicket between Sean Williams and Craig Ervine briefly revived them.
Once Williams edged to slip off Lahiru Kumara to fall for 45, Sri Lanka were able to chip away at the middle order and move within three wickets of a 2-0 series sweep.
Ervine reached stumps unbeaten on 65, with Donald Tiripano for company.

Sri Lanka flies home after 1-1 draw with Macau

Sri Lanka who was defeated in their first two matches in the ongoing Asia Solidarity Cup Soccer Championship in Malaysia fought a battle of honour against Macau to force a one- all draw at the Sarawak Stadium in Negiri, Kuching yesterday.
Sri Lanka dominated the game with an early goal by Kavindu Ishan who found the net following a superb pass from Mohamed Rifnaz in the fifth minute. They were leading the game until Macaus Voi Weing found the equalizer in the 85th minute. It was a moral boosting goal for the Macau players who restored their unbeaten status in the tournament.
The Sri Lankans were unfortunate to miss two easy scoring chances during the second half where the ball struck the goal post and went astray. Sri Lanka made three substitutions during the second half, but could not break the strong Macau defence to score the decisive goal.
The match cost Sri Lankas probability to enter the semi-final round. The team will fly home via Kuala Lumpur tonight.
Sri Lanka last played against Macau in the 2014 Lusofonia Games in India where they emerged victorious. Even in the 2014 match it was Kavindu Ishan who scored a goal against Macau. Sri Lanka is ranked at 193 while Macau is two behind at 195 in the World Football rankings.
Macau will meet Brunei while Nepal will take on Mongolia in the semis on November 12. The winners will battle for the Asia Solidarity Cup in the final on November 15.

Root, Ali frustrate India in first Test

RAJKOT, Wednesday: Joe Root said England played fantastic cricket Wednesday after his sparkling century helped the tourists reach 311 for four at stumps on the opening day of the first Test against India.
The 25-year-old put on 179 with Moeen Ali, who reached the close one run shy of his century, after India's spinners had reduced the tourists to 102-3 on a placid track.
Ali, who is on the verge of his fourth Test century, was at the crease with Ben Stokes who was on 19 at Rajkot's Saurashtra Cricket Association ground.
Root smashed 11 fours and a six during his 124-run knock before being caught and bowled by Umesh Yadav, who almost dropped the chance as he rushed to celebrate the dismissal.
With Ali standing tall at one end, England looked set for a big first innings total, vindicating captain Alastair Cook's decision to bat first. Root celebrated his 11th Test ton, and third against India, by waving his bat towards a grateful England dressing room.
In completing the feat, Root became the first overseas player to score a century in India since Australia's Michael Clarke in 2013.
"The way we played throughout the day was fantastic," Root said after the day's play.
"We always thought that seam bowling would be useful early on, but the guys handled it well and that allowed the boys in the middle order to build partnerships.
"I look forward to watching Moeen bat all day tomorrow too. It's pleasing, something to build on and a good position to be in."
Ali put in a focused performance, negotiating 192 balls during his 243-minute stay at the crease.
The Root-Ali pair piled on the misery for India who were also set back by an injury to pace spearhead Mohammed Shami.
Earlier, a gripping opening session saw opener Haseeb Hameed, 19, become the fifth youngest player to play for England. The youngster, dubbed "Baby Boycott" for his unflappable style, made 31 during his 98 minutes at the crease before falling lbw to top-ranked spinner Ravichandran Ashwin (2-108).
Ashwin also dismissed Ben Duckett for 13 but went wicketless in the last two sessions.
Hameed and Cook (21) both benefited from the largesse of India's fielders who dropped some early chances.
Cook was dropped off Shami on the third ball of the innings, while Hameed got a reprieve on 13 when Murali Vijay grassed his catch at first slip.
The England skipper, who surpassed Michael Atherton's record of 54 Tests as England captain, was adjudged leg before off left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja.
TV replays showed the ball would have missed the leg stump but Cook did not refer to the third umpire even though the decision review system is being used for the first time by India in a home series.
Hameed showed little sign of nerves against top-ranked India, hitting Shami for boundaries twice in an over and driving Ashwin for an elegant four in the covers.
India's batting coach Sanjay Bangar conceded the sloppy fielding had cost his side dearly.

Facile win  for England Women  in first ODI

England Women cricketers drew first blood in the four-match one-day international series against Sri Lanka Women when they won the first ODI quite easily by eight wickets with 21 overs to spare at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Winning the toss and batting first Sri Lanka Women managed to total a moderate 168-8 in their 50 overs.
Their top five batters all got starts getting into the twenties but none managed to stay long enough to play a big innings.
Sri Lanka Womens new pair of openers Hasini Perera and Nipuni Hansika got the innings off to a fine start with a half-century partnership but from their onwards wickets fell at regular intervals and there was no substantial partnership to sustain the innings.
Needing to score at less than three and a half runs an over England Women cruised to their target scoring at over 5 runs an over to win with ease.
An opening stand of 71 between Lauren Winfield and Tammy Beaumont got them moving rapidly towards their target score.
Skipper Heather Knight and Natalie Sciver saw England Women home with an unfinished stand of 82.
The second ODI is scheduled at the R Premadasa Stadium for November 12.

Brad Pitt 'abusive behaviour' investigation closed

An investigation into whether actor Brad Pitt was abusive towards his son in September has ended with no finding of wrongdoing, US media report.
Social workers in Los Angeles had been examining claims Pitt hit his 15-year-old son Maddox on a private jet.
His wife Angelina Jolie filed for divorce the day after the incident. They had been married for two years, but together for more than a decade.
Pitt is seeking joint custody of their six children.
A spokesman for the LA Department of Children and Family Services said the agency could not confirm it investigated Pitt.
Jolie cited "irreconcilable differences" when she filed to end the marriage on 19 September.
Pitt and Jolie grew close while shooting the 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith, in which they played a couple in a stagnant relationship. They got married in 2014.
Their union was Pitt's second marriage, after a divorce from Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller.
The couple have six children together - Maddox, Pax, and Zahara, who are adopted, and biological children Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne.
Pitt, 52, and Jolie, 41, married privately at their French estate in Provence. Their children served as ring bearers and helped illustrate Jolie's white Versace dress with their drawings.
Both actors are known for their philanthropic work away from the screen. Angelina Jolie was a UNHCR goodwill ambassador for more than a decade.
