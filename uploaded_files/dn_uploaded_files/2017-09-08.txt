HUMANIZING EDUCATION  AND CULTURE
The Government holds a monopoly in Education which is called free education because education in government and other government assisted institutions is given without any charge. Yet in practice, the quality of education given is such that even after taking tuition at a heavy price it still remains a stumbling block alienating the students from the rest of the world, due to the vernacular languages of instruction.
In Sri Lanka, due to the governments, whether of the UNP or SLFP or UNP-SLFP, not being able to tackle and solve several problems in education, people and communities do not connect and while staying so close remain so far from one another.
The downgrading of English has also been another barrier to reconciliation and therefore to humanization. Nor has the government been able to improve the quality of the teachers in schools in rural areas so that the desire of parents to opt for far-away urban schools may be avoided.
The successive Governments have also not specified what kind of monopoly it holds over what order of education even after the spiteful and ill-considered take-over of the denominational schools and vesting them in the Government on October 24, 1960 for a purported unified national system of education which has remained vague.
The lack of clarity over the manner of the Governments overall direction and setting guidelines to all academic, technical and professional standards of education in Sri Lanka and the freedom in education has not only hindered the progress of education, it has prevented the beneficial participation of other stakeholders in education and contributed to the over-commercialization of education with the profit-motive as a driving force.
At a certain stage in human development, human beings abandoned the unsettled life of hunting for livelihood and took to the settled life of agriculture, cultivating the land for grain and vegetables. Culture is derived from agriculture. To be cultured as a human person is to be well cultivated, to be well bred and knowledgeable, able to be outgoing and relate to other human beings on an equal level, to be always peaceable, truthful, honest, sincere, just, virtuous and to be appreciative of what is good and honourable, to have an aesthetic sense, to be refined and noble in thought, word and deed, to be reliable and fraternal as a human person
Today the government by law compels parents to send their children to a school where they have imparted instructions according to set syllabi and their minds fed with information. Government schools have a set regimen and a broadly stereotype school curricula at primary and secondary level grades.
But the governments cannot / should not monopolize the learning process of human beings at any stage of their lives or in any kind of environment or institution nor hinder new initiatives in the field of education.
TEACHERS: HUMANIZING LEADERS
While school and university environment should have its own discipline and concerns including the ecological, there should not be over compartmentalization and rigid regimentation that could dehumanize some individuals. Bullying and ragging should have no place at all in educational institutions. Nor should school education leave some students behind as a result of inadequate attention to them by the teachers.
It is through careful attention to all the students that attentive teachers could discern in the students other qualities beyond the academic and observe the talents, gifts, and abilities the development of which could enhance their humanness and lead them into alternative spheres of study and work essential to any community. To be gifted with other talents is not to be less remarkable.
At present, the humanizing and leadership qualities of the teachers in educational institutions have not been given sufficient attention. The overall school environment in which students indeed learn, the pedagogical methods and the indispensable role of leadership of the teacher that humanizes education has not been focused on. As a result, the school turns out to be like an impersonal bureaucratized educational factory rather than an institution with a family spirit. When parents cannot have meaningful contacts with the teachers and those in charge of students, the school environment is less human, it becomes impersonal, anonymous and even bureaucratic.
The politicization of education and the foolish understanding and emphasis on irrational prestige have made some schools far too large. Some far too small schools without well-trained teachers and sufficient facilities have been founded to satisfy narrow partisan appetites of local politicians.
The legislation, lack of sound educational policy and planning, party politics and far-too-big schools have complicated education and distorted pedagogical principles to the detriment of the humanization of education; humanization is the all round physical, intellectual, spiritual, ethico-moral, social and human development of all the students without anyone getting left behind. Our universities at least have not grown far-too-big. This is indeed helpful for all the students and staff to be university minded and have fruitful inter-faculty academic and other relations. Whether/how meaningful inter-faculty academic and intellectual relations are cultivated and time-wasting and destructive political protests drastically curtailed need to be examined. The relations and tensions between the university and society at large should be healthy and not destructive.
The university dons who have greatly influenced students and are appreciated for their contribution to university education and overall intellectual contribution and cultural enhancement of the country are those who have been also humanizing the university education environment and consequently society at large. It is sad if such university teachers of high calibre, who not only could contribute with their advice on many a national question and uplift the whole of the national community and are embodiments of valuable aspects of culture, are not remunerated sufficiently. Foreign universities remain a constant attraction to them for more than one reason.
Education should not only equip the educated person to be an integrally developed person with developed abilities and skills that are useful and needed by society but also develop such a person to be civically and socio-politically responsible. This means that he is concerned not only about his own and his familys well-being but also about the affairs and the common good of the larger community.
WELL-BRED HUMAN BEINGS
To be humanized is to be bred, cultivated and disciplined in those basic qualities that enhance the human being and keep him always refined and cultured in his conversation, inter-personal relations, conduct, and behaviour. Such persons have minds and hearts; they are understanding, humble and compassionate; they could be persuasive with their intellectual sharpness, uplifting without being snobbish, are never arrogant or haughty; they never exploit or manipulate others for self-gain; they often strive to be accommodative without compromising on principles.
Every teacher trained to excel in the role of humanization while exemplifying with her / his own life all that is of human worth and honour, should be able to say to their students, as in the Book of Proverbs, My Son/daughter, listen to my words and accept guidance with a will, for they will be a crown of grace for your head and a garland of grace for your neck (Book of Proverbs 23.26; 1.9). Those who have not listened then to their parents and teachers at home and school, now, even as elected representatives do not listen to the people but act imprudently according to their whims and earn disgrace.
When education has humanized all who have been educated, all are equal and free, all are responsible, relate well to one another and are civic minded. They do not neglect their social duties nor look for loop-holes to escape liability, accountability, and answerability over their obligations to society.
Those involved in the abuse of power, corruption, Bond scams, evasion of taxes, issues of conflicts of interest and trade-union blackmailing of poor citizens as done by the GMOA, could be considered as people who have dehumanized themselves through an education with many flaws. Paradoxically and regrettably they consider themselves adept in politics, economics, finance, banking, medicine, law, and diplomacy when they are nothing but experts in conning, swindling, deceiving; they are hypocrites and whitened sepulchres.
PROJECT NEEDING ATTENTION
At a certain stage in human development, human beings abandoned the unsettled life of hunting for livelihood and took to the settled life of agriculture, cultivating the land for grain and vegetables. Culture is derived from agriculture. To be cultured as a human person is to be well cultivated, to be well bred and knowledgeable, able to be outgoing and relate to other human beings on an equal level, to be always peaceable, truthful, honest, sincere, just, virtuous and to be appreciative of what is good and honourable, to have an aesthetic sense, to be refined and noble in thought, word and deed, to be reliable and fraternal as a human person.
To humanize our culture means to endow all human beings in our national community with the qualities of well-bred and responsible human beings. This has to be brought about in our homes and in all other places and institutions where education is imparted.
It is only from a well humanized education and cultured national community that we could expect to have good legislators, good judicial officers, good administrators, good professionals, good citizens in our society, who will not create social confusion and intractable problems for others but who will help order all things as well as they could and as well as they should for all to live happy and peaceful lives. Therefore, the project of humanizing education and culture is a project to which we should all give sufficient and careful attention.

Hurricane Irma responsible for 10 deaths, threatens Miami

The National Hurricane Center has issued hurricane and storm surge warnings for South Florida. The warning extends from Jupiter Inlet on the east coast of the state, southward around the Florida Peninsula to Bonita Beach on the west coast. The warning included the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee, and Florida Bay. The same area had previously been under a hurricane watch.
Conditions in the Turks and Caicos deteriorated Thursday as deadly and massiveHurricane Irma moved in on the islands -- and continued tracking toward South Florida where it could slam Miami this weekend.
"It has become more likely that Irma will make landfall in southern Florida as a dangerous major hurricane, and bring life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts to much of the state," the National Hurricane Center said Thursday.
The hurricane center forecast moved the most likely path of the eye of the storm to the west in its 5 p.m. ET advisory.
"It looks like it's shifting, even though it may be just 20 miles, it puts Miami right in the worst possible position," CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said.
"Because when you look at the formidable storm, the strongest winds, the strongest storm surge, the bands of heavy rain are always in that north, northeastern quadrant."
But Sater cautioned that some models show the storm farther west and some farther east. It is still more than 600 miles from Florida.
Irma, aCategory 5 stormchurning in the Atlantic with 175 mph sustained winds, killed at least 10 people on Wednesday as it devastated small northeastern Caribbean islands such as Barbuda and left hundreds of thousands of customers in Puerto Rico without power.
"Regardless of which (Florida) coast you live on, be prepared to evacuate," Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Thursday at a news conference, with forecasters warning the storm could reach South Florida by Sunday.
Mandatory evacuations have been issued for many counties in South Florida, but Scott said others in Florida need to watch Irma's path and be ready to move.
"This is not a storm you can sit and wait through," he said. He added later: "You don't have to drive hundreds of miles or leave the state to be safe. Go to shelters."
Georgia, too, is ordering coastal evacuations. People in the Savannah area and everywhere along the coast east of Interstate 95 -- including Brunswick and St. Simons Island -- are ordered to leave, starting Saturday,Gov. Nathan Deal said.
Irma still was battering the mountainous, northern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Thursday afternoon. It could dump up to 15 inches of rain there -- an amount that could trigger dangerous flooding and mudslides, the US National Hurricane Center said.
Meanwhile, the northeastern Caribbean islands just hit by Irma are anxiously watching Hurricane Jose to the east. On Thursday, Antigua and Barbuda issued ahurricane watch for Jose, which could pass close to those islands Saturday. Prime Minister Gaston Browne said the government has called for voluntary evacuations from Barbuda.
Irma left at least 10 people dead Wednesday, including four on St. Martin, four in the US Virgin Islands, one on Anguilla, and one on Barbuda, officials said. The latter is barely habitable, with nearly all its buildings damaged, Browne said.
Jose became the third major hurricane of the Atlantic basin season on Thursday, with winds of 120 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The Category 3 storm is about 625 miles east-southeast of Antigua.
Here are the latest developments
Around 8 p.m. ET, Irma's center was about 55 miles west-southwest of Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph. Hurricane-force winds could be felt as far as 70 miles from the center. Irma previously had winds over 180 mph, keeping those speeds longer than any storm ever recorded in the Atlantic basin.
Irma could cross the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday evening and be near the central Bahamas on Friday.
Hurricane warnings are in effect for parts of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern, central and northwestern Bahamas.
A hurricane watch has been issued for Jupiter Inlet on Florida's east coast to Bonita Beach on the west coast. It includes the Florida Keys to Lake Okeechobee.
Gov. Scott said Thursday he has directed Florida law enforcement to escort gas trucks to gas stations in an attempt to address reported fuel shortages. "We know fuel is very important" as people prepare to evacuate inland, he said. "While we're making progress, you will see lines and outages, unfortunately."
Irma is one of three active hurricanes in the Atlantic basin the last time this happened was in 2010.
South-eastern US bracing for storm's arrival
Some computer models show Irma nearing Florida's southern and east coasts by Sunday, and potentially threatening Georgia and South Carolina later. Florida officials areordering some evacuations and shutting down schools.
Many Floridians spent Thursday stocking up on food or making plans to head inland. Video fromCNN affiliate WSVNshowed Miami International Airport crowded with people waiting to leave the area. Miami resident Ashley Hahn was at a beach Thursday with her 4-year-old daughter, saying they were taking a final few dips before fleeing the storm.
"It is chaotic with the lines and gasoline and waiting for water -- you kind of need a break," she said.
"We are probably going to head north, just to be safe. I went through(1992's Hurricane) Andrew was a child, and ... I have seen videos of destruction and everything that it entails. I don't want (my daughter) to be around for that."
Monroe County administrator Roman Gastesi stressed to residents in the Keys they need to heed the evacuation order and leave.
"You might as well leave now, while you have a chance, because when you dial 911, you will not get an answer," he said.
Florida is not the only state preparing for possible impact.
Georgia's Gov. Deal declared a state of emergency for 30 counties. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster also declared states of emergency.
Turks and Caicos, Bahamas in Irma's path
Irma was bringing heavy rain and powerful winds to the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands on Thursday. Residents were told to stay put.
"It's hunker down. Stay where you are. Because you can't go out, because the winds are just far, far too strong," Gov. John Freeman told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360."
The governor said the hospital on Grand Turk Island was among 15 buildings that had roof damage or loss.
Storm surges could reach up to 20 feet, the National Hurricane Center says -- twice as high as some of the islands' elevations.
"Some of these Turks and Caicos (Islands) will be completely overwashed," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.
The Turks and Caicos are a British overseas territory with about 35,000 people. Officials there are "working intensively on disaster preparedness and response ... (and) liaising with their counterparts in the Cayman Islands for assistance," UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Alan Duncan said Thursday.
The Bahamas, a nation of about 390,000, ordered evacuations for six southern islands -- Mayaguana, Inagua, Crooked Island, Acklins, Long Cay and Ragged Island.
"This is the largest such evacuation in the history of the country," Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.
Capt. Stephen Russell of the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency said the concern was over the power of the storm surge and the potential it will have catastrophic results.

Instagram star paid to travel the world
When Nicola Easterby travelled to Nepal, she did not settle for a hotel in Kathmandu.
The 22-year-old experienced what life is really like for the countrys people, having travelled to a little village in the Nepalese mountains.
We slept on the floor surrounded by rats and giant spiders, bathed in the river, watched our dinner be killed in front of our eyes, had dance parties with the local Nepalese kids and got stuck in a flash flood, she told Daily Mail Australia.
I will always cherish this experience of actually getting to live like a local.
Miss Easterby runs the travel blog Polkadot Passport. Her Instagram page, that has a staggering 151,000 followers, takes you around the world from the rocky outcrops of Californias Death Valley to the tea plantations of Sri Lanka.
In fact, in the space of four years she has visited 35 different countries. But surprisingly the Brisbane resident did not set out to become a travel blogger.
After going to university for a year I knew I couldnt stay in one place any longer, so I took a gap year (which I am still on four years later), saved up all the money I could and took off on a four-month expedition across Europe, Miss Easterby said.
I never intended to get into travel blogging, in fact, I simply started my blog as a place to share photos of my overseas adventures with my family and friends so I could stop spamming everyone on Facebook. It took a long time before I even realised people could make money from blogging. In fact, it wasnt until I randomly attending a seminar on How to become a full-time blogger that the concept even crossed my mind. Over the course of about a year and half, my blog and Instagram started gaining some momentum and I started to think hey, maybe I can make something of this.
The first two years Miss Easterby spent travelling were entirely self funded.
She worked multiple casual jobs and ran a photography business to make her travel dreams a reality, but thanks to her blog, a large portion of her travels are now funded by companies or subsidised by hotels, tourism boards and tourism operators.
One of her favourite places to visit has been Turkey.
It is such a unique country that offers this crazy mix of mind-blowing landscapes, a rich culture, delicious food and fascinating history, she said.
I think its really underrated as a destination and I hope that changes as they really need the income from tourism at the moment. In terms of natural beauty, Switzerland takes some beating. I love the mountains so that place speaks to my soul. And my favourite city by far is Budapest. It is such a beautiful and vibrant city without being overwhelmingly busy or big.
Miss Easterby has spent the past two years splitting her time between Brisbane and abroad, but recently relocated to Europe where she plans to settle down.
Her biggest tip for other travellers was to slow down and appreciate the moment.
Travel slowly, carefully and thoughtfully, she said.
Every time you get to a place, go to a coffee shop for a few hours and immerse yourself in the atmosphere around you. If you are visiting a famous landmark or landscape, dont just take a photo and leave. Find a quiet spot to sit and appreciate the splendour of what it is youve travelled half way across the world to see. Take in the sights, smells, sounds and tastes of everything around you.
While her Instagram page might indicate otherwise, Miss Easterby said there were some challenges that came with travelling full-time.
She said living out of a suitcase, not having any routine and spending time away from family and friends could take its toll.
Travelling is also very exhausting, so it is difficult to maintain energy and not get sick or burnt out, she said.
The biggest challenge that Ive had to battle with is not having a place to call home. Having said this, I have come to realise home is not about the place, but about the people. That was a really important realization for me to come to. At the end of the day, Australia will always be my home so it is always the place I will come back to. However, for the moment, being in Europe makes travelling a lot more convenient and I figure I should take the opportunity to live overseas whilst I can.

## Title: Land development under 13th Constitutional Amendment

Land development under 13th Constitutional Amendment
With regard to Provincial finance, the analysis of the provisions reveals a substantial Central Control over Provincial finance. Accordingly provisions that enable the President to give directions to a Governor when financial stability or credit of Sri Lanka or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened are found in Article 154N. In addition, Article 154R establishes a Finance Commission.
Its main duty is to make recommendations as to the principles on which funds granted annually by the Government for the use of the provinces should be apportioned between various Provinces. After all, executive power in respect of provincial matters cannot be exercised without expending money. It is finally the decision of the President, based on the Finance Commission recommendation as to how much money would be allocated for each Province. Moreover, the funds allocated and voted in Parliament shall be deposited in the Provincial Fund. Therefore finance is another instrument used by the National Government to control the activities of a Provincial Council. Moreover, the Provincial Councils Act has made the Governor of a Province the absolute custodian of the Provincial Fund.
The Act lays down that all statutes which involve expenditure from Provincial Fund of a Province shall not be passed by the Provincial Council of a Province unless the Governor has recommended to that Council the consideration of the statute. This position through more powers to the Governor is further strengthened by the provisions of the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 28 of 1990. Accordingly fiscal devolution in Sri Lanka remains unfinished in establishing Provinces as efficient and accountable providers of public service.
Land development projects
Land administration involves multifarious activities such as land disposal, land alienation, land tenure, land registration. Land development, land redistribution and land use planning. As regards the subject of land even though, land is declared as a devolved subject, it has turned out to be a central function, in terms of the provisions of Appendix II, in List 1 of the Ninth Schedule and Article 33(d) of the Constitution. Accordingly, while the Provincial Councils have power of selection of allottees, it is re-centred through the Divisional Secretary, because, the power of selection of allottees was given to the Divisional Secretary under the Transfer of Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act No. 58 of 1992.
The provisions relating to the inter  provincial irrigation and land development projects come under item 2.0 of Appendix II (Land and Land Settlement) under the Provincial Council List. Item 2.1 defines such inter  provincial irrigation schemes and land development projects. They include irrigation and land development projects (a) within the Province initiated by the State which utilizes water from rivers flowing through more than one Province. (b) projects within the Province which utilizes water through diversions from water system from outside the Province and (c) all schemes where the command area falls within two or more Provinces such as the Mahaweli Development project.
The constitutional provisions relating to state land, clearly envisage a partnership arrangement and not a rigid demarcation of activities to be exercised solely by the Centre or solely by the Province. The government and the Provincial Councils have to act on the advice of each other or consult each other before acting. For instance, while land is declared a Provincial subject, the Government may utilize land within a Province in respect of a reserved or concurrent subject after consulting the relevant Provincial Council. Similarly, any alienation or disposition of State land within a Province shall be exercised by the President (Centre) but on the advice of the Provincial Council.
Currently two Cabinet Ministries namely the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment share the responsibility for Central irrigation. Regarding rehabilitation and management of minor irrigation schemes, there is a contradiction. Although minor irrigation is a devolved subject, in practice the responsibilities related to minor irrigation are undertaken by the Department of Agrarian Development under the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Development. This situation gives rise to duplication of work, waste and even neglect of some tasks due to lack of coordination and poor accountability.
Provincial Councils system
Under Section 20(A) of the Land Development Ordinance, the Land Commissioner General is vested with the power of selecting persons and issuing of permits for State land without a land Kachcheri. After 1989, this authority was transferred to Provincial Land Commissioner (PLCs) except in inter-provincial schemes. According to Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No.12 of 1989, the Provincial Land Commissioners can implement the responsibilities of the Land Commissioner given under the Land Development Ordinance.
Moreover, in terms of the Transfer of Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act No. 58 of 1992 any powers conferred on the Government Agent can be exercised by the Divisional Secretary. Since Divisional Secretaries are directly accountable to the Ministry of Home Affairs sufficient time may not have been paid by them to the directives from the Ministry of Lands, resulting in delay and even neglect in the implementation of functions.
If the Provincial Councils system is to function smoothly and meaningfully much needs to be done legislatively and administratively to fill the lacunae in the law to ensure that the transition from a centralized system of administration to a decentralized one facilitates the achieving of the main objective of the scheme a means of power-sharing among the different ethno-cultural groups providing a settlement of the major grievances of the minority group. The present status of the Provincial Councils system with all its infirmities does not warrant such optimism.

Leprosy  treatment  at OPDs : Cases on downward trend
The Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry has launched a programme to treat leprosy patients at the Out Patients Departments (OPDs) of government hospitals since the incidence of leprosy has shown a decreasing trend.
Since leprosy is a skin disease, quick treatment at an OPD within 48 hours of contracting the disease can prevent it from spreading, the Anti-Leprosy Movement said.
The number of leprosy patients recorded in 2016 was 1,954, but the number had decreased to 974 patients in 2017. This was disclosed at a meeting presided by Minister Rajitha Senaratne at the ministry recently to resolve problems encountered by the Anti-Leprosy Movement.
It was also decided to develop the Hendala leprosy hospital situated on 7.5 acres as a hospital to teat elders.
Ministry Acting Secretary J Gunatilleke, Anti-Leprosy Movement Director P. S. Karunaratne and other officials were also present.

LG polls and local interests
The silhouette of Local Government elections is in the distant horizon. Its postponement caused public anxiety for many services rendered by local government bodies were paralyzed under the administration of Commissioners. The latter had been not so enthusiastic about public welfare.
Two issues highlighted the weakness of the existing system and the need for early elections. They are the Dengue epidemic and the issue of waste disposal.
An unduly long time was taken to reform the elections law and technical issues were not sufficiently foreseen in formulating them. This caused so much repeated delays that one began even to wonder whether they were deliberately caused by interested parties. It is impossible to tell the exact date or period in which elections could be held till the relevant Local Government Election Acts are revised. Another factor that delayed the elections may be the reluctance of governing parties to hold elections till they put their houses in order.
New legislation that replaced the earlier Local Government election law is an advance in democracy. For the first time it has ensured 25% women representation in local government bodies. Such a mandatory quota is necessary in the context of male dominated political parties and cultural constraints on womens political activities. It has done away with the notorious preferential of manape system and retained the advantages of proportional representation through a hybrid system combining the latter with the First-past-the Post system. The abolition of the preferential vote makes electioneering much cheaper and accessible to poor candidates. It also reduces the dependence on money-bags.
Geneva Human Rights Council resolutions
Political parties have already started the polls campaign. What are the issues they are raising It is the same as that has been raised at any election whether Local Government, Parliamentary or Presidential. For example, issues highlighted were related to the prosecution of war heroes, the Geneva Human Rights Council resolutions, threats to sovereignty of the State, international conspiracy etc. Almost the same topics are debated even today. Of course new slogans are coined to update the dialogue. For example, the Joint Opposition claims that the Yahapalana government has sold the country to foreigners and is colluding with the LTTE Diaspora.
The Government parties argue that they have not only not done so but also have regained the lost prestige of the country in the international domain and prevented international probes of alleged war crimes. They will also harp on its achievements nationally without referring to any local development issues.
Is there anything that concerns local interests or development of the locality None at all. It means only central themes will become election campaign issues. Political parties will use the elections to test their national popularity or that of the Government. In fact it has been said so openly.
Returning to the Ward system of electing members is progressive. However, the full advantage of it is denied by allowing political parties to decide upon nominations. What would happen is the candidate that earns the confidence of the central party leadership or the MP of the area will get nomination while there may be more popular candidates in the locality. Considering the corrupt nature of central politicians anyone who gets into their confidence may also have a chance of being a controversial person of similar character.
Political parties
There were serial rapists and murderers among the local Government Heads in the last administration. Some have crossed allegiances and become members of other parties. Party nomination forces party loyalists to vote for the party candidate without questioning their credentials. Independent groups are powerless to challenge the authority of political parties unless in special cases. This factor nullifies the advantage of the new ward system. An elected member also would have a stronger allegiance to the party leadership or the party MP of the area than to his voters.
Now it is the political parties that could rectify this situation by nominating candidates of exemplary character from the localities. They could easily do so if they heed public opinion of local residents. In most cases, candidates themselves are to blame for they depend on the prestige of central politicians or the party leaders to attract votes. The latter too should discourage their names or photos being used to canvass votes.
Elections alone would not make local government better institutions. Avenues should be explored for peoples participation in the work of Councils. Two issues that need special attention are the Dengue eradication and waste disposal in the area. Both these need peoples participation. Besides public works such as road maintenance and public health also would be better served with popular participation. For example, a system of voluntary Ward Residents Committees could be established with the help of elected members for such purposes. Local government activities could be used as a testing ground in moving towards a system of participatory democracy to replace the majoritarian rule.

Lyon spin gives Australia  crushing win over Bangladesh
Chittagong: Nathan Lyon spun Australia to a series-levelling win over Bangladesh on Thursday with a 13 wicket match-haul in the second and final Test.
Chasing 86 for victory on a deteriorating Chittagong pitch, the visitors lost their top three batsmen before completing a seven-wicket win in the final session of the fourth day.
Glenn Maxwell, who hit the winning six to take his score to 25, and Peter Handscomb, on 16, helped Australia bounce back from their loss in Dhaka last week.
Bangladesh had been on a high after their historic first Test win over Australia. But Lyon brought them back to earth with a bump this time.
The off-spinner, who received the man of the match award, set up the win for the Steve Smith-led side after returning career-best match figures of 13-154.
Lyon claimed a third successive six-wicket haul to dismiss Bangladesh for 157 in their second innings. He took his series tally to 22 wickets, the most by an Australian bowler in a two-match contest.
Opener David Warner also stood out with two successive centuries in the series including 123 in Australia's first innings that helped secure a crucial 72-run lead.
"We played some good cricket at times. To restrict them to what we did in the first innings was great. There wasn't a great deal in the surface for Lyon, but he was remarkable," Smith said of Lyon's 7-94 that helped restrict Bangladesh to 305 in the first innings.
"I think he took 22 wickets for the series so that was a really good effort.... But credit to Bangladesh they really made us fight throughout the series," he added.
The hosts lost their grip after bowling out Australia for 377 in their first innings without adding a run to the overnight total.
But Bangladesh skipper Mushfiqur Rahim believed the home batsmen were not good enough after electing to bat first.
"Credit to Australia. The wicket was pretty good to bat on, we missed out in the first innings. That's what cost us. We should've got 350 at least," said Mushfiqur.
"Win or lose, there are a lot of areas of improvements. Our batsmen made things tough for themselves, hopefully we'll learn," he added. Mushfiqur managed a top score of 31 off 103 balls in Bangladesh's second essay. But none of the other batsmen could cope with a pitch that brought joy to Lyon. Bangladesh started the day on a high, dismissing number 11 batsman Lyon in the second over of the day.
But Lyon returned to pick up regular wickets as Bangladesh slipped to 83-5 at lunch.
A 54-run sixth-wicket stand between Mushfiqur and Sabbir Rahman steadied the innings briefly but an unrelenting Lyon got Sabbir stumped for 24.
Mushfiqur fell to fast bowler Pat Cummins after being caught behind, leaving his side in dire straits.
Cummins and Steve O'Keefe, who combined with Lyon to wipe off the tail in the final session of play, took two wickets each.
With meagre room for manoeuvre in the fourth innings, Bangladesh had early success when Mustafizur Rahman dismissed Warner, who shared the man of the series award with Lyon, for eight.
Spinners Shakib Al Hasan and Taijul Islam then took the wickets of Steve Smith for 16 and Matt Renshaw for 22 to leave Australia at 48-3.
But Handscomb and Maxwell then dug in and saw Australia home with their unbroken 39-run stand.
Australia now travel to India where they will play five one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches between September 17 to October 13. AFP

Major earthquake off Mexico coast sparks warning of possible tsunami

A magnitude 8.4 earthquake has been reported off the coast ofMexico, with residents told to evacuate and a tsunami warning issued for the region and neighbouring countries.
The quake struck 200km south-west of the city of Tuxtla Gutirrez just after midnight on Thursday local time.
The Pacific tsunami warning centre said hazardous waves could be possiblewithin the next three hoursfor the coasts of Mexico, Guatemala, El Savador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras and Ecuador.
Inan updated warning, they predicted waves over 3m for parts of the Mexican coast, and waves between 0.3 and 1 meters for the Cook Islands, Ecuador, French Polynesia, Guatemala and Kiribati.
Initial waves arriving on the coast at the Mexican cities of Salina Cruz, Puerto Madero were around 0.3metres over tide level.
Waves below 0.3 metres were forecast for other countries in the Pacific, including Colombia, Hawaii, Peru and Panama.
The tsunami threat to Hawaii wasstill under evaluation, said the warning centre.
The New Zealand ministry of civil defence and emergency management said they were assessing the potential of the tsunami to reach New Zealand. They estimated that waves would not reach for at least 12 hours.
In Mexico civil protection officials were checking for damage in Chiapas, but the quake was so powerful that frightened residents in Mexico City more than 1,000 kms (650 miles) away fled apartment buildings, often in their pyjamas, and gathered in groups in the street.
Around midnight buildings swayed strongly for more than minute, loosening light fixtures from ceilings.
Helicopters crisscrossed the sky above Mexico City with spotlights. Some neighbourhoods kept electricity while others remained in darkness.
The Mexican seismological authority reported a series of magnitude 6 aftershocks were felt after the initial quake.

Padeniya granted more time

The Court of Appeal granted further time for Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya today to file a written submission regarding the preliminary objections raised by him regarding a charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements.
 At a previous occasion, a charge sheet was in open court served on GMOA President Anuruddha Padeniya by Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
 However, Dr. Padeniya through his lawyer informed Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the Court stenographer.
 Two-judge-bench headed by Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya fixed the matter for objections on November 10.
 At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal issued an Interim Order preventing GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this contempt of court action.
 Two civil society activists Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
 The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment demanding to annul or set aside the said judgment.
 The petitioners further stated that in this backdrop, the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following the Court decision, ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
 The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017 the GMOA organised an island wide trade union action against SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under topic, Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
 The petitioners pleaded Dr. Padeniya to be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka.
They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case.
They further urged to impose a sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

The Government refused to accommodate some of them on the grounds that it is against the Standing Orders to include any Amendment that had not received the Cabinet approval. However, some of the proposals of the Opposition had already been included into the Amendments presented by the Government. Minister Samaraweera agreed to study all the other Amendments proposed by the JO and the JVP and bring in a separate Amendment Bill before long accommodating what is agreeable to the Government.
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne pointed out the new legislation has restricted the space for ministers to meddle in the affairs of taxes.
He insisted that no additional tax would be levied from places of worship.
He added that the tax exemptions hitherto granted to them would remain and implied that more tax concessions for the SME sector and other needy sectors would be announced in the upcoming budget.
He added that the Share Transactions Levy imposed on the Stock Market transactions would remain unchanged and the Capital Gains Tax would not apply to those transactions.
The State Minister clarified that provisions of the Bill related to corporate sector would come into effect only from April next year.

New Inland Revenue Bill is far simpler: Samarawickrama
The proposed new Act, overall, is far simpler from the standpoint of the taxpayers. It will increase the tax base, make administration of the Inland Revenue Department more efficient and will increase Government revenue collection, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said.
He added that an efficient and effective tax code is a dire necessity for the vision of the Government to transform the economy into a competitive social market economy with a prosperous future for the nation.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday joining the second reading debate on the Inland revenue Bill.
The Minister said the existing Act was outdated, which had gone through many amendments. It is complex, difficult to understand and implement, he said.
Sri Lankan economy has come from a low income country to a middle income level. As in the case of many legislative enactments, the existing Inland Revenue Act too has evolved over four decades or more and stands outdated. Even the principal enactment of 2006 has gone through nine amendments by now. These were piecemeal amendments done to address issues and concerns that arose at different circumstances and without any holistic review or appreciation of possible implications. The Act itself has become a very complex, difficult to understand and confusing. It has created loopholes and opportunities for many to escape the tax net and thereby creating a very unfair playing field, the Minister said.
As a result, Sri Lanka lags behind its peers in Ease of Doing Business in view of the existence of very complex tax law, Minister Samarawickrama said. This has made tax payment very difficult, costly and time consuming. Both local and foreign businesses find the Inland Revenue Act as a serious impediment that requires immediate change. The new bill looks at the issue of taxation from a novel and modern perspective and meeting the current status of our economy. It is a simple, easy to understand and it encourages compliance by all rational tax payers, he said. He said another major concern was the gradual and consistent deterioration of government revenue in Sri Lanka which was falling way behind compared with the peer economies. He added that there is also serious disparity between the direct and indirect proportions; which stands at 20:80 ratio today.
While government revenue is consistently dropping, the expenditure has consistently grown thus creating an inevitable deficit, with cascading implication to the economy. It is a vicious cycle and we must stop this and resurrect the situation. The new IR bill looks at the entire tax code in a holistic manner, with the multiple (composite) objectives of reducing the unfair proportionality between direct and indirect tax - our aim is to move towards 60:40 ratio by 2020, increasing the tax base and thereby increasing the tax revenue, Minister Samarawickrama said.
The simplification of the tax code will not only make it easy to understand but also result in better compliance and enhanced administrative efficiency. The new IR bill and the RAMIS (Revenue Administration Management System) will undoubtedly improve efficiency of the tax authorities. RAMIS without a cleaner, clearer and simplified tax code would have been a non-started and a disaster, wasting colossal amounts of public money, he said.
He said the principal features aimed at achieving overall increase in tax collection, better compliance and administrative efficiency were simplification through reduction of sources of income: the sources of income, which are currently divided into eight areas, have been reduced to four main sources thus simplifying the computation of tax. Another is removing imbalance in revenue collection through the introduction of capital gains tax: the introduction of capital gains tax, subject to certain exemptions, to capture high-value transactions will remove and imbalance in revenue collection by taxing the rich. Such taxes were not levied in the past allowing capital formation within the local economy and the Government is now of the view that it is the right time to introduce such taxes to remove the unfair imbalance. Since the appreciation of the value of capital, in the form of shares in companies or land and buildings is largely due to improvement in economic fundamentals year-on-year, there is justification to tax part of that gain as income tax for the greater benefit of the people, Minister Samarawickrama said. Another is absence of level playing field: the tax exemptions and incentives in the current law have evolved over the years and were not targeted towards increased economic development.
Intake of external degree students will be doubled: Kiriella
Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the Government has decided to double the intake of the students for external degree courses.
The Minister said in Parliament yesterday that the government decided to increase the number of students for external degrees to tally the students following the internal degree courses.
The Minister made these observations making an explanation to an answer he tabled in Parliament in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma for oral answers.
Generally, during the first round of questions if the member who submitted a question to the order paper was present in the House, the relevant minister would answer to orally. If a member raising the question was not present, it was left for the second round of question. During the second round, if another member raises the question on behalf of the member who submitted the question, the minister tables the answer.
When Minister Kiriella made an explanation, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake argued with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for he did not stop him making the explanation. You cant allow a minister to talk about an answer for oral question during the second round of the oral question session as per the standing order, MP Dissanayake said.
 Dont criticise me as the minister only wanted to make a clarification. It has nothing to do with the oral question, the speaker said.
MP Dissanayake said the Speaker should allow others to raise their questions too.
The Minister made only an explanation, the Speaker said. He requested to do so and said what is not in the answers.
Minister Kiriella said only the minister has the right to decide on answering an oral question. Joint Opposition Member Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that the Minister could make an explanation if he wishes.
Budget 2018 will be presented on November 9
The Budget proposals for the fiscal year 2018 will be presented to Parliament on November 9, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said in parliament yesterday.
The second reading of the budget will begin on November 10.
Minister Samaraweera said views and proposals of MPs are being discussed. A discussion of the government side members will be held at 9 am today (8) in the parliamentary complex, Minister Samaraweera said. I invite the Joint Opposition members to take part in the discussion and express their views and proposals.
JO, JVP amendments to Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill:
Cabinet already approved many of them as Governments amendments: Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera stated in Parliament that many of the amendments made by the Joint Opposition and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna had been granted Cabinet approval as governments own amendments.
He said he studied the amendments submitted by the opposition and many of them had been granted Cabinets approval even before Opposition submitted them. He said there would be no any issue with passing the Bill.
The Minister made these observations yesterday afternoon in Parliament in response to a request made by the Joint Opposition in the morning to allow their group to bring in amendments to the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera stated that he had no any objection in the JO making their submission. He added that the government could consider them and accept if they were suitable. The statement was made when Joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene, who raised the issue, said they have received a letter from the Government saying it was not possible to bring in amendments during the committee stage as per the standing orders. This is a violation of MPs rights. What has happened to the parliamentary democracy, he questioned.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella, who responded, said Cabinet approval was needed to bring in amendments to a financial bill. MP Gunawardena said there was no Act yet as the Bill had not been passed. So we can submit our amendments, Gunawardena said.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the opposition was welcome to bring in amendments during the committee stage.  You bring your amendments and we can agree or disagree during the committee stage, he said.


UNHRC called for action over Fonsekas statement on Gen. Jayasuriya
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday said the UNHRC had called for an immediate action with regard to the statement made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka on General Jagath Jayasuriya that the General committed war crimes during the war against the LTTE.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
He said the LTTEs international organisation has already applauded Field Marshal Fonsekas statement on General Jayasuriya. He added that the UNHRC has stated that immediate action should be taken on the statement made by Fonseka.
This is a serious situation, MP Alahapperuma said. The President says he will not permit any harm to the war heroes, but the harm is done by a minister appointed by the President. MPs Udaya Gammanpila, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Prasanna Ranatunga, and Keheliya Rambukwella addressed.

SP Chief Minister uses 14 vehicles: UNP MP
Kegalle District UNP MP Sandith Samarasinghe brought to the notice of Parliament yesterday that the Chief Minister of Sabaragamuwa Province uses 14 official vehicles violating the provisions of government circulars with regard to the use of official vehicles. MP Samarasinghe made the revelation raising a supplementary question during the round of questions for oral answers from Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapaha.

HC verdict on sil clothes:
Eye opener to public officials: Bimal
The High Court verdict on the Sil cloth distribution case is a historical decision that sends out a strong signal to public officials who misuse public funds and act as political lackeys, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake said in Parliament yesterday.
The MP made this comment while speaking at the debate of Inland Revenue Bill shortly after the news broke on the court sentencing former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Pelpita to three years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 2 million each.
This is a wake-up call to all other senior public officials to work with backbone. Today Lalith Weeratunge goes to jail as a former Secretary to the President who tarnished his name.
We, in the COPE, come across officials who misuse their power even today. Todays ruling will send a strong signal to such officials and also to politicians who rob the tax payers money, he stressed.
The MP commenting the judgement delivered yesterday said it was wrong to argue such punishment could affect public officials.
Only less than 10 percent of the public officials are corrupt.The majority is clean, but they also earn the bad name due to the wrongs of a few persons he added.
The MP pointed out former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, for whose election campaign the Sil clothes were distributed, easily got away with the charges because of the constitutional cover he enjoys.
Inland Revenue Bill designed to tax everyone: Handunnetti
The Inland Revenue Bill had been designed to collect tax from everyone in the country, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the bill was so harmful to the people that the Government should include the amendments submitted by the Opposition. He said the new bill proposed to collect taxes from the areas where the previous one had not collected.
He made the observations joining the second reading on the Inland Revenue Bill.
MP Handunnetti said the bill had been drafted by the IMF for Ghana and had been translated into Sinhala. We agree that the Government has made changes. But we have submitted our amendments . The indirect tax is 82 percent. The Premier said in his policy statement on November 5 that the indirect tax should be reduced to 60 percent. But it has proved a failure although you introduced super gain taxes through the budget proposals, Handunnetti said. Although they were not collected, the indirect tax was collected.
It affected only the common people.
He stated that over 43 percent of the population does not get over Rs 320 a day. The Bill has proposals to impose a tax on the dowry, on transfer of assets from parents to children, Handunnetti said.
If some one get a donation or a gift from the Presidents Fund, that money also will be taxed. Writers when they publish books are taxed, A drama producers, singers and other artistess would be taxed, he said.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera responding to Handunnetti said a tax was not imposed on the assets transferred to children from deceased parents and on transfers among blood relations.
MP Handunnetti said the salaries sent to Sri Lanka by overseas workers would be taxed. Minister Eran Wickramaratne responding said income of the migrant workers in the Middle East was not taxed.
The Minister added that an income of US$ 100,000 a year is not taxed from the Sri Lankans employed in other parts of the world.
MP Handunnetti stated the Bill has proposals to impose a tax on the donations made to Buddhist monks and priests. Even if a minister related to literature, art and sports make a donation less than Rs. 100,000 to someone, that money will be taxed. But such money was not taxed earlier, Handunnetti said.
Even if a small group of neighbours set up a association in a village, they would be taxed if they earned some money, he said.

Photo of girl fleeing Isis shortlisted for Taylor Wessing portrait prize
Images by Abbie Trayler-Smith, Csar Dezfuli and Maija Tammi in contention for annual photographic award
Portraits of a determined migrant rescued from the Mediterranean and a disoriented girl fleeing a life under Islamic State in Iraq have been shortlisted for one of the worlds most prestigious photographic competitions.
They are joined by a photograph of what appears to be a young Japanese woman, but is in fact an android called Erica created by scientists at Osaka University.
The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in London announced the contenders for this years Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize, an annual award running since 1993 that is open to amateurs and professionals.
The portrait of an unnamed girl escaping Isis is the work of Welsh documentary and portrait photographer Abbie Trayler-Smith.
It was shot outside Hasan Sham camp for internally displaced people in northern Iraq, where Trayler-Smith was working on a commission for Oxfam, talking to women who had lived under Isis and were prepared to be photographed.
The girl was on a convoy of buses bringing people to safety at the camp after a battle broke out hours earlier.
Trayler-Smith said: I just remember seeing her face looking out at the camp. The shock and the bewilderment in hers and others faces  it made me shudder to imagine what living under Isis had been like.
To me, the uncertainty in her face echoes the faces of people having to flee their homes around the world and references a global feeling of insecurity.
The Madrid-born photographer Csar Dezfuli is shortlisted for his portrait of Amadou Sumaila, which was taken as he documented the search and rescue operations for migrants on an NGO vessel working along the perilous central Mediterranean route.
Sumaila was photographed, bedraggled but strong and defiant, in international waters 20 miles off the Libyan coast. He has since been transferred to a temporary reception centre for migrants in Italy.
The third shortlisted photographer is Finnish artist Maija Tammi, whose portrait focuses on the artificial intelligence work carried out at the Hiroshi Ishiguro Laboratories in Osaka.
One of Them is a Human #1 is part of a broader series presenting androids alongside one human that questions what it means to be alive.
Tammi said: I had half an hour with Erica and a young researcher in which to take the photograph. The researcher told me that Erica had said she finds Pokmon Go scarier than artificial intelligence.
The three portraits were chosen from 5,717 submissions by 2,423 photographers from 66 countries. For the first time, all were entered digitally, with 59 images chosen for the annual exhibition at the NPG.
Nicholas Cullinan, the NPGs director, said the submission for this years prize was exceptionally strong. The resulting exhibition consists of a range of photographic subjects that is truly global in its scope and concerns, he said.
Tim Eyles, managing partner of the law firm Taylor Wessing, said: To be on the judging panel of such a world-renowned competition, in our 10th year of sponsorship, is a true privilege.
Year in, year out the quality of images remains exceptional. This year was no different with digital submissions adding a new creative twist  Those attending the exhibition will enjoy a truly special artistic treat.
The winner of the 15,000 prize will be announced on 14 November, two days before the exhibition opens. As well as the competition entrants, it will feature previously unseen prints by the American photographer Todd Hido.
 The Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize 2017 exhibition is being held at the National Portrait Gallery in central London from 16 November to 4 February.

Previous regime  created robbers:  Paranavithane
Although the previous regime boasted about a one project for each village programme, what it actually did was to introduce one robber for each village, said Vocational Training and Skills Development Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithane.
However, all political parties in this country tried to produce cultural individuals whom we should strive to protect and bring to the forefront, he said.
Paranavithane who said that the January 8 revolution could never be reversed, added that fraudulent people who defrauded public assets had no place in society again.
He said the Yahapalana Government never feared to face elections. Paranavithane said a recent statement made by him regarding the wild elephant menace had created a public dialogue. What he emphasised was that despite the threat, elephants could not be killed as they were intertwined with our culture.

Protect prison massacre  witnesses
No efforts should be spared in apprehending those responsible for firing shots at the residence of Railway employee Sudesh Nandimal Silva, a vital witness in the November 2012 prison massacre. The shots were clearly aimed at instilling fear in the witness who was an inmate at the Welikada prison when armed police, while putting down a prison riot, is alleged to have executed 27 inmates. It was one of the blackest episodes in the country's penal history that can only be compared to the prison massacre during Black July, where over 50 LTTE detainees were butchered to death by fellow inmates, ably assisted by prison officials. If such prison massacres of the magnitude witnessed in both instances occurred in India, the Justice Ministers would have resigned pronto. However, neither the Justice Minister in 1983 or the minister in 2012 did anything of the kind and continued merrily as if nothing occurred.
Since the shots were fired close to midnight, when the witness was asleep, it was not meant to kill but warn the latter to keep mum. There had also been attempts to abduct him on three occasions after he accused the previous regime of the massacre. He says, attempts were being made to shield the culprits by this government, since no action was taken to inquire into any of these incidents. His claim cannot be dismissed lightly in the backdrop of other accusations too made by the supporters of the Yahapalanaya government, no less, of attempts being made to protect important figures of the last regime accused of murder and corruption.
The Welikada prison massacre had many features that led to the inescapable conclusion of a planned operation to silence certain inmates who knew too much, for the liking of certain VIPs. In the heat of the massacre, a senior police officer, close to the leaders of the government, lost no time in reading out from a list of the prisoners who perished, which included notorious criminals and drug dealers, as per the account of the police officer, to create the impression that this was good riddance. The chapter was closed thereafter, with little or no action taken to get to the bottom of matter, like all other investigations into incidents of a suspicious nature, such as the Thajudeen murder. Like the Black July massacre, no one was held accountable and investigations commenced in earnest only after advent of the new government. A report on the matter was compiled by former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe wherein compensation was recommended to the next of kin of those killed. Nothing much has been heard of since, and it looks as if this is going to be yet another unsolved crime, unless concrete steps are taken to identify those who gave orders to open fire at the prisoners.
Be that as it may, our prison system needs a complete overhaul. Prison overcrowding is still a phenomenon that the authorities are grappling with, although it has to be said that Minister Swaminathan has endevoured to improve things and make prisons less inhospitable than they are. Proper rehabilitation of prisoners too should be given the utmost priority to ensure that inmates, once they leave the four walls of the prisons, will be productive citizens and shorn off the stigma that was once attached to them. Steps should also be taken to have frequent family reunions for prisoners, especially those serving sentences for minor offenses. In some of the advanced countries the term prison has already been discarded and instead establishments where small time offenders are held named as correction centres'. These are mostly open air expanses where the inmates have more freedom of movement and opportunities to intermingle with others and not feel the full impact of being a prisoner. Such a setup will be welcome here as well.
However, the authorities should also have special monitoring in the case of serious offenders, especially given the recent revelations of the subterranean life in the prisons. It is no secret that, for some, prisons have become a home away from home, even masterminding drug running operations and contract murders from within the four walls of the prisons. Even in the recent prison bus massacre in Kalutara, instructions had been received from a gang leader behind bars. There was also an instance where an inmate was allowed to leave the prison to attend the birthday party of his child. Needless to say, collusion by corrupt officials is today rampant in our prisons, with most prisoners allowed to have an open line with their outside contacts, family members and monitor their drug distribution networks. Drugs and sleaze within prison walls are all too common today with officials looking the other way. Prisoners who are first time offenders are invariably drawn to the vice, rampant in our prisons, become hardened by the experience and add to the world of crime, once they leave the prisons. All these factors should be taken into consideration when effecting the proposed reforms to our prisons system.

Public Lecture on Alzheimers disease
Tea and Cognition: More than a storm in a tea cup ! will be the topic of this years public lecture on September 21 at 6.30 pm at the Lanka Alzheimers Foundation 110,Ketawalamulla Lane,Colombo 10.
The lecture will be delivered by Dr.Shehan Williams (MBBS, MPhil, MD, MRCPsych), Professor in Psychiatry and Consultant Psychiatrist, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya.
Tea is an ancient beverage considered to be the most commonly consumed beverage in the world after water. Recent epidemiological studies provide evidence that higher tea consumption could be related with slower cognitive decline, reduced risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimers disease, and reduced mortality in patients with Alzheimers disease.
Although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood, there is emerging evidence from in-vivo and in-vitro studies on the neuroprotective effects of tea.
The lecture will summarize the evidence regarding the role and the possible mechanisms of phytochemicals in tea for the reduction of risk factors and prevention of cognitive decline.
Professor Shehan Williams is a leading researcher in Alzheimers disease in Sri Lanka and has in July published a review article on Diabetes and Alzheimers Disease: Can Tea Phytochemicals Play a Role in Preventionin the International Journal of Alzheimers Disease with a group of eminent researchers in Edith Cowan University , Perth, Australia. This research paper is significant as we celebrate 150 years of Tea in Sri Lanka.

The public statement made by Southern Provincial Councillor Chandana Priyantha (UNP) over a prospective No confidence Move against Southern Provincial Minister Weerasumana Weersinghe and Council Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda, had stirred profound concerns of many Southern Provincial Councillors, including ministers.
The Provincial Minister and Council Chairman is alleged for maintaining allegiance towards the Joint Opposition loyalists of the Council and the Council Chairman had conducted the previous Council meeting contravening the Southern Province Governors directives requesting him to postpone the meeting without taking the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution for discussion at the respective meeting and Minister Weerasinghe had voted against the act at the same meeting together with Joint Opposition loyalists.
Here are comments made by some Councillors of the Council, including the Chief Minister and two Provincial Ministers:
When questioned over the issue, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said that the move gave the impression of an indefinite subjunctive mood act and it was too early to comment on such an unspecified proposal. However, I would not take a personal decision over it. Instead, I would arrive at a collective conclusion. However, I will inform the issue to the party and respond to the proposal accordingly.
Provincial Minister H.W.Gunasena. To vote against a fraternal member of the Cabinet is not ethical and righteous. We are in the same ruling faction. How can we vote against a member who is on our side Although they act as supporters of the Joint Opposition, we all are in the ruling party. We established the Southern Provincial Council as the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA). We need the support of the Joint Opposition loyalists in the Council. I am prepared to uphold the Cabinet collectiveness. So, I think the proposed No confidence move will be an abortive effort. It is an unwarranted action at this juncture.
Southern Provincial Councillor Chamly Withanachchi (UPFA)  If such an effort is made, we will definitely defeat it. Both the Provincial Minister and Council Chairman did nothing in breach of confidence of the Council or its members. At the said meeting, the Chairman acted according to the majoritys will which was a rightly democratic decision.
Opposition Chief Organizer Asoka Danawansa(UNP) - I am not aware of such a move. During the past few days, I was sick. If a No confidence move was to be submitted to the Council against another councillor, it should be first discussed in the party group before it is processed. That is the due procedure.
Southern Provincial Councillor Nalin Hewage (JVP) - When we pull any card out from a shuffled deck of cards, we get a jack. In the same way, when we change any head of the council, we will get an unscrupulous and corrupted person in place of the predecessor.
The so called Joint Opposition loyalists are not ready to topple the Council until they get the due vehicle permit. It is an attempt just to threaten the minister and get some benefit from him. On the other hand, although there are many criticisms against the minister, he is an innovative minister who is trying to do some useful work through his ministry. Hence we are not interested in that proposed move.
Provincial Councillor Nihal Wedaarchchi ( UNP) - We will stand as a group and respond to the proposal following party instructions. I respect the Chairman for he is a morally principled person and a former teacher. However, I will take a decision according to the party advice.
Ruling Party Chief Organizer Ajith Rajapaksa (UPFA) - Winning of the no-Confidence Motion against the Minister and the Chairman is just a day dream which will not materialize. There should be a two thirds majority in the Council to win such a move. Even the Joint Opposition loyalists who consist the majority of the Council, cannot win such a proposal. The Southern Provincial Council consists of 55 members. The UNP has 15 members, while the JVP has 5 members. So no party has a 2/3 majority.
Provincial Minister Weerasumana Weerasinghe - The projected No Confidence Motion is a prejudicial act manipulated over mere personal detestation. I hope the so called move will be a blessing to me. I have been in politics for over 20 years and bear an unblemished political character. I have never defrauded a single cent from public money.
Although the countrys political power was changed, Southern Provincial Councils authority remains unchanged. We are not ready to act according to the tune of the UNP. If I am defeated in the anticipated no confidence move, I am prepared to take a firm political decision.

Romancing the Calamansi Cove
Would you like to try our latest avocado mousse dessert madam and before I have a chance to say no, a sample is incarnated before me with a great flourish. I look at it, green and cool as the exotic tropical garden that the Tangerine restaurant sits in and as unusual in its cocktail glass design as the stunning azure blue infinity pool next to it. Not wanting to offend the gorgeous team of staff, I take a spoonful and by the second mouthful I am addicted and wondering how many more I can order before leaving.
Dos and donts
It is hardly surprising, with five such good chefs cooking out-of-the box recipes like avocado mousse, that Calamansi Cove by Jetwing cooking classes are a sell-out success, because even their chicken curry cookery demonstration is done with a philosophy that food is like art and must be done in inspirational new ways. Of course, like everything at this stunning resort, there is a fun twist, as they will get you picking the Calamansi fruit, grown at the front entrance of the property so you can have the freshest taste of this tropical jewel. From tropical fruit feasts and colourful traditional mask-making classes in the garden, to a personalised arts and artisan tour of the area, it is impossible not to feel the pull to return and learn more about this little known area with its private cove that could almost be a scene set out of Enid Blytons Famous Five, Five Go to Smugglers Top. I half expected, as I wandered with my children along the beach, that we would find buried treasure as we all had fun digging holes in the sand and would then jump off the rocks and come up for air with stunning finds from the rock-pools full of mesmerising sea creatures and pretty shells.
For any busy parent, this is a perfect place to base yourself for a family holiday, as the staff love kids and take them off your hands between meals so you can rejuvenate your mind, body and spirit and also see the very best of what the island has to offer. Nothing is more than an hour or two away, such as the city of the arts of Ambalangoda, the fascinating historic fort city of Galle and, on the way, you can stop at one of the endless idyllic beaches, where the team can organise surfing lessons for the uninitiated. For the more experienced surfers, an early morning trip or an evening to ride the spectacular Hikkaduwa waves, with characters like the legendary Mambo boys, are easy to organise with the superb General Manager, Shalini Gamage, who grew up in the area and is worth listening to on dos and donts, so you can spot the clever local scams.
Rich in heritage
The area is a hub of artistic talent akin to the South of France and one of the many reasons the owners, who come from the incredibly exciting world of advertising, decided to build their resort in this hidden gem that those in the know are calling Asias Southern Riviera. Eveline, one of the partners in the business, loves to encourage creativity both in the kitchen and with the daily activities. Every chance she gets to explore the area with her own family is an adventure as the location has no shortage of extraordinary characters and special things to see and do. With this in mind she has designed tours to give you a unique insight into the real lives of local artisans. You can see the four owners different passions are woven into every aspect of this breathtakingly beautiful resort that is exquisite in both its well thought through architecture and exciting new experiential experiences.
After all, where in the world can you go, with a top artist, on a tour whose picture hangs on your villa wall and discover why he has won a host of awards, including the Presidential one for being the islands number one artist, while meeting puppet makers in their homes cum workshops, who have been producing masterpieces in puppetry for more than seven generations
Art and artisan guide Janaka De Silvas artwork, whether created with a porcupine quill or an ice cream stick, embodies a painting tradition rich in heritage and island traditions. Janakas work takes inspiration from the era of the great Kings and the Dambulla cave painters to the contemporary and the political, which you can see in his Galle Fort Art Gallery in the ancient fort citadel, only a short drive from Calamansi Cove by Jetwing.
From winning awards to having his own art shop at the Dutch Hospital complex in Galle Fort on Hospital Street, De Silvas merging of the ancient with unusual canvases, like Dutch boxes and wooden hand painted bowls, have left an indelible impression in the South. He has also built his own Salon of leading artists, who are now movers and shakers in the Asian art world.
Indigenous artists
De Silvas tours celebrate the re-creating of wooden Jaffna horses for the front verandas of stylish fashionista Southern villa owners, which he does from his own studio in Ambalangoda. Always looking back and yet moving forward with different items to paint on, from door stops looking like colonial characters to Dutch chests with the tree of life painted on them, he challenges us all to think about the real meaning of life. De Silva is considered by many as the Sri Lankan version of Modigliani, and, as part of his tour, will show you his studio workshop in action. He will then take you to see medicine-mask makers and explain the contrast in carving style between masks made for theatrical purposes and those made to protect houses from evil spirits. His tours are interactive so you can have a go at making your own and learn in the process just how hard it is to carve details into wood. Although he says children never find it difficult to be creative resulting in some pretty special masterpieces from his classes. He picks wood from broken branches and tree stumps in the surrounding Sinharaja Rain Forest, and talks avidly about how it is better to use natural colours by mixing the grated pieces of bark with clay and vinegar to make a range of earthy warm colours.
The half-day tour takes you into several homes of indigenous artists, handicraft makers and batik workers. De Silva happily answers questions on how modern life has taken a heavy toll on ancient practices and how some of the traditional performing families, such as the puppeteers, are the last in the country, with only three historic puppetry families remaining, who have been in the trade for generations. The cultural and historical significance is high and the preservation of this traditional art is now paramount, because without those special individuals who make up this heritage-rich town, the ancient crafts will be lost forever.
As I return to Calamansi Cove by Jetwing for dinner and to sneak in another delicious avocado mouse, I notice an amusing cartoon in the local papers saying, We are only puppets, our strings are being pulled by unknown forces. All I can say as I dive into the pool as the sun sets and cocktails are prepared, you wont regret whatever forces cause your heartstrings to book this oasis of inspiration reflected in the beautiful tropical garden that each of the villas seem to float within like water lilies on the Great Kings tank in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa. In truth there really is nothing else out there quite like it.

## Title: RUMESH and ASHANTHA were world class fast bowling all rounders
## Supertitle:

RUMESH and ASHANTHA were world class fast bowling all rounders
After achieving that elusive full membership in the International Cricket Council in 1982, Sri Lanka produced many fast bowlers who were speedy,menacing and who all opposing batsmen feared facing them.
Two of them were ASHANTHA LAKDASA FRANCIS DE MEL and RUMESH JOSEPH RATNAYAKE. DE MEL learnt his trade at Isipathana before going across to Royal College where he bettered his trade ultimately ending up as one if not the fastest bowler in the country.
RATNAYAKE was a blue blooded Peterite. Bowling with great success in inter-school cricket and in the company of another fast bowling ace VINODHAN JOHN he teased, tormented and instilled fear on all batsmen who faced him and he put Peterite cricket at the top in that era with high class fast bowling reminiscent of Benedictines Cecil Waidyaratne and Neville Wickremasinghe in mid-1957 who batsmen feared.
International cricket  sub head
DE MEL and RATNAYAKE broke into the Sri Lanka teams and international cricket, when that man who was tagged the power behind the throne ABU FUARD who lorded and ruled the local cricket world with the blessings of the then Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket the irrepressible GAMINI DISSANAYAKE who allowed FUARD free reign.
After having their early coaching at Isipathana and St. Peters College  DE MEL under former Peterite cricketer Mike Chanmugam and later under GaminiSalgadoe at Royal, RATNAYAKE came under former Peterite Captain and national team wicket keeper/batsman Dr. H.I.K. Fernando.
When they broke into big time cricket they had the fortune of coming under the Influence of that all-rounder of all allrounders in world cricket GARFIELD SOBERS who captained the West Indies who dominated world cricket with fearsome pace men like Wesley Hall, Charlie Griffith and Chester Watson.
Played stellar roles
De MEL and RATNAYAKE played stellar roles in Sri Lankas first ever Test victory when they beat the Indian team led by KapilDev at the P.Sara Stadium in 1984. Not many wagered on new babes to Test cricket Sri Lanka led by DuleepMendis to beat a mighty team led by Dev who had led India to win the World Cup in England in 1983.
That Sri Lanka were trained to a nicety by Sobers who instilled in them that they should go hard at the Indians who are sure to capitulate under pressure. And that was exactly what this team did and the Indians failed to withstand the pressure and the end result was a 147 run victory for the Lankan babes.
That was an historic victory, considering that the Lankans were into the big league only a couple of years and when RATNAYAKE midway in his follow trough dived right to take a brilliant one-handed catch to dismiss Dev all hell broke loose not only on the ground but country wide as fire crackers rent the air and President Jayewardene who was a former Royal cricketer who was at the scene soaking in the action immediately declared a national holiday.
Excellent bowling figures
DE MEL had match figures of 2 for 63 in the first innings and in the second innings 3 for 63 with RATNAYAKE having figures of 4 for 76 in the first and 5 for 49 in the second innings. It was a truly amazing performance by the duo and along with Amal Silva who made 111, RanjanMadugalle 54, Roy Dias 95 and 60 not out, Mendis 51, Aravinda de Silva 75 not out and were along with the other team members the toasts of this historic victory.
RATNAYAKE it must be stated began his career as a leg spinner. Quite tall and strongly built, he decided to take to fast bowling and what a devastating bowler he turned out to be. He bowled right arm with a deceptive action that made batsmen struggling to read him.
He had some of the batsmen shaking in the knees when facing him. It is said he struck batsmen of the caliber of West Indian captain Clive Lloyd and team mate Larry Gomes. Lloyd unable to take the embarrassment queried RATANAYKES action. When things were getting hot for Lloyd he said he had been misquoted.
Stood by his story
But the respected Australian cricketer writer Dick Tucker when asked by me when I met him on a tour in Australia and who was ghosting Lloyd in a column stood by his story.
Another story told me by my former team mate at St.Benedicts College Ranjit Fernando was this. RATNAYAKE had struck New Zealand batsman John Wright on the head in NZ. Worried that he may have badly hurt the Kiwi batsman RATNAYAKE walked up to console Wright, but when he saw blood RATNAYAKE fainted.
RATNAYAKE earned his Test cap as a teenager and made his debut against New Zealand in Christchurch and made a big impression in a Test match against India at the SSC he returned figures of 6 for 85.
Top class seam bowling
On a tour of Australia in 1990/91 he produced top class seam bowling capturing 6 for 66 in Hobart. At Lords against England he had the fine figures of 5 for 69. RATNAYAKE was also a hard hitting bat using the long handle to advantage. He played in 23 Tests capturing 73 wickets and in the 70 ODI games he played he took 76 wickets.
DE MEL was a double international. In addition to representing the country in cricket he was also a clever bridge player and represented the country at the Commonwealth Games.
Playing in Sri Lankas inaugural Test against England, he captured the first wicket when he had opener Geoff Cook edging to LalithKaluperuma in the gully. He followed with the wickets of Chris Tavare, Graham Gooch and Ian Botham which signaled his arrival as a first class fast bowler. He would have added the wicket of England captain Keith Fletcher to his bag, but had the mortification of seeing the catch being grassed. In the first drawn Test against India in 1985 the lion-hearted fast bowler had figures of 5 for 64.
Maiden tour of Pakistan
When Sri Lanka made their maiden tour of Pakistan after gaining Test status, DE MEL rocked the home teams batting with 11 wickets in the series on wickets that were not conducive for fast bowling. His perseverance earned him the wickets.
DE MEL as a batsman was also a mauler of bowlers. I had the fortune of seeing him blast an Indian attach in a Gopalan Trophy game at the P.Sara Stadium and score a belligerent century. He played in many a Maharaja Organization team that dominated Mercantile cricket in the 1980s.
As is the case with all fast bowlers, DE MEL and RATNAYAKE had their careers cut short suffering irrecoverable injuries. They were not molly coddled like the fast bowlers of today. They worked hard for success. Where are the likes of the DE MELS and RATNAYAKEs now
Both were outspoken and likeable cricketers. RATNAYAKE was god fearing. On retirement they were not lost to the game, but offered their expertise to the Cricket Board in the furtherance of the game. Both had credentials to be classed as LEGENDS of the game in Sri Lanka cricket.

Sangakkara (57 n.o.) but defending champs Tallawahs knocked out
In a rematch of the 2016 CPL final, Guyana Amazon Warriors exacted revenge behind Rashid Khan's hat-trick and Luke Ronchi's cold-blooded 70 off 33 balls to knock out the defending champion Jamaica Tallawahs at Brian Lara Stadium.
Tallawahs were on the back foot throughout Amazon Warriors' chase of 169 courtesy a splendid second-wicket stand of 67 in 5.1 overs between Ronchi and Chadwick Walton, before victory was sealed by a six from Assad Fudadin with 13 balls to spare.
For the second night in a row, the decision to open the batting with a player who hadn't played through the tournament produced underwhelming results.
The Tallawahs management decided to drop Glenn Phillips despite four 30-plus scores in seven innings in the competition. Captain Kumar Sangakkara said at the post-match presentation that the reason to include Lewis was because the Tallawahs "had gone soft in the Powerplay". Lewis managed 15 before he was bounced out by Rayad Emrit, caught at deep square leg in the fifth over.
Sangakkara and Andre McCarthy, a consistent performer for the Tallawahs this season, were pushed down two spots. Rather than giving their two leading scorers the most time to bat, their delayed entry may have cost the side 20-plus runs, particularly since Sangakkara finished unbeaten on 57 off 38 balls.
On Wednesday night, Rashid created CPL history with the tournament's first ever hat-trick. First was McCarthy, beaten driving by a googly to begin the 15th over. Jonathan Foo lunged at another googly next ball and was beaten easily as the ball knocked into leg stump.
Rovman Powell's dismissal was the worst stroke of the three, teased into chasing a flighted delivery well outside off that spun back sharply to hit off stump. At 116 for 7, Tallawahs were left with a struggle to get to a defendable total on a night where heavy dew made gripping the ball increasingly difficult as the night wore on.
Ronchi finished with 70 off 33 balls, setting up a showdown with Trinbago Knight Riders for a chance to return to the CPL final for the fourth time in five seasons.
Scores:
Jamaica Tallawahs 168-8 in 20 overs (L Simmons 34, T Griffith 20, K Sangakkara 57 n.o., Rashid Khan 3/32, S Jacob 2/33)
Guyana Amazon Warriors 169-5 in 17.5 overs (K Walton 39, L Ronchi 70, A Fudadin 29 n.o., Mahmudullah 3/25)

Should abortion be legalised  in case of rape:
WALTER WUTHMANN
Last week youth activist Sarah Soysa was optimistic about the fate of the Abortion Bill she had spent months lobbying for. The Cabinet had reportedly approved papers that would legalize two forms of abortions in Sri Lanka: if a mother was raped or if the fetus had a lethal congenital birth defect.
I am very surprised and happy to witness public response, she said about the conversations shed had regarding the Bill. Its quite progressive.
Soysa, who heads the Youth Advocacy Network, advocates for universal access to abortion in Sri Lanka. She also documents the reality of abortion on the ground.
In a video Soysa produced in 2014, an unidentified young woman describes her choice to have an abortion.
After the girl moved away from her parents home to a cousins in Colombo, she said that her cousin pressured her constantly into having sex as a condition for her staying with him.
She found out she was pregnant after he left for work in Australia. A friend took her to an abortion provider in Borella and she said the process was incredibly painful.
Hers is the kind of situation that Soysa believes the current initiative to legalize two forms of abortion that could begin to be addressed.
These types of stories are not unique. The Sri Lanka Journal of Medicine estimates that nearly 700 abortions take place in the country daily, even though the law currently states that abortions could only be performed to save a mothers life.
By contrast, neighboring countries such as India and Singapore, have relatively liberal abortion laws, according to an analysis by the US - based Guttmacher Institute.
The relaxing of laws in Sri Lanka, should have initiated many, many years ago, said Madusha Dissanayake, the Public Affairs Director for the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka.
We have been penalizing the people the State should have actually providing security for, she said.
Legislative gridlock
Over the weekend, though, the movements momentum stalled. First, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said at a media briefing that the status of the legalization initiative was still just a proposal but had not been approved by the Cabinet.
President of Catholic Bishops Conference,His Lordship Bishop Winston FernandoYouth Activist at Youth Action Network,Sarah SoysaFamily Planning Association, Director Public Affairs,policy and Advocay, Madusha Dissanayake
Then, the media reported that the drafting of the Bill was on hold, due to President Maithripala Sirisena wanting the religious leaders to consult on it and they were unable to reach a consensus.
Documents reviewed by the Daily News this week, show that the Presidents request actually goes back to January.
This [abortion] memorandum is very convincing on humanitarian grounds to make laws for the purpose, President Sirisena wrote in a January 16 Cabinet memo. Since certain religious groups are emphatically against abortion  I recommend that the Minister of Justice and other religion related Ministers responsible for religious affairs, should conduct a dialogue with religious leaders before proceeding further on this proposal. But the record shows that the group of religious leaders and government officials have not met since March 8. At the time since, the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka had made strong statements, opposing any move to legalize abortion in the country.
I expected this of course, Soysa said in an interview on Tuesday.
Its the Catholic Church that comes first, she said.
And then what generally happens and what would happen very soon, are the other religious groups, the Buddhist monks and Muslim leaders and everybody concerned, would follow this bandwagon, while everyone will support the same thing.
Religious opposition
The President of the Bishops Conference Bishop Winston Fernando, certainly hopes Soysas prediction would comes true.
No one has a right to take life, he said in an interview. Natural birth to natural death, life is sacred. And we believe life begins at the moment of conception.
For that reason, he said that the Catholic Church opposes any form of abortion whatsoever.
The Church has a well-documented history of lobbying against abortion laws around the world, and with great success in places such as the Philippines, where it remains illegal in all forms.
When Amnesty International changed its policy to support abortions for women who were raped, the Vatican called on the Catholics worldwide, to withdraw their support for the non profit.
Bishop Fernando said the abortion question was not one of politics, but of morality.
This has been our position since time immemorial, he said. Im surprised that politicians have taken this into their own hands, trying to legalize abortion after all this discussion.
Fernando said that when Catholic leaders spoke with Buddhist monks, Hindu clergy and Muslim leaders, we explained our position to them very clearly.
And (their) position is the same as ours, he added.
Dr. Kapila Jayaratne, the National Programme Manager for Maternal and Child Morbidity & Mortality Surveillance at the Family Health Bureau, is a major champion of the current legalization initiative.
He said he tried to keep the conversation concerning abortion away from moral terms. I dont even like using the term abortion, he said in a recent interview, because of the stigma it carries. Instead, he said the proposed Bill was about the medical termination of pregnancy in two specific instances.
We dont have any other agenda, he said.
But even Jayaratne was unable to escape from putting the issue, which is so morally divisive, into human terms.
We daily witness the sufferings of women, he said. And it was a suffering for the baby also  he is suffering in utero, and then after delivery, and then after one week he ultimately dies, giving another grievance to the family and the community too.
Ours is a medical perspective and what were advocating is a human approach, he added. We respect belief, but at the same time, we need to look at the suffering.
The future of abortion
A majority of Sri Lankans may agree with Jayaratnes opinion. In a survey published in the Ceylon Medical Journal last year, 65 percent of the respondents said abortion should be legalised in cases of rape. Another 53 percent said it should be legal for pregnancies with lethal fetal abnormalities.
But it appears that the Bill would not go to a vote until it gets an OK from religious leaders.
Progressive leaders need to lobby the President and look at that direction, Soysa, the youth activist, said this week. But its going to be extremely difficult.
Maybe it would fail this time, she said. But maybe it would be back again and maybe if it was to come back many more times, it would pass.

Sisu Suraksha to benefit  4.5 million students
Following in the footsteps of free education pioneer C.W.W.Kannangara, the government yesterday launched free medical insurance scheme Sisu Suraksha for the 4.5 million students in the country.
The scheme will be effective from October 1 in parallel with World Children's Day covering all students in government schools, non-aided or aided private schools, Pirivena schools and international schools.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said this health insurance scheme will further enhance free education in the country.
"Under this scheme, if a student is hospitalised at a government hospital, Rs.1000 will be paid daily for upto 30 days and each student would be entitled to this benefit twice a year. If hospitalised in a private hospital, each student will get upto Rs.1,00,000 to settle the bills.
In case of death of a parent,a student would be paid up to Rs.75,000 to complete his/her education, while in the case of the death of a student, Rs.100,000 would be paid to the immediate family. The scheme will also provide Rs.10,000 per day for OPD treatment," the Minister said. "We are also looking at the possibility of getting 20 percent discount for students consulting private doctors and specialist consultants at private hospitals, Minister Kariyawasam added. He said that school principals have responsibility to implement this scheme in a successfull manner. Relevant circulars in this regard will be sent to schools in due course.

SLFP Convention brought minority  parties in to our platform: Amaraweera
The 66th SLFP Party Convention which brought many of the minority parties on to its platform, is very hopeful that they would support its candidate at a future Presidential election. UPFA General Secretary and Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Mahinda Amaraweera addressing the weekly SLFP media briefing yesterday challenged any other majority party to be able to do the same,
We saw Sumanthiran from the TNA with Doughlas Devananda of the EPDP, then we had hill country parties of Digambaram and Mano Ganesan. We also had Rauf Hakeem of the SLMC and representatives of the ACMC, Minister Amaraweera said.
He went on to add, It is only President Maithripala Sirisena who has been able to do so. These parties have said that the Convention had renewed their trust in President Sirisena,
If we are to win an election, we could not do so without the support of these parties, explained Minister Amaraweera further, as the SLFP under President Sirisena has tried hard to win the confidence of the minorities which it lost during the previous regime.
The 66th Convention held on September 3, the Minister said, was a harbinger of the support the President and the SLFP enjoyed in the country, adding that it was more successful than any of the previous Conventions they have had so far.
Members of the Central Committee and the MPs had met President Sirisena on Wednesday evening to discuss the future action of the party in the aftermath of the Convention, said Amaraweera. Those gathered had decided to target party supporters at grassroot level.
At village level, we have noticed that we were enjoying much support. Despite whatever the Joint Opposition says, the average SLFPer at the grassroot level is with the Party and President. Thus, we have decided to concentrate our efforts there, he said.
Commenting on reports that certain SLFPers were set to leave the government, the Minister said that he was unaware of such a move and that the Joint Opposition has been playing the same tune for some time now with no discernible results to show.

SLFP will contest elections under the 'hand' symbol : Amaraweera
UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said SLFP will not contest an election under any other symbol than the hand. He added that he believed that the unity government would have achieved its purpose by 2020.
Amaraweera added that the SLFP was determined to form an SLFP-led UPFA government after 2020.
The two major parties which signed the MoU to govern together came to an end last month but the two parties have agreed to go it together until December 31.
By that time, we would have saved Sri Lanka from international investigations, we have removed the EU ban on fisheries, won GSP plus back, able to bring democracy and the biggest victory would be to change the electoral system, explained Amaraweera. UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim, however, has stated that his party looked forward to continuing the partnership beyond 2020.
We are happy that he looks upon us in such a favourable light but we want our own government now, said the UPFA General Secretary in response to his UNP counterpart.

SLID promotes professional directors in all companies
The Enron and WorldCom scandal, the crash of Lehman Brothers and closer home, the collapse of Pramuka Bank and Golden Key Credit Card Company Ltd., to name a few, brings to mind the importance of boardroom ethics and the need for a director to be alive to what is happening inside his or her own company without being solely dependent on others for such information.
Sri Lankas Companies Act of 2007 also holds directors accountable.
It even empowers the law to seize a directors own private assets for the recovery of losses suffered by a company.
Therefore, subscribing to boardroom ethics is not only crucial for the survival of a company or a directors character, but is also important to safeguard his or her own personal assets.
The law has no mercy on sleeping directors. It requires all to be hands on'. This is no trifle matter.
The SLID Board Leadership Director Certification Programme, also known as the Board Leadership Training Programme (BLT) addresses this critical need.
Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID) Chairman Preethi Jayawardena said that BLT has a specific focus on grooming young directors and associate directors. Its even good for mature directors, he said.
BLT is mainly about corporate governance in practice and in action and is not limited to theory only. BLT makes a complete director.
It is also a training programme specifically designed to enhance the leadership skills of Board Members.
BLT is based on material developed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Global Corporate Governance Forum customized and updated to suit Sri Lanka and accredited by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka.
The programme is delivered by the SLID faculty of trainers who have the knowledge base, experience and skills set to lead director education programmes. Included in the SLID faculty are certified IFC Corporate Governance Board Leadership trainers.
SLID is looking at submitting a proposal to make this certification programme mandatory for new directors in public quoted companies, Jayawardena said.
BLT, with a focus on corporate governance runs over two full days over four months and comprises four parts and sixteen modules covering topics such as corporate governance, the business case for corporate governance, disclosure and transparency, shareowners and stakeholders, Boards role, directors duties and liabilities, the effective Board: composition and structure, Board practices, Board procedures, governance of strategy, evaluating strategy delivery and executive directors' performance, the governance of risk, corporate responsibility, financial oversight, reporting, corporate finance, and the control environment.
The programme is delivered by a faculty comprising renowned professionals and corporate personalities such as Dr Harsha Cabral (PC), Dilani Alagaratnam, Aroshi Nanayakkara, Dilshan Rodrigo, Manil Jayasinghe and Suren Rajakarier.
Ordinary members of SLID who complete the SLID Leadership Training programme will be qualified to become graduate members of SLID and are eligible to use the acronym 'GSLID' after their name.
GSLID members are included in a database and their names are shared with companies looking for independent directors.
We must have such training programmes for upcoming directors, said Jayawardena. This training programme is continuously renewed and upgraded, he said.
It is on the job, practical training for directors and not just theory alone, the SLID Chairman said.
SLID together with IFC conducted an exclusive Corporate Governance Board Leadership Training of Trainers workshop last year for SLIDs faculty which built on their capacities, to create an interactive environment for the BLT programme.
SLID also has a Power Evening series of knowledge sharing sessions which are held regularly as panel discussions on topics of interest for directors with international and local presenters.
Jayawardena emphasized the importance of availing cheap credit to SMEs, the countrys biggest employer. But the biggest handicap is that Sri Lanka has no development banks to provide cheap credit to the SME sector.
SLID has embarked on a programme of educating the drivers in the SME sector, namely, its owners, directors and operators, on financial literacy.
The ability to produce a professional set of accounts to banks may help to lessen the burden borne by SME operators, by banks weaning away from charging high lending rates to this key sector of the economy because of orderly and professional accounting standards adopted and presented by this important sector of the economy. SLID has over 700 members and with associate members, its membership extends to 800.
He said that the 'institute of directors' is a worldwide programme encompassing Sri Lankas giant neighbour India and embraces other countries in the region such as Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia.
SLID plans to latch itself to this international network, to gain more insights as to how directors could add more value to their organizations and to the country at large.
With Jayawardena at the helm, SLID also has on its radar screen to improve the efficacy of family owned businesses. The SLID Chairman said that there has not been any studies done in Sri Lanka, but he believes that a majority of the companies in Sri Lanka are family businesses and globally studies have shown that more than 66% of businesses are family owned and these are estimated to contribute about 70% of the annual global GDP.
Nonetheless, most of those family run businesses dont go beyond the third generation, he said. In business literature there is a 30:13:3 rule, which states that around 30% of family businesses survive to the second generation, 13% to the third generation and only 3% beyond the third generation.
Most often there is a difference between ownership and management in these family businesses and the need is corporate governance where everyone is treated equally so that there is value.
Such family owned companies should have independent remuneration committees, audit committees, credit committees, risk assessment committees and so on.
As the company grows, outside talent should be invited and be allowed to foster. Only then will family owned companies become sustainable and their future assured, he said.
SLIDs other Board members comprise well known figures in the countrys corporate sector. They are: Senior Vice Chairman Rasakantha Rasiah, Vice Chairman Faizal Salieh, Immediate Past Chairman Shiromal Cooray and Council: Dilani Alagaratnam, Aroshi Nanayakkara, Prakash Schaffter, Dinesh Weerakkody, Vish Govindasamy, Dilshan Rodrigo and Kasturi Wilson.

Sri Lanka to reach economic comfort zone by 2025: PM
After settling Rajapaksa regime debts 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that Sri Lanka will be converted to a hub of Indian Ocean through developing economically important sectors including industry, naval and air transportation.
The Prime Minister said through these fruitful initiatives taken by the Government, Sri Lanka will reach an economic comfort zone by 2025 after settling all the debts and liabilities of the Rajapaksa regime.
The countrys economy is being strengthened with the moves taken by this government, he noted.
The Prime Minister was speaking at an event organised to mark the keel laying ceremony of a cable laying vessel at the Colombo Dockyard Limited yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the biggest ever loan installment of the mountain of loans obtained during the Rajapaksa regime is to be paid in 2018. However, the country is all set to achieve an stable economic position by 2025 after settling all its dues.
The Prime Minister said that another ship building institute will be established to boost the economy.
The Prime Minister appreciated the assistance of Japanese Government highlighting that the Japanese assistance is a huge strength to the country.
Speaking the gathering he added that Japanese investors will come to the country by January.
This event can be considered as a move to strengthen the countrys economy. The economy of a country should not only focus on one sector but should incorporate a number of sectors. Sri Lankas export economy is mainly focused on a few products such as tea, rubber,coconut and garments. However, the time is ripe to focus on many other sectors such as ship building, where technology is used, he added.
With the receiving of the GSP Plus concession, Sri Lanka is benefited by being granted permission to send over 6,000 products to the European market. It is needed to increase the exports aiming to receive more foreign reserves, the Prime Minister said. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that measures have been taken to develop the fisheries industry aiming to get the maximum benefits from the GSP Plus concession.
We should increase exports to achieve better economic prosperity. This should be the countrys main objective, the Premier said. The Prime Minister added that the countrys economy was affected by a mountain of loans which prompted the previous government to go for an early election.
He said the country has been subjected to rapid economic development programme. A few industrial zones will be established in several parts of the country so as to attract foreign and local investors. Under this programme, Kandy city is going to be developed with the assistance of the Japanese Government. Besides, tourist zones will be established in the Galle district.
The country needs to attract foreign investments and introduce the latest technology to achieve economic prosperity.
However, when we try to do so,certain people who were not able to build a paper boat are casting aspersions and shedding crocodile tears that the Government is selling countrys resources. The Prime Minister said that our harbours should be developed to cater to the world.

Sri Lanka tea prices up 28% in August
ECONOMYNEXT  Sri Lankan tea prices rose sharply in August this year from a year ago, helped by demand from oil producing countries after a recovery in oil prices, brokers said.
The Colombo tea auction average for August 2017 of Rs606.86 a kilo was up Rs133.08 or 28 percent from Rs473.78 in August 2016, Forbes & Walker Tea Brokers said.
Global oil prices often have an impact on Sri Lanka tea prices, with almost 7 percent of Sri Lankas tea exporters being absorbed by these oil rich countries, they said in a report.
They noted the increase in oil prices by 4 percent in July 2017 to $46.93 per barrel on month-on-month basis after two consecutive months of sharp declines.
During the latter part of August, there was a further 9 percent increase in oil prices to $51.87 per barrel and a further gain to the current $54 per barrel.
Forbes & Walker Tea Brokers said prices of teas from all three elevations rose during August, with the biggest gains in the high-grown varieties.
The brokers said prices were higher than a year ago even in US dollar terms.

STAX presents investment possibilities in SL to Singapore Water Association
STAX Inc., a global strategy consulting firm, has been working in collaboration with International Enterprise Singapore (IE) for over two years to inform Singaporean companies and investors on investment opportunities in Sri Lanka.
IE is a statutory board under Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry that facilitates the overseas growth of Singaporean companies and promotes international trade.
Given this liaison with IE, STAX has presented regularly to business communities in Singapore on the macro-economic landscape and investment opportunities in Sri Lanka. STAX was recently invited by IE and the Singapore Water Association (SWA) to present an overview of the opportunities in Sri Lanka's water sector. The presentation provides potential investors with a comprehensive view of the required investments relating to the water sector in Sri Lanka, said Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera, a Director at STAX.
Sri Lanka has an ample water supply with 52.8 billion cubic meters (BCM) of surface, ground, and overlap between surface and groundwater. The country's water consumption in 2013 was 16 BCM and is set to reach 20 BCM by 2018. Of the 120 BCM of annual rainfall received, only about 36% is available for use due to run-offs in the river system and lack of dam capacity. Over 64% of annual rainfall is currently non-utilisable because of insufficient catchment capacity. Other reasons for loss of water include infiltration and seepage, evaporation, and ground water recharge.
Despite the ample rainfall and the broad supply of water resources available to the populace, dry zones in the island are expected to face absolute water scarcity by 2025, largely owing to the forecasted increase in water-intensive paddy cultivation. The situation is exacerbated by poor adoption of water saving techniques and technological advancements; high losses associated with storage, distribution, and on-farm utilisation of water; and lack of incentives for conservation due to free state supply of water for irrigation.
The other reasons for the impending crisis include the regional differences in the distribution of usable water, as the Wet Zone (Central and South West districts) occupy 25% of the country's area but have 70% of the water resources, while the Dry Zone (North and East) occupies more than half the land area but claims only 30% of the water resources and more than 80% of the water demand. Furthermore, climate change is expected to aggravate water scarcity in future.
This is evident in the increasingly unpredictable and debilitating droughts and floods that Sri Lanka has recently witnessed - both of which can lead to shortages of clean water. Pollution of water sources too plays a key role in reducing the water available for agriculture as well as domestic use.
Hence, there is an increasing need for efficient water management to ensure sufficient water availability for all consumption sectors. While many efforts have been taken by the government and the private sector, more investment is needed to implement schemes to adequately prepare for the upcoming crisis.

Stokes treble rocks Windies as Anderson awaits 500th wicket
London: Ben Stokes took three wickets in quick succession as West Indies were reduced to 119 for seven at tea on the first day of the third Test against England at Lord's on Thursday.
James Anderson, who had made the initial double strike before lunch, was unable to add to his tally in the second session, with the Lancashire swing king still a tantalising one away from becoming the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets.
But all-rounder Stokes kept England on top, taking three for 22 in an unchanged 13-over spell spanning nearly two hours.
West Indies captain Jason Holder, who had taken the bold decision to bat first after winning the toss on a green-tinged pitch, and Devendra Bishoo were both nine not out.
Holder's side upset the odds by chasing down a target of 322 to win the second Test at Headingley by five wickets and level the three-match series at 1-1.
But they struggled in overcast conditions and only when Kieran Powell and Shai Hope -- fresh from Headingley scores of 147 and 118 not out, his first two hundreds in Test cricket -- were sharing a partnership of 56 did West Indies look like getting back on level terms.
Anderson, wicketless in the second innings at Leeds, should have had his 498th Test wicket when he took Kraigg Brathwaite's outside edge with the opener, who made 134 and 95 at Headingley, on three.
But Alastair Cook, who floored two first-slip catches during that victory charge last week, dropped a seemingly routine chance. It was not a costly error as Anderson, however, squared Brathwaite up on 10, and wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow made no mistake to leave West Indies 18 for one.
Rain then stopped play for 40 minutes and when the match resumed Anderson had Kyle Hope out for a duck when the batsman, trying to withdraw his bat, was well caught by a diving Bairstow.
Anderson had taken two wickets for no runs in 12 balls and West Indies were 22 for two.
Hope's exit brought in younger brother Shai Hope. The 23-year-old, carrying on from where he left off, marked his first ball by punching Anderson through the covers for four.At lunch the West Indies were 35 for two, with Powell 17 not out and Shai Hope unbeaten on eight. AFP

They are what a lot of teams aspire to be: Weve a lot to learn from India  - coach Pothas
Interim head coach Nic Pothas praised the Indian cricket team comparing them to New Zealands mighty rugby side All-Blacks and said that Sri Lanka had a lot to learn from them.
You look at their team and they are very All-Black-like. Theres a lot of respect for the facilities, theres a lot of respect for the opposition. They are very ruthless in the way they go about their work. Their work-ethic is immense. They are what a lot of teams aspire to be. The most important thing for us is learning from our mistakes, but most importantly, learning from them, said South African Pothas after Sri Lanka had lost the one-off T20 international to India at the R Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday.
That loss followed 3-0 and 5-0 whitewashes at the hands of India in the Test and ODI series.
Comparing the two teams Pothas said, First and foremost weve got to put everything in perspective, because its very easy to look at things at face value. Were a side thats developing. They are a side that is complete. Youve got to look at that, initially. Youve got to look at the quality they have in that side. Its a side with immense quality. Its always going to be tough to compete against them, or to try and beat them.
We just needed to compete a little bit more. I think it would be wrong of us not to learn off them. They do so many things very well. Most of them are just basics. You see how Virat (Kohli) runs between the wickets. You see the respect he commands on the field as a leader. Hes a role model to people and he pulls people with him. When you look at the way they go about their work and the culture that Virat has created within that team, its very, very impressive. Im sure its a great compliment to him, but its a fact, he said.
Pothas said that he has been in conversation with the Indian team physio Patrick Farhart over dinner and coffee during the tour and learnt quite a lot from him how the Indian team is jelling as a unit.
Patricks a very close friend of mine, so Ive spoken to him. These guys are very busy the same as we are, so to encroach on their leisure time  I dont want to do that. But I do get all the information Im looking for in the questions Im asking from Paddy. They arent surprising answers. Its just what you expect. But it is impressive. Even if you are aware of whats going on with their team, when you hear how it actually works, its very impressive. Its not rocket science, but its a discipline that is required across the board, said Pothas.
On the subject of the number of injuries suffered by the Sri Lankan team Pothas said the figure was an acceptable rate compared to teams around the world.
Talking to Paddy theres an acceptable number, which is about 15-20% of your squad. Thats an acceptable injury rate, and were well within that rate, said Pothas. It looks like we have a heap of injuries but were well within the rate. A lot of the injuries are just due to a spike in workload. A lot of guys work at the HPC (High Performance Centre) and they have good programs. Once they come and join us, that spike in workload tests a few players. We just have to look at that, but were within the acceptable injury rate.
Pothas accepted the fact that the players who replace the injured will not be good as them.
Thats true of any sport anywhere in the world. The guy thats in the team is in better form or is a player of better quality, at that point in time. The person coming in very often is not going to be in the same league as the guy who got injured. Thats the nature of sport around the world. What were doing now is to try and create (a) a quality within the team and (b) a depth, so that when players do get injured, the people that come in can do a job for us.
Commenting on the string of losses the Sri Lanka team has undergone in the past few months Pothas said, Thats a fact if you look at it on paper. If you take a young team to South Africa where they prepared the conditions to suit themselves, its going to be very, very tough over there. A lot of good things were done in South Africa. Yes the results didnt go our way.
At some point youve got to put your hand up and say: Look, this is the string of results. We need to look forward and get better. Weve spoken about the consistency. Weve got a lot of good players in this team. Its just a matter of giving them the confidence and the belief that they are very good players and will become world-class players. I think its a little bit of give from the coaching side and theres a little bit of give to come from the players side, to move forward, he said.
Pothas said that Sri Lanka was about 15 runs short on the runs they scored especially playing a side like India. It was a competitive total. But if you looked at how we played, we were probably 15 short of what we could have got on that wicket. We probably had a few too many little cameos that we could have dragged on a little bit longer. 170 is probably competitive but when you play a team of such quality, youre going to have to be very good in the field and with the ball to try and stop that being scored.

Tips and tricks for tasty cooking
A pinch of turmeric powder added to all kinds of dal when cooking hastens the cooking process.
Add a pinch of sugar while cooking any green leaf vegetables. This will help maintain the bright green color.
Always spray your grill with non-stick cooking spray before grilling to avoid sticking!
Before chopping nuts in a food processor, dust them with flour. This keeps the nuts from sticking to the processor.
Before heating a nonstick pan, always coat it with nonstick vegetable cooking spray and never heat the pan more than 3 minutes before adding food.
Collect a large assortment of Chinese wooden paddles and spoons. Use them to save wear and tear on your good stainless steel and copper pots.
Dried Herbs and spices lose their potency quickly. Buy only a small amount at a time. When using fresh herbs an spices, use 3 times the amount of the dried.
Excess salt in any dish can be brought down by adding diced potatoes, tomatoes or a teaspoon of sugar.
For maintaining the bright colors of any vegetable dont forget to put it in ice cold water as soon as you blanch them.
For perfect hard-cooked eggs, cover the eggs with cold water and bring to a boil. Then turn off the heat and let the eggs sit on the burner for 10-15 minutes.
Fresh eggs are rough and chalky . They will sink and stay horizontal on the bottom of a glass of water. The egg-white is viscous and close around the plump yolk.

Using sea water can cool down the earth
To slow down carbon dioxide from heating up the earth, geo scientists have proposed a new engineering method to manually brighten marine clouds in coastal areas.
In a research by University of Washington, scientists have proposed to replicate the effect that polluting aerosols have on clouds by using the sea water.
The researchers proposed this idea for coastal areas with persistently low hanging marine clouds, which can easily catch the salt from the sea water. In order to take the salt to the clouds, a device that would make the sea water sprinkle up into the sky as micro droplets would be placed in the sea. The research noted that the salt from these microdroplets would act as aerosols and build brighter clouds.
Scientists have a mixed response to this new technique. The geo engineering has enormous amount of uncertainty as it can alter the rainfall patterns, said Professor G Bala of Centre of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, IISC Bangalore. The aerosol-filled clouds always have the uncertainty in terms of the amount of rainfalls they would bring to the area. This new proposal comes in chain with an array of other proposals to beat the climate change with the earliest being putting up mirrors in the space to reflect the sunlight.
It is a dangerous to experiment with the nat-ure by not fully knowing the consequences. Every technology has unintended consequences, said retired Professor Babu Rao of IICT. Modelling studies have shown that once such geoengineering is stopped after the earth cools down, the temperatures would rise again. Thus, a permanent solution would be to reduce greenhouse gas emission, said Dr Arindham from IISC. The Scientist

World Suicide Prevention Day Sept. 10    -Take a minute  change a life
Suicides have become a common occurrence which is a threat to the world today. As it is a global problem, everybodys wish had been to reduce the rate of suicides or completely stop suicides.
It has been reported that during the year 1995, Sri Lanka had recorded the highest number of suicides. Even the Presidential Task Force was set up during that period to mitigate this situation.
According to global statistics, nearly 800,000 suicides are reported from various countries annually, while this number was higher than those killed by wars or homicides. The locally established Sumithrayo organization which is located in Colombo, is very keen on this subject and their sole objective is to completely stop the committing of suicides. They travel throughout the country and conduct various programmes to reduce the rate of suicides.
The Sumithrayo will commemorate the day to coincide with the `World Suicide Prevention Day on September 10 under the theme Take a minute  change a life at the Independence Square, Colombo . The objective of the programme is to motivate the whole nation on the negative side of suicides and reduce the number of suicides. The Day is endorsed by the World Health Organization.
This is an evening programme and it would commence from 5.00 pm to 8.00pm. The programme is open to the general public.

CDL not given land to expand in Colombo port
Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDL) urgently needs additional land for expansion, but it is not being offered to them, said its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer D. V. Abeysinghe.
Speaking to media after laying the key to build their longest ship for a Japanese company, he said CDPLC is now in the red due to global industry downturn in the ship building sector.
Hence, we decided to diversify to building of steel bridges and other construction all over Sri Lanka. We allocated Rs 200 million to lease out a property within the Colombo Port.
He said when Sri Lanka Ports Authority called for tenders to lease out land within the Port, they applied last year.
We were made to understand that our bid was strong, but due to whatever reasons we were not considered. In addition, this process too was called off and new proposals are now being called again. We dont know why this happened.
He said that they are now waiting to find land to unleash their future plans. Asked why they are seeking land within the Port, he said it was because of transport costs and other logistical issues.
Airing his views on the order they received from Japan, he said that the project value is US$ 54 million and their profit margin is around 4%.
The local value addition for this vessel would be over 30%. The tender to build this ship to be used by the Japanese company for laying of a cable in mid sea was secured through an international tender and indicates the confidence in CDL globally. He also predicted that they will once again be a profitable venture from next year. We have several more ship building orders both locally and internationally too.

Htota Port lease will save Rs 40 bn per year
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) would annually save around Rs. 40 billion by way of debt repayment through the lease of the Hambantota Port to China Merchant Port Holdings (CMP).
Speaking at the Colombo Dockyard PLCs (CDL) ceremonial laying of the keel to build the first-ever Cable Laying Vessel for Kokusai Cable Ship Co. Ltd. (KCS) Japan, yesterday, Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the deal will help to usher economic prosperity to the region, due to mega infrastructure developments undertaken by the CMP.
He also said that both 2018 and 2019 would be tough years for Sri Lanka due to high debt servicing. However this will ease towards 2025.
He said that the government would also develop the Trincomalee harbour and make it one of the biggest harbours in the region. This would be with Singaporean assistance.
He said that for a country like Sri Lanka, we need technical assistance of this nature from countries like China and Singapore to further develop the shipping sector and take advantage of the islands unique geographical location.
I dont know why the development of the Colombo harbour is not taking place at a faster pace as it would become a major economic driver to the country. We want to extend the harbour development up to Ja Ela, making it one the biggest harbours in Asia.
Wickremesinghe said that today 60% of cargo bound for India travels through Colombo Port and with proper harbour development it can increase to 75% and this is an area the government is concentrating on.
He also said that the fact that a Japanese lading company placed an order to build a technical advanced ship with Colombo Dockyard shows the confidence global companions have towards Sri Lanka. The keel which was laid yesterday at the Colombo Dockyard will be the biggest ever vessel (contract value wise as well as length wise) to be built by CDL in its illustrious journey of shipbuilding excellence.
The securing of this prestigious shipbuilding contract from a premier Japanese cable laying company further reinstates the high shipbuilding standards achieved by CDL in the world shipbuilding arena, said D. V. Abeysinghe Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, CDL.

SAARC intra-regional trade very low
The SAARC region intra regional trade is one of the lowest in the world and urgent steps should be taken to increase it, said Friedrich Naumann Foundation Regional Director Ronald Meinardus.
Speaking at the SAARC Investment Forum on Wednesday, he said that this is a very sad scenario since the region has a huge population and is rich with natural resources.
The politics in the region too is having a negative impact for low integrated trade.
He said that the Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCISL) has been an important partner and they have launched a series of events with them.
SAARC Chamber of Commerce Secretary General Suraj Vaidya said that over 17% of global GDP flowed through the region in early 2000 but today it is not so. We must all work together to revive this past glory.
The movement is not dying and it plays a major role towards the development for the region.
He also said that they expect women entrepreneurs in the region to play an even bigger role in the future.
He also said that though there is tension between some regional countries it should not be an issue to increase trade.
If you take China and Taiwan, there were only seven flights per week in 2002. But today it has increased to around 90 per week, which clearly shows that trade and tourism can go ahead even in hostile nations.
FCCISL clinched the much coveted and prestigious presidency at SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry  the apex body of SAARC chambers, in Islamabad, Pakistan, for 2018 and appointed Ruwan Edirisinghe as the senior vice president (SVP), recently. He is to assume the Presidency of SAARC CCI in 2018.

Aloysius questioned by CID for over six hours
Arjun Aloysius appeared before the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday to give a statement to the CID. He was questioned by the CID for over six hours.
Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando withdrew from representing Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) at the Treasury Bond Commission with effect from yesterday.
However, Fernando PC will assist the Commission until Kasun Palisenas testimony is completed.
Fernando PC giving reasons for his withdrawal, said his client refrained from providing all the telephone call recordings and call information to the commission despite being instructed to do so.
Fernando PC said that he was not aware of the said information was in possession of the PTL. He said on September 4, 2017 it was revealed otherwise.
Fernando PC has spoken with the PTL company lawyer and had arrived at the decision to assist the commission until Palisena completes his testimony. Legal representative of former Governor Arjun Mahendran cross examined the witness next.
Counsel Chanaka de Silva pointed out that Aloysius must have received certain decisions taken at the State Bank Primary Dealers meeting which former Governor Mahendran has nothing to do with. It was previously revealed that Arjun Aloysius has received bidding information of some state institutes including EPF and NSB Fund management.
The tables turned when De Silva questioned witness Nuwan Salgado on the allegation that Mahendran asked for a statement given by Kasun Palisena to the COPE Sub Committee inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
The allegation was made based on a telephone call recording played before the commission yesterday (06). The said call recording was among the deleted calls by the PTL.
Referring to the date of the call recording which was August 12, 2016, de Silva pointed out that Mahendran was not the Central Bank Governor anymore at the time.
He also pointed out that the said COPE Sub Committee was not the first but the second one headed by MP Sunil Handunnetti, inquiring into the Tresury Bond Commission.
De Silva also pointed out that the said date however coincides with the date when present Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy testified before the COPE Sub Committee inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
So, when Palisena mentioned about a Governor to Salgado who was he referring to, De Silva questioned.

Australia, Sri Lanka  reinforce cooperation on counter-people smuggling
Australia and Sri Lanka have dealt a blow to people smugglers operating in the region through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), enabling even closer cooperation between the two countries on counter-people smuggling.
The MoU will facilitate the return to Sri Lanka of people who are involved in people smuggling activities. It also paves the way for enhanced information sharing on methods for tracking, intercepting and investigating people smugglers.
The MoU was signed at a ceremony in Canberra by Immigration and Border Protection Department Secretary Michael Pezzullo and Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Kapila Mudantha Waidyaratne.
Australias strong and cooperative relationships with international partners, including Sri Lanka are an important part of Australias multi-layered approach to combating people smuggling and preventing people from risking their lives on illegal boat voyages to Australia.
Since Operation Sovereign Borders began in 2013, every attempted people smuggling venture from Sri Lanka to Australia has failed. The MoU demonstrates the resolve of both countries to see the success continue.
The agreement will also see further cooperation between the two nations on countering human trafficking, stopping the movement of illicit goods and targeting money laundering and proceeds of crime.
Training and cooperation in Australia and Sri Lanka will give officers from both agencies the opportunity to strengthen their skills across these areas and foster closer working relationships.
Australia has a long history of successful cooperation with Sri Lanka on people smuggling and a range of other transnational crimes. Todays agreement provides a strong indication that this type of cooperation is set to continue and expand.

Bangladesh calls for 2018 FTA
As Sri Lanka-Bangladesh trade continued its steady climb, a top Bangladeshi Minister recently issued a high level call for a speedier Free Trade Agreement with Sri Lanka, to conclude as early as next year. Yet another Sri Lanka-Bangladesh Working Group on Trade is also to take place in Colombo soon.
Our present bilateral trade has been on the increase but the volumes are not so great, said Bangladesh Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed at a meeting with Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, in Colombo, recently.
High Commissioner of Bangladesh in Sri Lanka Riaz Hamidullah joined the high level discussion with Minister Bathiudeen.
In the five-year period of 2012-2016, bilateral trade between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka surged by a strong 43% to $142 million (2016). Even YoY trade increased during this period every year: 2016 alone saw an 11% surge (from 2015s $131 million).
It is time that we focus on much broader trade levels than at present, said Bangladeshi Minister Ahmed. Our present bilateral trade has been on an increasing trend but the volumes are not so great and we can do much better. I propose we speed up the proposed FTA between both countries. It is great if we can conclude the FTA by end of next year and I propose so. Meanwhile, we can conclude the next Joint Working Group before that, in view of the FTA.
It is time to broaden the trade baskets as well. For instance, Sri Lanka can buy more Bangladeshi pharma products at lower costs.
The first meeting of the Bangladesh-Sri Lanka Joint Working Group (JWG) on Trade was held in Dhaka in February 2014 and both sides agreed on feasibility studies for a framework arrangement to boost bilateral trade.
The approval of the Sri Lankan Cabinet was granted in May 2014 and the feasibility study (Sri Lanka segment) was completed subsequently.
According to the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka under Minister Bathiudeen, during the second JWG Meeting in Colombo in September 2014, both sides agreed that after finalization of the studies and consultation with the stakeholders, negotiations for a potential PTA/FTA or any other institutional mechanism may be initiated.

Book review: Vignettes of  village life
Title: Grass for my feet
Author: J Vijayatunga
Grass for my feet by J Vijayatungabrings a good array of several vignettes of village life in Si Lanka written in great lucidity for anyone to breathe the authenticity of village life prior to independence and before sophistication due to modernization. Any Sri Lankan could feel proud as most of the critics have leveled J.Vitayatungawith great many writers.
On the whole, almost all the villages in the world look the same in constitution.
There are very distinguished people, in other words squires, rich and poor people, the village merchants, the temple priests, highwaymen or burglars and even murderers. To cap them all, the cattle and the poultry farm are common sights. In Dickencianstyle village characters give immense life to his fictions, in the same way the real rustic characters coming in this great fiction keep the reader under the grip of the writer. It is the beauty of his narration.
Bathing together in the village brook is fun and healthy because the cool water under the kumbuk trees with the rustling of the bamboo trees in tranquility lull the bathing party to the rhythm of the village.
Thus evening bathing of men and the morning washing and bathing of the village damsels drive away weariness and lethargy. How the village undergoes a rapid change is written well-wordily to take the reader on a smooth glide. Evening in the village is not ascene tobe read in a book, it is tobe felt by the soul. Yet, the writer makes it happen. Story time is not alien not only to the English reader but also to the Sri Lankan rural child, but the village story teller mingles our culture with folk lore into this traditional impart of versatile knowledge. Pundits in conclave are the decision makers in the contemporary society. Village fishing by angling and blocking a water course are always enticing. Pure nutrition and its thrill are immense to the villager. The story does not end there. The women in villages are born experts in this aspect of culinary art. The writerreminisces his early childhood. Fresh water fish experience in thevillage is something to cherish in life. The appearance of white men in the village is significant. Law and order is regulated by their service. The village lads have picnics into the jungle to eat wild dates, black berry, wild guava called cheena pera or another local variety called himbutu. The early childhood development in the village spontaneously teaches caring and sharing and also collective responsibly in the thicket as it is a highly serpent infested place. Another aspect of this escapade is the caning from their parents. The conversation across the stream is real bucolic romance that you have to read and feel. The lads approach and the village lasss gradual response speak volumes for the writers aptitude of writing that our country could be proud of rain, harvesting, cattle and the jungle expeditions as aforementioned are some of the excellent chapters of indescribable beauty. The young and old both could spend an enjoyable time by reading `Grass for my feet.
The demise of the village millionaire, a village wedding are depicted in real graphics, how a house is built with the village collective labour would take you back to the village gumption. Superstitious beliefs such as evil eye, evil tongue, devil dancing and also how an alms giving is conducted with real piety in a village house are of paramount importance because they are going to be things of the past.
The village temple and the community are inseparable. The urban environment is almost either cemented or macadamized. The village child still could walk on some grass. The gravity of the situation is that when the feet do not touch the mother earth, people get disjoined from nature. Violence and intolerance play havoc in later life. In this light, the writer opine that the schoolgoers could revert to some reading about grass, village life and cascading waterfalls to be away from the dull and monotonous ambience of the concrete jungles.

Chena cultivators shall be entitled for fertilizer subsidy and cultivation loss compensation. Although the government is prepared to officer chena cultivators growing maize this facility, the lack of land ownership where they cultivate prevent them from receiving it, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The minister told the Daily News that the government has taken a decision to accept the certificate issued by the Grama Niladhari confirming the particular crown land has been cultivated by the chena farmer, to grant the fertilizer subsidy and crop damage compensation. This is a long-felt requirement as far as the chena cultivators are concerned.
But I warn the chena cultivators not to misuse this to expand the extent of crown land they cultivate in or by claiming ownership of such land at any cost.
This is a temporary benefit which chena cultivators could entertain permanently provided that they adhere to the conditions, Minister Dissanayake said.
He added that Divisional Secretaries are expected to identify the limited extend of crown land being cultivated by the chena cultivators to ensure that conditions are not breached.

Coroner sounds alarm on liaisons of HIV infected
Stresses need to keep track of close affiliates
Colombo City Coroner, Iresha Samaraweera yesterday called for a mechanism to monitor relations of persons affected with AIDS in order to prevent the spread of the disease.
She said the presence of an institution to carry out this task will be of great use to the country at large.Samaraweera made these observations at the Colombo City Coroners Court during an inquest into the death of a woman who had suffered from HIV.
The woman, a Filipino national has been subjected to a post mortem without a blood test being carried out and thus her medical reports stated the cause of death to be a cold which turned into pneumonia.
The Coroner however pointed out that the bed head reports from two of Colombos Hospitals, showed that she was a serious HIV patient.
AIDS is a disease which weakens ones immune system, and even a common cold can turn into pneumonia, explained the Coroner.
The Filipino national had worked as a technician in a famous garment factory for the past eight years and it is reported that she had relations with several locals during that time. Submissions made to Court also revealed that the woman was living together with a married man at the time of her death and thus the Coroner stressed that it was more important than ever to have a system to record the family background and details of partners of her partner and his partners. She added that this was not the first case she had worked on where HIV patients had posed the risk of infection to others.
Special attention needs to be paid to such families but we dont have such an institution to take on that responsibility, she said.
The deceased identified as Lilian Berdios Arasalima (44) has had no family living here and the Human Resource Director of the company informed court that they have informed her family in the Philippines of her death and they have made arrangements to send her body back to her home country.

A Dangerous Schoolboy Fight..!
As I watch Trump tweeting threatening outbursts to the North Korean dictator and Kim cocking a snook at him, it does tend to remind me of similar fights in my schooldays:They were strange kind of fights, where two adversaries, faced each other, mouthed wild words at one another, swung their arms emptily in the air, and then strangest of all behaviors Id seen, rolled their sleeves, pushed elbows back, and hoped like crazy that somebody would hold those elbows and prevent them from fighting further.
In most of those fights, that signaled the end, because the pushing back of elbows was a sign to friends to hold onto their arms and prevent thefight escalating.
Trump and Kim Jong-un seem to be doing what Ive seen time and again in those schoolboydays. Threats and arm swinging seem to fill newspaper space, editorials scream of what could happen, and the two glare at each other, mouth dare words and threaten to burst bombs.
But horror of horrors, nobody is holding them back: Their elbows dangle free of preventive hands!
And thats a dangerous situation, because the world believes the two are madmen facing each other and making loud empty noises.
Now, and here let me take you back to those fights of yore;you can see both my school opponents creating a huge din, and suddenly find their friends who were always at their side to prevent them from hitting each other, have left the fight with boredom.
Those two just mouth empty words at each other, their friends say and move away.
And that is when the action happens.
Suddenly theres a slamming of fist against cheek, foot against stomach and a fight which everybody thought was a no fight becomes a bloody battle, till one or the other is soundly beaten, or both are dragged off to the headmasters office.
Unfortunately, in this Trump-Kim wrestling match, theres no headmaster, and as the world gets bored with their rhetoric and tunes off and they decide to missile and nuke each other, its going to be a catastrophe of a magnitude beyond comprehension!
So, lets not get bored by these two mad men. Even as they swing their fists at each other, even as they hurl abuses and threats, lets continue holding their sweaty elbows, and prevent them from going to the next stage!
They dont want to fight, but they love an audience and want to hold on to it. And the sooner that audience gets bored and moves away, a real disastrous fight could begin.
So stand around, watch the circus, hold their arms, and pretend you are hugely interested in the mock skirmish you are allowed to witness.
Dare you move away, the world you love and know well, may disappear.
Dont yawn, just clap and cheer and pull back their arms and elbows..!

Death of three Sri Lankans in Sharjah: Police confirm suicide
Sharjah Police confirmed that the deaths of three people in a hotel apartment in Sharjah on August 29 were the result of suicide.
The incident, described by police as a group suicide attempt, involved a man, a woman and a youth along with two female relatives, in which the latter two survived.
Police said that three people, a man, his wife and their son, died while two female relatives  the sister and niece of the woman  failed at the suicide attempt.
All of them are Sri Lankans.
The bodies of the 55-year-old man identified J.K. and his 54-year-old wife, B.S., and their 19-year-old son, J.N., were moved to Al Kuwaiti hospital and then to the forensic laboratory for autopsy.
The two women who survived, identified as D.I, 17, and P.I, 27, received treatment at Al Kuwaiti hospital and were transferred to Obaidallah Hospital in Ras Al Khaimah for psychological assessment.
The incident came to light on August 29 at 2.30 am when the man jumped to his death from the 7th floor of the building and a witness in a neighbouring building immediately reported the incident to the police operations room.
Police and forensic experts rushed to the scene of the incident.
Upon checking the identity of the man, police found that he had been residing in the same building from which he jumped to his death.
The police immediately visited his seventh floor apartment and found it double locked from the inside upon which they obtained permission from public prosecution and broke the apartments front door and entered the house.
Inside, they found an older woman and two young women in a pool of blood with their wrists slashed while a young boys body lay on the ground covered with a white sheet.
On a table, police found different kinds of medicines and cups containing red liquid and small white balls.
Initial indications suggested that the boy died first and followed by suicide attempts by the three women, and finally, the man who jumped to his death. Police said that it was a planned suicide. The hotel apartment managements spokesperson said the family had been living in the building for more than a year and had paid a monthly rent of Dh 6,250. He described them as a friendly family.
He added that recently, the woman approached the owner of the hotel apartment and requested him to reduce the rent as her husband, who worked as a gold designer in Dubai, was facing financial problems and that he had not received his salary for three months.
She also informed the owner that a foreigner had conned her husband.
Consequently, the owner reduced the rent to Dh 5,750 per month.
Police said that as they were carrying the bodies of the victims out of the room, one of the young women who survived the suicide attempt began to cry, saying, Why am I still alive.
Investigations into the incident are continuing.

Did a woman write Shakespeares plays
Globe to stage new play about the Dark Lady
The new artistic director of Shakespeares Globe is to launch her first season with a play exploring the theory that a woman may have written some of the Bards plays.
Michelle Terry has commissioned a writer to produce a new work about Aemilia Bassano, a published poet in her day and the mistress of Henry Carey, first cousin of Elizabeth I.
Born into a Jewish family with Venetian origins and married to an Italian musician, she is thought by some academics to be the Dark Lady who inspired Shakespeares sonnets. Others have gone further, suggesting that she may have authored some of his work.
It is a radical suggestion dismissed by most historians, but Terry is open-minded on the question of whether Shakespeare wrote the plays that bear his name. Some people think she authored some of the plays. Im not going to go any further than that because I dont know, she said of Bassano.
My view is: whether it was one man, one woman or 10 people, it exists. And no one else, or no other body of people, has ever matched it. It is the greatest offering to literature that has ever been made.
Terry replaces Emma Rice, who repeatedly clashed with the board over her experimental productions featuring amplified sound and artificial lighting rigs.
Rices recent staging of Romeo and Juliet featured nuclear warheads, pounding music, and Juliets father dancing to disco music in a dinosaur costume.
The job description stipulated that the new post holder must return to the old way of doing things, and Terry agreed. That decision has been made. There will be no amplified sound, there will be no imposed lighting rig, she said, describing the theatre as a raw, naked space in which the ability to see the audience from the stage is paramount.
She promised an unplugged approach, and suggested that during Rices tenure something of the Globes uniqueness was lost.
My offer to a director would be: if you want to do disco-dancing Capulets, if you want to get people to dance in a production go as far as you can with your imagination, and then unplug it.
What can you do with a drum People dance to ceilidhs every night of the week and thats a drum and a fiddle. What can you do to unplug your idea
Every other theatre can do lights and sounds. What is unique to the Globe is that we dont.
She has read every Shakespeare play and loves all of them - a contrast to Rice who, in a quote that came back to haunt her, said she would rather listen to The Archers than plough through some of his texts.
An actress by trade, Terry has no directing experience. Luckily Im not going to direct, so nobody has to worry about that. I think its a skill that I dont have, and my passion is acting, she said, adding that she hoped to appear in one production per season.
I hope that by putting an actor in this position goes some way to dismantling those labels because actually were all multi-taskers, she said of the job.
Terry got the job after sending a letter to the Globes chief executive pledging allegiance and saying Id love to be part of the artistic conversation. He wrote back suggesting she make a formal application.
Joking that she hoped to survive in the job at least until Christmas, she added: I take great courage in the fact that they are taking an enormous risk by putting an actor in this position. I think that smacks of bravery. That gives me great hope.

Distribution of Sil Redi during  2015 Presidential election: GUILTY
THREE YEAR Rigorous Imprisonment
fined Rs.2 million each
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Pelpita were yesterday found guilty of misappropriating Rs.600 million of funds belonging to TRC in the controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe Sil) distribution case and were sentenced to three-years-Rigorous Imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
While handing out a lengthy judgment, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accuseds guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015 - Presidential Election.
While observing a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
Each of the accused were further ordered to pay a fine of two million rupees and in default of the payment of fine they will have to serve additional one year imprisonment.
This is the first time, a High Court delivered a judgment regarding an indictment filed by Attorney General pursuant to the investigation carried out by FCID.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita under three counts, in connection with a criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign.
They were found guilty of all charges.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the two accused on three counts of committing a criminal misappropriation funds amounting to Rs.600 million at TRC while spending for a Sil Redi distribution programme in contravention of the Telecommunication Act, No. 25 of 1991 Act during the period of October 30, 2014 to January 5, 2015.
The prosecutors alleged that the funds referred to had been remitted to a bank account maintained by Secretary to the President.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General decided to drop charges which had been filed under Public Property Act against the two accused.
In his judgment, the High Court Judge observed that on December 5, 2014 a sum of Rs.600 million had been remitted to a bank account maintained by former Secretary to the President through the intervention of Anusha Pelpita, without obtaining Board of Directors approval (TRC).
Evidence given by a secretary attached to the TRC had proved that the Board of Directors approval was not obtained regarding this transaction. It has been revealed that this transaction had been done through a method called circulation in which no written approval was given to remit concerned funds, the High Court judge added.
While observing that he cannot agree with the defence contention that the Sil Redi distribution programme was a long-time process, the High Court Judge maintained that this programme had been initiated with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate in an urgent manner.
According to the defence contention, distribution of Sil Redi comes under the expenditure of President. The defence was of the view that due to non-sufficient funds at the Presidents expenditure, they were tended to seek financial assistance from TRC. The court is of the view that they should have sought funds through a supplementary estimate to meet financial
requirements without following irregular and illegal process.
The accused were charged under Section 386 of the Penal Code for dishonestly misappropriating a sum of Rs. 600 million.
Former Election Commissioner Mahin da Deshapriya, former Presidents coordinating Secretary (Religious Affairs) Ven. Vatinapaha Somananda Thera are among the persons who had been named as the witnesses. Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the prosecution. Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with counsel Kanchana Rathwatte and Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.
Lalith WeeratungE to file appeal
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing on behalf of former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita who were convicted of misappropriating Rs. 600 million in funds belonging to the TRC over the Controversial Sil Redi distribution case yesterday informed that the defence is expecting to file an appeal in the Court of Appeal challenging the judgment of Colombo High Court to convict his clients.
The Defence Counsel yesterday sought a date to pay off the fine and pavement imposed against the accused. Accordingly, the High Court set September 20 to pay off the fine and compensation.

Electrified fences around elephant threatened villages: Special committees for maintenance
In an effort to protect people in rural areas from the wild elephant menace, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry will erect electrified fences around threatened villages and set up special committees for their maintenance by providing financial assistance, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G Jayasena said.
She disclosed this after activating the operation of an electrified fence for the protection of the Maradankadawala Ranaviru village recently.
Jayasena said the government while protecting countrys wildlife would do its utmost to protect people from the threat of wild animals. Steps have been taken to ensure a five-fold increase in the compensation offered to people falling victim to rampaging wild elephants.
Deputy Minister Jayasena said the Wildlife Department has meagre resources, including human capital. There is a dearth of wildlife officials. Although Cabinet approval had been granted for an intake of officers and minor staff, they had failed to fill the vacancies.
She said the Civil Security Service was entrusted with the task of maintaining electrified fences. It was ill-equipped to carry out the job.
The ministry had devised a novel plan for the maintenance of the fences by setting up welfare clubs at rural level and pay their members a daily allowance of Rs. 750 hitherto given to Civil Security personnel engaged in the job.

Estimated additional revenue from new  Inland Revenue Bill Rs.45 b: Mangala
The estimated additional revenue from the new Inland Revenue Bill is Rs.45 billion, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament yesterday.
The Minister moving the new Inland Revenue Bill, that introduces a new income tax structure with the aim of raising the state revenue by closing existing loopholes in revenue collection, stated the new provisions would come into effect in two phases.
The provisions related to income taxes will come into effect from October 30, and the legislation will be fully implemented from April 1, 2018.
The Minister said parallel to this move, the Inland Revenue Department, Customs Department and the Excise Department would undergo a series of important modifications next year.
He said the Government intends to introduce a universal tax file number for every citizen over 18 years. However, he clarified that it in no way means that every citizen over 18 years has to pay income taxes. If you have no income, you can mention that. They will be entitled to a number of other privileges too, he said.
The Minister said the new Inland Revenue Bill was based on four main concepts, burden proportionate to ability to pay, certainty, convenience and efficiency of collection, adding that the Government hopes to achieve its revenue targets without burdening the low and middle income earning people.
Minister Samaraweera said the new legislation has provided concessions and tax exemptions to Small and Medium Scale Entrepreneurs and many other needy sectors including the exports, agriculture, IT,education and tourism etc.
He said the employees who earn salaries less than Rs 100,000 per month have been exempted from the PAYE tax. He pointed out the senior citizens have been exempted from income tax for the interest they earn upto Rs.125,000, adding that a person should have at least Rs.15 million deposits to earn the above mentioned interest.
Minister Samaraweera, expressing confidence that the new legislation would create a level playing field for all, stated international best practices have been incorporated in its making.
According to the new Bill, high income earners are liable to pay the Capital Gains Tax, and higher rates of Corporate Tax apply for liquor, tobacco, and betting and gaming.
Samaraweera reiterated that the main aim of the new Act is to up the state revenue by focusing more on direct taxes while reducing the dependency on indirect taxes.
Currently our revenue from direct taxes stands at only 2 percent of the GDP. Ours is the lowest in the region. Sri Lanka is precariously positioned due to gradual drop in state revenue from 19 percent of the GDP in 1990 to 10 percent of the GDP in 2014. However, we could raise it to 15 percent of the GDP during the last two years, the Minister said.
Our aim is to increase it upto 20 percent in the next two years with the help of new Act. We aspire to change the indirect to direct tax ratio from the present level of 82:18 to 60:40 by 2020, the minister said.
The minister noted the penalty for tax evaders would be increased in the near future, adding that provisions would be introduced shortly to expedite taking legal action against them.
We have proposed a very transparent and efficient system of revenue collection incorporating modern taxation concepts, the Minister added.
The minister pointed out Sri Lanka is ranked number 158 out of 185 countries as per the Ease of Paying Tax International
Index, adding that the country must strive to improve this to enhance investor confidence. The minister bringing out statistics on poor commitment of the affluent to pay taxes, said only 43,900 companies and 119,300 individuals have registered in 2016 to pay taxes. Even among those registered only 30 percent of the companies and 48 percent of the individuals pay the relevant taxes on the due date, he remarked.
Referring to an Income and Expenditure Survey of 2012-2013, the minister pointed out the richest 20 percent of the country shared 52.9percent of total household income, where as the poorest 20 percent only shared 4.5 percent.
There are well-off tuition masters, lawyers, large scale businessmen and doctors who engage in channel service who do not pay income taxes properly. This has to change, he insisted.
The minister said the Government hopes to replace the existing Customs Ordinance that was introduced in 1860 with a new one to suit the modern time.

## Title: Export-driven economy strengthening value     of the rupee

Export-driven economy strengthening value     of the rupee
As transactions have to be made in USD in international trade, the value of the rupee is measured against USD.
Any country which are engaged in importing and exporting activities, have to buy USD for their transactions in foreign exchange market, the market where currencies are exchanged. If we put it simply, when we have to pay more for buying a dollar, it says that rupee has depreciated against a dollar.
On the other hand, when we have to pay less for buying a dollar, it can say that rupee has appreciated against a dollar.
Implications
For an example, recently, dollar reached up to Rs 155. However, it was about Rs 8 in 1977.
Accordingly, it is needless to state how the rupee has deprecated for past few decades.
Whenever we talk about exchange rate, attention has to be paid to export and import, as those are the key factors that decide the exchange rate, only if it is allowed to float as per the market forces; supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.
Seemingly, rupee depreciation is good for exports and bad for imports. In other words, when exporters can earn a higher number of rupees, due to depreciation, exporters are encouraged to export more and make profits. However, this should not be a long-term strategy for improving the export competitiveness in the world market.
Importers are discouraged to imports, since they become very expensive with rupee depreciation. Things go from bad to worse, when the economy is more import-oriented and can never cut imports like crude oil under any circumstances. Higher cost of imports can result in higher level of inflation especially in an economy where people consume more and more imported goods rather than locally produced goods and services. Furthermore, inflation goes up, purchasing power of the currency goes down, pressurizing people to cut their essential expenses which ultimately challenge the living standard in the country. Imports in June in 2017 have gone down by 8%.
It creates a favorable situation for foreigners to travel in the country. Tourists that got Rs 8 in 1977, can get nearly Rs 150 in 2017. This encourages tourists to come and spend here in Sri Lanka.
Government
However, no one can say that rupee depreciation itself can boost tourism, as there are many more factors that develop the tourism industry.
Even though market forces are allowed to behave freely and decide on price in the market, a debate has emerged whether the government should get involved in foreign exchange market or not by pumping dollars into the market and imposing laws so and so forth. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka, since 2001, has been following floating exchange rate system which allowed an independent adjustment of the exchange rate, according to the market forces of demand and supply. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, from time to time, intervenes in the foreign exchange market to control over-depreciation of the rupee by releasing dollar reserves. In my opinion, this should not be done, because it reduces reserves in the Central Bank, endangering the stability of the economy.
Alternatives
Every government is politically motivated by nature. If they want to be in power, they have to cushion the economic impact on the public.
Hence, governments are likely to interfere with exchange rate system, in order that import-driven inflation can be prevented. However, it may open a can of worms in the future. For developing economies like ours are badly affected by currency depreciation, sustainable solutions have to be found out for genuine development of the country. Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy, the governor of the Central Bank, recently stated that the rupee has to depreciate a little more. We would do it in a very orderly way. In fact, it has depreciated 2.5 % against the US dollar this year. Their target by allowing the rupee to further depreciate is to push exporters to be more competitive in the world market. However, this may in my opinion seem to be a solution in the short-term, only export-driven economy can deliver the expectations.
It is when cash inflow of dollars is coming into the country that rupee can be stable.
Thats why, the country needs more foreign direct investment (FDI), more tourist arrivals and any kind of dollar inflow like remittances, most importantly increased exports. Furthermore, re-gaining GSP plus is very helpful to increase exports. It is up to the government to sign more Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with strategically important countries in the region as well as beyond the region, so that exports can be boosted in our favor.
We can have positive expectations over the economy, as $1.12bn from Hambantota port deal and $ 205 million from Mattala airport deal will inflow to the country. Presumably, this will strengthen the dollar reserve and then economy.
In conclusion, steps should be taken to develop an export-driven economy, in order that the rupee will not further depreciate, preventing an inflationary situation.

First Indian Trans Beauty Queen
At 26, Nitasha Biswas has made history. In a one-of-a-kind beauty pageant, Nitasha went on to become Indias first Miss Trans Queen, and it has changed her life. After completing her management studies, Nitasha, a former student of St. Xaviers College, Kolkata, moved to Delhi to study fashion and modeling. She took part in the event after seeing a post on social media.
Elaborating on the pageant, she says, It was an experience of a lifetime. I got to meet a lot of people from different regions sharing the same passion. We worked hard for about seven months to perfect our ramp walk, posture, diet management, etc, and adds, I will never forget the crowning moment. I went blank for a few seconds with the heaviness of the crown on my head. All the struggle that I went through flashed in front of my eyes.
Nitashas journey has been a long one.
I knew about my sexuality from a young age. But, as I came from a strict family background I couldnt open up as early as I would have wanted to. Years later, I finally opened up to my brother. He thought it was just a phase. But soon, both my father and he realised that I was serious and my need for a transition was real. From then on, I had their support. They were always there in each of my phases of transition, she says.
For Nitasha, it took around six years to come to terms with her new body.
Even though the medical transition takes about three years, the entire journey, including counselling, takes about six years. But it was all worth it. I knew that the transition would take time, so I completed my studies before jumping into it, she says.
Nitashas next call of duty is Thailand where she will be representing India in the Miss Trans Queen International. Talking about her future plans, she elaborates, I had worked as a stylist for Bengali movies and was interested in modeling. Now that I have won the coveted crown, I will continue my work in the field of modeling and eventually venture into Bollywood as well. Winning the crown got me to realise that this is not just a beauty pageant; I have become the torchbearer of my community. Deccan Chronicle

Five Madel fishermen's families who will lose their occupation and livelihood owing to a new hotel complex coming up in the Ahungalla beach received Rs 1.5 million each as compensation from the hotel management.
This was following the intervention of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. The affected families received the relevant cheques from Minister Amaraweera at the Ministry auditorium on September 6. Secretary to the Ministry Mangalika Adhikari and the management of the hotel participated in the ceremony to provide compensation. Speaking on the occasion, Minister Amaraweera said the government would never allow ongoing development work to inconvenience the masses. If by chance anyone was affected by such work, the government would intervene to provide compensation for them, the minister said. Earlier, the five families affected by the ongoing hotel project complained to Minister Amaraweera saying that they would lose their main livelihood due to the project.
When the Minister discussed the matter with the hotel management, they agreed to make compensation payments to the affected families.
The minister said steps will be taken to provide compensation to fishermen who lose their livelihoods in bait fishing. Funds of Rs. 500,000 each will be provided to these fishermen.

Fun -filled drama!
It all began six years ago for Gateway during a three day long drama workshop. The student turnout was tremendous. It was a sign that a current had started up within the walls of Gateway. Dramatic Moves features the Gateway College Colombo Drama Club whose arrival signaled the emergence of a new force that would change the destinies of all other schools.
Drama is to come alive. It is life, in all lifes wondrous forms. It is the past re awakened on stage. It is the realization of the dreams and visions of the future. It is life itself. It offers one the wonderful opportunity of seeing through the eyes of another. Teacher in Charge, Vasanthi Jayawardana, pointed out that the students are not only confronted by the lines of a script, they live the script. It is the restoration of a tale told centuries ago.
Not only is drama a discovery of a new world, along the way it teaches you something. It is a huge experience in team work, individual responsibilities and the basics of discipline. It is more than possessing a degree or a diploma, it is the molding of a confident and well -rounded individual.
It takes a lot of passion, dedication and self -discipline. It is a commitment you make not only to yourself, it is also a commitment to others, said Jayawardana.
This is their fifth consecutive year in operation. Six years ago, chairman Dr. Harsha Alles made arrangements with our current consultant Jerome L. de Silva to conduct a 03-day long drama workshop for the students of all four of our branches. It was done in order to gauge their interest in drama so that the Drama Club could be established. All the teachers received an open invitation to attend this workshop as well.
I attended this workshop as a teacher of the Gateway School of Speech & Drama. I remember that the auditorium was packed with students from the four branches and there was a tremendous amount of interest and enthusiasm among the students who participated, said Jayawardana.
Of course this is not to say that Gateway College Colombo has not put up concerts and small scale productions before. They started doing large scale productions with the establishment of the Drama Club following the huge success of that initial workshop.
A year after the workshop that helped inaugurate our drama club, we staged our first major production called Midnight Saga (2012). It was a mix of Shakespeare and different, more modern styles. It was an exercise which the students who took part thoroughly enjoyed. That production proved to be a huge success. I would say that the Drama club has never looked back since that production because it went on to produce A Midsummer Nights Dream (2014), A Little Mermaid (2015) and Robin & The Sherwood Hoodies (2016). The fact that all of those projects culminated in success is partly thanks to all the previous drama teachers of the school. Right now, we are working on our next production Romeo & Winifred which will be staged at The Lionel Wendt on the 7th of February in 2018, explained Jayawardana.
Gateway is always delighted to provide the members of the Drama Club, the opportunity for exposure to some of the most prestigious events related to drama in the country such as the Annual Inter-School Shakespeare Drama Competition.
A huge improvement
Consultant/Director, Jerome L. de Silva role is pivotal and he is the pillar the drama club rests on. The drama club would not exist if it had not been for Jeromes dedication and the dedication of the children and even their parents and the other teachers. That has enabled us to keep the drama club going without it dying down.
It also has been in my experience that it is not only about confidence. In my years of teaching drama, I have encountered children who are labeled as dyslexic, autistic and having ADHD. There are many of these children in Drama Clubs and we dont even realize it. The parents have told us that the therapists of these children have found a huge improvement after joining drama. That is a major thing. In drama we dont have labels and as far as we are concerned everyone has talent. I work with Gateway achievers who are children with special needs. Drama is a therapy. These achievers are very talented, said De Silva
When Daily News visited Gateway the girls were practicing for their production Merchant of Venice for Shakespeare and the boys were practicing for their production of Othello for Shakespeare.
Many benefits
Secretary, Hasali Wirasinha was very upbeat speaking positively about practices saying that the cast have been practicing enthusiastically to put up a good show. They have been practicing morning, evenings and sometimes at night. Wirasinha pointed out that drama has had a very positive effect on her life and her other extra- curricular activities such as swimming, basketball and athletics. All in all with the passing of time, friendships have been formed and she has reaped many benefits such as improved audibility and a greater clarity of speech.
I am still shy, but now more than blend into the background my presence is more visible on stage. I now speak out and drama has helped me a lot in that way. It has also helped me in other sports and other activities such as swimming, basketball and athletics, said Wirasinha
Teacher in charge Vasanthi Jayawardana interjected that it is also a lesson in life. You dont panic when things go wrong. You improvise and fix things and change your plans as you go. Quick thinking is important because they are on their own on stage. They need to manage the situation. The students have all had a good taste of drama and they have proved relentless in reaching the highest that they can get. That is the sort of work ethic the drama club instills in the students.
Discovering a new side
President, JShara Ahamadeen, initially a shy girl has now cast her inhibitions aside and now embraces the field of drama. She correctly pointed out that drama has this remarkable way of opening your eyes to yourself. You get to know a part of your mind through drama. You get to know a different way of thinking. drama helps you address your fears. You think differently and it adds to your confidence. With that confidence you become more independent. By discovering a new side to yourself you think better when encountering obstacles.
For me practices have been very energetic and fun. There is absolutely no lethargy amongst the cast members. It is great getting to know everybody especially those I have only seen at school. It is nice to make new friends. At the start I was a very shy girl. I have really got better at my words, and overall my performance in speaking roles have really improved. If you enter something without passion or enter something without any future goal in mind, it kind of makes you lethargic while doing practice. And that can ruin things for the rest of the cast, said Ahamadeen.
Drama automatically makes you friendlier and Ahamadeen discovered this early on. She was new to school and everyone was so friendly. They accepted her and made her feel at home.
And when you start practices, from that moment you are the character. An actor/ actress cannot go into his/her mindset at all. This discipline is also a very good way of handling lifes obstacles. Because you have no choice but to get into the mindset of your character.
Background checks
Co-Treasurer, Ruwantha Supun Kumara, discovered he had stage fright only when he took up drama. This problem was immediately rectified with a period of practice with Jayawardana. Kumara is a diligent young man who researches intensively when playing a role.
I have a love for literature and that also helped me out when playing Hamlet. Medieval language does not come easily to people nowadays. So I did background checks on that. It is hard to get into a role but with the right amount of dedication and practice you can achieve it.
Acting styles
Co-Treasurer, Senika Wanigarathna owes his success to the endless hours of practice. Though shy at first, his friends have always been behind him and with the help of Jaywardane it was only a matter of time until he reached his goal.
I was really shy at first but my friends and Ms. Jayawardana were so supportive of me and really gave me the boost I needed. The endless hours of practice have helped us perfect the words and acting styles.
Senior Member, Anish Fonseka and Senior Member, Isira Methnuka Edussuriya stressed that discipline is important to succeed as a dramatist. Edussuriya speculated that it is indeed controlled fun. Both agreed that one has to apply themselves doing hard work.
If you ask me which Shakespearean character I like to play it would be Iago. He is very evil and evil is always fun! But if you ask me who I relate to in Shakespeare, it maybe Hamlet. What happens to him is out of his control but he is one of the nicest people in Shakespeare, said Fonseka.

A Green Sri Lanka: HNB calls for  industry-wide action on sustainability
The evolution of human civilization is rapidly approaching an extremely crucial juncture beyond which any further progress will only be achieved through drastic and sustained action in order to reorient our economies, marketplaces, cities and homes towards a more sustainable path.
While these challenges can appear multifarious and monolithic at first, breakthroughs in technology, and more crucially, in the implementation of major green initiatives across the globe are beginning to show real promise in their potential to create lasting solutions and open up a new trajectory for humankind.
At the root of many of our current difficulties are the interlinked problems of energy, and sustainability. How do we ensure that growth and development takes place in a manner that ensures that future generations will be able to enjoy a similar or better quality of life to what we ourselves have enjoyed
While debate does continue at the far fringes of the scientific community and - quite unfortunately - in the halls of power of certain nations, the truth of climate change is already upon us.
The challenges ahead
In 2016, global temperature records were set for the third consecutive year and we are already well past the halfway mark of carbon emissions necessary to trigger the 2-degree temperature limit established by the Paris Climate Agreement.
As a small island nation dotted with vibrant coastal cities, the long-term implications of climate change and rising sea levels are too serious to ignore while even today, we already feel the deadly impacts of global inaction on climate change.
We see it in the catastrophic floods and landslides just one month ago, that resulted in the deaths of 212 Sri Lankans and left over 700,000 displaced and in the aftermath of 2016 floods which resulted in 101 lives lost and 100 missing.
These terrible tragedies will only increase in frequency and intensity for as long as we continue to buttress our global civilization with fossil fuels. Particularly given the scale of our nation and our economy relative to some of the worlds largest carbon emitters, it is understandable that some would feel disheartened but this need only be true for as long as we lack a better, more progressive, and ultimately, more sustainable future.
Illustrative view of the plant
Avoiding drastic global warming would likely require a complete overhaul of our global energy system. Fossil fuels currently provide 87 percent of the world's energy. To zero out emissions this century, we would have to replace most of that with low-carbon sources like wind, solar, nuclear, geothermal, or carbon capture.
That is a staggering task and there are huge technological and political hurdles standing in the way. As such, the world's nations have been slow to act on global warming - it is a genuinely difficult issue to tackle and efforts to revamp the energy system often encounter heavy opposition.
In that context, I believe that the size of our country and the size of our population is actually one of our strongest advantages. Our nation holds the potential to serve as a global pioneer in renewable energy. Our geographic size and location means that we can become an ideal testing ground for innovative new technologies, business and financing models, all of which are based around the creation of a truly sustainable energy mix that makes optimum use of renewable energy.
As Sri Lankans, we have had the privilege of being heirs to a priceless cultural and environmental legacy and we are pleased to note that there have already been many positive initiatives implemented over the past decades and more in the pipeline, which could serve to preserve and enhance this legacy for future generations.
According to its most recently stated goals, Sri Lanka is, at a policy-level, targeting a complete switch to renewable energy capacity by 2030 where Sri Lankas Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan anticipates installed renewable energy capacity to reach 1,897 MW by 2034.
Wind energy is expected to overtake mini hydro in terms of installed capacity to reach 719 MW by 2023, where mini-hydro which is already nearing saturation point, will achieve 673 MW, followed by biomass-based power and solar power with 279MW and 226MW respectively.
In this manner, the Government aims to elevate Sri Lanka into the status of an energy empowered nation and we commend the Government for setting such a progressive sustainability energy agenda.
Nevertheless, with 35.7% of Sri Lankas energy being sourced from coal power and a further 31.5% from fuel oil during 2016, one fact becomes immediately clear, namely, we have a significant amount of work ahead of us if we are to achieve a truly Green Sri Lanka.
Examples to emulate
While the situation is dire, we should take great encouragement from the strong state-led initiatives taking place in countries like India, China and in nations across the European Union, with regard to the establishment of substantial new renewable energy capacity. It is particularly noteworthy that such substantial investments took place despite the historic lows in crude oil prices that took place over the past two years.
In Chinas 13th Five Year Plan on energy development, the country - which is one of the largest contributors to global emissions, but also the worlds largest investor in renewable energy - announced plans to lower coal energy consumption from 62% of its energy mix down to 58% while aiming for higher contributions of renewable energy with wind and solar energy set to reach over 210 GW and 110GW respectively. In total, China will invest US$ 493 billion on green energy by 2020.
Similarly, India is driving a remarkable transition away from fossil-fuel based energy and plans to reach 60% renewable energy by 2027, well in excess of targets established by the Paris Climate Agreement.
Crucially, this forecast reflects not just the bold and highly commendable stance of the Indian Government with regard to renewable energy, but also the substantial private sector efforts that are driving vital progress in this sector.
Meanwhile in the European Union, despite notable sociopolitical volatility across the region, the high priority that governments in the region have allocated towards renewable energy is impressive with most nations being on track to meet 2020 targets.
Under the Paris climate deal, the bloc plans to make renewable energy account for 27% of energy use by 2030 and to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 and down a further 80% by 2050.
As a final example of the potentials that renewable energy can unlock, we must also look to Africa, a continent that has an abundance of solar, wind and hydro energy capacity waiting to be tapped.
With the right strategy for placing solar and wind farms and with international sharing of power, most African nations could lower the number of conventional power plants - fossil fuel and hydroelectric - they need to build, thereby reducing their infrastructure costs by perhaps billions of dollars.
There are extremely valuable lessons that we can learn from each of these examples, and if we as a nation resolve ourselves to seriously drive our own clean energy revolution. The strong, clear and systematic direction taken by the Governments that are leading the charge in renewable energy must be emulated in order to establish a feasible path towards a national grid that is fully independent of fossil fuels.
The innovative approaches to securing funding for such projects, as seen across Africa through international investments and through intensive private sector engagement in India, must be analyzed, adapted to meet the needs of the Sri Lankan economy and then implemented on an urgent basis.
This will require the mobilization of significant efforts, resources, and investment but we must all keep in mind that the cost of inaction will always be much greater. We must take note of the EU approach that requires regular reporting on sustainability initiatives which in turn results in greater accountability.
A common standard for the banking industry
In 2015, HNB together with our respected colleagues in the Sri Lankan banking industry joined together with the Sri Lanka Banks Association (SLBA) and set about the historic goal of establishing the Sri Lanka Sustainable Finance Initiative (SFI).
This forum created one of Sri Lankas first platforms for industry alignment while building industry-wide capacity in the area of environmental and social risk management.
Bringing together 18 banks to secure a sincere commitment from each of them towards sustainable financing, the SLFI achieved tremendous progress and is now ready to move on to Phase II to expand upon these initial commitments and in so doing, chart out a new vision for the Sri Lankan economy that is focused, primarily on environmental and social sustainability.
When establishing the SLBFI, HNB, together with our colleagues across the banking industry were cognizant of the fact that long periods of inactivity or mere reactivity to the realities of climate change would result in our nation, our fellow citizens and future generations of Sri Lankans having to pay a heavy cost.
While the discussion around what can be done about climate has become more intensive, it will ultimately be the actions we take which determine our fate. In that regard, we believe that the time is now right for Sri Lankas private sector to put its best foot forward and commence making concerted efforts towards enabling a more sustainable, secure energy future for our country.
In the 129 years that HNB has been active, our bank has witnessed several remarkable transitions in the Sri Lankan economy and we note that in many cases, it has been the banking industry itself which has paved the way for new technological innovations. This role as a first adopter of best systems and best practices - from the adoption of computerized systems to the first implementation of online and mobile technology, it is often a nations banking industry that leads the way into new and unexplored paradigms.
Particularly over the recent past, HNB has been significantly expanding its investments into renewable energy. We are pleased to report landmark progress on this front, with HNB over the recent past having implemented Sri Lankas largest rooftop solar project, covering 69 locations with approximately 2 MWp of clean, renewable energy.
These initiatives were made through a substantial investment of Rs. 350 million to date and has resulted in a drastic reduction of our carbon footprint by approximately 1,215 tonnes per annum.
Moving forward we aim to expand this important initiative to 100 locations by the end of 2017 and we are fully committed to continue this process until we have achieved full coverage of our entire network of 252 customer service centres.
From our rapidly deepening expertise in the establishment of solar energy capacity, we have seen that the key to shortening the period for Return on Investment (ROI) is scale.
Together with our industry colleagues we have a vital role to play as custodians of the Sri Lankan banking industry, and in this regard, I believe we have an unprecedented opportunity before us to reorient our people and our organizations in order to expedite this transition as much as possible.
As at December 31, 2016, HNB has allocated over Rs. 2.85 billion towards the funding of sustainable energy initiatives.
In the first half of 2017, three new green energy projects of solar and hydro were financed with an exposure totalling Rs. 1.8 billion. HNBs most recent involvement has been as lead arranger to a syndicated loan of Rs. 9 billion towards the construction of a 10 MW garbage-to-energy power plant that will contribute to the national grid through the conversion of between 500-700 metric tonnes of garbage into energy.
Promoted by the Aitken Spence Group of companies, the project represents a vital and much needed solution to the growing problem of Colombos municipal solid waste. Moving forward we must seek out similarly innovative methods to achieve sustainable solutions to the challenges facing our nation.
What we are therefore proposing, is that our industry now take its role as a steward of technological progress to the next level by facilitating Sri Lankas Green Revolution.
We have already seen several Sri Lankan corporates take bold individual steps and we count HNBs rooftop solar project among these initiatives. However, it is imperative that we take these sustainable initiatives forward in a concerted and systematic manner. Hence, while we were the first to achieve renewable energy capacity on this scale, we cannot be the last to do so.
In that regard, HNB looks forward to working together with our colleagues in the Sri Lankan banking sector to support a new wave of growth in renewable energy and sustainable initiatives, in a two-pronged strategy encompassing internal and external stakeholders.
Such initiatives must be emulated and expanded with a view towards facilitating direct and indirect investment into sustainable energy and energy efficient technologies that in turn will translate into a meaningful reduction in carbon footprints.
At the same time, we must look internally in order to root out inefficiencies and take forward initiatives that improve the sustainability of our own organizations, particularly in relation to resource consumption and carbon emissions. Such efforts must also be supplemented by further initiatives aimed at spreading awareness of expertise in sustainable initiatives like rainwater harvesting, and reforestation programmes.
We reiterate however that while these investments are good for the environment and for future generations, they also make good sense for the bottom-line. Hence we are not only calling for enterprises to do what is morally right, we are also asking them to do what is right for their businesses, particularly over the medium-long term. A new age is dawning for humanity and we must not be left unprepared. It is only through partnership that we will achieve the progress we seek.

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said he was happy to have changed the corrupt electoral process.
Speaking to the media yesterday he said he received the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
I was able to change this corrupt electoral process with great difficulty.I am thankful to the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary, cabinet ministers, Chairman of the Election Commission and the delimitation committee who helped me to succeed in this endeavour and those who encouraged me by their criticisms. I respectfully thank everyone who gave me the strength in this process. Everyone was a source of strength to me. I did all of these for the people of country. Because of my actions today, I believe that in the future we will have an intelligent political generation. Especially, we have achieved a big victory in introducing 25% womens representation. I believe that where there are women present, the opportunities for corruption will be reduced.
With the introduction of 25% womens representation, the voice of women in parliament will increase and we can expect a new political culture where morality and justice will prevail,he said.
