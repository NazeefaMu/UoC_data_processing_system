India stands with SL in her hour of need
Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi expressed condolences at the loss of lives and property and said that India stands with her Sri Lankan brothers and sisters in their hour of need.
The Government of India received a request from the Government of Sri Lanka in the afternoon of May 26 to provide assistance following major flooding and landslides in various parts of the country. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi immediately directed provision of all necessary assistance.
Pursuant to Prime Ministers directions, INS Kirch was diverted from her deployment and tasked to reach Colombo to provide immediate assistance. The ship, with around 125 personnel on board, arrived at Colombo Port in the morning of May 27 and offloaded relief supplies, inflatable Gemini boats with diving teams, and a mobile medical team with supplies.
High Commissioner of India Taranjit Sandhu handed over the supplies to Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Colombo Port. The Indian rescue personnel are now being deployed to the disaster affected zone in coordination with the Sri Lanka Navy and other Sri Lankan authorities.
A second ship, INS Shardul, has left Kochi and is scheduled to arrive at the Colombo Port by mid-day on May 28. The ship is carrying additional relief material requested by Sri Lankan authorities, apart from more inflatable boats. A third ship, INS Jalashwa, has also set sail from Visakhapatnam to join the relief efforts, and is expected to reach Colombo within two days. INS Jalsahwa is an even larger LPD (landing platform/dock) class of ship, which can carry large amounts of relief material and is ideally suited for conduct of humanitarian assistance/disaster relief missions.
The High Commission of India in Colombo is in close touch with Sri Lankan authorities to coordinate any additional assistance that may be required.

All measures to mitigate flood disaster: Rajitha
Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratna yesterday said the government will impart all information on the countrys national-level flood disaster and the efforts under way by the government to mitigate it without holding back any information from the public or the media,
He said they will inform the public of their failures and weaknesses that may be identified or found in the the process of mitigation .
It is in keeping with a culture of openness that we share the full details of the disaster with the public and media, he said.
Minister Senaratna was speaking at a press conference at the Disaster Management Ministry.
Expressing his gratitude to all media establishments for their efforts in actually helping the flood victims, Minister Senaratna said, the media has been doing a worthy service in that they themselves implemented relief progammes for flood victims.
They also helped the government locate flood victims showing those areas where provisions of relief have not reached, rather than criticising it for being unable to bring its relief to these locations, he pointed out.
However, he said it came to his notice that a certain print medium had reported that the Disaster Management Ministry had exposed its unpreparedness to deal with a disaster situation.
They have spotlighted that the ministry lacked stocks of basic items such as blankets, life jackets, umbrellas, torches and boxes of matches, the minister said and asked,if they thought that keeping life jackets and blankets as disaster preparedness.
He said stocks of these items cannot however be kept for too long as they face the fate of being old and unusable or expired.
What actually took place was just as we learned that some of these items were scarce,we supplied them to areas where they were needed.
We sent life jackets, and there are more life jackets coming from India to mitigate the situation. They too will be sent to these areas, he said.
You may have seen how America faced the recent disasters. What did the government give he asked,
Is it blankets and lifejackets
If you face a disaster with blankets, jackets, boxes of matches and torches, this Ministry of Disaster Management would be confined to a store room, he said.
If it was not having blankets and jackets their being not sent to flood victims that caused the alarm, I can give out a larger list of items, which we have been unable to send to the flood-hit people so far, should it please anyone, the minister said.
Minister Senaratna said on the disaster that up to now around 114,124 families encompassing a total of 442,300 persons have been displaced by it.
The number deaths reported so far is 151. The number of missing persons is at 112, the number of persons suffered injuries is 95, he said.
A total of 250 houses have been fully damaged and 1,095 houses partially damaged by the flood. Out of 114,124 flood-hit families 24,735 families, a total of 102,218 persons, are currently located at Disaster Relief Centers set up by the government, he said.
The supply of water to the Matara district has been affected with 60,000 water consumers who were registered with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board not getting the boards water supplies.
The supplies are being restored, with contingency measures where necessary.
Meanwhile, we have arranged to provide emergency water supplies to the affected people by air and with the use of water tankers.
He said the people in need water of can call 0777724360, 0777891332, and 0714532222, and get supplies of safe drinking water.
Electricity has been down in the districts, Matara Galle, Ratnapura, Kegalla.About 300, 000 people have lost electricity.
The supply of electricity has been suspended in the Matara district due to damage caused on electricity infrastructure.
The Ceylon Electricity Board(CEB) is currently taking steps to restore the situation with 8 Megawatt power generators. The board is also going to replace damaged water meters free of charge.
The CEB has warned against riding boats near the damaged electricity sub stations in the affected districts.

Anelise Chens Meditations on the Snail
The mollusk writes this from a state of longing, far from the highland plateau where she had been only two weeks earlier. This sea-level suburb where shes staying should be a more natural place for a mollusk to be, but now its two A.M. and she finds shes out walking. The terrain unfolds in grids: straight boulevards bordered with tidy squares of lawn. The symmetry oppresses her. She catches herself staring with heightened intensity at garden flagstones and piles of pebbles, at gnarly shrubs vaguely reminiscent of juniper. What shes looking for is so far away. There are no sandstone outcrops here, no stands of cottonwoods lining a wash, no dots of evergreen on the hills or snow on distant peaks.
Two weeks earlier: the mollusks brief stint in New Mexico had come to a compulsory end, so she loaded up the Camry and drove off in a daze, enclosed momentarily with all of her belongings, like a snail. Why did she have to go Snails hated to go; slow, trepidatious mollusks, once a snail gets settled, she generally prefers to stick around. Its a desperate snail who crosses the road, and if she does, she is wise to get across as quickly as possible.
The improvised plan, now that she had to leave, was to detour (briefly) to Utah to see A. It would only add a few extra days to the itinerary, but even so, she felt guilty about it. Having been on vacation from her real life for the past several months, here she was, siphoning off even more time. It felt greedy and undeserved; like everyone else, she had deadlines to meet and jobs to resume, money to make.
Ill only stay two days, she told A., more to reassure herself. A. didnt seem to care either way how long she was staying.
Back on the road, a heady feeling pervaded. She drove the scenic route, northwest along 550, past Jemez, Counselor, and Nageezi. She was entering the Colorado Plateau. In the rain, the slick, iron-rich hillsides looked bloody and alive. Even at eighty miles per hour, the landscape spooled out before her in one tremendous vista after another. It was relentless. She tried to take photos through the windshieldall worthlessbut she wanted to remember.
The stated purpose of the detour, she told M. before she left Taos, was to get brainwashed. She wanted to justify her trip somehow with an agenda, because she was, above all, a list-oriented fiend of productivity. M. seemed either amused or alarmed that the mollusk was taking this spontaneous detour to visit a man she had only spent forty-eight hours with prior. But, she told M., with A., time passed differently. It was almost spatial: the moments cohered, gained mass, glommed together. Day and night were undifferentiated; the sun set and rose like a smudgy swipe across the sky. One of A.s favorite things to say was that time was an illusion. He said this when she complained that she hadnt done anything all day. As a timeless person, everything he uttered seemed to have universal import. She was a receptive student.
COLORADO PLATEAU
Only someone who had grown up in the Colorado Plateau would be capable of saying things like time is an illusion in semi-half-joking tones, she thought now, driving through his terrain. Outsiders, like the early nineteenth-century Euro-American explorers, described the Colorado Plateau in a curiously nebbish manner, characterized mainly by apprehension and horror. The rocky formations were a confrontation with time. Staring down into the Grand Canyon was like staring down two billion years of historythe geology laid bare, with no foliage to hide behind, Earth made its age known. One was forced to acknowledge the sheer amount of time that had transpired to uplift the plateau, while slow erosional forces cut that rock into chasms, mesas, laccoliths, and hoodoos. The expanse of time and space was apparently so immense that it shorted their Euro-American aesthetic synapses.
Around Farmington, the mollusk turns on the radio to scan for music stations and stumbles upon a Christian station advertising audiotapes that promise to prove the historicity of Noahs Flood. Of course, of course! In this seemingly indifferent landscape, man would need extra assurances that theres some bigger picture that involves him. She is quite familiar with these Flood argumentsshes come across many such blogs doing her mollusk research. The posts often have suggestive, rhetorical titles like Seashells in the Desert or Marine Fossils Found in Limestone of Egyptian Pyramids that attempt to account for whale skeletons in the Atacama Desert or clam fossils high in the Andes. Most cultures have some sort of flood myth. According to Hindu legend, Vishnu incarnates into a fish to warn Manu of a coming flood, advising him to collect all the grains of the earth and board an ark.
The Epic of Gilgamesh tells a similar story: the gods conspire to flood the world, but one god, Ea, reveals the secret to Utnapishtim, also resulting in a lifesaving boat. Cultures in Siberia and the Caucasus have their own versions.
In China, the goddess Nu Wa saves the world from water after one of the pillars of heaven comes crashing down; in Yoruban myth the goddess Olukun floods nearly everyone in a fit of rage; the Inuit, too, believe the presence of shells high in the mountains is evidence of an ancient flood. Later, A. will tell her that the Navajo emergence myth also involves a flood: after Coyote steals Water Monsters baby, she floods the third world in her grief. - Paris Review

[APPRECIATIONS - (29-05-2017)]
M.G.S. Perera
Founding father of Naval and Maritime Academy
This appreciation on the birth centenary of Maharage George Stephen PereraStephen Aiyahto meis from his first cousin.
He obtained The Ceylon Teachers Certificate in English and Sinhala and came to Galle to teach at Mount Calvary School, where my father was the Head Master. It is here that I came to know him personally when I was about ten years old. When he got married in 1951, at his request, I was his best man, and my late wife Rita, a bridesmaid.Perhaps, he is still one of the unsung heroes of the Sri Lanka Navy.
In 1962, disaster struck the NavyThe training establishment at Diyatalawa was closed down, permitting no training of any kind; no recruitments; the Navy was left to rot resembling a battered hulk. What pulled, turned round and literally resurrected the derided Navy was the NMA; and that NMA was Instructor Commander M.G.S. Perera.
Yes, he did it in 1967 and that was a giant leap for the Navy.
He was the designer, planner, creator and visionary who was made totally responsible by the Navy in 1965 for transforming within 20 months, an old and discarded set of buildings at Dockyard Trincomalee, setting-up, giving birth, thereafter giving life and establishing the renowned Naval and Maritime Academy (NMA) in Trincomalee (in 1967) and that too, with the restriction of having no approvals for extra-expenditure for any building work.
The firm foundation he laid has enabled NMA to reach far greater heights with tremendous change, sailing through prosperity and adversity to become what it is today, a degree-awarding naval academy awarded with the Presidents Colours.
He trained, taught, moulded and inspired generations of officers and sailors of the Sri Lanka Navysome of whom even went on to hold the rank of Commander of the Navy and personnel from Fisheries Corporation and Sri Lanka Police and thereafter Merchant Navy Cadets on board for the Ceylon Shipping Corporation, over a total period extending beyond 30 years.
Even 45 years after his retirement from the Navy and 18 years after his death, this officer and gentleman is still fondly remembered, deeply appreciated and held in high esteem for his outstanding contributions and extra-ordinary achievements in establishing disciplined naval training in this country.
The very fact that, at his funeral, every retired Navy Commander alive was present is adequate testimony of how much these inputs have been appreciated.
Stephen Aiyah was a qualified Chartered Engineer and a Fellow of the prestigious academic body Institute of Marine Engineers London (FIMar.E).
Soon after the singing maestro Sunil Santha (Joseph Aiyah to me)another first cousin on my fathers sideleft to join the Shanthi Nikethan, India, in 1941, Stephen Aiyah followed him there to join the then renowned Victoria Jubilee Technical College in Bombay and obtained his Licentiate in Mechanical Engineering in 1947.
For nearly two years in 1960-61, he received comprehensive training on vast areas of specialised naval subjects that covered navigation, meteorology, engineering, electronics, physics, naval training and discipline, naval training methodology and evaluation, etc. with a series of worthwhile achievements at many Naval training establishments in the UK and then in 1970, at San Diego, California and Annapolis, Maryland Academy in the USA.
In 1962, he became the first and perhaps the only Sri Lankan Naval Officer to date to undergo a full time course to specialise in meteorology at the Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose in Cornwall to qualify as a Fellow/full member of The Royal Meteorological Society in England (FRMet.S).
He first served The Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (1949-51) as a Petty Officer Stoker Mechanic. When the Navy acquired its first ship, H.M. Cy. S. Vijaya, he joined her as part of the First all-Ceylon Crew to sail her from Trincomalee to Colombo for commission.
He then joined The Royal Ceylon Navy as a direct entry Instructor Lieutenant as the Navys First Instructor (Training) Officer.
The late Instructor Commander counted 23 years of distinguished unblemished Naval Service and retired from the Sri Lanka Navy in June, 1972, as the countrys First Director of Naval Training.
For 3 years, he then served Walker Sons and Company Limited in Mutwal as Director/Senior Manager of the Fibre Glass Division.
In 1975, on being invited by the then Chairman of the Ceylon Shipping Corporation P. Karandawela, the late Commander joined M.V. Lanka Kalyani as Senior Staff Captain and sole sailing Nautical Instructor.
He was responsible, single-handedly, for training Deck Officer Cadets for a career in the Merchant Navy. He held this senior position for eight long years, sailing with many a Master Mariner of today; perhaps well over a hundred of them learnt the rudiments of navigation from him.
After retirement, for a further period of 15 years until 82 years, often going against medical advice and in spite of poor vision in the left eye, he unhesitatingly offered his expertise from his residence, free, for many who sought his assistance.
It was during this period that he wrote and published the then popular self-training manual: Trainees Guide in Celestial Navigation; ISBN: 955-95805-0-7a big achievement and long-standing dream for him, at the age of 78.
By 1960, he was responsible, single-handedly, for the establishment of a competent Instructor Staff in the Ceylon Navy, to meet its demands for two decades ahead in disciplined naval training.
In the beginning, as the one and only instructor (training) officer of The Royal Ceylon Navy, he established the first Naval Technical Training Centre to train Artificer Apprentices before they were sent to training establishments in India.
With a fertile mind, he was eminently qualified, widely experienced and truly competent to perform all tasks of training of all types of officers and thereby, we hardly had to ask England or India to train them for us.
It resulted in saving appreciable amounts of foreign exchange for the Sri Lanka Government, hitherto expended on obtaining initial naval training abroad.
Perhaps Stephen Aiyahs greatest achievement, as I realised, was that he showed the world that our own Sri Lanka Navy could fully train Officers from cadets upwards, who could hold their own with Officers in any Navy, anywhere.
Fifty years ago, he had foresight to see that the NMA was a National Institute and that the Navy alone, could train all sea-going personnel and award the successful and internationally accepted Academy Certificate.
In 1961, H.M. Cy. S. Rangalla at Diyatalawa became the first ship to be manned entirely by Instructor Officers with Instructor Lieutenant Commander M.G.S. Perera as its first Commandantthe first non-executive branch officer to be appointed to command a ship.
Since that he had held, simultaneously, four Military Command appointments over a period of 10 consecutive years.
He never offended anyone by word or deed and his company was always delightful. He was essentially a simple person who lived in rented houses and used public transport. Although he could easily have amassed a fortune, he never sought to enrich himself.
He married a pretty maiden Maureen Johanna Samarakoon from Galle. She gave him her unstinting loyal support in every sphere of life, throughout the 48 happy years they spent together.
His son Dr. Ajith C.S. Perera, and daughter Deepthi C.J. Guneratne, have brought deserving honour and great fame in their own professional fields to their illustrious father. With his death in August, 1999, a life of gentleness and modesty came to an end.

Dr. T. Jayasinghe
Man dedicated to the Palestinian cause
We deeply mourn the passing away of the first Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine Dr. T. Jayasinghe. He was the first to garner support for the Palestinian cause in our country and got the support of senior media personnels such as Sunimal Fernando and Latheef Farook in the formation of the Solidarity Association.
When others in the front benches in Parliament flinched, these coterie of men were able to convince Mahinda Rajapaksa, a first timer in the Back Bench to accept the chairmanship of the Sri Lanka-Palestine Solidarity Association.
Until he became the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa headed this solidarity movement and earned the goodwill and close friendship of Yasser Afarat and the incumbent President Mahmud Abbas.
There can be no other person from the majority community who showed so much concern for the suffering Palestinians.
He was truly sincere and dedicated to espouse the cause of Palestinians for the last 40 years.
When he was serving as Ambassador in this war-torn desert country, he was in close touch with us and regularly e-mailed to us all writings and documents he emotionally wrote on the subject. For all his dedication and commitment, he was decorated with Medal of 'Star of Jerulsalem' by the Head of the Palestinian State, a rare honour received by a Sri Lankan. May he attain the best he craved for herafter!

Chrissy Aloysius
Warmhearted friend
I have known Dr. Dennis Aloysius and his beloved wife for over 30 years and I was grief-stricken to learn about the demise of Chrissy Aloysius. She lived a humble and generous life and always invited me for a meal whenever I visited them. My wife and I were always treated like their own family members.
Acts of kindness did not always mean a sacrifice to Aloysius; ever helpful, a cheery smile, a word of good advicemade no great demands on herpart of which also contributed to my own success in life. Her motto was 'whatever you do, do it well, or dont do it at all.'Many memories survive, untouched by change of life or death.
We share with Dr. Dennis Aloysius and his children, this moment of sadness.
May the soul of dear Chrissy Aloysius be in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ in heaven.

Arsenal deny Chelsea double as Ramsey seals FA Cup
LONDON, Saturday - Arsenal salvaged some silverware from a traumatic season as they beat Premier League champion Chelsea 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday thanks to Aaron Ramsey's late winner.
Chelsea had been hot favourites to complete a remarkable debut season for manager Antonio Conte but were not at their clinical best as Arsenal, who finished fifth in the league, lifted the Cup for the third time in four seasons.
They have now won it a record 13 times while manager Arsene Wenger, who is yet to say whether he will be extending his 21-year reign, is now the most successful manager in the history of the competition with seven wins. Chelsea made a woeful start and were behind after four minutes thanks to Alexis Sanchez's controversial opener but when Diego Costa levelled in the 76th minute it seemed they would complete a memorable season.
Conte's side had to play the last 20 minutes with 10 men after Victor Moses was dismissed following a second yellow card for diving.
Ramsey's header in the 79th minute knocked the stuffing out of Conte's side and Arsenal could even have extended their lead in the closing stages as Chelsea finally buckled.
Wenger, who failed to finish in the top four for the first time since taking charge in 1996, celebrated with his players in front of the massed red ranks of Arsenal fans at the end.
We had an outstanding performance from the first minute onwards, the 67-year-old Wenger said.
This team has suffered. They've united and responded. I said last week this team will be in the championship with one or two good buys. They showed strength and unity and played spectacular football today.
Underdogs Arsenal enjoyed a dream start although there was huge debate about whether Sanchez's effort should have stood. When his initial attempt to chip the ball into Chelsea's area was blocked, he appeared to knock the rebound forward with his arms before running through and shooting past Thibaut Courtois despite Ramsey standing in an offside position.
Confusion reigned as the goal was initially disallowed but after consulting with his assistant Gary Bewsick who had raised his flag, referee Anthony Taylor awarded the goal.
Chelsea never properly recovered from that body blow and Arsenal could have been out of sight before halftime.
Mesut Ozil had a shot back-heeled off the line by Gary Cahill while Chelsea had an amazing escape when Danny Welbeck's header thumped against the post and Ramsey bundled the ball back against the same upright. Despite being all at sea Chelsea did threaten with Costa denied by a perfectly-timed tackle by Per Mertesacker who was making his first start for Arsenal for 13 months. Arsenal keeper David Ospina also bravely denied Costa, receiving a blow to the head for his troubles.
Chelsea started the second half with more tempo and Footballer of the Year N'Golo Kante warmed Ospina's fingers with a deflected drive from distance before Moses brought a fine save from Ospina after Costa played him in. Chelsea were required to play the last 20 minutes a man down after referee Taylor's second big call of the day, deciding that Moses had thrown himself to the floor under no obvious contact from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Just when it seemed their double hopes were slipping away, Costa equalised when his weakly-hit shot brushed off the excellent Mertesacker and past the diving Ospina.
But Arsenal had the last laugh when Chelsea's defence went AWOL again, allowing Ramsey the freedom of the box to head substitute Olivier Giroud's astute cut-back past Courtois.

Australia tested their bench strength in Sri Lanka warm-up  Travis Head
Australia was without Steve Smith, the captain, Mitchell Starc and John Hastings in the warm-up game against Sri Lanka on Friday, which Travis Head chalked up to the side testing their bench strength.
Smithy had the day off, Starcy and Hasto also, so weve got strength in our bench which is always what you want with good teams, he explained. Its competition for spots and weve definitely got that at the moment, but come game day everyone will be there. Weve got one more [warm-up] so as we get closer to that first game, the structure will start to come out. Head made a strong case for selection for Australias opening ICC Champions Trophy 2017 game with an unbeaten 85 in their win over Sri Lanka in a warm-up match at the Oval on Friday (May 26). Head put on a 75-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Aaron Finch, who made a brilliant 137 as Australia chased down Sri Lanka's 318 with two balls to spare.
It was a good hit out, probably a tighter game than we wanted it to be, said Head after the game.
They dug in pretty well in the end and posted 300, and chasing down, I thought we did beautifully. Finchy at the top of the order was fantastic. To bring it home it was a nice team performance. We just had a really nice game plan, we try to spot every ball and try not to leave it right to the end -- ended up working out that time -- but I feel it was pretty controlled.
In parts, it probably wasnt as controlled as others, but its not going to be clean sailing in run chases.
Being the current ICC Cricket World Cup champion has made Australia one of the favourites to win the title in England and Wales, and Head believes the side's experience at the ICC Cricket World Cup will benefit it in the coming few weeks.
There are some strong teams, he reflected. We played good tournament cricket back in the World Cup -- the experience weve got from that and the players that weve still got -- were confident going into the first game. Weve got to hit the ground running and play really well because weve been a little bit inconsistent in some of the last 12 months.

BPPL Holdings net profit up 42% to Rs 436 mn
BPPL Holdings net profit has increased by 42% to Rs 436 mn in the financial year April 2016 to March 2017.
Consolidated revenue for the period was Rs2.4 billion, up 16% over the corresponding period in the previous year. The North American region accounted for 77% of the reported revenue. The region saw a 21% increase in revenue over the previous financial year. High growth was also seen in New Zealand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka although from smaller bases.
In the United States, robust revenue growth was seen in the food services, janitorial and oil and gas sectors. Revenue slowed in Australia and Britain due to client inventory adjustments and new product launches in the previous financial year causing increased orders in that year. Sales to Britain were also affected by Sterling depreciation vs the Sri Lankan Rupee during the period.
Overall revenues were also strong as the company pursued its dual objectives of penetrating the household market segment both through direct sales to retailers and own branded goods sales in Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
Direct sales accounted for 10% of total sales for the period, up 20% year-on-year. Own branded goods also grew by 59%, again over the corresponding period in the previous year. Gross profit was up by a faster 26% year-on-year to Rs 963 million due to margin expansion amid revenue growth. Gross profit margins, which improved from 37% to 40% during the twelve month period ended March 2017, continued to benefit from higher productivity, lower freight rates, lower costs as a result of improved raw material sourcing and Sri Lankan Rupee depreciation against the US Dollar. Improved productivity and stringent cost controls also led to a 41% increase in operating profit (EBIT) to Rs 512 million compared to the same period in the previous year.

Brotherly love
Will you even believe that women find romance in partners who look like their brothers Yes, researchers have suggested it!
In a new study, published in the Evolution and Human Behaviour Journal, participants were asked the rank the facial similarity of photos of men, who they did not know where the male partners and brothers of the women.
The photos were sent in by volunteers, other photos were of the brothers and partners of public figures and celebrities. Participants were given a sheet of paper which on one column had the brother of a woman and on the other column had four men: Three of which were random and one of which was the woman's partner. The participants were then asked who the man on the first column most resembled on the second.
Researchers found "clear evidence for perceptual similarity in facial photographs of a woman's partner and her brother".
If the chance that a participant would pick the woman's partner was one in four, the raw data showed people were picking the partner more than that. Once the researchers had taken all the variables into account, the rate was around 27 percent.
"Our findings were not a rule or true of every woman but we do find that, at levels greater than chance, partners did show some subtle resemblance to the women's brothers," lead researcher Tamsin Saxton told, as quoted by the Independent.

Cat cuddler wanted!
A job opening at a Dublin veterinary clinic is getting a ton of attention because, well, it basically sounds like a dream job for cat enthusiasts.
Cat Cuddles Needed! reads the job posting at Just Cats Veterinary Clinic & Cattery, a veterinary clinic devoted to - you guessed it - cats.
The post asks potential applicants some crucial questions to see if theyre the right fit:
- Are you a crazy cat person and loves cats
- Does cattitude come naturally to you
- Have you counted kittens before you go asleep
- Do you feed the stray cats in your locality
- Does petting cats make you feel warm and fuzzy
The site explains that a cat cuddlers responsibility is to help calm felines that may be anxious about their time at the vet. Thats why qualifications include gentle hands capable of petting and stroking cats for long periods of time, a soft-spoken demeanor and an ability to understand different types of purring. (For those confused about what this last one means - purring is typically associated with being content, but cats also sometimes purr when they are stressed or afraid.)
With all the attention the job is getting (not to mention how amazing it sounds), its sure to be ultra-competitive. Its also not clear from the post whether the clinic is accepting international applicants.
But if youre still dying to cuddle cats and kittens, youre in luck.
Animal shelters are often in need of volunteers to socialize and play with the animals in their care. The need is especially strong during kitten season - the warmer months of the year when lots of kittens are born and many animal shelters become overwhelmed with homeless young felines. Rescue groups also often need people to foster kittens that were separated from their mothers too early, meaning you can even cuddle kittens in the comfort of your own home.
Sure, you might not be getting paid, but professional cat cuddlers have to start somewhere.

Champions Trophy 2017 : Mathews, Malinga return could spur Sri Lanka on
Sri Lanka will enter the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 hoping for its second title success after having shared the trophy with India in 2002, but its run up to the big event hasnt been the best, with Angelo Mathews side losing one of its two games against Scotland.
Pooled with India, South Africa and Pakistan, Sri Lanka will certainly have a tough task getting into the knockouts, but it will fancy its chances with a strong all-round team that has been bolstered by Lasith Malingas inclusion. Malinga, who last played a One-Day International in November 2015, will head the pace attack that includes Nuwan Kulasekara, Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal, as well as the all-rounder Thisara Perera, while Seekkuge Prasanna and Lakshan Sandakan will man the spin department.
The batting is a mix of youth and experience. Mathews, alongside Upul Tharanga, should lend stability to the side, while Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis and Niroshan Dickwella will add flair to the proceedings. Thisaras role cannot be overstated. Apart from the few overs of medium pace, he will be expected to provide late impetus with the bat.
History
Sri Lanka has featured in every edition of the ICC Champions Trophy to date. It was the joint winner with India in the 2002 edition, when heavy rains at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo spoilt the party. Sri Lanka has also finished in the semi-finals on two occasions; the inaugural edition in 1998 and in the most recent one in 2013. It suffered group-phase exits in the 2004, 2006 and 2009 editions, while reaching the quarter-final in 2000.
Recent form
Sri Lanka hasn't had the best run in recent times. Since the start of 2016, it has played 27 ODIs, winning seven and losing 15. It was whitewashed in a five-match ODI series by South Africa in early 2017, then tied a series at home against Bangladesh 1-1, before the 1-1 result against Scotland. Sri Lanka will, however, take heart from the fact that it played those games without Mathews and Malinga.
Watch out for
Niroshan Dickwella was the top run-getter for Sri Lanka in the ODI series in South Africa. The 23-year-old has missed games because of injuries but has displayed fine skills with the bat when given a chance and is also a strong wicketkeeper.
If he brings his A game to the table, it will be a major fillip to the Sri Lankan batting order, which has appeared a tad fragile in recent times.
Squad
Angelo Mathews (captain), Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Upul Tharanga, Dinesh Chandimal, Nuwan Pradeep, Asela Gunaratne, Chamara Kapugedara, Kusal Mendis, Kusal Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Lakshan Sandakan, Suranga Lakmal, Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulaseka.

Coca-Cola Zero hits Sri Lankan markets
Coca-Cola Sri Lanka, has launched the globally acclaimed product Coca-Cola Zero  variant of Coca-Cola, already available in more than 150 countries.
The launch adds to the suite of beverage options that are currently available to The Coca-Cola Companys consumers in Sri Lanka including Lion Soda, Lion Ginger Beer, Fanta Cream Soda, Fanta Portello, Fanta Orange, Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light and Sprite.
Coca-Cola Zero offers the same great taste of Coca-Cola and is sugar free. Coca-Cola Zero uses globally approved sweeteners instead of sugar and therefore only has 0.3 Kcal per 100 ml of serving.
It is widely acclaimed and is one of the most successful products launched by The Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola Zero is one of those brands that became a USD 1 billion brand in revenue terms, in the shortest length of time.
Speaking about the launch Mayank Arora, Managing Director of Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd, the bottling arm of The Coca-Cola Company in Sri Lanka, said We value the relationship and the faith that Sri Lankan consumers have been reposing in us for over five decades. We are confident that Coca-Cola Zero gives them yet another reason to strengthen the bond. Coca-Cola Zero, manufactured in Sri Lanka, will initially be available in a 400 ml pack and will be rolled out across the nation in a phased manner.
According to Sonu Grover, Managing Director, Coca-Cola Sri Lanka Pvt. Ltd, As the consumer choices are constantly evolving, it is important for us to add new offerings to our portfolio as we nurture the existing brands. With this launch, we have now made available, three variants of Coca-Cola to consumers in Sri Lanka - Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light and now Coca-Cola Zero. We are excited about the new launch and we look forward to providing more choices to consumers as we go forward.
When Coca-Cola Zero first debuted globally in June 2005, it became The Coca-Cola Companys most successful new product launch since Diet Coke in 1982.
The origins of Coca-Cola Zero can be traced back to the late 1990s, when the search for a next-generation, no-calorie Coca-Cola began. Coke Zero would eventually offer the best of both worlds. In 2007, AOL named Coke Zero the second-hottest product of the year, behind the iPhone, and the brand is currently sold in 159 countries.

Colombo Plan International Society AGM
The 32nd AGM of the Colombo Plan International Society 2017 was ceremonially held recently at the Sasakawa Cultural Centre, Colombo.
The Colombo Plan was inaugurated on July 1, 1951. This great idea was translated into a reality by a group of eight Commonwealth nations namely Australia, Britain, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa.
The aim was co-operative economic development in South East Asia. In fact the idea was conceived 18 months earlier at the Conference of Foreign Affairs held in Colombo in 1950.
The Ceylon delegation was of the view that through this plan the underprivileged would be helped by the countries with wealth.
This would also help to bring a closer understanding and a greater appreciation of culture and civilization of the developing countries. This also strengthens human understanding and fellowship.
The Colombo Plan International Society (CPIS) was formed by the Colombo Plan Scholars who participated in varied fields of education in the donor countries and on their return this society was formed in 1972 and continued till 1978. After a lapse of six years it was revived in 1984. The society of has contributed to the nation in the form of workshop, seminars and awareness programmes in the rural areas.
These were conducted with the assistance and co-operation of the Colombo Plan Secretariat, the Police, anti narcotic division and District Health Department, Kalutara.
The national council of Road Safety, the Three Wheeler Drivers Association of Colombo, the Automobile Association and well wishers from the Business Community and members of the CPIS.
The 32nd AGM of the CPIS was held recently at the Sasakawa Cultural Centre where the new office bearers were elected. The chief guest was the Secretary General of the Colombo Plan Secretariat Kinely Dorje. Addressing the audience he presented visuals of what Colombo Plan has done in the rural areas of Sri Lanka. He stressed the fact that the members should be more involved in the activities in these areas. He suggested ways and means of involving the membership and expanding the CPIS activities.
The guest speaker Mayor General Dr Thuvairaj inspired the audience with a vibrant address and a practical video presentation on Fitness for all especially senior citizens.
The President of CPIS highlighted the activities of the society and thanked the ex members for their hard work and dedicated services in all these activities.
The AGM concluded with a fellowship lunch.

Combating Colorectal Cancer : Men beware!
Senior Consultant, Medical Oncology, Parkway Cancer Centre, Singapore Dr Zee Ying Kiat speaks to the Daily News on Colorectal cancer, its causes, treatment procure and preventive measures. Colorectal cancer which is mostly found in men still remains the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world.
What are the main risk factors of colorectal cancer How can it be prevented
Age and Gender are non-modifiable risk factors.
Usually, the risk of colorectal cancer increases after age 45. Men, unfortunately, are slightly more at risk than women. Even though its more common in men, women also get colorectal cancer.
There are however modifiable risk factors.
Smoking: This is something very important for all the readers. It is not often known that smoking is a risk factor for developing colorectal cancer.
We know that smoking increases heart disease, stroke, lung cancer or oral cavity cancer. But smoking actually increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer too. So one way to prevent colorectal cancer and many other cancers is actually to stop smoking altogether!
Alcohol intake: The use of alcohol is another modifiable risk factor. Actually limiting alcohol intake can help lessen the risk of colorectal cancer developing.
Obesity/lack of exercise: Obesity and lack of exercise too are well linked to colorectal cancer as well. So if we exercise, and maintain a healthy weight, we lessen our chance of developing colorectal cancer.
Food: Red meat is linked with the development of colorectal cancer. It should not be said that we should avoid red meat altogether, but it is important to lessen the intake of red meat.
Low fibre diet: Eating too little fibre is a risk factor. Taking more vegetables and fruits - a higher intake of fibre- is known to lessen the risk of developing this cancer.
Processed food: Consumption of processed food is actually a known risk factor for developing colorectal cancer.
In short, limit the intake of processed food and red meat. It is a matter of moderation. I think the key word here is moderation.
Screening for colorectal cancer is also a form of prevention. Because, if we detect the polyp and if the polyp is removed, we prevent polyp ever turning into cancer in the future.
These are the things that are not only helpful to prevent colorectal cancer but also for ones general health.
What are the common symptoms
Half of the patients with colorectal cancer actually do not have any symptoms. It is diagnosed because they have gone for screening which again emphasises the importance of screening. It is known to help save lives and it predominantly does so, because it detects cancer at its earliest stage and treatment is more effective and therefore the outcome is better.
If colorectal cancer does cause symptoms, some of the symptoms it can cause are a pain in the tummy, altered bowel habits (constipation/ diarrhoea) passage of blood in the stool, nausea  vomiting and tiredness.
But these are also symptoms that can be the result of non-cancerous causes. Therefore the best advice for patients with any symptoms is to at least get themselves checked up by their doctor to find out what the cause of these symptoms are and if cancer is found then have the appropriate treatment for it.
How often should a normalperson go for screening
For an average risk individual (an individual that does not have the family history or personal history for that matter of colorectal cancer) the guideline for screening starts at the age of 50 and above.
What are the methods of screening
There are different methods of colorectal cancer screening.
One is the foecal occult blood test (FOBT) and this test is done to check whether theres blood in the faeces that is not visibly apparent. This test is usually done once every year from age 50.
The alternative method is colonoscopy (a form of endoscopy), a test that examines the rectum and entire colon using a long, lighted instrument called a colonoscope. If the colonoscopy is normal we usually repeat ten years after the first.
Of course, if an abnormality like polyp is detected the frequency of screening becomes closer.
There are other forms of screening for colorectal cancer as well such as CT Colonography. This is a non-invasive form of screening because it uses CT scanner to produce three-dimensional pictures of the colon and rectum. Although it is non-invasive, it does have limitations. It is less accurate than the colonoscopy.
Therefore if pursued and found to be normal, CT Colonography tends to be repeated every five years and the other limitation of a CT Colonography is, if a polyp is found the CT scan is not going to allow you to remove the polyp. So the patient will have to go through colonoscopy procedure again to get that done.
If detected early, can colorectalcancer be cured
If the cancer is detected in its early stages, its highly treatable and the rate of cure is actually high. For example at stage one colorectal cancer, ninety-five percent of people live normal lives after surgery.
Even if there are relapses, if detected at earlier stages, effective treatment is possible.
Stages of Colorectal Cancer
* Stage 0: The cancer is found only in the innermost lining of the colon or rectum. Carcinoma in situ is another name for Stage 0 colorectal cancer.
* Stage I: The tumour has grown into the inner wall of the colon or rectum. The tumour has not grown through the wall.
* Stage II: The tumour extends more deeply into or through the wall of the colon or rectum. It may have invaded nearby tissue, but cancer cells have not spread to the lymph nodes.
* Stage III: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to other parts of the body.
* Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver or lungs.
* Recurrence: This is cancer that has been treated and has returned after a period of time when cancer could not be detected. The disease may return in the colon or rectum, or in another part of the body.

Dan Lawrence digs in for Essex after Sangakkara double
LONDON, Saturday - When, having completed his 14th first-class double-century, Kumar Sangakkara finally fell, caught at long-off trying to stick Simon Harmer into the river, the stage seemed set  with the pitch brimful of runs and the sun beaming  for Alastair Cook to go just as large. It was not to be as Tom Curran pinned Cook in front  so plumb he walked  shortly after lunch for a brisk 36. But the boy many folk in these parts believe is their next Test player, Dan Lawrence, stepped in, shelved his trademark extravagance and ground out a fine day for Division Ones leaders. Sangakkaras was an exquisite innings that had hauled Surrey to 369. Farming the strike in the company of the last man, Ravi Rampaul, Sangakkara was turning down singles on 199, a score he reached with a searing cut splitting two men in the deep. He had put on 110 with Stuart Meaker, one of two other batsmen to reach double-figures, until he nibbled outside off to Jamie Porter, who sent Amar Virdis off peg cartwheeling shortly afterwards. Cooks 44-ball stay, potted with lovely drives, gave Essex a sharp start, but they were pinned down by Surrey in a slog of an afternoon session. That was in large part thanks to the 18-year-old off-spinning debutant, Virdi, who bowled 12 overs unchanged from the River End at a cost of 22 runs. Zafar Ansari retired confident that Virdi was ready to play first-team cricket and it appears he was right.
Virdi is green, but beat the bat and found drift and turn, while poor deliveries were rare. Rory Burns persisted with him for seven overs after tea and while a first wicket was not forthcoming, nor were a flurry of runs, apart from successive silky smooth cover drives and a cut by Ravi Bopara. After Tom Westley was caught behind driving Sam Curran, Lawrence, capped by Essex on Friday and with England Lions for the first time next week, batted with grace and maturity. With his pronounced trigger and easy manner, he was quick to pull and powerful through point.
Lawrences first partner was Nick Browne, whose touch partially returned in his first half-century of the season (although two balls later, he pulled Meaker straight to midwicket), then Bopara, with whom he has put on 89. Their next task is the imminent new ball. If Surrey are to leave with a win, they must make good use of it.
Should the weather stay fair, Hampshires visit to Taunton will not make it into a final day. After Somersetused the final 10 overs of the second day to knock 39 off their target of 259 for their first win of the season in an entertaining game on a turning track, the equation is simple: Hampshire need 10 wickets, Somerset 220 runs. Hampshire had a better day, besides a crazy hour after lunch in which they lost six wicket. They had efficiently docked Somersets tail, with Liam Dawson and Kyle Abbott taking four wickets apiece, to limit the first innings lead to 35, then all chipped in to make 293 in their second innings. Dom Bess, an increasingly alluring off-spinning prospect, took seven wickets (including the first five) to finish with 10 in the match.
Nottinghamshires inevitable march back to Division One continued apace at Trent Bridge as they skittled Gloucestershire for 149 (a first innings lead of 281) and invited the visitors to follow-on. When they did, Luke Fletcher, who, like Stuart Broad, took three first-innings wickets, picked up the scalp of Chris Dent.
Kent took a 205-run first innings lead as they bowled Sussex out for 164 with Darren Stevens again taking five wickets. Daryl Mitchell made 161 in Worcestershires 434, a lead of 196 over Northamptonshire, who they had reduced to 53 for two by stumps. There was another run-drenched day at Derby, where Derbyshire reached 532 for eight, with hundreds for Billy Godleman and Shiv Thakor and 97 for Gary Wilson, in response to Leicestershires 619 where Sri Lankas leg spinning all rounder Jeevan Mendis had figures of six for 204 off 52.3 overs. And on a rain-affected day at Swansea, Durham toiled hard for six Glamorgan wickets, as they reached 220 in response to 342.

Endangered marine mammal to disappear in a year
The world's most endangered marine mammal - known as the 'panda of the sea' - may go extinct by 2018 if no action is taken to save them, warns a new report which estimates that fewer than 30 individuals may be alive today.
The mammal, named vaquita porpoise, is endemic to the Upper Gulf of California. Unsustainable fishing practices and illegal wildlife trade driven by demand for the swim bladder of a critically endangered fish also endemic to the region, the totoaba, has caused the vaquita population to plummet in recent years.
Listed as the most endangered cetacean in the world these mammals are often accidentally killed in gillnets which were banned for two years in 2015."Yet again, we bear witness to the devastating impacts of the illegal wildlife trade. But vaquita aren't even the target of this crime - they are innocent bystanders, paying the highest of prices," said Leigh Henry, Senior Policy Advisor for Wildlife Conservation at World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
WWF has recommended an immediate, permanent ban on gillnets and remove and destroy ghost nets, to prevent the vaquita and other marine species from being caught. "Having discovered the vaquita less than sixty years ago, we humans have now brought it to the brink of extinction," said Jorge Rickards, acting CEO of WWF-Mexico.
"Their incredibly low numbers are a stark reminder of how our efforts to protect this incredible species and its habitat are falling short. Unless we act decisively today, we could lose the vaquita forever," Rickards said.

Farah, Taylor shine at Prefontaine Classic
EUGENE AFP May28, 2017 ,Mo Farah laid down a marker to his rivals with a superb 5,000m victory in the Prefontaine Classic here Saturday as triple jump king Christian Taylor edged ever closer to his dream of a world record leap.
Farah, the four-time Olympic champion who is embarking on his final season of track racing, clocked the fastest time of the year after romping home in 13min 00.70sec at Eugene's Hayward Field in Oregon.
The 34-year-old British distance running king, who completed a 'double-double' of 5,000m and 10,000m gold at last year's Olympics, said he had been determined to send a message to his challengers as he builds towards his farewell at the World Championships in August.
For me it wasn't about time. It was just a matter of telling the boys 'Look, I'm ready', Farah said.
A lot of the boys talk a lot. I just want my running to do the talking and get on with it. Farah's brilliant tactical victory wasone of seven world leading performances set across a high quality day of action.
The display of the day came from US triple jump king Taylor, the two-time Olympic and world champion who recorded the third longest leap in history, 18.11m, to win a duel with compatriot Will Claye, who was second with 18.05. Taylor, 26, is now within striking distance of Jonathan Edwards' 1995 world record of 18.29m. Afterwards, Taylor admitted pursuit of Edwards' record was his main motivation.
It's the only reason I'm here, he told AFP. I've got two Olympic titles, two world titles, the American record, I've been blessed beyond belief.
The only thing that kills me now is that I'm number two all-time. And nobody will remember number two. And that's what's pushing me every single day, he added.
Arguably the most surprising result of the day came in the women's 200m which had been billed as one of the strongest fields ever assembled.
America's Tori Bowie, a bronze medallist over the distance at last year's Olympic Games in Rio, blasted to victory in the quickest time of the year in 21.77sec.
Bowie led from start to finish to come home ahead of Olympic 400m champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas in second with 21.91. Olympic champion Elaine Thompson was third with 21.98 while Dutch star Dafne Schippers was fourth in 22.30. Allyson Felix, the 2012 200m Olympic champion, was fifth in 22.33. Elsewhere Saturday, Jamaica's 110m hurdles star Omar McLeod signalled once again he will be the man to beat at the World Championships after storming home in 13.01sec. - AFP

Global Design Tex launches first training development centre in Mullaitivu
Co-founders of Global Design Tex (GDT), Maheshika Kularathne and Sampath Madarasinghe, known experts in the field of the apparel industry established their training development centre (TDC), 300 km away from the capital city of Colombo, in a remote village named Keppapillaw in Mullaitivu in the Northern Province.
This is set up as a stepping stone to establish a fully-fledged garment factory employing around 300 youth in Chemmalai, Mullaitivu within the next two years.
GDT, with their Australian partnership, caters to a niche market with a premium range of brands, exclusively for the Australian market and also serves Europe and the USA
GDT is now is in the process of expanding their global network with Europe and India attracting many similar new brands. The duo felt that it is the need of the hour and took this risk in good faith for the sake of humanity and genuine endeavor to support the Government effort in reconciliation and nation building.
The idea was mooted by Commander Security Force  MLT, Major. General Dampath Fernando who understood the desperate need of addressing the prevailing unemployment issue in the district as majority of the men and women are employed on the basis of daily wages with very limited earning capacity causing numerous grievances on sustaining their families.
In fact according to Government statistics the Mullaitivu district is considered as the poorest district in the country with mediocre development in all areas as compared to other districts since the three- decade war ended in 2009.
The Army has come forward as usual to play their role, teaming up with the GDT group, to establish their TDC with 35 employees from the area.
Maheshika Kularathne who is the livewire behind this whole exercise has been working very closely with the Army from start to end, to set up this centre. Mullaitivu District Secretary Rupawathi Kethishwaram who supported this project from the very inception said the TDC with 35 employees would help to sustain 35 families and in the future through the upcoming factory, 300 more employees would sustain a further 300 families.
With many giants in the apparel field, GDT, an up and coming business entity effort to extend its commitment to establish its business in Mullaitivu should be highly commended.
It would no doubt be an eye opener for other investors to look towards the district.

Glory of Ramadan
The Islamic calendar has 12 months and the Ramadan falls on the ninth month. Ramadan means completely destroying one's sin, and it plays a vital role in the spiritual life of every Muslim across the world.
Basically there are five pillars in Islam. The fist pillar is Kalima, second Prayer, third Zakath, fourth Ramadan and fifth is Haj. Every Muslim should try to uphold these five pillars because it is the fundamental of Islam. Though Ramadan takes the fourth place, it has a deeper meaning in the practical term.
Ramadan is a blessed month of mercy, blessings, forgiveness, patience and peace. Muslims all over the world fast 30 days in this month and they are divided into three divisions. The first 10 days of fasting is for blessings (Rahmath), second 10 days is for seeking repentance for the sins they committed (Magfirath) and the last 10 days for seeking protection from the Hell (Ethukum Minannar).
Every Muslim should observe fasting during the 30 days, yet there are certain exceptions for elderly people, pregnant and breast-feeding mothers and patients who cannot fast due to their illnesses and also for travellers.
The Muslims who skip fasting should fast on a later days or provide compensations for the days they could not fast.
Fasting means not merely refraining from food and drinks. Think of a machine that functions throughout the year without a break. It will soon break down or get into troubles. Our body is also functioning all 365 days without a rest; as a result the body will be exhausted and apparently prone to fall sick. Fasting provides rest for our body; besides its bodily benefits, it also brings numerous spiritual benefits. People generally tend to commits sins during the eleven months but during the Ramadan they determine to refrain from committing sins.
There are several significant good deeds that every Muslim should observe during the month such as reciting the Holy Quran, Perform tharawi and involving in charity (sadaqua) and so on. But in real context, Muslim brothers and sisters engage in speaking ill of others, watching televisions, playing carom and chess and idling away precious time during the Ramadan. They should completely make themselves free from these activities, as they are not going to bring any rewards by doing them. These entertainments will erode their good deeds and they finally end up as bankrupt on the doomsday.The fasting takes the forth place in the five pillars of Islam and prayers (salah) take the second place. Some Muslim brothers and sisters tend to skip five times prayers and observe only fasting. They do not obtain any spiritual improvements and rewards in skipping away prayers and fasting.
One should perform prayers and fasting simultaneously so as to obtain the real benefits from Ramadan. This month is also gifted with divinely benefits such as the doors of the heavens are open and the doors of the hells are closed, the Satan is handcuffed and the rewards for good deeds are multiplied during the Ramadan.
If a Muslim performs five times prayers during the Ramadan, it is 70 folds greater than the prayers which he performs in other ordinary days. The holy month is also gifted with a meritorious night referred to as Lailathu-Qadir, which is greater than thousand months.
Allah has honoured the month by revealing the Holy Quran in the same month. The Muslims should realise the real purpose of Ramadan and perform all rituals accordingly. It would pave the way for them to remain the heaven forever.

Government ready to mediate in Australia pay row
SYDNEY May28, 2017 Sports Minister Greg Hunt said Sunday the federal government was prepared to provide mediation between Cricket Australia and players over the pay-dispute stalemate.
CA chairman David Peever has turned down the Australian Cricketers' Association's request for independent mediation and there are fears the stand-off could potentially lead to a players' boycott of the showpiece Ashes series later in the year. Hunt said the government was hesitant about being too interventionist in contract disputes in professional sport. But he said there was scope to act as a mediator if the dispute looked likely to threaten the home Ashes series.
If it got to a last-minute situation, I suspect that we would offer to provide good officers brokering between the parties, but there's six months between now and the Ashes, Hunt told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
It would be unthinkable that in the end we wouldn't have a full team.
I do not see either the players or the administration returning to the late 1970s where we had a second-rate team.
The players love playing for Australia, Cricket Australia knows this is not just fundamental to sport, it is part of our national identity.
I'm very confident they will reach an agreement. - AFP

Growing rewards!
Many of us like to eat fruits because of their health benefits. However we do not give much thought to how these fruits are planted. Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Director's Office of Agriculture Ratmalana, Subject Matter Officer (Fruit Cultivation) Chitrani Menikge on the stage where fruits are planted.
First of all we must select an appropriate area and prepare the soil. A good drainage system is vital as we need to protect against soil erosion, using specific methods like creating drains. Soil erosion affects the roots damaging it and sweeping away the compost. There also must be appropriate spacing between the plants. It must be done in a certain way where the branches will not come into contact with each other. The ideal spacing should be 8m- 10m or 10m - 10m. After this we dig the pit, said Menikge.
If the spacing is 10m - 10m (Rambutan and Mango), then you can grow 100 trees in a hectare. If it is 8m - 10m, then you can grow 125 trees in one hectare.
We must also clear the ground of weeds. If the soil is good then the height and width of the hole must be 60cm - 60cm. If the soil has a clay like nature then the height and width of the hole needs to be 90cm - 90cm. This is because for proper healthy growth, you need soft soil. This is for the development of the roots. Two weeks before planting the hole must be filled with a mixture of Compost and Top Soil, stated Menikge.
Process
When digging the hole, we must dig up the top soil and place it separately. Then we must dig up the ground soil and place it separately. Then we mix the compost and top soil and fill the hole. Then after two weeks, we plant.
When we choose the plant that needs to be planted, we choose a budded plant. This is because it yields a bigger and faster harvest that seedling plants. The harvest comes in three years. You can get exactly the same variety that you want. Two days before planting, we need to apply chemical fertilizer. This is also mixed into the soil, pointed out Menikge
However prior to all of this we have prepared the budded plant. We fill a polythene bag with compost and top soil, and plant the seeds there. After it grows it is put through the budding process. So we have the budded plant in the polythene bag. Then what we do is, we remove a section of the hole (that we have filled in with compost, top soil and chemical fertilizer) which is the size of the polythene bag. After that we remove the polythene bag and place the soil mound (containing the budded plant) in that hole, explained Menikge.
Shade
After planting we introduce a supporter into the hole - a piece of wood, and tie the plant to that piece of wood. Then we administer the required amount of water. As soon as it is planted it needs shade. The shade must be given for at least six months.
If the soil mixture is good, there will be a good development of roots. This is especially important when it comes to secondary roots. If the secondary roots have developed well, then you will see leaves coming. That is why the soil needs to be soft and not hard and clay like. Leaves are a good indication of good root development. If the soil is too hard you won't see leaves. Also the roots need proper nutrients - Water and Compost. Too much water is bad and too little water is also bad. Irrigation and good drainage is important. If there is too much water and the clay like quality is there, then there won't be proper air for the roots, elucidated Menikge
The secondary roots absorb the water and nutrients. In the Wet Zone, fruit planting is done in April and May. In the intermediate zone it is in October to November.
When growing in home gardens, the growing area must be a little distance from the house and the wall. When the plant is growing you need to apply more compost. You need a boundary here. The boundary where the compost and chemical fertilizer is applied is marked by the edge of the branches. In that way the secondary roots which are branched out will receive the nutrients. The soil is loosened and compost is applied. Of course in the Rambutan trees, the roots are near the surface, so in that case the soil does not need to be loosened too much. Of course the loosening of the soil takes place 35cm away from the plant, forming a sort of inner perimeter where the compost is applied, explained Menikge.
When the leaves appear we know that the plant is well fixed to the ground and that the roots have developed. Compost is applied to the boundary in four months, and every four months till harvest. After the harvest, the amount of compost needs to be changed.
Budding
Budding is yet another propagation technique where a bud is excised from a mother plant and used as the scion material. When a leaf falls after maturity there is a scar. That is the bud or a growing point. It can develop as a branch. A part of the bark of the stock plant is removed and the selected vegetative bud along with a patch of bark from the scion plant is inserted onto the stock plant. The graft is further tied to keep the bud in place and maintained till the union takes place. After the union is ensured, the portion of the stock above the bud union is removed and the sprouts from the scion bud are encouraged to grow further.

Half a glass of wine every day increases breast cancer risk
According to a report from the World Cancer Research Fund, half a glass of wine or a small beer a day increases the risk of breast cancer.
It also backs up research showing that regular intensive exercise can reduce the risk of the disease.
Breast cancer is by far the most common cancer in women in the UK with one in eight women developing the disease during their lifetime.
But scientists say they cant explain why the cancer occurs in some people and not in others.
There are numerous causes and lots of factors to take into account, including lifestyle, hormone levels and other medical conditions.
Basically, its a complex picture and theres no point focusing on one factor only your family
Risk factors
For a start, there are some factors you cannot control such as your sex, age, height, genes and when you started your periods.
Being a woman, over 50 and past the menopause, and having a history of breast cancer in your family, all increase your risk of getting the disease.
Being tall and starting periods before the age of 12 are thought to increase the risk too.
Cancer Research UK lists 18 different factors which could cause breast cancer to some degree. Alcohol is only one of them.
The report says there are ways women can lower their risk of breast cancer by focusing on factors they can control, like diet, weight and exercise.
After analysing more than 100 studies that examined the medical history of 12 million women, the report backs up current advice to be aware of alcohol consumption.
The report found evidence that drinking an extra small glass of wine every day (10g of alcohol) increases a womans risk of breast cancer after the menopause by 9%.
It means that in a group of 100 women, around 13 would be likely to develop breast cancer anyway.
And if they all drank an additional small glass of wine every day, one extra case might develop among the original group.
Exercise and diet
When it comes to exercise, the report found that doing more vigorous exercise, like cycling or running, cut the risk of post-menopausal breast cancer by 10% compared to the least active women.
Breastfeeding was also found to lower the risk of the disease before and after the menopause.
And there was limited evidence that eating more leafy vegetables, such as cabbage, spinach and kale, decreased the risk of a less common kind of breast cancer.
We already know that regular physical exercise, eating a balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight are important for reducing the risk of lots of diseases, including cancers.
But scientists say all these factors interact with each other and that makes it difficult to tease out which ones are driving the cancer and to what extent.
Advice on alcohol intake
New guidelines were introduced in 2016 which said that men and women should drink no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine - and some days should be free of alcohol altogether.
The UKs chief medical officers advice was based on research which showed that any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of cancer.
Pregnant women are advised not to drink at all.
Reaction to this report
Cancer experts say the findings dont tell us anything new about the link between alcohol and breast cancer, which is already well known.
But if you can, to stack the odds in your favour, they say it is a good idea to have some alcohol-free days during every week and not to increase your drinking.
However, Cancer Research UK says there is no need be alarmed and go teetotal.
It is also important to look at the bigger picture.
Drinking alcohol has a greater effect on the risks of several other cancers - including mouth, liver and bowel - than it does on breast cancer, so there is no reason to become fixated on alcohol.
Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, says the risks have to be set against whatever pleasure women might obtain from their drinking.
The report does not provide absolute risks and as such, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, from the University of Cambridge, said it did not seem a good basis for recommending that women give up alcohol completely.
However, Dr Anne McTiernan, lead report author and cancer expert at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, said the evidence regarding breast cancer was clear.
Having a physically active lifestyle, maintaining a healthy weight throughout life and limiting alcohol are all steps women can take to lower their risk.

Human, all too human
In October 1876, around the time of his thirty-second birthday, Friedrich Nietzsche set off on his first journey to Italy. He was at this point Professor of Classical Philology in Basel, a post he had secured at the astonishingly young age of twenty-four. Nietzsche had been quite sickly, suffering from a number of ailments, ranging from debilitating headaches and vision problems to frequent bouts of nausea and vomiting.
It was thought that some restful time in the pleasant climate of the south would do him good. Malwida von Meysenbug, a well-to-do aristocrat and writer, invited Nietzsche to join her, and secured rooms in the Villa Rubinacci, perched up the rocky cliffs of Sorrento, across the gulf from Naples and Vesuvius. Richard and Cosima Wagner were a short stroll away, luxuriously ensconced at the Hotel Vittoria. They too were resting, with a monumental undertaking recently completed. A few months before, Wagners cycle of music dramas, Der Ring des Niebelungen, had had its premiere at the newly inaugurated festival in Bayreuth. Both Nietzsche and Meysenbug had been close with the Wagner family, and had been champions of the Wagnerian programme for German cultural renewal. While relations between Nietzsche and the Wagners were still cordial, they had cooled somewhat. It was on this trip that Nietzsche would see Wagner for the last time. As Wagners influence over him diminished, he began to assert his intellectual independence and come into his own as a philosopher, beginning to write his aphoristic work Human, All Too Human.
Paolo DIorios Nietzsches Journey to Sorrento charts this trip, and this pivotal year in Nietzsches life. DIorio cites a moving notebook entry of Nietzsches, from a few years later, where he reflects back on what this meant to him:
I dont have enough strength for the North: awkward and artificial souls reign there, who work as constantly and necessarily at the measures of prudence as the beaver at his dam. And to think I spent my whole youth among them! That is what overcame me when, for the first time, I saw the evening come up, with its velvet gray and red, in the sky over Naples  like a shudder of pity for myself, that I had started my life by being old, and tears came to my eyes and the feeling of having been saved at the last moment. I have enough spirit for the South.
Ill health
This journey was the start of a lasting infatuation with Italy. Not long after this trip to Sorrento, Nietzsche would come to resign his professorship on grounds of ill health. He afterwards lived on his modest pension and divided his time between Italy, the Cte dAzur and the Swiss mountains, particularly around Sils Maria. This trip marked a turning point, both personally and philosophically. In addition to Nietzsches move away from Wagner, his early work was strongly under the influence of Arthur Schopenhauer. Although Nietzsche was dubious of Schopenhauers metaphysics early on, he was drawn to aspects of Schopenhauers bleak world view. Schopenhauer argued that ours was a miserable lot, where we are perpetually buffeted between states of suffering and boredom, and can never reach lasting satisfaction of our desires.
It would be better, he thought, never to have come into existence. Nietzsches crucial shift away from this Schopenhauerian stance of life negation to his eventual one of life affirmation was of course an incremental process. But this foray to the South, if not necessarily the impetus for the philosophical transformation, provides a beautiful geographical image of what was happening more gradually: Nietzsche moves from attachment to a cold, pessimistic philosophy of the North to a sunnier philosophy of the South, a philosophy celebrating life and the world, the body and vitality. Like Lesley Chamberlains superb Nietzsche in Turin(1996), covering the last year of Nietzsches sane life, DIorios book focuses judiciously on a key year. It is well judged in its plan and its execution.

Covering a considerably longer span, Daniel Blues The Making of Friedrich Nietzsche charts the philosophers formative years. He was born in 1844 in the Saxon town of Rcken. His father, a Lutheran pastor, died when Friedrich was a young child. Blue recounts the first decades of Nietzsches life, up to the point that he finished his university education. Subtitled The quest for identity, Blues book takes as its guiding thread Nietzsches interest, from an early age, in writing his autobiography. At the age of thirteen, he wrote a charmingly pompous first attempt: From My Life  by F. W. Nietzsche. The years of youth. This was the beginning of several efforts at the genre throughout his life, culminating in 1888, on the brink of his collapse into insanity, with Ecce Homo, whose chapters notoriously include Why I Am So Wise, Why I Write Such Good Books, and Why I Am Destiny.
Academic work
In 1858 Nietzsche enrolled at Schulpforta, a boarding school with a distinguished register of alumni, including the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte and the historian Leopold von Ranke. It was here that he received the rigorous training in classical languages that prepared him for his future academic career. Nietzsches seriousness about matters of Bildung was evident from this early stage, and extended beyond his formal academic work. Along with a few friends, Nietzsche formed a club called Germania, an intellectual discussion circle, where they would take turns presenting essays, poetry and music.
One of the most interesting elements in Blues story is its charting of Nietzsches loss of faith, beginning in his middle teenage years. In his contributions to Germania, we dont see outright atheism, but we do see a cautious movement to a more sceptical perspective. In one of his essays from this period, Nietzsche reflects on how difficult it can be to distance oneself from the tradition in which one has grown up, and to reflect on it in a critical way. This gives a nice hint of what, in the face of this difficulty, will become one of his most striking philosophical accomplishments: specifically his ability to step, insofar as possible, outside the Judaeo-Christian moral tradition and look at it as an anthropologist might, explaining how it gained traction and why it continues to retain it. Nietzsche pressed this still further, going beyond the role of anthropologist to that of philosophical legislator, concerned with the task of revaluing these hitherto revered values.
From Schulpforta, Nietzsche first moved to Bonn to study, then to Leipzig, where he did his doctoral training. While philology was his subject, philosophy was a strong side interest. He had ongoing doubts about whether he would be cut out for a career as a philologist, but his talent was evident to his teachers. - Times Literary Supplement

Human rights standards on freedom of association
The preamble to the ILO Constitution states that universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice Sri Lanka has ratified all the principal United Nations Conventions on human rights and also all eight of the International Labour Organization (ILO) fundamental conventions reflected in the 1998 Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at work Among the most basic principles of the International Labour Code are the freedom of association and collective bargaining in the conduct of industrial relations. These principles pervade all ILO standard- setting instruments. In the areas of basic human rights particular attention here is drawn to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Rights to Organize Convention 1948 (No. 87)
Human rights and development are interrelated. They reinforce each other. Rights constitute the essential condition of a good life. The individual has obligations towards the state. But the state also has certain obligations to provide conditions of good life to such persons. Rights are essential but they are not unlimited. Rights and duties are interrelated. Human rights are rights that everyone has by virtur of his / her being human. Human Rights are concerned with the dignity of the individual  the level of self-esteem that secures personal identity and promotes human community. The aim of a universal system of human rights is to revise and restore human dignity in all societies, whose political and economic oppression exist and to relieve human misery, to enrich and refine human life in all parts of the world.
The most comprehensive and widely used human rights declaration is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) which was crafted by the United Nations in the aftermath of the Second World War in 1948. The Declaration was designed to serve as a fundamental source of inspiration for national and international efforts to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to serve as a yard stick to measure the degree of respect for and compliance with international human rights standards. Social justice and human rights are intimately connected.
Without human rights guaranteed by civil liberties, social rights have no meaning. Political freedom, civil liberties, social justice and cultural vitality are mutual complementary expression of the freedom of human sprit. Without of freedom of association, the freedom of individual is at the mercy of the powerful groups or persons.
The International Labour Organization (ILO)
The International Labour Organization (ILO) is one of the most important agencies of the United Nations which promotes industrial and social peace through some humane conditions of work. It was created as a tripartite body under the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, and outlived that body to become in 1946, the first specialized agency associated with the United Nations. Its main objective, is to ensure the social and economic well being of the working people all over the world and to guarantee to them decent living standards, adequate employment opportunities and satisfactory conditions of work and pay. The ILO has brought governments, employers and trade unions together for united action in the cause of social justice and better living conditions everywhere in the world, on the premise that the promotion of social justice in the field of labour could be achieved only if the social partners themselves were involved in the appropriate solutions.
The values enshrined in the ILOs Constitution and the Declaration of Philadelphia also find expression in a body of international instruments comprising Conventions and Recommendations that together form the International Labour Code. Sri Lanka has ratified a number of such Conventions. The Declaration of Philadelphia which re-defined the aims and purposes of the ILO in 1944 stated, among other things that freedom of expression and association are essential to sustain progress. The ILO approach to the implementation of human rights is based on three guiding concepts: laying down standards by way of conventions and recommendations, promotional and educational activities, inquiring into complaints and practical assistance involving in applying standards and procedures.
An introduction of the relevant ILO Conventions
(a). The Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention No. 87 of 1948.
The Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention No. 87, 1948, sets out the way in which workers and employers organisations should be allowed to function; free of control by public authorities. Its objective is to establish the freely exercise the rights of workers and employers, without distinction, to organize for furthering and defending their interests. A summary of the Convention is as undernoted:
i. Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing with a view to furthering and defending their respective interests. However, national legislation can determine the extent to which the guarantees in the Convention shall apply to the armed forces and the police.
ii. Such organisations have the right to draw up their own constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. Public authorities are required to refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise of this right.
iii. The organisations are not liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.
iv. These organisations have the right to establish and join federations and confederations which are entitled to the same rights and guarantees, and to affiliate with international organisations.
v. The acquisition of legal personality by those organisations shall not be subject to restrictive conditions.
vi. In exercising the rights provided for in the Convention, employers and their respective organisations are required to respect the law of the land, which should not impair, nor be so applied as to impair, the guarantees in the Convention both in respect of its content and its application.
Thus the Convention emphasizes the need for development activities to address human needs directly and protect the working people by creating safe and humane working conditions reforming and extending social security and meeting the needs of the most vulnerable groups such as child workers, women and migrant workers and those in the formal sectors. Development cannot be measured solely by the quantity of production but by its sustainability, by its capacity to protect the livelihood of all human beings. Development should be coupled with distributive justice.
(b). Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention No. 98, 1949
Adopted in 1949, Convention No 98 seeks to protect workers from controls by employers and employers organizations and also seeks to guarantee non-interference by workers and employers organizations in respect of each other. Article 1 of Convention No. 98 requires that-
(1) Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.
(2) Such protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to 
a. make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not join a union or shall relinquish trade union membership;
b. cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities outside working hours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours.
The freedom of association for trade union purposes is meaningless unless the protection is extended to the purposes for which people would wish to so associate. Therefore the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. 98) 1949 has as its objectives the protection of workers who exercise the right to organize, ensuring non interference in workers and employers organizations and the promotion of voluntary collective bargaining. The main provisions of the Convention are as follows:
i. Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
ii. Workers shall be protected more particularly against the refusal to employ them by reason of their trade union membership, and against dismissal or any other prejudice by reason of union membership or participation in trade union activities.
iii. Workers and employers organisations are entitled to protection against acts of interference by each other. This protection is afforded particularly against acts intended to secure the domination, the financing or the control of workers organisations by employers or employers organisations.
iv. Machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established, where necessary, to ensure respect for the right to organise as defined by the Convention.
v. Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the development and use of voluntary collective bargaining to regulate terms and conditions of employment.
The extent to which the Convention applies to the armed forces and the police is determined by national laws or regulations.(Article 5 of the Convention). Although the Convention does not deal with the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the State, it cannot be construed as prejudicing their rights or status.
The establishment of the United Nations in 1945 revolutionized human rights protection. From a subject that was treated under classical international law as being an exclusively domestic matter, human rights protection became a subject that came within the purview of the international community governed by international law. Article 1(3) of the UN Charter declares international protection of human rights as a main purpose of United Nations.
To that end, the Charter charges the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOL) with human rights related functions. Further, Member States are deemed to be under an international legal obligation to inter alia, to promote universal respect for an observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language and religion through and joint and separate action in co-operation with the United Nations.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is still considered as the seminal document that recognizes Universal Human Rights Norms. The document which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948 states in its preamble that the content of the Declaration is to be a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations keeping in mind the ideal expressed in the UN Charters preamble that the peoples of the UN: reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and the worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. The UDHR provided the basis for the formulation by the United Nations of Covenants, Conventions and Declarations on specific matters.
The rights proclaimed in the UDHR can be broadly divided into two kinds: the first refers to civil and political rights which among others, include the right to life, liberty and security of person, freedom of peaceful assembly and association. The second refers to economic, social and cultural rights which relate to among others, the right to work equal pay for equal work, the right to form and join trade unions.
The UDHR further states that these rights may only be limited for the purpose of securing recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and that each person has duties to the community in which she / he lives. After the adoption of the UDHR in 1948, two international Covenants on human rights namely the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Optional Protocol to the latter Covenant were adopted by the General Assembly on December 16, 1966.
Both came into force in 1976. These instruments, along with the UDHR and Second Optional Protocol adopted in 1989 make up what is now widely known as the International Bill of Rights. The Covenants, unlike the UDHR, are legally binding treaties for those States which are parties to them and they are obliged to respect the procedures for their implementation including the submission of periodic reports in their compliance with their obligations under the Covenants.
Although there are two Covenants on human rights, the UN position is reflected in the 1993 Vienna Declaration on Human Rights is according to which all human rights are universal, inter-dependent and indivisible The human rights which ICESCR seeks to promote and protect include among others, the right to just and favorable conditions of work (Article 7), the right to form trade unions and join in the trade unions of his/ her choice (Article 8).
The ICCPR elaborates the political and civil rights identified in the UDHR. These include among others, right to life (Article 6), right to peaceful assembly (Article 21), and right to freedom of association with others including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his rights. (Article 22).
The Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98). The freedom of association for purposes or objects which are lawful is an aspect of pluralism which underpins the concept of democracy. Pluralism relating to industrial relations implies a process of negotiation between employer and workmen and between one or more of them on the one hand and the government on the other. It therefore recognizes these groups as the checks and balances which guarantee democracy.

ICTA signs MoU  with FITIS
The ICT Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), the nations apex ICT Institution under the Ministry of Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Federation of IT Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) the Apex ICT Industry Association in Sri Lanka.
ICTAs partnership with FITIS on Smart Social Circle is yet another initiative to push the ICT industry to greater heights.
Expressing her views on this new alliance, Chitranganie Mubarak said, As the apex body for driving ICT development in the country it is incumbent on us to ensure that the benefits of ICT development reaches all sections of our society.
It is only then we can talk of being digitally inclusive. ICTA launched the Smart Social Circle Initiative last year and its outreach and scope has exceeded our expectations. But this is not something we can sustain and drive on our own.
We need partners, strong committed partners, and FITIS as the largest industry body in this domain is well equipped to take up this role. ICTAs association with FITIS goes back many years and the MOU we have signed today only strengthens our commitment to jointly ensure that Sri Lanka forges forward towards a Digital Economy which is beneficial to all sections of our society.
ICTAs objective is to create an islandwide network of SMART social circles with knowledgeable, experienced and responsive citizens through the effective use of emerging digital technologies and social media. For this purpose, they expect to develop 860 SMART Social Circles in 860 Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions in all 25 districts during 2017.
SMART Social Circle is a community which consists of representatives from villages, members of community organizations, school children, housewives, small and medium scale enterprises, social activists, and charitable organizations.
A minimum of 10 competent knowledge agents will get selected from each GN division including government officials work at the grassroots and members from the community and get trained on effective use of digital technologies and applications.
This is a historic occasion for Sri Lanka's ICT industry. FITIS and ICTA have been working very closely for several industry development initiatives and we jointly conduct several programs very successfully. Joining with ICTA for an important initiative like Smart Circle will benefit the country in massive way.
From this joint initiative, FITIS and ICTA expect to promote active partnership among citizens to organize, integrate and provide user-friendly online information and services, build networks among entrepreneurs, administrators, activists, educators, and innovators, said Dr Kithsiri Manchanayakke, Chairman, FITIS.

Insurance companies should harp on new product diversification - Sugathadasa
Insurance companies should harp on new product diversification and innovation aiming tailor made solutions, said IBSL Chairperson Indrani Sugathadasa at the General Insurance Sales Congress (GISCO) held for the second consecutive year at the Waters Edge with the theme, Sustainability through Innovation.
General Insurance business in Sri Lanka is over relying on motor insurance. Not to put all your eggs in one basket,  she cautioned. Sugathadasa further stated the fraternity should penetrate untapped markets with a futuristic vision since success depends on both growth and sustainability. Sales forces are the ambassadors of insurance business. They must play customer-oriented multiple roles, she urged.
IBSL ChairpersonIndrani Sugathadasa
GISCO participation comprised insurance whiz kids, IBSL officials, re-insurance brokers, foreign insurance experts and sales personnel. Executive Director, SSMI Europe Dr Fabrizio Majorama said insurance agents must be uber-proactive and companies should adapt both push and pull strategies to attract customers.
Efficiency can be measured. Quality, feasibility, ROI and processes must be intact. Client perceives quality, not processes. Hence re-engineer processes to satisfy customer in minimum possible time. Too much strategy kills execution. Be light, and be fast, he said.
Ceylinco General Insurance CEO Ajit Gunawardane said insurance companies should sell insurance instead of prices.
Be in the hot seat instead of adhering to structured approaches which does not stimulate innovation. Lots of opportunities for the insurance fraternity are on cards. Companies thus should focus on both top line and bottom line while harping on product innovations and distribution enhancement, he said.
Alliance Insurance CEO Surekha Alles said Sachet Insurance Covers are fast gaining momentum in the world and it is high time local insurance industry started introducing one-day and one-hour Covers.
Online products are fast becoming major rivals for global insurance companies. If Google or Apple gets into insurance business they will have a global penetration. Hence insurance companies must adapt newest technology to cater to a whole new set of customers emerging which is also a vast untapped market, she said.
Insurance Association of Sri Lanka President Deepthi Lokuarachchi said the local general insurance sector is yet to realize potential available to develop markets.
Though a lions share is taken by the premium growth rates, we should achieve that by concentrating on untapped markets,, he urged.

## Title: Keeping the Peace

Keeping the Peace
The United Nations (UN) was established way back in 1945 with the avowed aim of establishing peace around the world. This was easier said than done. Today, there are more than 60 conflicts around the world, apart from acts of terrorism like the suicide bombing in Manchester, UK. The conflict in Sri Lanka ended just eight years ago and the ones in Colombia, Ireland, Peru and Spain ended only recently. But the success stories are few  new conflicts have arisen to take their place, claiming thousands of lives.
A semblance of peace has been achieved in some conflict zones, but this peace needs to be enforced by an impartial party, lest the warring factions begin hostilities again. Who better than the UN for this unenviable task In fact, peacekeeping is one of the biggest tasks of the UN today.
On May 29 in 1948, the first UN peacekeeping mission began operations in Palestine. Today, the world honours the UNs Blue Helmets for their unwavering commitment to keeping the peace. The theme for the 2017 International Day of UN Peacekeepers which falls today is Investing in Peace around the World. Yes, peace is an investment for the future, because everything that is not possible with war becomes possible with peace. We in Sri Lanka know about this than anyone else.
Peacekeeping is an investment in global peace, security, and prosperity. It is a flagship enterprise of the UN that deploys more than 113,000 military, police and civilian personnel in 16 peacekeeping operations on four continents. Currently, UN peacekeeping operations receive contributions of military and police personnel from 124 Member States. This impressive number reflects strong global confidence in the value of UN peacekeeping. Their efforts on behalf of the international community are one of the most concrete expressions of the UN Charters determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Peacekeepers help bring peace and stability to war-torn societies around the world every day.
Sri Lankan soldiers too are involved in peacekeeping missions in Haiti. Even more than peacekeeping per se, it is a flexible, evolving instrument that brings together political, security and technical tools to assist countries make the difficult transition from conflict to peace.
Peacekeeping is a difficult job and occasionally, peacekeepers have to make the Supreme Sacrifice for peace in a strange land where they know no one and have no connections with. But peace somewhere is like having peace everywhere and they have not died in vain. Today, the UN Member States will honour more than 3,500 peacekeepers who have lost their lives serving under the UN flag since 1948, including 117 last year alone. They work amidst threats and grave risks - peacekeepers continue to come under attack from armed groups and terrorists, including incidents in Mali, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan.
Among the valiant UN peacekeeping personnel who received the Dag Hammarskjld Medal for fallen UN Peacekeepers this year was Sri Lankan Army Warrant Officer ASP Pushpakumara of MINUSTAH (UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti) who was killed in January 2015. At the UN Headquarters in New York, the Secretary-General presided over a wreath-laying ceremony in honour of all peacekeepers who lost their lives while serving under the UN flag. Incidentally, MINUSTAHs mandate will end in October this year, when a smaller successor peacekeeping mission focusing on the rule of law will begin.
Over time, peacekeeping has grown from simply monitoring ceasefires to protecting civilians, disarming ex-combatants, protecting human rights, promoting the rule of law, supporting free and fair elections, minimizing the risk of land-mines and much more. They have also strived to ensure that women are represented in peace processes, political life, and in branches of government including in uniformed services.
All of these efforts are fundamental investments in building lasting peace. Every mission aims to save lives, prevent mass atrocities, set the stage for peace and then close. In Cte dIvoire, the United Nations will complete the peacekeeping phase of its engagement with the country at the end of June after successfully assisting the country in restoring peace and stability following the post-2010 election crisis. The UNMIL peacekeeping mission in Liberia, which has made progress in restoring peace, security and stability in the country, will end in March 2018.
Here is a staggering fact: Despite the breadth of its operations, the UN global peacekeeping budget is less than one half of one percent of global military spending which exceeds US$ 1,700 billion annually. The world will be a much better place if countries can spend less on defence and more on peace. This is the biggest challenge that we face in a world driven apart by conflict and terrorism. The successful cessation of hostilities in several countries proves that peace is indeed possible of there is a commitment by the parties to the conflict. We should ultimately strive to create a world that no longer needs UN peacekeepers  this would be the biggest tribute that we can pay to the UN and its ideal of lasting world peace.

Lasting solutions for buildings to last
Everyone dreams of a house of their own. However, S. Radha who has lived and owned a luxurious apartment for the last 10 years in Wellawatte is yet to receive the title deeds for his apartment. Radha is not alone in not having a legal right to his dwelling and is one of many in and around Colombo struggling to get housing deeds from their builders.
Unauthorized structures and illegal building practices have been a bane in Colombo for some time now. When the unauthorized sections of the Excellency Building in Wellawatte collapsed recently, it highlighted one of the many issues in our poorly regulated construction sector.
K. Wijeyaratne, a resident of Bambalapitiya claimed that the entire responsibility of the collapse in Wellawatte as well as the environmental and physical harm caused by unauthorized constructions in and around Colombo lay in the hands of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and the Urban Development Authority (UDA) since it was their duty to inspect the quality and the condition of the buildings.
Measures taken by UDA
Jagath Munasinghe
The authority of taking legal action against the owners of unauthorized buildings is currently vested upon the Urban Development Authority (UDA). They have the power to inspect the suitability and feasibility of the constructions. Yet, neither the CMC nor any government institution has responded with any report on the quality and the standards of buildings so far.
UDA Chairman Jagath Munasinghe said, in mid-2016, a survey was done in Southern Colombo (Bambalapitiya, Wellawatte, Kirulapone and Pamankada) and identified many unauthorized constructions.
We have identified around 2,000 buildings that have violated regulations. There were a huge number of buildings that have never come to the relevant authorities for any approval, he said.
CMC Commissioner V. K. Anurain meanwhile said that he had not given the opportunity anyone to build any unauthorized constructions since he took office in 2015.
Anura explained that it was difficult for the CMC to get involved in each and every unauthorized construction taking place given the limited number of staff they had. Therefore, he requested the public and the citizens to inform and reveal any kind of unauthorized constructions taking place so that they could proceed with legal action against the accused.
Based on an outcome of the survey conducted by them, the UDA has identified thousands of unauthorized constructions within the city of Colombo. The issuing of license for constructions is carried out by the UDA whereas the provincial institutions obtain authority from the UDA to proceed with the arrangements.
Munasinghe said unauthorized constructions do not require the time consuming and complicated procedure of obtaining numerous approvals, licenses and certificates as well as paying taxes for utilities and complying with administrative rules with regard to the basic characteristics of the building itself.
Unauthorized constructions vary in nature. Some have illegal ownership to land and constructed not according to the building regulations. Some have illegal ownership to land but constructed as per regulations and some have legal ownership but constructed not according to the building regulations, he said.
Being a gazetted area, Colombo is subject to the regulations of the Urban Development Authority Law and all constructions should comply with the legal provisions; if not, they are identified as unauthorized housing constructions.
Munasinghe said, in 2016 December, they took 200 buildings as a sample to analyze the kind of violations that had taken place.
Only 10 percent of them can be regularized or given approval with minor changes. Others needed to be demolished or subjected to major reconstructions. The owners of these constructions forwarded applications seeking for approval, he said.
According to the UDAs rough estimation, there are around 10,000 unauthorized constructions. Those buildings were constructed without any required approvals and they do not have proper documents either.
Munasighe explained that development includes subdivision of a land even if it needs to be divided into smaller plots. Developmental purposes could be residential, extending the ground or the upper floor, reconstruction and changing the purpose of initial construction. For all these activities, the builders should obtain the approval or permit to commence constructions.
Since 2017, the UDA has withdrawn some powers vested on Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas related to the approval for developments. Earlier, around 1985, the planning and enforcement powers were vested with the local authorities. But again in 2017, the UDA withdrew some of these powers from the local authorities.
The powers include the approval to subdivide a land over 40 perches, any building that has over 4,000 sq ft, a building over four floors, a construction that has an effect on the environment such as a petrol shed or factories, any building that is constructed in sacred areas and UNSCO heritage sites, he said.
He said the application was available in the UDA website and the builders had the option to hand it over it to the head office or one of the regional offices. For small development purposes, builders can get the approval from the local authorities.
Once the builders submit the planning approval, one of our officers will inspect the site and then it is forwarded to the planning committee. Afterwards, if everything is in line, they will be given a building permit. The permit is valid for a period of one year and it can be renewed three times. If the builder exceeds the time period, he has to get a special permission or a new permit. Once the construction is completed the builder has to request the local authority for the Certificate of Conformity (Compliance Certificate), to approve that the builder has constructed in line with the plan initially submitted, he said.
Struggle to obtain ownerships of apartments
Munasinghe said if the initial plan had changed, the relevant authority would not issue a compliance certificate and added that the people who are purchasing the apartments also have an important role to play.
Any person who is planning to purchase an apartment (pre-sale), they should check whether the builder has the planning and continuously monitor whether the builder is constructing according to the plan. If a person is aspiring to buy an apartment that is already built, check whether they have the Compliance Certificate, he said.
Radha said it has been 10 years since she bought an apartment in Wellawatte but has not received her deeds yet.
I spoke to the builder several times but he never gave me a proper answer. He promised us that we will be getting the deeds this year, she said.
She added that the builder has made changes to the initial plan that was proposed.
M. Wickremasinghe, another resident of Wellawatte has been occupying his apartment for the last six years without a deed. Wellawatte has the highest construction of apartment buildings in the country.
We paid the full amount to the builder when I bought this apartment. It all happened in a hurry, so I blindly trusted the builder. I dont know what will happen to us, saidWickremasinghe.
The residential owners also claimed that there was an increase in the number of construction companies as well.
Munasinghe stressed on the need to have a proper monitoring system.
When we receive applications for approval, we have decided to monitor the constructions every six months to check whether the constructions are taking place according to the approved plan. It will prevent the large scale demolition of buildings, he said.
He said the UDA started this from February this year and it will continue to carry out surveys on a priority basis to target critical locations such as canal reservations and main roads.
The bigger survey will be carried out by the Census and Statistics Department. That is a long term plan and that will include all the details of the family as well, not only the constructions. But our focus will be on unauthorized constructions. It will be a database, he said.
Munasinghe explained that once the builder requests for compliance certificate, the UDA requests them to submit a document from the architect and structural engineer giving an assurance that the building was constructed according to the plan and the structural stability. According to that, the relevant authority will issue the compliance certificate.
The UDA informed the owners to submit whatever the approval certificates that they have. Once we get them, we would check to identify what kind of regulations that they have violated. If they dont submit any documents, we monitor the construction and if it was an unauthorized construction, we inform them to demolish the building in seven days. If they dont, we will file a case in courts, he said.
Residential apartments and high rise commercial buildings are on the rise everyday in Colombo. However, the relevant authorities are yet to find a solution to ensure that all buildings stick to building regulations. While development is encouraged by the government on the one hand, measures to ensure feasibility and the stability of constructions still remain a question.

The Literary World Says Goodbye To Denis Johnson
Emily Temple Emily Temple is an associate editor at LitHub.
Massively influential and widely adored author Denis Johnson died Wednesday at the age of 67. He is best known for his collection Jesus Son, a book that has been passed hand to hand among young writers like a secret password since its publication in 1999.
Johnson has the aura of a cult author, and he would be described as such, were he not so thoroughly celebrated: hes the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Whiting Award; in 2007, he won the National Book Award for Tree of Smoke, and in 2012 was a Pulitzer finalist for Train Dreams, my own personal favorite of his work. He never stopped writing, either; Random House will be publishing his new short story collection, The Largesse of the Sea Maiden, in early 2018.
Today, writers, editors, and readers have been mourning his death by sharing not only their sadness and memories, but also their favorite lines and selections from his workwhich is probably the best way to remember him. Honestly, Twitter has never been so good. If you do nothing else, read Denis Johnson today. Start with the below, or follow Johnsons lead and forge your own path.

Mahela Jayawardene to coach Khulna Titans

Mahela Jayawardenehas effectively ended his playing career in Bangladesh after being signed for two seasons as head coach of BPL franchise Khulna Titans. Jayawardene featured in two games for Dhaka Dynamites alongside his former Sri Lankan team-mate Kumar Sangakkara in 2016.
Jayawardene's signing comes a week after he coached Mumbai Indians to an IPL crown in his first season with the franchise. The former Sri Lankan captain takes over the mantle from Stuart Law, the former Australia batsman who recently took over as head coach of West Indies.
"I enjoyed playing in the BPL last year and that has given me a great insight into what will be required to be successful in the 2017 tournament," Jayawardene said in a statement. "BPL is an exciting tournament for Bangladesh, as well the region as a whole, and I am excited to be partnering with one of the most respected and forward-thinking franchises."
Kazi Inam Ahmed, Khulna's managing director, said that the franchise can only benefit from the expertise of a cricketer of Jayawardene's stature. "We are excited to have Mahela Jayawardane join the Titans as head coach for next two editions of BPL," Ahmed said. "He has always been a great leader on the field and has won big tournaments for Sri Lanka.
"We were thrilled to see him win the IPL recently as the coach of the Mumbai Indians. I am sure all of us Titans will learn a lot from him and the tournament will be enriched by his presence."
The 2017 edition is slated to start on November 4, with Sylhet likely to join the ranks and make it an eight-team event. The players' draft is likely to be held on September 16 in Dhaka.

Messi leads Barca to third King's Cup win in a row
MADRID, Saturday - Lionel Messi and Neymar showed their pedigree as Barcelona outclassed a determined Alaves side 3-1 on Saturday to win the King's Cup for a third successive year, allowing coach Luis Enrique to leave the club on a high.
Messi curled in the opener in the 30th minute from outside the area following clever link up play with Neymar after Alaves, who were playing in their first domestic final, had struck the inside of the post. The Basque side drew level three minutes later when Theo Hernandez fizzed a spectacular free kick into the top corner although Neymar restored Barca's lead a minute before halftime, bundling in Andre Gomes's pass from close range after starting the move with a dazzling run down the left.
Paco Alcacer further stretched the Catalans lead two minutes later killing off Alaves hopes of a first trophy in their 96-year history and delivering Barca's 29th King's Cup, the ninth trophy of Luis Enrique's three-year tenure.
Nine trophies in a club like Barca, who have had a glorious decade, means that the players have been at their very best and I was able to enjoy it. These trophies were down to the players and their ambition, Luis Enrique told reporters.
It's great to finish the season with a trophy and not go home empty handed. We've won another trophy, but the team gave their best in every game.
I feel satisfied about a job well done and I can't wait to rest, to be with my family and enjoy some well deserved holiday.
Luis Enrique said he had no plans for the immediate future and is expected to take a sabbatical year before plotting his next move. Former Athletic Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde is set to be named as his successor on Monday, according to reports in the Spanish media.

Barca were searching for one piece of silverware to end a disappointing campaign after surrendering the Liga title to Real Madrid and exiting the Champions League in the quarter-finals to Juventus and were without prolific striker Luis Suarez and defender Sergi Roberto through suspension.  Agencies

Moving beyond weapons
Eradicating terrorism and winning the confidence of the international community is a huge achievement for the progress of our country. At the end of a conflict it will lead to another conflict.
It is a possibility, but we must keep in mind the sacrifices we have made over the last 30 years to overcome this menace and it is the responsibility of the people in power to take appropriate action to take our nation to the next level.
Our role as Security Forces officers has been fulfilled with absolute commitment and huge sacrifices. It was possible due to the fact that we had goal oriented officers leading the battle. On the same line political leaders, too, have to implement a plan so that, all our commitment and the sacrifices made over the years bring positive results, our Tour of Duty is completed with absolute positive results and it should be an example to the present leading actors to follow.
It is important for us to scrutinize the capabilities, commitment, ruthlessness and the determination of the terror group.
They invented many methods for the first time in the world, that was used to destroy human life, property etc. and improved on periodically and made things really hard for the Security Forces and the people.
Their main weapon and most effective tool in their armoury was the knowledge and the ability to use explosives. They introduced various types of IEDs (Improvise Explosive Devices) to attack their targets.
From time devices to suicide bombers was the most successful systems they used. Since we (STF) mastered the art of handling explosives under Israel experts we were ahead of the terror groups to a certain extent, and we managed to identify, neutralize their attacks and had success.
Suicide can be classified into three types.
Anomic, Egoistic and Altruistic
A suicide bomber has to be trained and he believes that his act has meaning and will lead to secondary gain.
Anomic suicide is due to social or personal disorganisation, Egoistic suicide occurs when you feel alienated or separated from society, altruistic suicide reflects opposition of Egoistic suicide.
But they went on to introduce various ruse tactics and methods to get to their targets, eg. First ever human bomb that killed Rajiv Gandhi.
The suicide bomber who killed Rajiv Gandhi had a different type of a suicide jacket invented by the terror group at least there were 15 members for this operation (all committed suicide during investigation).
Probable position of assassin of Rajiv Gandhi at the moment of explosion (dummy)
Vest jacket  waist belt
The explosive charge spread over the vest on her (assassins) back was not a simple flat bed, but had taken the contour of her back. While the right arm was engaged to activate the bomb, she would have to be in a bend down posture, as if to touch Rajiv Gandhis feet in a classic obligatory choreography of Indian social behaviour, in order to explore.
For the person of higher statue to bend slightly over a person touching their feet in respectful manner.
This would have really hit the full force of the explosion as he was very close to the main charge.
Jacket belts configuration was not that of a conventional type jacket, but the combination of two separate flaps, resembling apron hanging in front and the other on the back. Very similar to a life jacket with a strap from the rear to strap around the waist binding both sides.
The steel balls embedded in the explosive acted as missiles, in addition, the bone fragments of the body of the assassins also acted as missiles. These pieces of bone fragments of the assassin vertebral and rib bones would drive at high speed missiles to hit the target in front. That is why the Indian expert (Dr. Chandrashekaram) identified this explosive device as the first human bomb that was produced in the world. This in fact was the capability of this ruthless terrorist organisation.
It is very important to realize the amount of planning and careful launch of the whole operation to perfection.
Destruction of LTTE
Destruction of the LTTE military network was the greatest achievement of Sri Lanka in our time. We have taken total control of all areas, which were under the LTTE and taken precautions to protect our innocent people and their property. The fight against terrorism will be long and a difficult exercise, where we have to be on the alert at all given times without dropping our guard.
All of us have a role in upholding the security of the Nation.
It is true that, security operations have brought immense success and people breathe freedom today, but we have to be fully aware that this was an ideological struggle.
Those detained, rehabilitated members by the security agencies need to be made to realize that they were misguided in their understanding of the history of this country and we have to raise awareness of others, who are closely connected to them and in general the Tamil populace, so that they do not also succumb to these radical ideologists again in the future.
Counselling is the key when it comes to rehabilitation, because they have become terrorists by believing their ideologist who preached to them, mothers and wives also play a major role as they are the closest to the effected members.
You also have to do and in-depth research of the history and look at the cause for terrorism.
The effort to inspire and enlighten Tamil minds is a great challenge with profound consequences, not only for Tamil societies, but for all people.
The energy needed to transform the Tamil society by regenerating the essential Tamil culture values and peaceful change and respect for others must arise and be natured within the Tamil community. Majority community too, should understand this challenge and have to make every effort to resurrect the damage done to the trust and confidence of two communities.
Young people are a crucial wedge of a nations development. Their input and involvement therefore is greatly needed. They are social actors of change and as the saying goes youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow, but also the partners of today.
Rehabilitation of detainees who participated in terrorist attacks has presented a model for efficiency in war on terrorism. For any future effective strategy to combat terrorism the challenge is to win the minds and hearts of terrorists and provide with new opportunities to act as citizens in a democratic society.
We have faced a disease in which political grievances is infected with an ideological sanction for violence. Against this disease a professionally planned rehabilitation system offers both inoculation and cure. That is why we had to give special thought and plan out a very effective goal oriented plan implemented locally and internationally (embassies here and overseas have a major role to play).
We have to get the Tamil populance and Diaspora to realize that if they do not act and come forward there could be grave consequences for the whole Tamil community again. They have a major role to play in upholding the security of our nation and rightful understanding and application of results oriented plan with commitment.
Radical ideology is dangerous. All must collectively be motivated with a single intention. If we can get every one believe and intention formula including the detainees rehabilitated members they, too must share the believe and intention. They have to be aware that if they still pursue their wrong ways they will continuously cause misfortune not only to themselves but to their families and community.
In my experience, even a suicide cadre can be transformed back to society if you really reason out and convince him that he has made a mistake, that human life is the most important thing in the world. I managed to convince Prabhakarans personal bodyguard after long interrogation, and he changed his stance and even took me to Prabhakarans hideout in the Mullewaikkal area in 2009 where we recovered Prabhakarans personal weapon M16 with a grenade launcher fitted to it and many other important documents etc.
When you analyze countering terrorism, methods used by various other countries and our own experience, the identifying of root cause of terrorism is very important. Failure of the economy, no future for the youth, lack of power and hope for the future, encourage, upgrading the education system, standardization should be fair to all and equal employment.
This has given the advantage to the extremist to recruit. This situation in the North and East was well planned strategy to get the people to suffer without any other option, but to join their cause.
Forming a council with eminent personnel to undo the convoluted thinking that led them to believe the distorted history. We have to identify people who will be able to untie this racial knot.
It was Prabhakaran who was controlling the network. Now it has been broken. We must make sure unlike the IS terrorists who have transformed into independent units and operate separately, former LTTE members should not get the chance to merge again, this has to be closely monitored.
There should be a solid foundation for widows to resurrect their families and the future. It is one of the main requirements at this juncture.
The Government and other organisations involved in rehabilitation have to work hand in hand to stop terror taking root again. It is very important that to make the people in North and East comfortable and for them to act as citizens in a democratic society. Authorities must encourage Tamil community to form an ideological counter strategy groups to deal with the extremist ideological threat in their respective areas.
Former militant leaders
Church, Kovils played a major role in the past as terrorist movement made use of them, we will also have to use the clergy, school principles, teachers, community leaders, youth leaders, specially the former militant leaders who has joined the main stream of politics as they are the people who led the movement in the past to create this situation.
Abraham Lincoln said: The probability that we may fail in this struggle ought not to deter us from support our cause we believe to be just. We have to keep this in mind.
Multilateral cooperation plan to apprehend this problem have to be implemented. Human development approach is the key to success.
It is very much evident that over the years Tamil political leadership have been ineffective. Some of them have misled the youth for their survival and gain. One wonders, whether the present Tamil politicians in the North and East are acceptable to the present generations and the masses. The political leadership to these areas has to be emerged from the present society and they have to be people who have won the confidence of the majority and especially the youth.
Due to the absolute commitment and years of sacrifice of the security forces and other support services for the last so many years, the environment is stable and safe for all political parties.
If they launch their campaign with commitment unlike in the past, they can win the confidence of the masses and they should not miss this opportunity as it is a rare chance.
One wonders after the liberation of the North and East in 2009 whether we missed a golden opportunity to formulate and propose a reasonable devolution package, as the ground situation was conducive at that time. Furthermore, they even appointed a hardcore former terrorist as a Deputy Leader of a recognized Sinhala political party and another as Chief Minister of the Eastern Province. This was acceptable for the majority at that time and there were no protests and didnt we miss an opportunity to push through the devolution package at that time.
But we will never get that opportunity again, whatever the devolution package, majority community will never support that and it will be a very testing challenge for the political leadership.
Keep the federal and unitary system suggestions aside, give top priority and concentrate on developing these areas and give hope to the people. They have a future and their children have a future.
If this is done as a goal oriented plan to produce results with absolute commitment by using the correct people to the correct slots (we have to learn from the military victory), north and east will be the most productive economy hub of the country that will contribute to the progress of the country.
A comprehensive nation building programme is most important in the agenda to counter terrorism. All development work under taken in these areas should give the confidence to the people, that they are partners of the development programme and where they will feel comfortable, and believe in the system where they have got their due place.
Transparency and administrators with honest and committed background will strengthen the plan. Specially the role of GAA / Division Secretaries of these districts. I believe it is a must that their past and present record will have to be assessed and personnel with result oriented plans should replace the ineffective ones, so that officers with vision and commitment at this juncture will produce results.
Education played a major role, where the standardization to enter the universities was a key issue. This will have to be looked into in a practical manner with equal opportunities to every student. The present situation has opened the doors to rectify whatever the shortcomings in the past.
Winning the confidence of developed countries is a key factor in this issue. Without the support of the developed countries international terrorism will not prosper. The possibility of forming an international/diplomatic committees to support the government plan will be of immense benefit to our country.
Tamil Diaspora and internal community
As far as the militants were concerned they were successful in their mission to dominate the areas in the North due to the fact that Tamil Diaspora and international community support which they enjoyed, over the years.
Tamil Diaspora, which played a major role in the international arena should realize, what they have contributed in the past to destroy their own community and their assets in the North and East by providing funds to purchase weapons, explosives, ammunitions, etc. had they pumped that money for the development of their so called areas, people in those areas could not, have suffered.
Whatever the cause terrorism is not the answer, since it is a human problem.
Since the present situation is very much conducive for a bright future, implementing of all plans have to be transparent.
Tamil Diaspora and internal community involvement in the development work will be a plus point, as with their funding and support only that the militants were able to bring so much of pain and destruction to their kith and kin in the past. They should realize this, and compensate. They will not have another chance and every one should understand that and support the President to achieve peace and harmony, as he is a leader who is very practical and absolutely committed to bring peace to all communities in the country.
Developed countries, UN member countries, must realize that to counter global terrorism in third world countries there should be sound economic development in those countries. Developed countries can easily come forward and offer FTA etc. to countries like Sri Lanka and show their genuine concern to combat global terrorism.
The biggest achievement is the international support, recognition the President has earned all over the world. This situation has to be analyzed properly and plan out an effective strategy to get the best from the international community as we are fully aware that without the support of the international community, terrorism in the third world countries will never prosper.
The President has earned a golden opportunity, where none of the former leaders had in the past. With a strong committee consists of professionals, experts, diplomats with experience and reputation to guide him and the country to make use of an effective programme to harness the international support, so that our country will be economically and security wise will be strong and that will strengthen the hands of the head of the state and he will go down in the history as the leader who marshalled our countries destiny to prosperity.
We have achieved two important goals to completely eradicate terrorism.
a. Destroying the terrorist military power
b. Winning the support of the international community  use it
When you analyze the past and present, Police will have to play a major role in the North and East. They are the people who have the opportunity to interact with the masses. Winning the confidence of the masses by understanding their day to day problems and assisting them when they need support, protection and help, will be the key to win the confidence of the Tamil speaking population. Effective policing will definitely produce results and if they are able to win them over, the years long mistrust will be diluted.
Every policeman in these areas should be able to communicate in Tamil, as it was the biggest barrier which led to suspicion and distrust. At the same time, local Police should have a very efficient, committed, intelligence units in every Police station.
For a successful security system, and smooth function of the Government Administration, key is intelligence. Since the police officers in these areas are paid a special allowance compared to other areas, they should be fully aware of their tasks for which Police Department should subject them to a comprehensive training programme, compiled with all data information and methods, to meet the demand in a post conflict arena, which they have to adopt during this transition period in a conflict zone. I believe, will be of immense value for the future of this country.

N Korea fires Scud missile into sea, its third test in three weeks

North Korea has fired a short-range ballistic missile, the third apparently successful test in as many weeks.
The Scud flew about 450km (280 miles) before landing in Japanese waters, prompting Japan to lodge a protest.
Observers say the tests indicate the North is making progress towards missiles capable of carrying warheads.
The North has repeatedly defied a UN resolution banning all nuclear and missile activity, and has ramped up its tests in recent months.
The US Pacific Command said the missile was launched from Wonsan in North Korea and flew for about six minutes before landing.
Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that the missile landed in an area between Japan's Sado and Oki islands, in their exclusive economic zone.
A spokesman for South Korea's military said the missile reached an altitude of 120km, and "an analysis is under way on the specific number" of missiles fired, indicating that more than one could have been launched.
The launch comes a day after North Korea's state media reported the test of a new anti-aircraft weapon system, and released pictures of leader Kim Jong-un watching the test.
North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range Scud missiles developed by the Soviet Union. Modified versions of the Scud missiles can have a range of 1,000km.
The previous two launches were of medium to long range missiles, both of which the North claimed as "successful" tests.
The first of those launches was hailed by Pyongyang as a new type of rocket capable of carrying a nuclear warhead - it was a demonstration of the North's longest-range nuclear-capable weapon yet.
Pyongyang has been testing its missiles at an unprecedented pace and experts believe it is steadily edging towards the test of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the mainland United States.
North Korea says its weapons programme is necessary to counter US aggression.

Oh! Oh! What Hogwash!
We are greatly indebted to a very popular TV channel which aired a clip, describing it as a Luxury Car Show. The cars belonging to our hardly working ministers were seen driving into the Presidential Secretariat, for swearing in before the President. It is unbelievable that these are the very same characters who begged for our vote in order to see to OUR well-being, have absolutely no conscience to acquire and flaunt such fabulously expensive cars.
The make and cost of each vehicle was clearly indicated on the TV screen. These vehicles were in the range of Rs 25 - Rs 45 million. As to how they earned this kind of money within the space of two years is mind boggling indeed or in all probability these are expensive gifts to them in return for their support It is very obvious they are very efficient in looking after themselves.
A businessman cum minister had the audacity to declare that ministers spent only Rs7.5 million to purchase a vehicle. What hogwash is this and whom is he trying to hoodwink The Public Finance Committee should have put a stop to this unbelievable spending on luxury vehicles a long time ago. Anyway, its better late than never.
A so called LASER pandal (world record of course) with a seemingly ugly looking white cloth was on the Galle Face Green. There were banners with the ministers name in bold print surrounding this monstrosity, and sacrilegiously placed beside the sacred Buddhist flag.
This was an insult to Buddhism, purely to glorify himself. We cannot forget the fiasco of the Tallest Christmas Tree in the World, a couple of months ago. These are very costly and cheap jokes, which are heaped on us the citizens, in order to glorify themselves.
We heard about the colossal amount spent by the Chief Minister Western Province on three overseas jaunts. What did the country gain by these expensive trips Was he able to find a solution to the most pressing problem of garbage management and disposal
Why cant the present lot of corrupt ministers and officials at least take a leaf from President Premadasas book He did make mistakes but one cannot forget his dedication and contribution towards the development and well-being of the people. He made the minimum number of foreign trips and harnessed all available assets for the well-being of Sri Lanka.
What about the Dengue epidemic that is raging There should have been a separate ministry to tackle this deadly problem which is expected to get worse with the monsoon. But, the new ministries with new names have no significance towards OUR crying needs. The constant strikes by the doctors, who hold the poor patients to ransom, are just to satisfy their perverse mind set. They have forgotten that each and every citizen has paid for their education - and is this the manner in which they show their gratitude
Every single person in government should remember that this seemingly comfortable BUBBLE they are in at present is temporary and will burst, as it did two years ago for THAT brazen regime. Perhaps they should all go back to school and acquire at least an O/L pass What remedy is there for absolute power that has absolutely corrupted these puny personalities
A suggested solution is a genuinely caring leadership creating a satisfied majority...as in Singapore As in Brunei, where the leader has everything money can buy but his citizens are cared for, untaxed etc And Dubai among others Oh! Sri Lanka!

Over 1.5 million smoke 11 cigarettes daily in Sri Lanka

A total of 1.5 million people in Sri Lanka smoke 11 million cigarettes daily. The percentage of smokers above 15 years in Sri Lanka is 15 percent,National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo today in connection with World No Tobacco Day to be held on May 31, he said although Bhutan has banned cigarettes, 17 percent above 15 years smoke in Bhutan.
The percentage is 60 in China and around 20 percent in the West, Abeykoon added.
According to Dr. Abeykoon, at present, smoking in Sri Lanka has gone down significantly when comparing with the situation before 10 or 15 years.
Annually, between 20,000 and 25,000 Sri Lankans die from smoking and smoking related health issues.
Ten percent of them die due to passive smoking and third-hand smoking.  
Cabinet papers were presented in connection with banning the sale of cigarettes within a radius of 500 metres from a school and to ban selling single cigarettes.
Sri Lanka will introduce plain packaging for cigarettes in the future.
Already, around 11 countries have introduced plain packaging for cigarettes. Tobacco cultivation in Sri Lanka was reduced to around 300 hectares, he added.

Own your dream castle for free!
If youve ever dreamed of having your own castle, nows your chance. Italy is giving away 103 run-down properties, including villas, inns, and castles for free.
That means anyone can start building their personal versions of Winterfell, Casterly Rock, or The Pyke. However, theres just one catch. The countrys State Property Agency expects anyone who gets a free castle (or any other of the 103 objects) to commit to restoring it so it can be used as a tourist destination.
Whether the property becomes a hotel, spa, restaurant, or something else is up to the new owner to decide.
The project will promote and support the development of the slow tourism sector, Roberto Reggi from the State Property Agency told The Local. The goal is for private and public buildings which are no longer used to be transformed into facilities for pilgrims, hikers, tourists, and cyclists. Authorities also hope this plan will relieve some of the strain on the countrys most popular and overcrowded areas (like Venice).
The deadline for applications is June 26. Successful applicants will get an initial nine-year period to work on their project, with the possibility of extending it for another nine years afterwards.
If, however, your application is denied, dont worry  Italy plans to give out 200 objects the same way within the next two years.

Public service: work space and working habits
Government spend a huge quantum on a large public service at present .These include good buildings, computers, air conditioned at times etc. Public service generally sticks to rules and procedures. In urban cities traffic snarls are adding to the woes of the public servants and public at large leading to calls for varied public service working hours. What this article asks and presents is ways of working which is different from the current practices.
Service will be more efficient and a better place to work, where people focus on outcomes not process, are empowered by technology, work flexibly and cost-effectively, collaborate more effectively with other teams in their own department and other departments and maximise productivity and innovation while reducing environmental impact.
Smart Working is about taking a comprehensive and strategic approach to modernising working practices across Government.
The outcomes of adopting Smart Working
Greater productivity and services delivered more effectively, the costs and environmental impacts of work reduced as space is shared and used more intensively, people having more choice about, when where and how they work, supported and connected by effective and appropriate use of technology and people have the opportunity to lead more balanced and healthier lives.
In many cases, employees will blend different smart/flexible working options, according to the need of the tasks in hand. Enabling this involves a substantial move away from the idea that an individual applies for and is granted a single particular alternative work style that is set in stone. All the options are important in terms of equal opportunities and diversity.
Rethinking meetings
A common complaint within the Public Service is of having too many meetings or of a meetings culture.
New ways of working provide an opportunity to replace physical meetings by online interaction, replace formal meetings by shorter interactions, in person, online or mixed physical/virtual. Reduce the number of people at a meeting for the whole session, calling people in remotely when needed, or having them primed to respond to questions by instant messaging if needed. Managers should consider setting targets for reducing the numbers of meetings, to liberate more time for other kinds of work.
Smart Working is based on the following principles
 Work takes place at the most effective locations and at the most effective times, respecting the needs of the task, the customer, the individual and the team
 Simplified collaboration and connectivity virtually everywhere means sharing information and working with others regardless of location
 Space is allocated to activities, not individuals and not on the basis of seniority
 A Flexibility First approach where flexibility is the norm rather than the exception. Everyone is assumed to be capable of Smart Working without assumptions being made about people or roles
 The processes people are asked to work with are continuously challenged to make sure they are fit for purpose
 Managing performance focuses on results and outcomes rather than presence
Flexible place and flexible time
Smart Working incorporates the full range of flexible working options. These broadly fall into two areas: flexible place and flexible time.
1. Flexible place options include:
 Mobile working: Employees who work in many places need to be empowered and equipped to work when travelling, in public settings, and touching down in offices as needed.
 Sharing space in the office: Employees do not have a permanent desk, but choose a work setting appropriate to the task in hand.
 Working from other offices: Staff may choose to work from other offices  offices belonging to the organization, partner/client offices, as appropriate.
 Working as virtual teams: To prevent relocation or frequent travel, staff work flexibly as virtual teams, using online communications and collaboration techniques.
 Working from home: When employees regularly work from home it is typically for 1-2 days per week. Some roles may be based at home full-time. More mobile staff may work using home as a base rather than, or as much as, using the office as a base.
2. Flexible time options include:
 Flexi-time: employees can vary start and finish times. Sometimes this is limited by a core hours requirement.
 Time off in lieu (TOIL): TOIL is a form of flexible hours working that allows hours to be varied across days, by paying back extra hours worked on one day with time off on other days.
 Annualised hours: employees are contracted annually to work a set number of hours, which can be worked flexibly over the 12 month period. This is useful for coping with peaks and troughs in work, as well as for meeting personal requirements.
 Compressed working weeks: employees work their standard working hours in fewer days  e.g. one weeks hours worked in four days, or two weeks worked in nine days. There are a range of patterns of varying complexity.
 Term-time working: this enables staff who are parents to work around school terms and holidays.
 Part-time working: It is typically associated with parenting responsibilities, but surveys indicate this is an option of interest to older workers who are thinking in terms of phased retirement.
 Jobshare: this is a particular form of part-time working, where two (or occasionally more) people share a full-time job.
 Self-rostering: teams take control of their own shift patterns and cover arrangements, which can be especially valuable in roles that are very location-specific or have a hands on requirement.
 Career breaks: the option to have a career break or sabbatical to pursue professional or personal development
Desk-sharing and clear desk protocols
The following are suggested protocols that can be adopted or adapted to ensure that space-sharing works effectively:
1. Use of space is determined on the basis of the activities being carried out.
2. Space is not to be allocated on the basis of seniority, habit or personal preference.
3. Where team priority zones are designated, this should be seen as non-exclusive team-space, available also to other employees of the organisation as the need arises.
4. Non-team members working in specified team areas should be made to feel welcome. This will help to break down silos and encourage cross team working.
5 If plans change, rethink space requirements and move to a more appropriate work setting.
6. If a desk or other work area is to be left unoccupied for more than 2 hours the desk should be cleared for use by others.

## Title: A real delight when uptight cops are polite

A real delight when uptight cops are polite
For almost four decades or more a succession of police top brass have crafted initiatives aimed at improving community relations, usually coinciding with a public outcry over discourtesy or police brutality.
In responding to and addressing the question of conduct, of how cops ought to behave towards citizens, the police hierarchy claims they lose sleep over concerns about the manners of members of the department. They say the importance of good manners and courtesy has been instilled in every member of the force before and after recruitment.
For most law-abiding citizens, direct encounters with the police are rare occurrences or intermittent at the most. The vast majority of Sri Lankans will never be arrested. But when passing encounters with the police go wrong, they can leave a lasting impression on the civic mindset and can do as much damage to police-public relations as much as a highly publicised case of police brutality.
Process-orientated standards
There are scores of causes why the police find it difficult to interact with the community they are supposed to serve and protect. The police have to deal with the public at diverse levels. They do so individually, as a group organisation and as public players.
When it looks as if law enforcement stands for the security of the area which they police, there is bound to be common accord. But when the coppers do not correlate to such thinking there is bound to be disgruntlement and discord. Rude and dismissive behaviour by the police shows a great disdain toward the public whose personnel are expected to have sworn to serve and protect. Many fear that such disrespectful behaviour can potentially lead to more harmful acts against the public.
A breakdown in relations between community members and police can lead to feelings of distrust, resentment and fear. Programmes are vital to help build the trusting relationships necessary for long-term change. People from diverse backgrounds develop trust, understand each others' experiences and work together on solutions.
Clearly it is the responsibility of the police to ensure the safety of citizens by working towards preventing criminal acts and enforcing the law. They are accountable to the community and its evaluation of police accomplishments and failures in thwarting, combating and solving crimes. They are also expected to be frank, polite and transparent when dealing with the public and the media in all spheres of their operations, excepting of course divulging sensitive information requiringsecrecy based on national security needs.
Different schools of thought view police procedure contrastingly and have varying concepts of the priorities and objectives of law enforcement and the criminal justice system. The cops are also expected to adhere to a wide variety of process-orientated standards.
These include certain key aspects such as integrity, which in effect means avoidance of corruption and abuse of power for personal gain. Also fairness is a key issue in treating people equally or equitably, regardless of race, sex, or social standing. And of course there is civility because treating people with respect is vital for its image.
Unfairly blamed
Another much overlooked factor is police presence and response, which stresses on the significance of being available and accessible to provide services in a timely fashion. A feature that has been often been the cause of contentious debate is the appropriate use of force, where cops are expected to use only as much force as is necessary to accomplish their legitimate goals.
Still, as the old Gilbert and Sullivan operatic lyrics go it is true that a policemans lot is not a happy one. For cops on the street, keeping their composure is not always easy. Few personnel find themselves regularly in situations where they face the brunt of other peoples wrath such as when a policeman is trying to intercede in a family dispute, or calm someone who has been attacked.
Citizens may think the police are prejudiced and resort to unfair policies at times. On the other hand officers who attend to their work with commitment and responsibility may feel they are being unfairly blamed for all kinds of social problems, and many think they do not receive proper credit for doing their jobs with fearlessness and dedication.
The whole issue has raised an interesting question with certain analysts as to whether good manners translate into effective policing Some disagree with the politeness idea, contending that in certain instances police officers, frankly, have to drop the niceties to get their jobs done more effectively. Clearly, police work is one of the most stressful occupations anywhere. Whether people are willing to acknowledge it or not, policing does become a contact sport in unpredictably explosive situations.
The cooperation and assistance
Lawmen are often in the thick of danger routinely handling some volatile confrontations in situations that dictate that they do not have time for pleasantries. That is only natural when one comes face-to-face with desperate and armed hardcore criminals.
Certainly the safety of law enforcement officers must be acknowledged as a fundamental concern of both the departments hierarchy and the general public. No sensible citizen would expect a police officer to risk his or her life needlessly or recklessly. It should be in everyones interest to campaign for the adoption of policies and practices that afford maximum protection to officers and citizens.
This onus of responsibility for fighting crime carries with it the obligation for the police to recognise and respect the rights of citizens. But make no mistake about it, the police would never be able to accomplish even a fraction of their crime fighting success rate if not for the cooperation and assistance of the community. When police fail to respect the rights of residents and their leaders fail to hold those who engage in misconduct accountable, the police public relationship is put in dire jeopardy.
There are at times a good deal of disquiet about accountability is in the handling of complaints concerning misconduct. The Departments head honchos must explain to the public how adequately their personnel will be held accountable for misconduct.
Every police officer must play his or her role with discipline, courtesy, good manners and with proper conduct and accountability. Good work must be rewarded, while erring personnel must be dealt with strictly. A more responsive system of rewards and punishment should be implemented.
Police work is one of the most personal of all public services. It deals with human beings in life and death situations. The cops and the people they serve must be as near as possible and where possible must know one another.
Such understanding can generate the police-citizen cooperation necessary for the involvement of the whole community in community protection.

S.Africa's De Villiers angry at ball-tampering inference
SOUTHAMPTON, Saturday  South Africa captain AB de Villiers insisted his side had done nothing wrong after they found themselves caught up in a fresh ball-tampering row on Saturday as they lost their one-day international series against England.
The hosts somehow managed to win by two runs at Southampton to go 2-0 up when it seemed South Africa were on the brink of levelling matters ahead of Monday's third and final ODI at Lord's.
As if that was not bad enough for the tourists, de Villiers thought he might be accused of ball-tampering during England's innings
After the 33rd over, it appeared he was trying to get the ball changed.
But de Villiers later revealed he was in fact insisting to umpires Chris Gaffaney and Rob Bailey that the Proteas were not responsible for illegally altering its condition.
The vexed issue of ball-tampering is particularly emotive for South Africa given that Test skipper Faf du Plessis was fined his match fee by the International Cricket Council in November for shining the ball using saliva generated by sucking on a mint during the Proteas's second Test win over Australia in Hobart.
On Saturday, de Villiers felt his side risked being accused once again, although he added the fact the umpires did not in the end change the ball was proof of the Proteas innocence.

The Scary Strangers at Home
It's 6 O'Clock, Saturday morning. I am happy I don't have to get up for another thirty minutes. I listen with closed eyes to the sound of birdsong outside my window and let my mind wander back into the land of sweet slumber...I'm almost there when something heavy lands on my back, two arms circle my neck, a tiny voice says into my ear, Can I watch something What I blink my eyes rapidly trying to understand. You said I can watch on Saturday. I turn and stare into the pleading eyes of my eight-year-old. It's hard to say, no. But only 'Moana'...and nothing else, and no rewinding every few minutes, got it She jumps out of the bed skips towards the family room. Why not, let the TV and a movie be babysitters while I grab an extra thirty minutes of sleep After all, TV was a part of our own childhood wasn't it And we turned out alright, didn't we
Maybe we did. But the reality of today is that our kids are living in an entirely different, much more complex media environment than we ever could have imagined at their age. Back then, there was only one TV station, Rupavahini, (ITN was limited to those who lived in Colombo)and broadcasting was limited to a few hours in the evening. There was next to zero children's movies ('Handaya' is the only movie I can remember watching) and computers were things we saw on Star Trek with Mr. Spoke staring at them and lifting one eyebrow at what he saw on the screen. Things have surely changed since then.
As James Stayer writes in his book, The 'Other Parent', Unlike the children of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, whose media choices were limited and stood out like isolated landmarks, kids today inhabit an environment saturated and shaped by a complex 'mediascape' that envelops and bombards them day and night. Roaming around TVs, internet, movie screens and electronic games kids can spend more time in this vast mediascape than in the real world- and not surprisingly, far more time than they spend in direct contact with their parents.
If we pause to think about it, we are bound to realize that many children and adolescents today, are drawn to movies that depict violence or horror or in the case of Barbie movies unrealistic body types and a rigid beauty ideal that can be harmful to girls. It's also true that many of these same children experience negative effects of trouble falling asleep, nightmares,fear of the dark, anxiety, increased feelings of vulnerability and increased concerns about possible (and sometimes unlikely) dangers that can befall them. These negative effects sometimes last days or weeks but sometimes they can last much longer.
One area of major concern is that the line between fantasy and reality is blurred for children younger than six or seven. Psychiatrists say young children live in the magical world of Santa Claus and the tooth-fairy. The images of ghosts, monsters, human predators, bodily mutilation and blood and gore can feel just as real and can be emotionally absorbed as easily as the image and positive emotional impact of Santa.
Serious lasting effects
Even for adolescents, some movies can have serious lasting effects. It is certainly true that the amount of violence in movies and blood and gore have increased and has steadily been depicted with more detail and realism over the last 50 years. Beyond this, the horror movies watched by adolescents often contain disturbing images and situations focusing on adult themes that can cause irreparable harm to innocent minds.
According to reports on the subject, the primary reason that certain movies can be so harmful to children is that although we may know in our mind that the movie is not real, our body and our physiological responses react to the images and events as if they were real! This is why we scream, gasp, cover our eyes, and clutch our loved one. Physiologically, our heart beats more rapidly, our breathing becomes more shallow, our palms begin to sweat as if these imaginary stimuli were real. In other words, although our mind knows what is real and what is not, our body does not make this distinction. If this is true for us, imagine how hard it must be for our children to cope with this kind of 'pseudo reality' movies present.
According to a study conducted by Harrison and Cantor of the University of Wisconsin of 150 college students, directly after watching horror movies, 52% reported disturbances in areas such as sleeping or eating, as well as increased anxiety. One-thrd reported avoidance of the dreaded or depicted situation and 25% reported obsessive thinking or talking about the frightening situation. However, even more disturbing is that one in four students (25%) experienced such lingering effects a year or even years after viewing the disturbing movie.
In addition, these researchers found that the younger the participants were when they watched the movie, the longer lasting the effects. This was true even for those who reported enjoying the thrill of such movies. The lasting negative effects of horror movies also increased when children or adolescents watched these movies because someone else wanted to watch them as compared with those who sought the film out for themselves.
Quicker to attack
Research has shown that, since media often demonstrates that violent acting out is an acceptable method of problem-solving, children may be quicker to attack their problems with fists raised than with dialogue. Children tend to identify with the cool or heroic character; sometimes, this is the character that does the most shooting and killing, and in the end, wins.
Were throwing screens at children all day long, giving them distractions rather than teaching them how to self-soothe, to calm themselves down, says Catherine Steiner-Adair, a Harvard-affiliated clinical psychologist.
Before age 2, children should not be exposed to any electronic media, the American Academy of Pediatrics, maintains, because a childs brain develops rapidly during these first years, and young children learn best by interacting with people, not screens. Older children and teenagers should spend no more than one or two hours a day with entertainment media, preferably with high-quality content, and spend more free time playing outdoors, reading, doing hobbies and using their imaginations in free play, the academy recommends.
If kids are allowed to play Candy Crush on the way to school, the car ride will be quiet, but thats not what kids need, Dr. Steiner-Adair adds.
They need time to daydream, deal with anxieties, process their thoughts and share them with parents, who can provide reassurance.
Technology, obviously, is a poor substitute for personal interaction. Dr. Steiner-Adair reminds parents, children have to know that life is fine off the screen.
Its interesting and good to be curious about other people, to learn how to listen. It teaches them social and emotional intelligence, which is critical for success in life.
So, come next Saturday, when those tiny arms go around my neck and the inevitable question is whispered in my ear, 'Can I watch something' I know what to say, Let's go make pancakes for breakfast.
Hope it works. Fingers crossed.

Teachers off all religions had upheld assistance towards the destitute as a great act of merit. Instances where people had come forward to help those affected by various natural and other disasters are abound in our recent history, the Mahanayake Theras stated.
The fact that people displayed the same traits during the recent disaster was evident according to media reports. Therefore,it was proper for people to set off part of the funds earmarked for holding dansalas, erecting pandals and other acts of Amisa Pooja for forthcoming Poson festival
to help the people fallen distribute by the heavy rains and floods.

SIA first Asian carrier to offer TSA Precheck for US customers
Singapore Airlines (SIA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have partnered to offer customers travelling from US airports expedited security screening procedures under the TSA Precheck programme.
SIA is the first Asian airline to be participating in the TSA Precheck programme.
TSA Precheck enables low-risk known travellers to enjoy the programmes benefits while reducing checkpoint wait times. This provides a separate lane for security screening during departure, where the traveller does not have to remove jackets, belts, laptops, liquids and shoes.
Enrolment in the TSA Precheck programme is open to US citizens and lawful permanent residents.
However, non-US citizens may also enjoy the benefits of the programme through various Customs Border Protection (CBP) trusted traveller programmes, such as Global Entry, NEXUS and SENTRI. Singapore citizens are eligible to apply for the Global Entry Programme, which is also open to citizens from the following countries: Colombia, Germany, Netherlands, Panama, South Korea, UK, and Mexican nationals.
Successful applicants of the TSA Precheck programme or other CBP trusted traveller programmes will receive a Known Traveler Number (KTN) which may be provided to the airline during booking or check-in.
Once the customers KTN is recognised, the TSA Precheck logo will be printed on their boarding pass, indicating that their KTN has been captured in their booking record. Customers can provide their KTN across SIAs various check-in or booking channels, including its call agents, online reservations system, and website check-in via singaporeair.com or SingaporeAir mobile app, in addition to checking in at the airport counter.
Children aged 12 and under may also enjoy the benefits of TSA Precheck if they are travelling with passengers who have a valid KTN. As a partner airline under the TSA Precheck programme, SIA will also be able to offer customers travelling to and from the US an option of having a Self-Printed Boarding Pass (SPBP) and/or Mobile Boarding Pass (MBP).
This will enable travellers without check-in bags to check in online and proceed directly to the gate at the airport. Customers can expect this to be implemented in the coming months.

SLPA could have made Rs15 bn profit sans Htota Port loss
If not for the financial loss of Hambantota Port the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) would have made a profit of Rs15 billion in 2016, said SLPA Managing Director Sarathkumara Premachandra. Last year the SLPA made a net profit Rs 10 billion after tax.
Speaking at the annual general meeting of the Sri Lanka Association of Non-Vessel Operating Container Carrier (NVOCC) on Friday he said that this was an 83% increase over previous year in spite of Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) losing 100,000 TEU to competition. JCT in spite of all the other developments was the breadwinner of the SLPA earning over 60% of its total revenue, he said.
SLPAs total revenue in 2016 was Rs 44 billion whilst the Royalty revenue from the two private terminals amounted to approximately Rs 2 billion which is 4.5% of the total revenue.The reason for this success was the controlling of costs closing down some of the unproductive units. We improved productivity of JCT thus reduced its costs. Thanks to the South Harbour we handled larger ships and earned higher revenue from navigation services. Every TEU that went to private terminals gave us a revenue share of few dollars per TEU,he said.
Premachandra also said that they turned around the Trinco port from red to green after two decades while profit of the Galle Port too moved up. All ports other than port of Hambantota made profits. The losses of the Hambantota Port amounted to Rs 4.36 billion.
The Colombo Port achieved a 10.6 % growth handling over a half a million TEU of additional volume last year. This trend continues today still retaining over a 6.8% growth, he said.
He also predicted that SLPA does not expect Hambantota to make profits in the short term.
Looking back he said that since 1982 where Colombo which was a minor port that was handling feeders for Singapore without even a properly equipped container terminal has transformed itself to a hub that can cater to any container ship that sails in the high seas. It has been rated as the 23rd among the worlds top container ports, he said.
The managements and professionals of SLPA over the last four decades have selflessly worked to nurture the development with the guidance and assistance of successive governments and ministries.

SriLankan to fly daily to Melbourne
SriLankan Airlines, the National Carrier of Sri Lanka and a member of the prestigious oneworld alliance, will be establishing its presence in Australia with daily non-stop services to Melbourne commencing October 29 this year.
The non-stop services will also facilitate passengers from the Middle East and South Asia seeking onward connectivity via Colombo to/from Australia. SriLankan Airlines Chief Executive Officer, Captain Suren Ratwatte said Our presence in Australia cements the long-standing relationship between our two countries. We recently celebrated the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our nations, and the addition of Melbourne signifies our strategy of optimizing the airlines network in line with our restructuring. This also means that we have connected another continent to our global route map. On the other hand, given the number of Sri Lankans residing in and around Victoria, we fulfill a long felt need for a direct service. We are proud to welcome all the diverse residents of Victoria who can now enjoy the direct connections when visiting their friends and families throughout our network.
The airline will be operating Airbus 330-200 aircraft on the route, offering its passengers modern in-flight comforts complemented with its award winning service and the world renowned Sri Lankan warmth and hospitality.
SriLankan Airlines Chief Commercial Officer, Siva Ramachandran said, Despite the absence of direct connections, we have witnessed a steady increase in passengers travelling between Colombo and Melbourne via various Asian connecting points such as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. Our direct services will give us a definite advantage as SriLankan is the only carrier that is able to offer connectivity of this nature at this time. We also offer seamless onward connections beyond Colombo to a range of destinations in the Indian Sub-Continent and Middle East. With the launch of the new services, SriLankan Airlines passengers will also have the choice of flying to other Australian cities such as Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide as well as Auckland, New Zealand. SriLankan Airlines will continue to explore potential expansion opportunities across its network in order to facilitate the envisaged growth in business.
Australias High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Bryce Hutchesson said, We congratulate SriLankan Airlines on the addition of a direct flight to Australia. Direct air connections between countries stimulate two-way tourism, business, and trade and people-to-people exchange which are the core ingredients for a vibrant bilateral relationship. We are seeing a growing number of Australians looking to travel to Sri Lanka for tourism and business, and to reconnect with family. And we welcome the growing number of Sri Lankans travelling to Australia for education, business, to explore Australias culture and natural wonders, and of course to catch up with family and friends.
Widely known as a city for all seasons, Melbourne offers the travellers a wide variety of historic and natural attractions along with urban cityscapes preserving colonial architecture. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, offers heritage, wildlife as well as adventure sports and surfing hotspots for the adventurous Australian traveller. Over the years, the two countries have shared a mutual passion-- cricket, which has inspired fans to travel the distance in support of their respective home teams.
More importantly, Australia accounts for one of the largest Sri Lankan communities living outside Sri Lanka, out of which almost 50 percent lives in and around Victoria, making Melbourne the convenient terminus for their departures and arrivals.
For the convenience of travellers seeking onward connectivity from its Colombo hub, SriLankan currently connects over 10 Indian points with over 100 flights a week, which includes services to/from Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Calcutta, Trivandrum, Tiruchirappalli, Cochin, Mumbai and New Delhi. SriLankan will be adding Visakhapatnam, Coimbatore and Hyderabad to its route network in July this year, further expanding its presence in India.
The Airlines Middle Eastern services include over fifty weekly flights to/from nine Middle Eastern destinations, including daily services out of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, Riyadh, Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait. The Airline also offers its passengers the option of exploring popular holiday destinations such as Seychelles and Maldives Male and Gan Island.
These operations will further complement the existing double daily services offered by SriLankan Airlines between Sri Lanka and Australia via Singapore and Kuala Lumpur with its codeshare partners, Qantas and Malaysia Airlines.

Steps to clean your flower bed
Gardeners who take pride in their flower gardens are always looking for ways to make their flower beds more attractive and interesting. One way to do this is to create and maintain a clean flower bed. The best time to clean your flower bed is in the early spring, before flowers are planted and begin growing. Here are 6 steps you can use to clean and prepare your flower bed.
Step 1  Plan Your Flower Bed and Its Landscaping
Before you start your cleaning, take time to view your flower bed from a landscaping perspective, before it becomes crowded with flowers and bushes. This is the best time to decide which flowers will look better at the rear and edges of the bed. If you are planning to add bulbs, roses, or annuals, now is a good time to decide where you will plant them.
Step 2 - Take Care Using Gardening Tools
Preparing your soil, removing weeds, and tilling your soil will be an important step in cleaning your garden. But it can also be one that results in harming early plants, such as crocuses, if you use the wrong kind of gardening tool. Rather than using larger tools such as rakes, you will find that the smaller and more manageable hand-held tools are less likely to uproot early flowers and buried bulbs.
Step 3  Prune Bushes
Bushes and shrubs in your flower garden can add variety, beauty, and interest. You should include them in your spring flower bed cleaning. Prune back sucker branches and those that dont contribute to the beauty of the bush. Remove dead branches from the bush and dead leaves from beneath it. It might even be necessary to remove bushes that are dead or relocate those that may be growing in the wrong place in the garden.
Step 4  Remove Debris
After winter months, your garden will be covered with loose leaves, mulch, dead plants, weeds, unwanted compost, and maybe even poop from your pets. Remove all of this and pull up dead annuals. Removing larger pieces of debris by hand, such as dead branches and bushes, will give you a more clear view of the garden bed. You will then be able to see new weeds, smaller debris you will want to collect with a hand rake, along with plants and bulbs you may want to relocate to a different part of the garden.
Step 5 Add Grass Clippings
When you have finished cleaning your garden bed, it will be a good time to add grass clippings to the bed top to help control new weeds from sprouting and add nitrogen to the soil.
Step 6  Add Earth Worms or Night Crawlers
In addition to helping to keep the soil loose, earth worms and night crawlers will add castings (droppings) which will contribute nutrients to the garden soil.
Finally, sprinkle the garden soil to moisten and soften it. After a few hours when the moisture has dissipated throughout the soil, it will be time for you to begin planting your new flowers. -doityourself.com

Stokes stars as England take South Africa series
SOUTHAMPTON,Saturday  Ben Stokes struck a superb century before pacemen Josh Ball and Mark Wood helped England seal a dramatic and series-clinching two run-win over South Africa in the second one-day international at Southampton on Saturday.
Victory put England 2-0 up with one to play ahead of Monday's finale at Lord's.
Stokes made South Africa pay dearly for dropping him off both first and second balls after the all-rounder had been passed fit to play following a knee injury.
Yet in a match where the Proteas dropped six chances in all, they were still on course for a morale-boosting win ahead of the start of next week's Champions Trophy ODI tournament in England.
South Africa, the world's top-ranked ODI side, needed 20 off the last two overs chasing a target of 331.
That became 10 off 10 balls when David Miller (71 not out) struck Jake Ball for a six and a four off successive deliveries.
But South Africa -- often accused of choking in pressure situations -- saw Miller and Chris Morris (36 not out) fail to score the runs they required as Ball and fast bowler Wood held their nerve. Wood defended a target of seven off six balls in the last over.
Two singles were followed by a dot ball, a single and another dot ball.
Suddenly, South Africa needed four off the last ball and Morris could not oblige.
Earlier, Stokes made 101 and Jos Buttler a dashing 65 not out in England's 330 for six after South Africa captain AB de Villiers sent them into bat in overcast, bowler-friendly, conditions.
Stokes, who briefly left the field with a knee injury in England's 72-run win in the series opener at Headingley on Wednesday, showed no discomfort with the bat, although he only bowled three overs.
His 79-ball innings, just his second century in 55 matches at this level, featured 11 fours and three sixes.
Stokes, the Indian Premier League's record two-million-dollar-man, shared stands of 95 with skipper Eoin Morgan, himself dropped twice, and 77 with Buttler.
South Africa's sloppy fielding saw ODI debutant left-arm spinner Keshav Mahraj, who bowled much better than figures of one for 72 in 10 overs suggested, have three catches dropped off his bowling alone.
England were faltering at 80 for three when Stokes came into bat.
The innings then took a decisive turn when Stokes was missed twice in his first two balls, with Maharaj again the unfortunate bowler.
He deceived Stokes with a well-flighted delivery that took the left-hander's outside edge only for the ball to go through Amla's hands at slip for four.
Next ball produced another edge, with wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock failing to hold a more difficult chance.
Stokes subsequently hoisted both medium-pacer Andile Phehlukwayo and Morris high over deep midwicket for sixes.
He had equalled his previous ODI best of 101, against Bangladesh in Dhaka in October, when he found Miller at long-off to give Maharaj a deserved wicket.
Stokes partly returned the favour when he dropped de Kock, then on 28, when he floored a tough one-handed caught and bowled chance with his first ball in the Proteas innings.
De Kock went on to make 98 and shared a stand of 96 with de Villiers (52).
Amla was hit flush on the helmet grille by Wood before falling falling for 24 when he drove Stokes to Morgan at short extra cover.
De Villiers, who made a sparkling 52 at better than a run-a-ball, gloved a well-directed short delivery from fast bowler Liam Plunkett (three for 64) through to wicket-keeper Buttler.
South Africa then suffered a further setback when de Kock, in sight of a hundred, tried to run off-spinner Mooen Ali down to third man and was caught behind by opposing gloveman Buttler.
De Kock faced 103 balls including 11 fours but the real drama on a now gloriously sunny day was still to come. - AFP

With a straight bat
He had the reputation of being an opener. Later he anchored his place as a middle order batsman in the Sri Lankan cricket national team. His record of 212 not out together with Kumar Sangakkara against England in 2015 remains the highest second wicket partnership for Sri Lanka in ODI cricket. He is also the former ODI captain of the team. Lahiru Thirimanne has often been described as a player with unflappable talent and determination. His dainty and bubbly wife Rukshani Thirimanna ne Harishchandra tells us what the man behind the bat is like.
First meeting
Ours is a love marriage. We met during our G C E Advanced Level Classes. I am from Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa, and Lahiru schooled at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. So, even our schools were close by. We both joined the same Chemistry class. I did not take notice of him much because he didnt speak to anyone. I only began to notice him when he got my phone number through one of his friends and called me. Till then I did not have the slightest idea that he was interested in me! I have always imagined him as the egocentric character in the group. However after we started talking I realized that his reserved qualities appealed to me a lot. There is much more to him than that which meets the eye. We celebrate nine years of togetherness this year. We got married in December 2014.
Second thoughts
Rukshani Thirimanna and Lahiru Thirimanne ,Pictures by Saliya Rupasinghe
Lahiru has played cricket in school for his school team. So it did not come as a surprise that he was selected for the national team because he showed signs of becoming a world class player. I was ok with him making a career out of it because it was something he is passionate about. However I was definitely a bit scared because that means that he would have to travel a lot and not be in the country much. However, after the first few months I got used to it. So I do not oppose if he wants to continue playing for the team for many more years.
The husband
He has been as loving towards me as he was before marriage. Before marriage he was more carefree and light hearted. Then after marriage he became more responsible. That was the only change that I saw in Lahiru  the husband- from Lahiru  the boyfriend. We got to know that I was expecting while I was accompanying him on one of his tours in England. He was elated with the news. He started taking me to the temple more often.
The New Dad
Lahiru takes his duties much more seriously now that there is a third member in our family. Our son, Livaan Rashnuka, is three months old. He has become a doting father to him. Though we were not specific about it, we both secretly wanted a son. Now that he is here we have not made plans to get him into cricket or any other profession. It is up to him to decide what he wants to engage in as he grows up. However I have noticed that he has taken a special interest towards cricket whenever it is being played on TV. He would just stare at the screen wide eyed and would not bat an eye easily. So who know Must be the genes!
An alternativeprofession
If he had not made it to the international team and become a globally renowned cricketer Lahiru would have become a successful engineer. He is interested in the subject. He had done Maths for his G C E Advanced Levels, studying subjects like Physics and Chemistry. So he could have gotten into that field easily. He is currently pursuing studies in management.
Holidaying together
We mostly spend any free time we have at home but if we get an extended holiday we like to go down south.
Foodwise
Since he is in the national cricket team Lahiru has to follow a specific diet. However, whenever he is allowed to have a cheat meal he likes to indulge in the prawn curry that I make. We are both fans of the Sri Lankan cuisine so even if we are dining out we mostly crave for Sri Lankan dishes.
Temperwise
Lahiru does get angry  especially if he is faced with unfair circumstances. Such things really get to him. We have had our share of disagreements but the good thing about him is that he cools off after a while and does not keep the anger within his system at length. We keep away from each others company for a while after an argument. Then when both parties have had time to cool down we seek each other and discuss the problem and find a solution.
Three lesser known facts
Lahiru may seem snobbish but that is just the way he seems to others. So do not judge the book by its cover. He is very is very honest and faithful. You have to become close to him to get to know these characteristics. If someone wins his heart he would never let go of that person. He would become a lifelong friend to him or her.
In brief
If I was asked to sum Lahiru up in one word I would choose goodwilled. He does not get close to people easily. Therefore many mistake him for a snob. However if they can really get to know him they would realize that he has a heart of gold and can be a very loyal and caring companion throughout their alliance.
Ten years from today
If he chooses to stay in the cricket field I believe that Lahiru would become one of the best batsmen in the world. If he wishes to begin his own business I think he would succeed in that sector. Lahirus father had passed away when he was 10 years old. So there has been a lot of people who have helped him to reach the position that he is in today. We are grateful to our parents, his fathers brother Viraj Thirimanne, his brother Thulindu, his coaches and anyone who has helped him out even by saying an encouraging word.

UK lowers threat level
UK: Britain on Saturday lowered the terror threat level which was hiked after this weeks carnage in Manchester as police released CCTV footage of bomber Salman Abedi on the night of the attack.
The move to scale back the threat level from critical to severe was announced by Prime Minister Theresa May who said there were now 11 suspects in custody over Monday nights bombing targeting young fans at a pop concert.
Investigators gave details of Abedis last hours as they released photographs from security cameras showing the bespectacled suicide bomber in trainers, jeans, black sleeves, a black cap and a black puffer waistcoat, over which the straps of his backpack can be seen.
The 22-year-old, of Libyan origin, was born in the northwestern English city.
The police statement said one of the last places he went to was a city centre flat and from there he left to make his way to the Manchester Arena, where the attack took place.
The flat is highly relevant as a location which we believe may be the final assembly place for the device.
Two unarmed police officers remained on guard outside the entrance to Granby House, believed to contain the flat in question, according to an AFP correspondent at the scene.
It is surprising, because these people are just under your nose and you dont know it, said Harpreet Lota, a Manchester resident walking past the building.
In their latest arrests over the attack, police detained two men, aged 20 and 22, in an early morning raid in north Manchester on Saturday. Along with the 11 suspects in UK custody, police in Libya have detained Abedis father and brother.
A third of those killed in Mondays bombing were children, and another 116 people were injured. The attack, which has been claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group, targeted concertgoers at the end of a show by US teen pop idol Ariana Grande.
British counter-terror chief Mark Rowley said Friday that police had captured a large part of the network linked to the bombing.
Explaining the decision to reduce the terror threat level from critical -- its highest level -- to severe, May said troops would also be withdrawn from the streets, another measure adopted after the bombing. We should be clear about what this means: A threat level of severe means an attack is highly likely, the country should remain vigilant, she said.
Operation Temperer, which involved the deployment of troops on patrol alongside police, will be wound down on Monday night, at the end of the bank holiday weekend. From midnight on Monday, there will be a well-planned and gradual withdrawal of members of the armed forces, who will return to normal duties, she said.
May has seen her polling lead against Labour rival Jeremy Corbyn dwindle as campaigning restarted ahead of a June 8 general election, with her rival accusing her of overseeing a cut in police staff while she was interior minister.
Between 2009-2016, the number of police officers fell by almost 20,000, or around 14 percent, according to the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank.
May argues that the government has increased funding for security and intelligence agencies. Authorities are currently handling 500 terror-related investigations into 3,000 individuals, with another 20,000 people on the radar posing a residual risk.
May attempted to hit back Saturday, announcing the new Commission for Countering Extremism, saying that enough is enough -- we need to be stronger and more resolute in standing up to these people.
The commission will have a legal responsibility to identify extremism, and will advise the government about what policies and laws to enact in order to defeat extremists.
Armed police were on patrol as the country enjoyed a long holiday weekend with security boosted at Saturdays FA Cup final at Londons Wembley Stadium, where Arsenal beat Chelsea.
And extra security measures were in place for Saturday evenings gig by the Courteeners, an indie rock group, at Old Trafford cricket ground -- where 50,000 music fans attended the citys first major gig since the attack.
The bombing was the latest in a series of IS-claimed attacks in Europe that have coincided with a US-led offensive against the jihadist group in Syria and Iraq.- AFP

Whats your go-to emoji
Researchers have found that many different factors determine our choice of emojis, the symbols that help us express ourselves digitally.
An emojis popularity, perceived meaning and even location on a smartphone's keyboard all play a role in emoji choice.
The researchers found that people are more likely to use emojis with meanings close to popular words, with clear and less ambiguous meanings.
The 'face with tears emoji' was ranked the most popular of the year. In a previous study, the researchers found that it accounts for 15.4 percent of total emoji usage, and the new study suggests that emoji popularity is linked to their linguistic meanings
The researchers, based at the University of Michigan, studied the use of emojis by one million users through more than 1.2 billion messages. PhD student Wei Ai and colleagues analyzed the relationship of the emojis to words, to measure emoji semantics - their linguistic meaning - and to determine what makes some symbols more popular than others. They found that more than 9 per cent of the messages contained at least one emoji, and emoji popularity was linked to their linguistic meanings. 'Emojis with clear and less ambiguous meanings are more likely to be used, and they provide good substitutes to their word counterparts.' The researchers found that although emojis each have a textual description provided by the Unicode Consortium, users don't see the description whey they decide to use an emoji.
So even if a description is informative, it may not be how people interpret the emoji.
For example, the sun behind clouds emoji, which is officially labeled 'sun behind cloud,' is widely used as 'Good morning.'
The researchers found that although emojis each have a textual description provided by the Unicode Consortium, users don't see the description whey they decide to use an emoji. So even if a description is informative, it may not be how people interpret the emoji. For example, the sun behind clouds emoji (pictured), which is officially labeled 'sun behind cloud,' is widely used as 'Good morning'. The Kika Emoji keyboard was used to collect the data in 2015, which contains nearly 1,300 emojis - the majority of which were barely used.
Instead, users find several go-to favorites, many of which seem to say similar things.
'We found that the popularity of emojis are really affected by multiple factors related to the semantics,' said Ai.
'It is likely that although those emojis look similar, people don't interpret them similarly.
'Nonverbal symbols in online communication has shown their power ever since the first emoticon ':)' is coined, and will be even more powerful as new forms (such as gif animations) become supported by modern apps and websites. 'These symbols, as a ubiquitous new language, also make it easier to communicate across language and cultural barriers.'
