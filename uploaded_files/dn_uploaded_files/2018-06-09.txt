Fraudster in USA gets passport back
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered to release the passport belonging to a suspect who had been charged for preparing fake documents to obtain visas to the United States of America (USA).
The magistrate had ordered to impose the travel ban on Hiripitiyage Wilson Samarasinghe regarding the alleged preparing of fake documents to obtain visas to the United States of America (USA).
The suspect had fraudulently prepared letters as a former participant at an athletic event and another letter purportedly issued by the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Athletics Association, saying that he had participated in athletics and submitted it to the US Embassy to obtain a visit visa.
The US Embassy officer Ann Florence Nicholas had found that they were fake documents.
Earlier, the suspect had given a statement to the police that his first name was Hiripitiyage Premarathne and later had legally changed his name as Hiripityage Sugath Priyantha in 1999. After changing his name, he had been in the US in 1999 and worked at a fuel station and in 2004 had returned to Sri Lanka.

Historic Trump Kim Summit Tuesday
Presidents Donald Trump of the United States and Kim Jong Un of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will meet on June 12 at Hotel Capella in Santosa Island, Singapore. This is a dramatic development considering that the two were trading accusations and threats only seven or eight months ago and were virtually on the brink of physical war. Both leaders were called mavericks and war-mongers. While President Trump was decried as a lunatic President Kim was identified as a Recluse in a not so complimentary way.
Now both are called pragmatic leaders who understand realpolitik better and are pursuing meaningful policies. How did this transformation take place No politician could operate in a vacuum. He or she is influenced by the historical setting, the economic and cultural environment and many more factors. For example, the precarious nature of the North Korean economy and the decline in the US economy would have influenced both leaders to pursue peace instead of war. Most important also is public opinion both in the United States and the Korean peninsula.
US citizens were weary of wars fought on foreign soil which resulted in the death of so many US soldiers. South Koreans had elected President Moon who favoured peace with the North. They did not wish to see their motherland destroyed by war. This yearning for peace found resonance in the North.
Earlier President Trump cancelled the Summit but subsequently the Koreans have managed to convince him about their genuine interest and conciliatory approach, which changed his attitude. Kim sent one of his most senior intelligence officials- Kim Yong Chol to meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for discussions. Both of them later met President Trump.
It is quite clear that Kim has been an astute diplomat who played his cards intelligently without revealing the Aces. He started the whole peace process with the offer of joint participation in some sports events in the Winter Olympics last December in South Korea, which gathered a momentum of its own.
It is also true that he has not compromised on principle so far and has achieved the goal of strategic nuclear capabilities he desired. This last factor would not have gone unnoticed in Washington.
However, one cannot be too optimistic about the outcome of the Summit though a general thaw in US-North Korean relations could be expected. There are powerful reactionary and militaristic forces in the US that are unhappy with the latest developments. One of the positive developments could be the need to reduce the presence of US troops stationed in South Korea and the lifting of sanctions on North Korea. That would result in an asymmetry in the comparative strength of US and rival (Chinese, Russian) troops in the Asia-Pacific region.
US vetoes UN resolution on Palestine
The United States voted against a resolution brought by Kuwait calling for the protection of Palestinian citizens. This is an open endorsement of the policy of genocide Israel is currently practicing in Gaza. Last Monday June 4th alone Israeli Defence Forces killed 59 unarmed Palestinians including a medical worker and injured hundreds in one of the bloodiest days. During the last few weeks the toll of those killed was 112. In addition there were 13,000 people wounded.
Jim Kavanagh writing in Counterpunch says that New York Times Editorial Board has defended Israel. It has said that Israel has every right to defend its borders, ignoring the fact that Palestinians are in their own land and Israel is the intruder who has barricaded the Gaza population.
Shmuel Rosner in an op-ed piece in the NYT says Guarding the border [or whatever it is] was more important than avoiding killing. Kavanagh also reveals that Knesset Member Avi Dichter has said that If every man, woman and child in Gaza gathers at the gate  there is a bullet for every one of them. They can all be killed, no problem.
According to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child Israel is guilty of continuous use of Palestinian children as human shields and informants.
Meanwhile, Israel is considering the extension of illegal Jewish settlements in the Golan region. On the 50th anniversary of the victory of Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967 Israel Deputy Minister Michael Oren has said that the Golan is an acceptable part of the character of Israel and we must develop the same.
The tragedy of Palestine is the disunity of the Palestinians with certain sections colluding with Israel and the US for opportunist reasons and the subservience of some Arab countries before US imperialism.
This calls for an intensification and expansion of the international solidarity campaigns against Zionism and Israels genocidal and apartheid policies.
The cause of Palestine is the cause of humanity.

Indian Women crush Sri Lanka Women by 7 wickets
A day after they were handed their first loss in the history of Asia Cup, India chased down 108 with ease to stage a seven-wicket win against Sri Lanka at the Royal Selangor Club in Kuala Lumpur.
While the bowlers managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 107, an unbeaten 40-run partnership between Veda Krishnamurthy and Anuja Patil sealed the chase for India with seven balls to spare.
Electing to bat, Sri Lanka lost their first wicket in the fourth over, following which a 38-run stand between opener Yasoda Mendis and Hasini Perera took them to 50 for 1 in the 11th over. They slumped in the middle overs, with left-arm spinner Ekta Bisht, who had taken the first wicket, triggering a collapse in the 14th by trapping Nilakshi de Silva lbw for 7.
Sri Lanka went on to lose Malsha Shehani and captain Shashikala Siriwardene to run-outs in a span of six deliveries as they lost their last five wickets within 25 balls. Hasini led the sole resistance, scoring an unbeaten 43-ball 46, taking the total past 100 in the 19th over.
In reply, India lost Smriti Mandhana for 12 in the Powerplay, and de Silva sent Mithali Raj - who became the first Indian woman to reach 2000 T20I runs - back for 23 to leave the score at 55 for 2 in the 12th over. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur chipped in with a 25-ball 24, but the fourth-wicket stand between Krishnamurthy and Patil ensured a win for India. Krishnamurthy struck four fours in her 23-ball 29 while Patil was named Player of the Match for her all-round effort of 19 runs off 16 balls and bowling figures of 4-0-19-1.
Scores: Sri Lanka Women 107-7 in 20 overs (Yasoda Mendis 27, Hasini Perera 46 n.o., E Bisht 2/20)
India Women 110-3 in 18.5 overs (M Raj 23, H Kaur 24, V Krishnamurthy 29 n.o.)

Khan spins Afghanistan to T20 series sweep over Bangladesh
DEHRADUN, India, Thursday - Spin sensation Rashid Khan bowled an excellent last over to help Afghanistan eke out a thrilling one-run win over Bangladesh and complete a series whitewash in the third Twenty20 international Thursday.
Chasing 146 for victory, Bangladesh required nine in the 20th over but Khan held his nerve to restrict Bangladesh to 144-6 in the north Indian city of Dehradun.
The Asghar Stanikzai-led Afghanistan, who await their Test debut against India on June 14 in Bangalore, triumphed 3-0 after winning the first two games comprehensively.
Mushfiqur Rahim, who hit 46, and Mahmudullah Riyad, who made 45, put together a gritty 84-run fifth-wicket partnership to give Bangladesh hope of a consolation win.
Mushfiqur, who was named man of the match, smashed five fours in the penultimate over but fell to Khans leg spin on the first delivery of the final over.
Mahmudullah tried to get four off the final ball but Shafiqullah Shafiqs acrobatic work at the long-on boundary got the batsman run out in a dramatic finish to the game.
The 19-year-old Khan, who topped the bowling chart with eight wickets and the man of the series award, returned figures of 1-24.
Earlier Afghanistan batsman Samiullah Shenwari made an unbeaten 33 to lift his side to 145-6 after they elected to bat first.
Afghanistan were in trouble at 101-4 in the 15th over against a disciplined Bangladesh bowling attack but Shenwaris 28-ball knock gave them a winning total.
Opening batsman Mohammad Shahzad and Stanikzai also made useful contributions of 26 and 27 respectively.
Left-arm spinner Nazmul Islam and paceman Abu Jayed claimed two wickets each. AFP

More than 1.1 million people avoid paying direct taxes in Sri Lanka directly impacting on the economy, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said there are more than 1.5 million people who fall under category required to pay the income tax according to the per capita income in the country. However, there were only 0.4 million paying income tax at the moment. The Minister during a meeting held with industrialists and businessmen in Kegalle said the government policy is to gradually reduce imposing indirect taxes while increasing the direct tax.
He said further that the collection of direct tax has become a challenge due to people having no confidence in the procedure. "So there should be an awareness programme to make people aware of the importance of paying tax," Minister Siyambalapitiya said. The Minister said the word that entrepreneurs and businessmen hate to listen is the tax. "However this should be changed and they have to think of it as a responsibility," Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

Negombo gets new Rs 20 bn wastewater management system
Work will soon commence on a major wastewater management system for Negombo, the first of its kind in the area.
The Rs.20 billion project will take four years to build, and is funded with support from the European Union and the French Agency for Development.
Dignitaries from the donor agencies and officials from the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply announced the project at a ceremonial launch at Negombo Beach on Friday.
Sri Lanka is known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, said AFD Country Director Martin Parent. But there is a challenge in preserving its fragile coastal environment, he added.
Wastewater management is key to conservation, he said, and it is very rare around the world to see developing countries invest in this sector.
National Water Supply and Drainage Board Chairman Alahudeen Ansar said the Negombo lagoon and coastline has been consistently polluted by municipal waste over time, largely the result of residents using individual septic systems, which can overflow.
The new project, which includes 70 km of pipeline and nine pumping stations, would serve about 75,000 people, he said.
The European Union is committed to supporting international ocean governments, (and) lays emphasis on managing and using the worlds oceans and their resources in ways the keep our oceans healthy, productive, safe, secure and resilient, said EU Embassador Tung-Lai Margue.
He said the EU contributed almost six million Euros to the project.
French Ambassador Jean-Marin Schuh said Sri Lanka was home to incredible biodiversity and marine resources, which needed to be conserved. France has a lot to share with Sri Lanka, he said. City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem thanked the international agencies for their financial support.
One of the main ideas in providing this infrastructure is to preserve our beautiful landscape and leave the water resources for the posterity of successive generations, he said.
Negombo lagoon and the ocean has progressively been subjected to heavy pollution because non-availability of proper a waste disposal system in this important city, he added.
The new wastewater treatment system would not only help preserve marine resources, but also protect human health by securing safe drinking water and a clean environment, he argued.
He said several other cities were earmarked for wastewater systems, such as Galle and Unawatuna. With the increased urbanization we are experiencing, we are faced with this challenge of our groundwater resources getting polluted and the beauty of the environment getting disturbed, he said.

Influenza virus in Southern Province :
No need to close schools - Health Services Director
Among the influenza virus infected children reported throughout the Southern Province, there is only a very few school children. Hence, there is no need for the closure of schools and other educational institutions of the province, Southern Province Health Services Director G. Wijesooriya said.
The children who have so far succumbed to the viral flu are children under two years of age. Moreover over 85% of paediatric deaths were due to chronic congenital intricacies which reduces genetic resistance to the virus, he said.
Wijesooriya was speaking at a discussion to review the current situation of the influenza epidemic in the province.
The discussion was convened by Southern Province Governor Marshal Perera at the Governors Secretariat Auditorium on Wednesday.
There are instances where children who died of other diseases were also wrongly branded as influenza related victims. The influenza virus is seasonal in Sri Lanka and was first reported in 2008. Usually, the epidemic breaks out twice a year. In 2007, 98 persons died of influenza.The media always questions about the influenza vaccine. However,we cannot take a decision over that matter. The vaccine is recommended by a special committee of experts. At present, we have ample stocks of medicine in all hospitals throughout the province. We hope to be able to control the disease within the next month.
Karapitiya Teaching Hospital Deputy Director Dr.Susantha Fernando said that there were 46 influenza positive patients being treated at the Karapitiya hospital,out of which number two were in critical condition.
Dr.Fernando said, So far 503 out of the 600 flu patients identified are children. Following medical examination, 110 out them were found to be infected with the influenza virus. More reports are to be received.
By Wednesday (June 6), 15 children had died of the disease.Three were from the Galle,seven from the Matara and Five were from the Hambantota districts respectively. Further,40 out of the 90 pediatric patients being treated at Karapitya are suspected to be infected with the influenza virus. Two children are at present in a critical condition.
We have initiated a number of measures to stop the further spread of the epidemic. We have set up a separate unit for the examination of patients who come to the hospital daily. Within an hour, we take a comprehensive report on each of the patient and treat them. Patients who need to be hospitaliSed are admitted and others are sent home after treatment.
Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said that unauthentic and exaggerated stories in the media about the flu epidemic has created a sense of panic in the minds of the people.
Therefore,we can notice a drop in school attendance. The closure of schools is not practical. For how long can we keep the schools closed We have taken maximum precautionary measures to halt the spread of the disease. We have allocated sufficient funds from the Southern Provincial Council Treasury in addition to the colossal amounts of money provided by the Health Ministry, he said.
The abrupt decision to close schools for three days last week also created more fear among the public. People should be vigilant over the situation but we should not cause unwanted panic or fear, he pointed out.
Southern Province Education Minister Chandima Rasaputra said that if children do not attend schools, the Health Ministry should strive to build up the confidence of the public by encouraging them to send their children to school.
The highest number of deaths due to the flu were reported from Matara district.The parents of Thiahgoda Junior School demand the closure of the school. I think the number of deaths exceeds 15. I suppose that it is better to close the schools for two weeks and educate the public over the situation, Rasaputra further said.
Southern Province Governor Marshal Perera said that on observing the statistics over the prevailing influenza situation he noticed that the epidemic had not been properly controlled.
The death toll that started from five has now been increased up to 20. Some try to say that the situation is not so serious. I do not agree with that. There is no restriction for expenditures over controlling the epidemic. President Maithripala Sirisena has assured that all the funds needed will be be provided.Hence, I urge all the respective authorities to pool their resources to reduce the spread of the flu, the Southern Province Governor said.
Meanwhile, Southern Provincial Education Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said there is a 21 per cent reduction in school attendance in the Matara district alone.
Presently, there are over 342 schools with 72,260 children in the Matara district. Of them, nearly 28,265 students were absent by yesterday. Another 366 students present with symtoms of fever, cough and flu were sent home with their parents, elders and guardians, the school authorities added.
This situation has worsened during past to to three weeks. Therefore, parents are relunctant to send their children to schools, Dhamma schools and tuition classes through fear of contracting the fast spreading viral diseases. The health of the children has been the main consideration of us, they said.

NO KNOWLEDGE OF MENDIS FUNDING POLLS CAMPAIGN :
Nothing but a political witch-hunt - Sujeeva
International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe denied that he had any knowledge of Mendis Distilleries having donated for his election campaign or that it was a subsidiary of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL). The State Minister addressing a media briefing at his residence at Chelsea Gardens, Colpetty, said many had donated to his election fund run by close friends and that they did not keep track of donated funds.
The B report filed in Court on Thursday in the case connected to the Central Bank Bond issue stated that Senasinghe had received three cheques (one in August 2015, another in October 2015 and third April 2016) of Rs 1 million each from W. M. Mendis and Company, and that they were cashed by police officers attached to the his security detail.
The Minister who sat on the second COPE Committee which investigated into the Bond Issue in 2016 said that it was only when they were investigating into PTL that he figured that Mendis was a subsidiary of PTL.
He however refused to answer questions of whether at the time, he should have mentioned having received funds from Mendis and Company. It was only last year that we got to know that PTL was involved in all this. We did not want to protect anyone. Even though they called us the footnote gang, we scientifically studied the issue and all our recommendations were legal, even the Bond Commission admitted that, Senasinghe said.
He added that if he had known earlier, he would not have taken the money. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Senasinghe also said it was unfair that his name was mentioned in the B report when thousands of those who had been paid by Mendis did not have their name on the report, The B report clearly states that I have not committed a crime. So why is my name there What about the suppliers, media and other people Mendis would have given money to, he asked.
Over Rs 300 million is being spent on this investigation with around 70 CID officers investigating. This is nothing but a political witch-hunt. What about the other crimes that need to be investigated, he said.
The State Minister added that if anyone was to make a genuine request, he was prepared to give back the Rs 3 million.
I cannot speak too much on this.The Speaker told me to make a short statement, there is an issue of privilege here. Legally you cannot release the names of the MPs if they have not committed a crime. The Speaker is looking into this, Senasinghe said.

Palitha Range Bandaras son remanded
Arachchikattuwa Police yesterday remanded Yashoda Range Bandara, son of State Minister Palitha Range Bandara over several charges including misuse of public property and drunk driving.
Bandara was arrested when he was admitted to the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital following a motor accident, causing heavy damage to a house in the Kottapitiya junction on the ChilawPuttalam Road.
He was remanded till June 12 after being produced before Nugegoda Acting Magistrate Thissa Wijeratne.
Preliminary police investigations revealed that the State Ministers son was under the influence of liquor and the vehicle he drove belonged to the Ministry of Irrigation.
However, Yoshoda Range Bandara and Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Anjana Sandaruwan who were travelling in the vehicle were admitted to hospital.
The Chilaw Magistrate and District Court Judge on Thursday ordered the Arachchikattuwa Police to arrest Bandara and Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Anjana Sandaruwan in connection with the incident.
Meanwhile, Irrigation and Water Management State Ministry secretary J.M.

TRCSL should be brought under Telecommunication Ministry - Mangala
It could have been better if the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) came under the purview of the Telecommunication Ministry, Mass Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He was responding to a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
I was the minister when the TRC Act was drafted in 1997.
As per the Act, the TRC should be under the Telecommunication Ministry and its Secretary must be the TRC Head. However, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who tasted money and power attached to this institution took it under him by gazetting it under his purview.
He used it as a political weapon. Since then the TRC continues to be under the President. It could have been better had we given it back to the Telecommunication Ministry, he said.
On behalf of the Government, Minister Samaraweera expressed his regrets over the TNL incident, adding that the Government is always committed to creating a free and responsible media environment.
I am happy that the Joint Opposition MPs, who were silent when media organisations came under severe attacks during the Rajapaksa regime, have come forward to speak on media freedom at least now.
Today, many media channels allocate more air time to criticise the Government, but still we maintain good relations with all of them, he added.
The minister said transmission equipment belonging to the TNL to the value of about Rs 2 million had been taken into Police custody. MP Gunawardena raising a question under Standing Order 27 (2) brought to the attention of the House that due notice had not been given when closing down the TNL transmission tower.
He charged that this was a violation of the TRC Act. Observing that the President is only entitled to keep Defence Ministry and Environment and Mahaweli Development Ministry under him as per the 19th Amendment, the MP questioned whether the President has the power to make appointments in other institutions. He said the Presidents appointment of the TRC Director General can be questioned.
Replying to these concerns the minister said the issue could be a bureaucratic bungle than a political issue. I am not a lawyer or a Constitutional expert, but I see your argument has a basis. We will discuss a way to resolve it, Samaraweera said.
He also said that he could not contact TRC Chairman Austin Fernando yet as he had gone overseas, adding that he would talk to him as soon as he returns.
UNP MP Pathirana heavily criticised the Government over the TNL incident, also recalling how TNL Janahanda programme, conducted by him, provided the platform for many politicians to make their first public appearance.
He noted the Mass Media Minister and the Prime Minister should have been informed and their consent sought prior to the blocking of any media institution.
Can we control the media by sending Police in this modern era Besides had the Law and Order Minister been informed when Police raided the premises.
We are dragging the country back to a dark era. I am ashamed of this conduct. We did not come to power to behave in this manner.
This should stop immediately, Minister Samaraweera said.
University protests funded by certain parties - Dr. Rajapakshe
There are certain groups who provide money to disrupt University operations. These forces are trying to destabilize our university education. Hence, the universities should be safeguarded from these sinister elements and brought to a progressive platform, said Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe.
He said so during the Second Reading of the National Defense Fund (Amendment) Bill in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister noted that currently, drugs were being taken into universities, while the underworld had grown in magnitudes. The youth have been caught up in drugs. Ragging today had become very vicious, while students who are subjected to it are afraid to complain. We gave found out through a special unit that there had been 284 ragging incidents last year. This includes sexual harassment too. In some universities, it is a very strange atmosphere and even the Vice Chancellors are afraid to report these incidents as they have no protection if they do so. If students complain about it, they are unable to return to the university thereafter. Some students leave the universities as they are unable to bear the ragging. Therefore, parents are in a quandary as they dont know how to deal with this situation. This has been happening for some time, but nothing has been done about it, Rajapakshe said.
Even in the North, the drug menace is now a huge problem, noted the minister, adding that it does not seem that anyone had paid proper attention in addressing this drug menace.
Today, the drug scourge has reached unprecedented heights and had even made its way into universities. Referring to a recent incident, the minister said a minor staffer of a well-known state university had brought drugs into the university and the staff had reported the matter to the police. According to witnesses, Excise officers had arrived and taken the suspect and later the police had produced him in court on charges of possession of alcohol and he was released. What happened to the drugs The whole university is aware that he was caught with drugs. I have complained about this matter to the Finance Ministry Secretary, who had promised to conduct an investigation. We are waiting for the report, he said, adding that today there is a big problem with regard to discipline in the country.
As a means to tackle the issue of ragging in universities, the University Grants Commission has developed a new APP with the collaboration of the ICTA Institute to assist students facing ragging at universities.
When they install this App on their phones, with just a mere tap, the UGC Unit monitoring this system would be able to determine who the student was and provide assistance instantly, the minister explained.
Referring to the culture of protests in universities, Rajapakshe noted that the students at the Oluvil University had been on strike for many days and when he summoned and inquired them, he was told that they were striking over the expulsion of one student, who is an absolute thug. He disrupts all university activities and how could we adhere to the demands of the students and reinstate such a bad egg If we do so, how could we ensure the proper functioning of the university These striking students notified me that it costs them around Rs. 300,000 per trip to travel to Colombo by buses to stage these protests. They have made around seven such trips to Colombo. How could they afford this and who was funding these protests All these students who are involved in these protests are those who are on Mahapola Scholarship grants and children of low income families.
These students waste their time on the streets protesting and when its time for their exams, they get the notes from somewhere and manage to pass, the minister pointed out, adding that despite having a qualification on paper, practically, they lacked language proficiency and complete knowledge.
According to Minister Rajapakshe, many condemn international schools, but today, the international school network has widened vastly. Most students now prefer to go to Nepal, India or Bangladesh to pursue their medical degrees. This is a very pathetic situation the countrys education sector is facing, he said, emphasizing that the government should find a way to save the countrys students from this unfortunate plight.
Closing down TNL Transmission Tower:
Speaker directs Harin Fernando to attend Parliament and reply to queries
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya directed Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando, to come to Parliament and respond to queries on the TRC closing down the TNL transmission tower in Polgahawela.
The Speaker made this direction when MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena and UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana, demanded an immediate response to the matter.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said Minister Fernando had informed that he would make a detailed answer during the next Parliamentary sitting week. The Speaker instructed Minister Karunathilake to contact Minister Fernando and ask him to come to Parliament and give a reply within the course of the day.
If the minister could give a reply today (8), it would be very useful. I will also inform him, he told the House.
However, later in Parliament, Mass Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera replied to the concerns on behalf of the Government.
Underworld operating with Police, political backing:Dr. Rajapakshe
During the past 3 - 4 decades, underworld gangs have emerged strongly with the backing of either the Police high ranking officials or politicians or both. If any underworld gang came up without the backing of the police or politicians, then within a few months the police would crush them.
If there are underworld gangs that could not be controlled, then invariably they had the protection of Police officials or a politician.
If not, these drug rings or underworld operations could not survive, said Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe, joining the Second Reading of the National Defense Fund (Amendment) Bill in Parliament yesterday.
Therefore, he noted that attention needs to be paid to this drug scourge that is destroying our younger generation, by taking measures to address the issue.
In a country that had faced a long war, it is inevitable that drug related activities and the issue of illegal weapons arise, noted Rajapakshe, adding that especially drugs and the underworld could not be differentiated as they go hand in hand. We expected to establish an Independent Police Commission and with the 19th Amendment, establish an Independent Police Service without political interference. However, now the time has come to re-analyse this situation. It is questionable whether the Police was functioning independently and carrying out their duties properly.
It is not enough that the Police is merely independent. They should be efficient enough to carry out their duties to the level expected of them, added Rajapakshe.
Party leaders could make changes to MPs nominated to COPE:Speaker
The Party Leaders have space to make changes to the MPs nominated to the COPE, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to concerns raised by UPFA MP Shehan Semasinghe. Semasinghe urged the Speaker to remove the COPE members who are alleged to have obtained money from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. If those members are not ready to step down, I request the Speaker to remove them and ask the relevant parties to nominate other MPs to replace them. The Attorney General had said that certain COPE members had directly benefitted from the suspect accused of the bond scam. The COPE probed on the bond scam extensively. Having members who allegedly obtained money from the accused party, is a disgrace to the Committee as well as the Speaker.
Therefore I request for the removal of all MPs who are alleged to have obtained money from PTL beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius or had telephone conversations with him, he said.
The Speaker agreeing with the MP, said he had already conveyed that message to Party Leaders, and that the matter was discussed at several Party Leaders Meetings. Your point is taken. Nominations to the COPE are done by the respective parties.
The Party Leaders could make the necessary changes if they so wish, the Speaker replied.

The President also expressed his views regarding the illegal acts committed by various forces with ulterior movies through the use of Social Media.

We should also create a generation nourished with moral values while utilising modern technology to the benefits of society.

Sportmen and women participating in international events should first get clearance from the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA) who will issue a certificate. All sports associations are expected to submit their athletes details one month prior to the international event.
This directive was made by Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha and the SLADA officially announced it at a press conference held at the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media auditorium yesterday.
Speaking at the press briefing the Sports Minister said, We need to set up some system when it comes to an international event, and anti-doping clearance certificates is a must.
We need to ensure our countrys reputation because of these anti-doping issues. Susanthika Jayasinghe was able to win a silver medal because the gold medalist was found guilty of doping.
At the Ministry we are more concerned about doping because in rugby and weightlifting some sports athletes feel that if you used banned substances they can get good results. But on the legal side we are keeping a close eye on the doping problem because it can create huge issues. We should protect our future generation and wip e out the doping culture among the sportsmen and women  the Minister said.
The Minister also conveyed his best wishes to the 15th Asia/Oceania Region inter government Ministerial meeting on anti-doping in sports.
The Sri Lanka Anti-Doping agency will be hosting the 15th Asia/Oceania Region inter government Ministerial meeting on anti-doping in sports for the first time on 18-19 June at the Kingsbury Hotel.
The event organized by SLADA is designed to promote, co-ordinate and monitor the fight against doping in sports. Twenty-eight countries including Sri Lanka out of 45 members countries will present their progress reports, for co-operation and partnership between the anti-doping organizations of Asia and Oceania.
Chairman of SLADA Professor Arjuna de Silva also shared his views at the press conference and revealed that there is a leading herbal syrup (Ayurveda Remedy) that has caused doping issues because it contains 8% to 10% percent alcohol in the herbal syrup. Its similar to alcohol percentages in a wine bottle. Im telling this with scientific evidence, de Silva said.

Royal go out favourites against St. Peter's
High riding Royal College Colombo will go out with a clear edge against unpredictable St.Peters College Bambalapitiya in their Singer A Division inter school league rugby tournament second round final match for the B.C. Anghie trophy to be played at Royal College Sports Complex today at 4:00pm. 
The Royal lads under the leadership of winger Sabith Feroz have an unblemished record in this years ongoing league rugby tournament where they are yet to lose a game this season being the only team in the league to be unbeaten. 
Royal cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards who have given a sensational display this season together with their whole eight dominating the set pieces and having abundance of ball position through line outs, rucks and mauls. Spear headed 
by crack flanker cum vice-captain Maleesha Madumevan , prop forwards Sasitha Siyath, Samadi Induwara, number eight Himantha Hirushan and second row forward Fadil Adahan. Along with their speedy three quarter line scoring tries through their famous three quarter moves. Also they have a reliable place kicker in full back Dulan Gunawardena and his contribution in this match with his kicking boot will be vital for a Royalist victory. 
On the other hand St.Peters College possesses a good team with play maker Jason Karunaratne along with their entire three quarter line can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school but has been blowing hot and cold and is feeling the unexpected loss they had against their arch rivals St.Josephs College last week. 
Meanwhile this will be a do or die battle for St.Peters College and if they lose this battle to Royal College today in this match, then it could be worse for them as they might slip further down in the rankings. 
Kingswood  Wesley  
 
The confrontation between Kingswood College Kandy and Wesley College Colombo in the Singer A Division inter-Schools league rugby second round match for the L.E. Blaze Trophy at Race Course grounds in Colombo , should turn out to be a close affair today. The match is due to kick off at 4.00 pm. 
Kingswood who won against Zahira College last week under the Consultant coaching of dedicated and hardworking former Sri Lanka national head coach Ronny Ibrahim will have a slight edge today. 
The forte of the Kingswood College team has been their speedy three quarter line hence today they will give a torrid time to the Wesley outfit. 
Wesley lost badly to Trinity outfit last week, hence they will have to be at their very best if they are to at least make a match of it against the formidable Kingswood team, as to date the Kingswood lads looks a much better team comparatively to Wesley boys. 
Going by the two team's starting line ups and the performance so far in this ongoing league tournament, this will be a very close game and the team who played better in the first half will have a clear chance to pull pff this game

Shocked to see charge sheeted VC appointed as MP - Minister
A former vice chancellor of the South Eastern University facing a list of charges currently being investigated by the University Grants Commission, has ironically taken oaths as an MP last morning, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr.Wijayadasa Rajapakshe told Parliament yesterday.
The former Vice Chancellor has had many charges levelled against him. Even the CoPE Committee had received a host of complaints that he was maintaining his home expenses, including water bills and electricity bills with university funds. I was shocked to note that this person who is facing many charges, Dr. Ismail had in fact taken oaths as an MP yesterday morning.
His charge sheet is very long and the CoPE Committee had recommended that he be investigated, which is currently being done by the University Grants Commission. But shockingly, he has taken oaths as an MP. This is not a political party issue, but this is the reality we face today,Rajapaksha said.
Many issues had been reported at the South Eastern University and the government had taken measures to appoint a new Vice Chancellor.But he too is finding it very hard to carry on his duties due to the issues at the university.
In fact some female students have complained to us that a lecturer named S.M. Alif is demanding sexual favours from the female students and if they dont comply, they would not be passed. We have received many complaints about him, the Higher Education Minister said.

Twenty-eight countries including Sri Lanka out of 45 members countries will present their progress reports, for co-operation and partnership between the anti-doping organizations of Asia and Oceania.
Chairman of SLADA Professor Arjuna de Silva also shared his views at the press conference and revealed that there is a leading herbal syrup (Ayurveda Remedy) that has caused doping issues because it contains 8% to 10% percent alcohol in the herbal syrup. Its similar to alcohol percentages in a wine bottle. Im telling this with scientific evidence, de Silva said.

Sri Lanka rally to 125-5 at lunch against West Indies
PORT SPAIN June8: Sri Lanka lost the vital wicket of captain Dinesh Chandimal in the final over before lunch to slip deeper into trouble at 125 for five in reply to the West Indies first innings total of 414 for eight declared on the third day of the first Test at the Queen's Park Oval on Friday.
With their immediate target of 214 to avoid the follow-on still some 89 runs away with five wickets in hand, the tourists will look to wicketkeeper-batsman Niroshan Dickwella (25 not out) and new batsman Dilruwan Perera to defy the home side.
The West Indies enjoyed immediate success on the third morning but were then frustrated by the defiance of the fifth-wicket pair until Chandimal's error of judgement.
Taking on the responsibility to repair the considerable damage done to the innings late on the second day and in the third over of the morning when Kemar Roach bowled Roshen Silva, the Sri Lankan captain played positively and dominated a 78-run stand with Dickwella.
Despite continuing assistance from the pitch for the faster bowlers who so unsettled the opposition's top-order, Chandimal and Dickwella saw off the early threat of Roach and Shannon Gabriel.
It prompted the introduction of support seamers Jason Holder and Miguel Cummins, although they failed to have any impact with the Sri Lankan pair growing in confidence and working towards rebuilding the innings from the depths of 43 for four.
Holder finally summoned his lone specialist spinner, Devendra Bishoo, into the attack but it was the return of Gabriel for the last over before the break which brought about the potentially critical breakthrough.
Chandimal, well set and looking good on 44, immediately went after a short, wide delivery and miscued an attempted cut to offer a simple catch to Roston Chase at backward point, his third of the innings.
Brief scores: Sri Lanka 125-5 (D. Chandimal 44; S. Gabriel 2-30, K. Roach 2-34)
Sri Lanka's shell-shocked demeanour appeared to be the combined result of the West Indies fast bowlers' assault and the resilience of the hosts' lower-order batting built around an excellent unbeaten 125 by Dowrich.
His innings spanned over six hours and included 12 fours off 325 deliveries.
Yet it would not have been possible without the stubborn support of Devendra Bishoo, who contributed 40 in a seventh-wicket stand of 102 and Roach, whose innings of 39 in an eighth-wicket partnership of 75, appeared to thoroughly deflate the opposition.
In the face of mounting criticism over his continued place in the team, Dowrich responded in the best possible manner with a determined effort.
He reached the century-mark off the final ball before tea, turning a delivery from Rangana Herath through square-leg and showed greater adventure at the start of the final period of the day.
It was an innings that will nevertheless be remembered more for its doggedness than the extravagance which he curtailed to a considerable degree.
Dowrich's partnership with Bishoo began late on the first day and continued deep into the afternoon session of day two when the lower-order player eventually fell, senior seamer Suranga Lakmal taking a deserved second wicket of the innings via a catch at gully by Silva as Bishoo flashed once too often at the faster bowlers to again fall short of a maiden Test half-century.
With concerns over the fitness of Lakmal and champion left-arm spinner Herath clearly hampering his ability to engage his bowling resources as effectively as he wanted to, Chandimal employed his other options without success.  AFP

Tendulkar junior picked for India Under-19 team
NEW DELHI, Thursday - Arjun Tendulkar, son of Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar, was on Thursday named in an Under-19 squad for two four-day matches in Sri Lanka.
Arjun, 18, was picked as part of a 15-member squad by the country's junior selection committee, according to a press release by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
An all-rounder who bowls and bats left-handed, Arjun has been playing junior cricket for Mumbai.
Standing at over six feet, the left-arm quick bowler has claimed 18 wickets from five domestic matches at the U-19 level including a five-wicket haul. He came under the international spotlight when he bowled in the nets in the lead-up to the Lord's Test between England and South Africa in 2017.
Arjun was however overlooked for the five one-dayers which the juniors will play during the July 11-August 11 tour after the four-day games.
Sachin, revered in cricket-mad India, also began his career with Mumbai's junior team before being picked for the senior side at the age of 15.
He scored an unbeaten century on his debut in the Ranji Trophy, Indian cricket's inter-state championship.
He won his first cap for India a year later before going on to become the highest scorer in the history of Test cricket as well as the first player to score 100 international centuries. He retired in 2013.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
TrinityZahira at Pallekelle
Trinity who are brimming with confidence after their win last week go out firm favorites when they clash with Zahira College in their inter school Cup competition rugby encounter at Pallekelle. It was evident at the last outing that the Trinitarians have a powerful set of forwards and their quarters moved gallantly and their forte is to attack from the moment they are on the move. Zahirians who did well in the first half of their last game failed to do so in the second half, this was due to the entire team observing Ramadan fast. They too have plenty of talent and experience behind them. Trinitians are placed 6th in the table and Zahirians are 8th. The game will kick off at 3.30 p.m, because Zahira College players who are fasting have to break fast at 6.25 p.m.
Blaze trophy - Kingswood in Colombo to play Wesley
Kingswood College will play Wesley College in their 2nd round Cup game at Race course in Colombo for the L.E. Blaze trophy.

TRUMP COULD INVITE KIM TO U.S.
US: US President Donald Trump said he would consider inviting North Korea's Kim Jong-un to the White House if their summit in Singapore goes well.
Trump made the comment after meeting Japan's PM Shinzo Abe to discuss the 12 June summit.
He said it was possible an agreement to end the Korean War could be reached, though he called that "the easy part" of the negotiations.
"It's what happens after that that is really important," he told reporters.
The US and its regional allies want to see North Korea give up its nuclear weapons but Trump acknowledged that it "will take longer" than one meeting to realise that goal.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking later at the White House, said Kim Jong-un had indicated to him personally that he was willing to denuclearise - although it is not clear if that means North Korea is coming closer to the US vision of what that entails.
Trump has previously had a policy of placing "maximum pressure" on North Korea to force it to change course.
But he said he did not want to use the term anymore "because we're going into a friendly negotiation" but he warned he had many more sanctions he could use against North Korea.
He also said he was "totally prepared to walk" if the summit did not go well, but if it did go well an invitation to Mr Kim to visit Washington was not out of the question.
"Certainly if it goes well, I think it might be well received," he told reporters. "I think [Kim] would look at it very favourably so I think that could happen."
But, when asked about a report a day ago that Trump might invite Kim to his Florida retreat Mar-a-Lago, he quipped: "Maybe we'll start with the White House, what do you think"
Earlier, Trump said he did not think preparation was essential for his meeting with the North Korean leader.
"I think I'm very well prepared. I don't think I have to prepare very much. It's about attitude, it's about willingness to get things done," he said.
Trump also dismissed speculation that US basketball player Dennis Rodman - who has visited North Korea several times and is a friend of Mr Kim's - had been invited to the summit."I like him. He's a nice guy. No, he was not invited," he said.
Meanwhile, the White House on Thursday ruled out any role for retired basketball star Dennis Rodman - who has formed an unlikely friendship with Kim Jong Un - in next week's scheduled summit between the North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump.
Rodman, the former Chicago Bulls forward, has made five trips to Pyongyang since Kim took power and once called the North Korean leader his "friend for life."

Union urges strict implementation of taximeter rule
The All Island Three-Wheel Drivers Union had urged the government to make taximeters compulsory for all three-wheelers from June 20, to regulate the three-wheeler industry.
The All Island Three-Wheel Drivers Union President, Lalith Dharmasekara, addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, said this is the only way to make the three-wheeler industry a disciplined and safe public transport mode in the country.
It was our union that first introduced taximeters, on January 5, 2005. Therefore, we are 100 percent in favour of making the taximeter compulsory for all three-wheelers. Those who opposed to taximeters previously still maintain the same stance, citing various reasons. But, these types of regulations are necessary to protect honour and dignity of the profession, he added.
Several gazette notifications making taximeters mandatory for all three-wheelers were issued in 2013 and 2017. But, no action was taken to implement the regulations. The government should at least make taximeters compulsory for all three-wheelers operating in the Western Province, he added.

Must do better Halep into third Roland Garros final, faces Stephens
PARIS, Thursday - Simona Halep vowed to erase the misery of her 2017 Roland Garros heartbreak after reaching her third French Open final on Thursday where she will face US Open winner Sloane Stephens for the title.
Halep, the runner-up in 2014 and 2017, enjoyed a 6-1, 6-4 victory over 2016 champion and third seed Garbine Muguruza of Spain.
Stephens, who won her maiden Slam title in New York last year, defeated fellow American and close friend Madison Keys 6-4, 6-4 having previously never got beyond the quarter-finals in Paris.
I am really happy that I won the match, it was very important for my mind and I gave it all I had, said Romanian star Halep.
After racing through the first set, Halep saved three break points in a marathon ninth game of the second which lasted 13 minutes.
I think I played one of my best matches on clay against a great opponent, added Halep, who will be appearing in her fourth final at the majors having also been beaten in Australia in January.
I was 2-4 down in the second set but I knew I had to fight for every ball, push her back and play the way I did in the first set. Halep has now defeated Muguruza in both their meetings on clay and will also retain the world number one ranking next week.
However, her sights now turn to the final where she is desperate to erase the memories of last years horror show where she surrendered a set and a 3-0 lead to lose to Jelena Ostapenko.
I have another chance to be in the final and hope to do better than last year.
She boasts a 5-2 career lead over Stephens including both their meetings on clay.
The Americans last win over the 26-year-old Halep was five years ago.
Halep raced into a 5-0 lead in the first set against misfiring 2016 champion Muguruza who had blasted Maria Sharapova off court on Wednesday for the loss of just three games.
The 24-year-old Spaniard stopped the rot in the sixth game before Halep quickly reasserted her authority.
A sweeping, running forehand into an open court gave her the set with Muguruza having managed just two winners.
It was the first set that the Wimbledon champion had dropped at Roland Garros this year. She also failed to win a single service game in the opener. Muguruza settled down in the second set, moving 2-0 ahead before Halep levelled in the eighth game.
That set the stage for the lengthy ninth game where Halep stood firm.
The spirit ebbed away from Muguruza, who converted just two of the eight break points she carved out, and a backhand which sailed long sealed her fate in the 10th game.
Its Simonas third final in Roland Garros, she has a great level. Shes the favourite, said Muguruza.
Stephens defeated Keys in straight sets when she won the US Open last September.
On Thursday, it was more of the same as the 25-year-old capitalised on her friends big match nerves.
Its really hard to play against a great friend, but I am pleased to be in the final for the first time, said Stephens who will rise to four in the world thanks to her deepest run in the French capital.
This is one of my favourite tournaments. Its another great opportunity and I am looking forward to it.
In the first all-American womens semi-final in Paris since 2002, the 10th seeded Stephens broke in the third game of the opening set.
That was sufficient in a set where 13th seeded Keys committed 23 unforced errors.
Stephens, who had been just two points from being knocked out by Camila Giorgi in the third round, was quickly 2-0 ahead in the second.
She went to 5-2 on a double break and although Keys rallied, the statistics made brutal reading. She finished with 41 unforced errors with Stephens only needing to fire nine winners to get her home.  AFP

The more they agitated trying to clear their names from the Perpetual Treasuries quagmire, the more they stuck in it exposing how deep the wheeler-dealing has run in contemporary Sri Lankan politics.
While denying benefitting from PTL Beneficiary Owner Arjun Aloysius, the members of both sides pointed fingers at each other disclosing more ugly information only to reinforce what the public presumed for some time now.
Then again, some of those claims were not without distorted facts and fabricated stories designed to insult their political opponents.
Needless to say, Aloysius is not the only influential businessman having unholy nexus with political fraternity. The larger picture of this issue is a strong wake-up call to give serious thought on introducing campaign finance regulations. If investigated deep into the can of worms that has been opened, more interesting revelations may follow.
All MPs in hot water
As the speculations gathered steam and spread fast, the MPs of both sides started complaining the Speaker that they have been finding it difficult to go back to their villages and move with the people due to unfounded allegations.
Many MPs called on the Speaker to reveal the names if such a list exists as all 225 MPs were in hot water. The allegations however sparked from the revelations by one among themselves, namely MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, in Parliament the other day when he tried to downplay and generalize his act of receiving money from businessmen with clout for election campaigning.
The embers that were stirred soon became burning flames as MPs went on accusing their fellow MPs in rival groups, sometimes even by naming them, of involving in shadowy wheeler-dealing. Their heated exchange of words in Parliament at times resounded like thief shouting thief. Not stopping at that, JO MP Ranjith de Soysa stoop to discredit a few respected civil society members by linking them to the controversial list.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, being the custodian of all 225 MPs, was seen worried over the serious allegations against the MPs and the impact they have on the dignity of the House. He was keen on receiving the full report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) that looked into the questionable Central Bank Treasury Bonds issuance to deal with the matter head on.
Missing annexures
The Speaker, however, strongly believed that a list of MPs who obtained money from Aloysius was not existing and he told Parliament that it was a canard like wanda pethi (sterilization pills) in Ampara. All the responsible authorities confirmed me that there is no such list, he added. He told the journalists that the report only contained a list of MPs who have had telephone conversations with Aloysius.
The PCoI report, which is more familiarly known as the bond report, was handed over to the Speaker along with the PRECIFAC final report on January 17. However, the Presidential Secretariat had then held back the many annexes of the report running to several volumes. Following the fresh requests by the Speaker, the Secretary to the President sent 11 more pages from C350-C360 of the report to Parliament on Tuesday.
The Speaker was not happy that he was once again given only a part of the requested documents. He said he was not ready to table parts of the report in the House. On behalf of the Government, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella too renewed the calls for the rest of the pages from C1-C349 of the report.
Watchdog committees get down to work
Three COPE MPs, namely Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Jayantha Samaraweera and Susantha Punchinilame, in what one might understand as an attempt to claim moral high grounds, submitted affidavits in Parliament stating that they have had no contacts with Aloysius nor had received money from him.
As they invited the other COPE MPs to follow suit, the Speaker plainly said that it was an unnecessary act. UNP MP Ajith P. Perera was also quick to point out that both Aluthgamage and Samaraweera have been indicted by court for involvement in fraud and misappropriation of public property. The Speaker could be right when he told the House recently that watchdog committees would have hardly any member left if all MPs with allegations were to be removed.
In the meantime, Parliamentary watchdog committees COPE and COPA had their first meetings this week setting in motion their work for the new session. They unanimously agreed to continue with JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti and Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna at the helm of COPE and COPA respectively. MP Handunnetti earned much admiration from all corners for his intrepid and tireless work as COPE Chairman. With his outstanding work at the committee alone he proved that Matara voters were wrong in defeating him at the last Parliamentary Elections.
Sampanthan backs SLFP nomination
The election of Deputy Speaker led to an interesting turn of events in Parliament this week. The voting pattern of the JO, the Opposition Leaders unexpected speech in favour of the SLFP, the TNAs objection to appointing a fellow Jaffna Tamil MP from the UPFA and finally the UNP clinching the Deputy Speaker post with a comfortable majority were salient features during the first secret vote in the House after 14 years.
UNP Monaragala District MP Ananda Kumarasiri succeeded the Deputy Speaker post vacated by MP Thilanga Sumathipala obtaining 44 more votes than SLFP contender Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle. MP Kumarasiri was first elected to Parliament in 1986 and has a cumulative legislative service of about nine years.
Had Fernandopulle succeeded she would have been the second female Deputy Speaker, the first being Adeline Molamure who was appointed Deputy President of the Senate in 1955 from the UNP. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reminded this to the House as a reply to the complaints of blocking a female candidate from becoming Deputy Speaker.
When the Speaker announced that a secret vote would be taken as two names were proposed, old-timer R. Sampanthan urged the House to unanimously agree on the SLFP nomination for the Deputy Speaker post in keeping with the healthy tradition that has been prevailed.
The Prime Minister did not agree with the Opposition Leader and was firm that the Deputy Speaker post has to be retained within the Government ranks. He revealed that it was the TNA which objected to the initial proposal by the Government to appoint SLFP MP Angajan Ramanathan, who is from Jaffna, as Deputy Speaker.
We bowed to your wishes in withdrawing the first candidate. Not that we went and told the SLFP that we dont want him. There was no other SLFP backbench MP remaining in the Government and none of the SLFP Deputy Ministers was willing to resign to take it over. Therefore we had no option but to propose a backbencher from the UNP, the PM reasoned.
Deep fissures in JO camp
A total of 73 MPs were absent for the vote including TNA and JVP MPs who left the main chamber as the quorum bell went off. Interestingly, despite the initial calls by JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena to unreservedly support Dr. Fernandopulle, as much as 29 MPs in the JO and SLFP Group of 16 did not turn up for the vote. They were conspicuous in their absence because some of them even spoke in the House prior to taking up the vote.
The fissures in the JO group were apparent as some JO MPs dodged the vote and remained at the Parliament canteen for the entire period of secret vote which lasted for about one hour and 45 minutes. For the utter disappointment of the JO, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, his brother Chamal and son Namal were all absent at the time of voting though they were present in the House earlier on the day.
MPs Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and T B Ekanayake in the SLFP Group of 16 also chose to be absent regardless that Dr. Fernandopulle is a member of their own group.
As per the Parliament records, the last secret vote was taken in April 2004 to elect the Speaker when the names of both W J M Lokubandara and D E W Gunesekara were proposed. The sittings went on till around 11 pm that day and three rounds of vote had to be conducted as it was a tie at the previous two occasions. At the final round Lokubandara was elected with a razor-thin margin of one vote, long-serving senior Parliamentary Official Janakantha De Silva recollected.

Sri Lanka took good measures to protect labour rights
Sri Lanka has achieved a number of significant achievements in the labour field including preventing child labour, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing the Plenary Meeting of the 107th Session of the International Labour Conference (ILC) being held in Geneva from May 28 - June 9 recently.
The Minister said Sri Lanka is the first country to implement a National Decent Work Plan (A proper work place) on par with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) principles, Minister Samaraweera said Sri Lanka is ready to share expertise with the ILO in preventing child labour.
'Sustained, inclusive and sustainable growth' could hardly be realized without properly addressing the inequalities in the labour field,' the Minister said.
"Sri Lanka has given priority to 'labour rights', through its inclusion in the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021. Sri Lanka is introducing a 'single employment law', consolidating disparate laws and giving effect to the principle of non-discrimination. Sri Lanka, the Minister stressed, has also made strides in reducing hazardous forms of child labour, and in promoting the rights of the child, offering to share its expertise in this area to support the endeavours of the ILO. .
The Minister said the need to consider practical measures including flexible working hours, creating a positive atmosphere for women to join the labour market, thereby increasing productivity.
He noted the important role that trade unions could play in making workers understand the changing global work environment.

Students must be educated about wearing masks properly
Certain organisations in Matara distribute protective masks to students and I appreciate it very much, Matara Consultant Community Physician Dr. N. Y. Samaraweera said. but some times, the students wearing masks may infect others if they do not know how to use a mask properly, he said.
The Matara Health Services District Director. Deputy Director, the Matara General Hospital Director and other health authorities are in the same view. Persons suffering from Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI), cough, cold or fever must wear a mask to prevent others from the virus. Persons in the high-risk groups should use a mask whenever they are in public places, they said.
Dr. Samaraweera said students should be instructed to use the masks properly. Otherwise, they will put others at risk. Children touch their face more often and adjust their mask and hold their noses which is risky. Using a mask worn by another is also risky. they must remove the masks they wear properly. the doctor said.
The Health Services Department is carrying out awareness programmes about these matters throughout the year. A circular issued in mid-May has instructed all government and private medical institutions on how to control a RTI outbreak and every institution had followed our instructions, he said.
Health Services Deputy Director Dr. Deepika Patabendige said the media and health officials should corporate to make the public aware of in this regard
The circular specifically requested that all health education units of hospitals should carry out health education for OPD patients, in-ward patients, health staff and for visitors.
Matara Health Services Director Dr. A D U Karunarathna said a downward trend of patients being admitted RTI symptoms, fever and cough to government hospitals and private hospitals is evident now.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History:
#21 Mario Kempes
When Argentina coach Csar Luis Menotti named his squad for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, there was shock and outrage when a 17-year-old rising star from Argentinos Juniors was not picked. His name Diego Maradona.
Menotti did not want the hopes and dreams of an entire host nation to rest on the youngsters shoulders. Instead, he picked two other strikers; River Plates Leopoldo Luque and the only player who played his club football outside the country - Mario Kempes from Valencia.
Popularly known as El Matador, little did they know that Kempes would eventually be the tournaments biggest star. Wearing the no.10, he was hard to miss - what with his flowing locks that were quite the rage in the 70s and his graceful movement on the pitch.
Kempes had been in the Argentina squad in 1974 but never managed to score. The 1978 tournament saw him go scoreless again in the first group stage as Argentina advanced and people started to question Menottis decision to leave Maradona out of the squad.
Nevertheless, it was the second round of matches where Kempes came into his own. The first game against Poland not only saw him score twice but also make a goal-line save.
Yes, before the Hand of God, there was the Hand of Kempes.
After having given Argentina the lead over a highly-fancied Poland with a well-placed near-post header, Kempes made himself useful at the other end when he deliberately punched the ball away from Grzegorz Latos header that was destined for the back of the net.
Back then, this was not a red card offence (like Luis Suarez vs Ghana in 2010) and Kempes didnt even receive a warning as the Polish side were awarded a penalty - which was saved. Poland will have felt cheated as Kempes would go on to double the lead in the second half to give the Albiceleste the win.
Although they would draw 0-0 with Brazil, Kempes was on the money again in the third game when he grabbed another brace in a must-win game against Peru. Needing to win by at least four goals to make the final, Argentina would win 6-0 with Kempes scoring either side of half-time.
The final was a tense affair with Kempes first-half strike cancelled out by Dick Nanningas header in the 82nd minute. However, even though it was the Oranje that played the better football in the second half, it was Kempes who put scored a second in extra-time with a sublime dribble that took him through the heart of the Dutch defence.
He dribbled past three players and although his initial shot was saved, Kempes bundled the ball over the line to give the hosts the lead. And if that wasnt enough, he would then assist the third goal which allowed Ricardo Bertoni to put the game out of reach.
Menotti was vindicated as Kempes walked away with the Golden Boot for his six goals. The man who had been doubted and criticised at the start of the tournament became an unlikely hero in the span of a few games.
He is the man who put Argentinian football on the map. - Diego Maradona
Although the country partied well into the night, Kempes drank a couple of glasses of wine during the celebrations before quietly slipping away in the middle of the night to pack his things and return home.
I took my suitcases and headed back to my parents house in Rosario about 300 kilometres from Buenos Aires... I arrived and got my bags and my medal out of the car.
It was before seven in the morning, there was no one there. I felt very calm. When I went home, my parents were still asleep. I had a coffee and went to bed. - Kempes in The Observer
By the time the 1982 World Cup came around, Maradona had joined the squad too. Kempes, who wore the no.10 jersey in the previous campaign, was assigned the same kit in 1982 too. Back then the shirt numbers were given out in alphabetic order.
However, Maradona was obsessed with the no.10 shirt and he wanted it for himself. Being the humble and generous man Kempes was, he simply gave it to Maradona with a warm hug.
It was the passing of the torch, even if Argentina did not go far in 1982. The stage has been set for Maradona to find his feet and prosper by the time the 1986 edition came around. But that was to be Kempes last stint with the Albiceleste before he retired from international football.
Kempes was no great goalscorer. He isnt even among the top 10 goalscorers in Argentinas history. But for one World Cup, the Golden Boot was his - only the second Argentine international to win it (after Guillermo Stbile in 1930). It is why he makes it to our list of 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk

All Blacks son caught in airport conveyor belt
WELLINGTON, Friday - The one-year-old son of All Black Vaea Fifita was rushed to hospital after being injured by an airport conveyor belt, the player confirmed Friday on the eve of the first Test against France.
The toddler was somehow carried into Auckland Airports baggage handling area on Thursday as the family checked-in.
Staff at the airport were reviewing video footage to find out how the accident happened.
He had an operation on his arm and is doing okay, Fifita said. My partner and I would like to thank airport, emergency services and hospital staff for all their support.
Paula Fifita, who turns two this month, was said to be in a stable condition.
The All Blacks blindside flanker posted on Facebook last week how much he was enjoying being with his sons before they left for Tonga while he was involved in the Test series against France.
Fifita, who can also double at lock, has been named on the bench for the first Test and an All Blacks spokesman confirmed he remained in the match-day 23 despite the accident.
A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said staff were extremely surprised to discover a child in the baggage handling system.  AFP

Astonishing rise of first black Springbok captain Kolisi
JOHANNESBURG - South Africas first black Test rugby captain, Siyamthanda Siya Kolisi, had a tough childhood much like the millions of poor black children in the coastal Eastern Cape province.
And his astonishing rise to the top will inspire millions of young aspiring players for years to come, rugby analysts say.
Born to teenage parents, Siya was the eldest of three children.
He was raised in Zwide township near Port Elizabeth by a grandmother who took odd jobs as a domestic worker wherever she could to provide for the family.
My mom was too young to raise me, loose forward Kolisi told AFP ahead of his debut as captain this Saturday against England at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.
I grew up in a very difficult (environment) -- not the worst but it was difficult for me going to school and everything. The cruel, jarring conditions of the township meant it was difficult for the little boy to even dream of making it as a provincial rugby player, let alone captaining the Springboks, a team traditionally dominated by white players.
When you are in the township, you just dont dream like that.
Although financially poor, the households love of rugby was abundant.
Since the age of eight, Kolisi had a firm understanding of the game thanks to his father Fezakele, who played centre for the local team.
Kolisi played rugby for his school with great passion, despite poor equipment and infrastructure.
I see something in you. Those were the words of veteran coach Eric Songwiqi that catapulted Kolisis career.
The coach recalls the moment vividly.
Songwiqis school had just thrashed Kolisis team 50-0, but the coach spotted the fire and raw talent of Siya and approached him.
That, for me, was the biggest moment in my life.
Kolisi grabbed the opportunity with both hands and left his school in the middle of the year to participate in provincial trials.
Ill never forget those trials because I was playing in silk boxers because I didnt have shorts.
At the age of 12, he made the B team and was spotted by Andrew Hayidakis, who enticed him with a full rugby scholarship to attend Grey High School.
I STARTED DREAMING BIG
Coming from the township, not having a lot and coming to Grey, your dreams start becoming much bigger because you have everything you need to be whatever you want to be.
I started dreaming big, recalled Kolisi.
He later went on to play for the school first team, then rose to represent regional teams like the Eastern Province Kings.
In 2012 he made his debut for Cape Town-based Super Rugby side Western Stormers and was named captain last year.
The 26-year-old has worked hard to bring his big dreams to life, both on and off the field.
He married the love of his life Rachel Smith in 2016. In the four years leading up to tying the knot, the couple adopted his two half-siblings and had a child of their own.
However, the mixed-race couple have had to deal with racial slurs and insults from the public on both sides of the divide in a country with a troubled racial past.
One critic on social media referred to Rachel as a waste of good genes because she married a black. While South Africa has been a democratic, multi-racial society since 1994, racial tensions have spilt into the post-apartheid era and remain strong.
But no one was more thrilled when Siya was named captain than his wife.
When I told my wife she put the phone down on me. But she called me back and asked me to repeat what I was saying, Kolisi said.
Obviously, it was before it was announced, but she was so happy that she wanted to tell people.
South African editor Pieter du Toit wrote: He (Siya) will also represent generations of men who were denied the opportunity to don the old green jersey.
Kolisi will bring a sense of healing to a sport and nation scarred by racial inequality and social injustices.  AFP

Bill to absorb SAITM students to KDU
The Government presented a Bill to provide for the absorption of medical students registered with the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University.
The Bill was presented for the first reading by Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe.
According to the Bill, students registered with the SAITM between September 15, 2009 and May 15, 2017, will be absorbed to the Kotelawala University to follow the MBBS Degree programme if they have obtained basic qualifications.As per the Bill the basic qualifications mean 3 Simple passes for Chemistry, Physics and Biology at the Advanced Level Examination or an equivalent foreign qualification.

The minister said the Bill was discussed with all relevant stakeholders and all of them agreed to it except a certain Students Union. The minister insisted that justice must be meted out to 980 students registered with SAITM, and asked as to why the JO is opposed to it.

Changing face of Colombo
Colombo is in the news again and for all the right reasons. The countys commercial capital is seeing rapid development in a variety of sectors, that has made it the fastest growing city in South Asia. The Megapolis initiative has been a blessing for the City, which has its fair share of problems that have to be addressed without delay.
Colombo is changing so much that the Survey Department recently released a new map for Colombo that includes the biggest investment project ever in Sri Lanka  the US$ 1.4 billion Port City, also known as the Colombo International Financial Centre. The Port City will add an extra two square kilometres to Colombos land area, with which it will be connected by an underpass and other roads. The project will be fully completed by 2040, but the first few buildings are likely to come up by 2020.
Colombos lifeline is the internationally renowned Port, which recently achieved a significant milestone of becoming the second fastest growing port worldwide after Singapore. The Port of Colombo recorded a 16.2% growth for the 1st quarter 2018 over same quarter last year in container handling. With this growth, the Port of Colombo has leaped ahead of many other Asian Ports, Major European Ports and Dubai as well. The Colombo Port expects to handle 7.0 million containers in 2018, up 12.9 percent from the 6.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) handled in 2017. Colombo Port was also ranked the 13th best connected port in the world in 2017, moving up five places from 18, a year earlier, according to an index compiled by Drewry, a UK based shipping and maritime consultancy.
Colombo will also be getting several world class chain hotels soon. The Shangri La is already open and Sheraton, Grand Hyatt, Ritz Carlton, J W Marriott and several others are in the pipeline. In fact, the towers housing the Ritz Carlton in Fort will be the tallest in Colombo at 92 floors. Add the many high-rise residential complexes to the mix and Colombos skyline will look vastly different just five years from now. Commendably, several housing schemes have also been planned for low income families in Colombo.
The authorities must also ensure that the Lotus Tower, another grandiose project from the Rajapaksa era, does not end up becoming a white elephant like so many other projects initiated by that Government. The Lotus Tower is already being mentioned in foreign tourist brochures, so the onus is on the telecom and tourist authorities to properly market and manage it profitably.
However, being euphoric about these developments cannot hide the fact that the City does have many problems. For one, its ancient drainage system cannot cope with the pace of development, which leads to flash floods in Colombo and other health hazards. A solution has already been proposed in the form of two underground mega drains which will cost Rs. 5,800 million to build. The entire city drainage system has to be overhauled, considering the number of new developments in the offing.
Perhaps the biggest problem facing Colombo is traffic. With around 100,000 vehicles entering Colombo per day, not to mention the addition of around 1,000 newly registered vehicles per day to city roads, all the ingredients for chaos are complete. Most roads cannot be widened or expanded anymore, which leads to gridlock. Idling in traffic leads to a huge loss of man-hours, energy and fuel (remember, Sri Lanka is a net oil importer). Given that the Government cannot restrict the purchase of automobiles, the next best thing is to develop public transport that has the potential of keeping some of the private vehicles away from the roads. This is why there is much hope over the proposed Light Rail Transit (LRT) for Colombo and environs. Unlike the jam-packed normal buses and trains, the LRT will be a cleaner, faster and more comfortable means of transport that can entice at least some of the motorists. One can consider the LRT a victory even if just 500 cars are taken off the road per day.
One can also look forward to the fading away of that other menace to all road users in the City  the ubiquitous three wheeler, as that market segment is moving to the four-wheeled Qaudricycles. It is time that laws are brought into phase out the three wheelers by around 2030 at least in the Western Province. The ride hailing industry should be further encouraged  many people in Colombo already ditch their cars for short journeys and opt for these services as it takes away the stress of driving and having to find a parking spot.
Much has already been said about the garbage problem in Colombo, but the time has also come to focus on doing our part. Minimising the use of plastics has become the number one priority, in line with the 3R mantra  Reduce, Re-Use and Recycle. Colombo is still one of the greenest cities in South Asia  residents and visitors alike must do everything possible to keep it that way.

Coalition of unity under threat
Unity in diversity is a situation that many would seek, to achieve progress in society. What we see today is political disunity in the structure of government, with calls for unity on one side, countered with demands for separation by the other. This is certainly no easy task, for the two leaders of the Coalition of Unity is in governance today, to keep its government going till the time for elections come and the sovereignty of the people is again made known.
President Sirisenas recent criticisms of the very core of the Yahapalanaya strategies, at the birthday memorial of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, are resonating in the arena of politics; with wider demonstrations of the divisions within the SLFP  the smaller party of the ruling coalition, while being the party of the Governments leader and Head of State.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attempted to prevent a public dispute on the issue of coalition unity with a call for silence from UNPers in government. But, criticism of the 100-Day Programme by President Sirisena, and public statements that he did not know of its origins, required answering, which members of the UNP Working Committee have done.
Election of the Deputy Speaker of Parliament brought into focus the issue of disunity within the government, and aspects of disunity among the SLFP and Joint Opposition (JO). While the former Deputy Speaker, Thilanga Sumathipala was from the SLFP, the candidate from the SLFP for the vacancy after his resignation could not be elected. Dr. Sundarshani Fernandopulle of the SLFP, who now sits in the Opposition benches with the 16 cross-overs from the government, was defeated by UNP backbencher Ananda Kumarasiri, who poled 97 with Dr. Fernandopulle receiving 53 votes, in the secret ballot.
This election brought into focus other divisions in government and the opposition, with the TNAs Mr. Sampanthan clearly stating his party thought the office of Deputy Speaker should go to the SLFP as earlier agreed, and that he supported Dr. Fernandopulle. The TNA members did not participate in the vote. There were further divisions seen in the SLFP - with several members in the JO walking away from the election, without supporting the SLFP candidate. Interestingly, the JO-SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa was also not present for the vote.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe did give a political explanation as to why the UNP proposed a candidate for Deputy Speaker, when the bi-party, UNP  SLFP agreement - had been for it to be an SLFP office. As he explained, there were no SLFP backbenchers in government anymore, who could be nominated for the position. There is already an agreement that the office of Deputy Chairman of Committees would be for the Opposition. The unstated reality was that the crossover 16 of the SLFP, who now sit in the Opposition, could not be considered part of government  although they followed the leadership of President Sirisena. The Wickremesinghe explanation did have more than an echo of the voting in the No Confidence Motion on the Prime Minister!
This also raises another issue of the stuff of democracy and the parliamentary system. While parliament comprises members of rival parties sitting in Government and Opposition benches, the values of democracy require that parliamentary office should not be distributed strictly on party lines. What is best, is for the most experienced and competent MPs to be chosen for important parliamentary offices such as Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairman of Committees. The majority should vote for the best, not necessarily for the party. A government having a majority would most often have the Speaker, if the most deserving from its ranks is nominated. This should be so for the Opposition, too. It is necessary to think of transcending party rivalries, in selecting those who manage the process of parliament, for true democracy to prevail.
The Money Tree
President Sirisena has good cause to be constantly critical of the UNP on the Bond Scam issue. While the manipulation of the scam certainly had strong UNP links with the presence of Arjuna Mahendran, and his failure to prevent conflicts of interest with his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius, leading to so much of crooked dealings. But the emerging talk of Perpetual-Aloysius Money thrown around as political gifts, payoffs or kickbacks, certainly points to cross party involvement in crooked enrichment.
Former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekaras delayed admission of receiving a million rupee donation for election work, and Field Marshal Sarath Fonsekas one lakh Aloysian benefit, speaks volumes on corruption in the electoral process, with a perpetual dominance of electoral subversion. There is clearly a UNP and SLFP link in this dirt heap. The JO must also be worried.
The Dayasiri takeaway for election expenses, as we are told, has also led to him being considered one of exception for revealing the payoff. Vasudeva Nanayakkara was among those who praised Dayasiris gesture of goodness and courage, in an interview in the Observer last Sunday. It was indeed surprising to see the close comrade of one time left leaders such as Dr. N. M. Perera, Dr. Colvin R de Silva and other outstanding leftists, speak so well of Dayasiris display of courageous declaration. But the facts are very much different from what is narrated today.
Dayasiri Jayasekara did not reveal the load of cash when he received it, or even shortly after. It was a revelation in a Perpetual related case in the courts that broke the story of how an employee of Dayasiri had cashed the related cheque. That is when the former Sports Minister began his loudly vocal play, and asked for the names of all others who had received such cash. It is good to think of judging honesty and courage from the facts as they are revealed. It was back in November 2017, when the Dayasiri Jayasekaras connection to Perpetual Aloysius was first revealed, at the Bond Commission sitting. It related to the many phone calls that Arjun Aloysius had with MPs - some COPE members. Dayasiri Jayasekara is known to have had 18 phone calls to and from Aloysius. There was no talk of the million rupee election donation at that time.
As reported in the Daily Mirror of November 22, 2017, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara admitted there was a major issue in the fact that members of the COPE Committee had conversations with Arjun Aloysius. Yes of course there is an issue. We will all be able to see the outcomes of this once action is filed, he said, in response to questions by journalists at the weekly cabinet media briefing yesterday.
However, Jayasekara defended the two calls and meeting he had with Aloysius, and said that he found no need to declare meeting Aloysius at any point.
Yes I met with him once and we spoke on the phone twice. But I dont think it was needed to declare to anyone that I met him, he said. Jayasekara, while admitting that there were more than two conversations with Aloysius went on to say that he knew Aloysius previously.
It is certainly a mockery of the public to show Dayasiri Jayasekara as a heroic politician for his much delayed admission of receiving so much cash from Arjun Aloysius, even though he may have known him earlier, and even as an election cost donation. What he did was to admit what was exposed. The donation to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, much smaller, also for elections, shows this to be part of wider electoral corruption. We now have the Attorney Generals Department informing court that W. M. Mendis & Co (an associate company of Perpetual Treasuries) gave two cheques of Rs One Million each to an unnamed Minister of State. How many more of active politicians, elected or nominated, would have received such crooked bonanzas One must not forget that several nominated MPs did contest the polls in 2015 and lost.
A Parliament Motion
It is unlikely that the Presidential Commission report would have names of MPs and others who received such money. The probe did not go in that direction. Whether such a report comes out or not, it is the duty of our politicians, if they are not crooked, to take their own action to expose the dirty, within politics and without.
This money tree is certainly the most crooked aspect of political reality in this country. Whether there are 116 such recipients or 180 of them from whatever profession or lifestyle, it seems time for those in Parliament, elected and nominated, to adopt a motion, calling for all those who definitely did not obtain any such money to make a public declaration, recorded in Hansard: and call for investigations into the cash and electoral expenses of those who remain silent. That is one way to clean up our politics, moving on to major changes in the laws governing electoral organisation and expenditure.
Members of Parliament from every party must have the courage to take such a step to clean their own images among the people.

The complete guide to footballs biggest tournament
Goal takes a look back at the biggest sporting event in the world, the most successful teams, best players and more. The 21st edition of footballs biggest tournament will take place from June 14 in Russia who joins a long list of host nations in staging the World Cup.
Excitement is beginning to spread across the globe as the 32 finalists booked their place in the prestigious competition where they will attempt to write their names into the history books.
With the groups now known and the tournament itself under three months away, Goaltakes a look at the history of the World Cup as well as some of the record holders.
WHAT IS THE WORLD CUP
The FIFA World Cup is an international football tournament featuring the senior national teams from around the globe. It was first launched in 1930 and takes place every four years.
Teams under FIFAs umbrella are eligible to compete and they must qualify for the final stage of the tournament, with qualification rounds divided according to confederational affiliation.
Aside from 1942 and 1946, when it was disrupted by the Second World War, the World Cup has run continuously since its inception.
HOW MANY TEAMS COMPETE IN THE WORLD CUP
The current format of the World Cup sees 32 finalists take part in the competition but that was not always the case and, indeed, will not always be.
Just 13 teams competed in the first World Cup and that number expanded to 16 from 1934 to 1978 (with some exceptions).
In 1982, the World Cup expanded to include eight more teams, bringing the total number of participants to 24. The format we are familiar with today - 32 teams - was first introduced in the 1998 World Cup in France. That is set to change, however, with FIFA confirming that the 2026 World Cup will feature 48 finalists - a remarkable increase of 16 teams.
WHO WON THE FIRST WORLD CUP
The first World Cup in 1930 was hosted and won by Uruguay.
It was markedly different to the tournament that we know today in that it was an invitational and it featured just 13 teams, seven of which came from South America.
Four teams from Europe participated, with Mexico and the United States completing the line-up.
The final, which was held at Montevideos Estadio Centenario, was an all-South American affair as hosts Uruguay took on Argentina.
Uruguay won the inaugural World Cup thanks to a 4-2 victory in front of over 68,000 fans.
WHO HAS WON THE MOST WORLD CUPS
Only eight countries have won the World Cup since its foundation in 1930 and Brazil are the most successful, having been crowned champions on five occasions.
The nation that spawned talents such as Pele, Ronaldo and Romario won the World Cup for the first time in 1958 before also coming out on top in 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002.
Italy and current holders Germany have each won the World Cup four times (though Germany won it three times as West Germany), while Argentina and Uruguay have both won it twice.
England, France and Spain have all won the World Cup on one occasion.
WHO IS THE WORLD CUPS ALL-TIME TOP GOALSCORER
The all-time top scorer in the history of the World Cup is Miroslav Klose, who scored 16 goals for Germany over the course of four tournaments.
Former Brazil star Ronaldo follows with 15 goals in three tournaments, while Gerd Muller scored 14 in just two tournaments.
Comparatively, Germany and Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller has played in just two World Cups, but he has registered 10 goals, making him the only active player with such a tally.
WHO HAS THE MOST WORLD CUP APPEARANCES
Germany midfielder Lothar Matthaus holds the record for most World Cup appearances having played in 25 games over a remarkable five tournaments (spanning 20 years).
Matthaus is closely followed by his compatriot Miroslav Klose, with Italy legend Paolo Maldini rounding out the top three.
Diego Maradona played in four World Cups and made 21 appearances, while Brazils 2002 World Cup-winning captain Cafu and Germanys 2014 leader Philipp Lahm each played 20 times.
WORLD CUP TROPHY
The winners of the World Cup are awarded the unmistakable gold FIFA World Cup trophy. Introduced at the 1974 World Cup, it was designed by Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga and is made of 18-karat gold with a malachite base.
Describing his creation, Gazzaniga said: The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.
The trophy is 36.8 centimetres tall (14.5 inches) and it weighs 6.175 kilograms (13.61 pounds).
WHAT IS THE JULES RIMET TROPHY
As mentioned, the current World Cup trophy was first introduced in 1974 and a different prize was awarded to the tournament victors prior to that.
From 1930 to 1970, the trophy given to the World Cup winners was the Jules Rimet Cup and it was quite different to Gazzanigas subsequent design. French sculptor Abel Lafleur was commissioned by FIFA to design the trophy and he produced a famous product that became the emblem of the early World Cups.
The trophy, which was named Victory, featured the Greek goddess for victory, Nike, holding an octagonal cup above her head.
It was made out of gold-plated sterling silver and featured a marble base (which was replaced by lapis lazuli in 1954).
Victory was renamed the Jules Rimet Cup in 1946 in honour of former FIFA president Jules Rimet, who played a key role in the establishment of the tournament.
In keeping with original World Cup rules, Brazil were allowed to keep the trophy when they won the tournament for the third time in 1970. However, it was stolen in 1983 and has never been found since.

Customs begins probe into undervalued BMWs
Sri Lanka Customs has resumed an investigation into an alleged massive fraud amounting to Rs.16 billion when importing 1,675 of BMW vehicles.
The fraud is alleged to have taken place when Chulananda Perera was the Director General of Customs.
This is considered as the largest ever customs fraud in Sri Lanka.The alleged fraud had taken place by presenting forged documents to the Customs after concealing the real value of 1,675 BMW vehicles.
Customs had initiated an inquiry into a complaint made by a vehicle importer against the penalty imposed on the importer. Subsequently, an appeal was also filed demanding to increase the penalty citing that the penalty is not at a sufficient amount.
It was revealed that a penalty of Rs. 100,000 had been imposed on each vehicle which were fraudulently imported by vehicle importers.
The vehicles worth more than 25,000 USD are not exempt from taxes. But, tax exemptions had been received for BMWs worth over USD 30,000 each by furnishing fictitious invoices which placed the value well under US$ 25,000 when Chulananda Perera was functioning as the Director General of Customs.

EU commends SLs progress in protecting, enhancing human rights
The European Union, during the third meeting of the Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights under the European Union-Sri Lanka Joint Commission, commended efforts by the Sri Lankan government for its progress in protecting and enhancing human rights.
The commission has urged the government to address issues relating to religious and ethnic hatred and to maintain zero tolerance for hate speech and crimes. The meeting took place in the context of Sri Lanka being granted access to the EU for its exports under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) in May 2017.
The decision of the EU to accord such preferences was taken in exchange for Sri Lanka's commitment to effectively implement the international conventions that it has ratified on human rights, labour conditions, the protection of the environment and good governance. It also demonstrates the EUs commitment to support the Government of Sri Lankas reform and reconciliation agenda.
Progress has been made by the Government of Sri Lanka in protecting and enhancing human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country. A number of important measures have been taken, including the operationalisation of the Office on Missing Persons, the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the passing of the Right to Information Bill. The EU drew attention to the importance of Sri Lanka making prompt and concrete progress in fulfilling international commitments on human rights and labour rights as well as environmental protection.
There was a detailed exchange of information on many important ongoing reforms, such as the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to bring them in line with international standards, and the status of the Constitution. The participants agreed on the need to make further progress on reconciliation. To this end, the full implementation of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution of October 2015, including the urgent return of land, remains a priority. The EU reiterated its readiness to continue supporting the Government in advancing national reconciliation.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group will be reported to the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission to be held later this year in Brussels. The Joint Commission will then assess the progress achieved since todays meeting.
The delegation of the European Union was led by Caroline Vinot, Head of Division for Regional Affairs and South Asia of the European External Action Service. Anchor The delegation of Sri Lanka was led by Shobini Gunasekera, Director-General for European Union, Commonwealth and Multilateral Treaties Division of the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Sri Lanka.

From fat to fit on road to the All Blacks for prop Tuinukuafe
The giant loosehead prop still has to pinch himself to make sure his whirlwind rise to the top is not a dream, while even All Blacks coach Steve Hansen was asking Karl who.
There was a season in France with Narbonne and a some domestic rugby in New Zealand before a string of injuries to the Waikato Chiefs saw him promoted to Super Rugby as a fill-in prop three months ago.
A further injury to All Black prop Tim Perry and the 25-year-old giant was rushed into the Test squad with a seat on the bench for the first Test against France in Auckland on Saturday. You have to do the job first and Ill think about it later, Tuinukuafe said Thursday when asked how it felt to be propelled into the All Blacks spotlight.
If it were not for the All Blacks he would most likely be at his security job this weekend.
It was mostly a desk job but Id get on the doors at night sometimes to get some extra money in for working at clubs and stuff, he said when explaining his previous life.
From my heaviest before coming back to rugby, probably (Ive lost) about 30, maybe 40 kilos.
It was 2014. The doc was telling me to lose weight. I was complaining about a bit of pain in my legs and stuff and he was explaining about all the bad health decisions, like eating and stuff was just leading to a heart attack.
So when he told me to lose weight the easiest way was to play rugby with my brothers and my family.
Hansen said Tuinukuafes story was proof that a player did not have to be noticed young and be put through an academy to make it to the All Blacks.
Id never heard of him before he got to the Chiefs and I dont think the Chiefs had until they had to go and find him, Hansen said.
It was one of those seasons for the Chiefs where theyve had a humongous amount of injuries, particularly at loosehead prop, and they had to go deep into the well.
When I say I hadnt heard of him, I mean he wasnt someone who was sitting on top of our radar. Obviously we knew he had played rugby before and we knew a little bit about him but hes not someone youd say, Hey lets keep an eye on this guy because hes going to be the future.
Hansen added his progress was fastracked by others injuries but said Tuinukuafe had seized the opportunity.
Hes raw, as youd expect with the history hes got, but hes a good scrummager.
Tuinukuafe said that being an All Black gave him a chance to repay New Zealand for the opportunities given to his parents.
I was born here but my parents were born in Tonga, (and) grandparents born in Tonga, but this country gave them opportunities for a better life and to play for this jersey, it is a huge privilege and honour to do that for what they did for my family.
