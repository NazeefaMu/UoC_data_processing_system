Sadeera suffered mild concussion - will bat if cleared by doctors
After what happened to Phil Hughes we have to be cautious  Gurusinha
DELHI, Sunday  Sri Lanka Cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha said that although Sadeera Samarawickrama was prepared to go out and open the innings he was help back on medical advice.
He is fine and he actually wanted to open but its a mild concussion and we just have to be careful. After what happened to Phil Hughes there are some guidelines that weve got to follow, said Gurusinha.
Australian batsman Hughes died after being hit on the neck by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match in November 2014, three days before his 26th birthday.
We are working with a neurologist because the team doctors from Sri Lanka told us to only deal with a neurologist and get the green light from him, said Gurusinha.
We had a neurologist in the changing room this afternoon who worked with him and he gave us the green light for Sadeera to start running. What we are looking at is if he starts running and if he gets a headache and feels vomitish well have to stop him immediately, Gurusinha explained.
We will do a first test tonight (Sunday) with him in the gym if he comes okay from that and the medical staff is happy, hell have a hit tomorrow morning and then the doctors will look at him. If things go right he will get the green light to play, he said.
Samarawickrama was struck on the forehead of his helmet while fielding at short leg by a pull shot from Murali Vijay on the first day of the third
Test and left the field taking no further part in the match. A precautionary CT brain scan cleared him of any danger but he was kept under strict observation. In his absence Dilruwan Perera was promoted to open the Sri Lanka first innings with Dimuth Karunaratne.  ST

Bad news for Bigfoot
The Yeti legend has received a devastating blow after alleged remains from museums and private collections were found to be abominable fakes.
Eight specimens - including bones, teeth, skin, hair and faecal samples - were proven to be unrelated to hairy human-like creatures rumoured to be living in remote areas of Nepal and Tibet.
Instead, DNA tests from the University of Buffalo in the US showed the remnants actually belonged to bears and a dog.
Dr Charlotte Lindqvist, lead scientist in the research, said: Our findings strongly suggest that the biological underpinnings of the Yeti legend can be found in local bears, and our study demonstrates that genetics should be able to unravel other, similar mysteries.
Clearly, a big part of the Yeti legend has to do with bears.
The study, published in the journal Proceedings Of The Royal Society B, showed that Asian brown bears, Himalayan brown bears and Tibetan brown bears had all played their part in the Yeti myth.
One sample studied by the team consisted of a preserved scrap of skin from the hand or paw of a Yeti, which turned out to be from an Asian black bear.
A thigh bone fragment turned out to be from a Tibetan brown bear.
Stretching back hundreds of years, the Yeti is from of Nepalese folklore.
Great excitement was stirred by reported sightings of the creature and its footprints but the blurry photos and shaky video were not enough to support the animals existence.
While Yeti fans might be somewhat disappointed by the study, it has helped scientists learn more about the evolution of Asian bears.
Little is known about the bears, as they are rare and live in an inhospitable habitat. Also, political unrest sometimes makes the area inaccessible.
A period of glaciation 650,000 years ago may have cause the Himalayan bear to separate from the other bears.
So, while Tibetan brown bears are closely related to animals in North America and Eurasia, Himalayan brown bears have a unique lineage.
Dr Lindqvist said: Bears in this region are either vulnerable or critically endangered from a conservation perspective, but not much is known
Further genetic research on these rare and elusive animals may help illuminate the environmental history of the region, as well as bear evolutionary history worldwide, and and additional Yeti samples could contribute to this work.

Bangladeshs economic growth hits record 7.28% in FY17
Bangladeshs economic growth accelerated to 7.28 percent in the year to June 30, Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal said at a media briefing in Dhaka on Tuesday, citing final data.
Provisional data put the GDP growth at 7.24 percent for the year. Per capita income rose from $1,602 to $1,610.
In the final data, Bangladeshs GDP stands at $249.86 billion, or nearly Tk 20.88 trillion. It took Bangladesh 34 years to reach a GDP of $100 billion. The remaining growth has been the achievement of the Sheikh Hasina administration, he said.
Aside from Bangladesh, only Ethiopia and Cambodia have achieved a GDP growth rate over 7 percent, the planning minister said.
The agriculture sector grew 2.90 percent, manufacturing grew 10.22 percent and the services sector grew 6.69 percent. Though we have aimed for 8 percent growth by 2020, we will reach it by 2019 at the current rate.
The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, or BBS had previously issued estimates of 7.24 percent GDP growth and per capita $1,602 in April.
According to the BBS, the growth rate in FY2016 was 7.11 percent, while the per capita income was $1,465.
The economy eventually passed 7 percent growth in FY2016 after being stuck in the 6-7 percent range for nearly a decade. Last June, Bangladesh targeted a growth rate of 7.2 percent for the current fiscal year. (www.bdnews24.com)

Brathwaite leads West Indies battle for survival
WELLINGTON Dec3, 2017: Kraigg Brathwaite was eyeing his seventh century as he led the West Indies survival effort after Tom Blundell's debut ton put New Zealand in a seemingly unbeatable position in the first Test in Wellington on Sunday.
Brathwaite was unbeaten on 79 as the tourists reached 214 for two at stumps on day three. Shai Hope was not out 21.
After trailing by 386 on the first innings, they still requiring a further 172 runs to make New Zealand bat again.
The target appeared monumental, but Brathwaite has the memory of the West Indies' last tour of New Zealand to know it is not impossible.
In the first Test on the 2013 tour they were 396 in arrears when forced to follow on.
A Marlon Samuels double century took them to 507 in their second innings on the fifth day and New Zealand ran out of time chasing a target of 112 to win.
Brathwaite, who was on that tour but not required for that Test, played confidently against the New Zealand attack.
He featured in a 72-run partnership with Kieran Powell (40) for the first wicket, a 94-run stand with Shimron Hetmyer (66) for the second wicket and has added a further 48 with Hope.
Hetmyer, only 20 and playing just his fourth Test, easily bettered his previous best 25 against Pakistan seven months ago.
Matt Henry, who toiled without success in the West Indies first innings, took both wickets while first innings destroyer Neil Wagner proved expensive with none for 89.
After 19 wickets fell on the first two days of the Test, there were only two on day three as the wicket browned off from the green cover on day one when the West Indies were rolled for 134 in their first innings.
However there were signs in the final hour that the wicket was starting to take turn which would put more focus on spinners for the remainder of the game.
New Zealand resumed the day at 447-9 and added 73 runs before declaring shortly before lunch with Blundell celebrating his call up to the New Zealand Test team with an unbeaten 107 on debut. He took 10 off the opening over of the day by Miguel Cummins and continued to pile on the pressure for another 21.4 overs while Boult staunchly defied his tail-end status to hold up the other end.
The number 11 batsman faced 60 balls to be not out 18, although he was dropped when Blundell was on 99.
When Blundell was on 82, the West Indies unsuccessfully reviewed a rejected lbw appeal after a Jason Holder ball flicked off the pads for four byes.
But other than that the 27-year-old's 180-ball innings, which included 13 fours and one six, was near chanceless.
He faced nine scoreless deliveries on 99 before an inside edge off Roston Chase went past square leg for two and he then marked the milestone with a six two balls later before New Zealand declared.

Cellular tower levy would only decelerate  internet penetration growth in SL
The Budget proposals to implement a Cellular Tower Levy of Rs. 200,000 per month per tower, payable by the mobile operators would have a severe negative impact to the mobile telecommunication industry. The proposed levy will increase the monthly operational cost from Rs 115,000 to Rs 315,000. (increase of 174%)
For more than two decades Sri Lankas mobile industry had been a key contributor to the economy of Sri Lanka delivering 100% population penetration of mobile services at some of the lowest tariffs in the world. Over the past two decades the Telecom sector has been the major contributor in terms of Realized Foreign Direct Investments to Sri Lanka.
In a joint press release they also point out that the implementation of the proposed levy on towers would result in great losses to 3 major international investors, resulting in their possible exit from the market. The operators note that three out of the five mobile operators are still loss making.
This loss-making situation of smaller operators is further deepened by their attempt to extend mobile services to under populated rural areas.
As stated by the Treasury, nearly 6,750 towers are used by the five mobile operators to support the needs of a population of 20 million. However, each tower can only support the equipment of 2 - 3 operators due to tower loading constraints.
All mobile operators already share towers before any approval is given for a new tower in a designated area. As such, very few new towers have been built over the last few years. It is also vital to note that each frequency per tower can only support a few thousand mobile subscribers usage. Therefore, simple mathematics determines how many towers will be required to support the entire population.
All operators already have a large number of loss making towers in the rural areas. These losses will be significantly augmented if the proposed levy were to be implemented, making them economically unviable to sustain. As a result, mobile operators will be compelled to decommission a large number of unprofitable towers and reluctantly deprive customers of service particularly in the rural underdeveloped areas.
With regard to the environmental and health hazard concerns raised, the mobile industry complies with all local and international environmental and health standards such as World Health Organization (WHO),
Central Environment Authority (CEA) and GSMA standards. In addition, telecom operators have installed advanced lightning protection systems in all their towers to protect expensive telecom equipment on site and the locality against lightening damage.
Internet penetration in Sri Lanka currently stands at only 38%. The fastest and most cost effective way to increase national internet penetration is wirelessly through mobile towers. The proposed Cellular Tower Levy would only decelerate the growth of internet penetration in Sri Lanka by curtailing further investment in 4G and future 5G technologies, thereby depriving a large number of the populations access to internet services, which is an essential service, the release further said.

China to gift nephrology hospital to Polonnaruwa
President Maithripala Sirisena would lay the foundation for the construction of a national nephrology hospital, which is a gift from China, on December 6, at 9.45 a.m. The project cost is estimated to be Rs. 12 billion.
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne would be present at the ceremony. The nephrology-specialized hospital is planned to house 200 patient beds and 100 dialysis beds.
The construction site is located in the east of the Polonnaruwa ancient city, adjacent to the Batticaloa road to the north, 600 metres away from the Polonnaruwa General Hospital.
With a construction land area of about 6.63 hectares and a gross floor area of nearly 25,210 square metres, the multi-storeyed building would contain diagnostics and medical-imaging facilities and a moderate amount of staff dormitories, while the building density and greening rate of the project land are planned to be 21 percent and 35 percent, respectively.
The design scheme of the hospital has been striven to build a green, ecological hospital through provision of an atrium and exterior courtyard, reducing poor lighting, lessening use of lighting and ventilation equipment, and decreasing AC operation.
The hospital project includes six construction contents such as outpatient, medical technology, inpatient, administration, security system, and hospital life. The medical technology unit includes a digital x-ray machine, CT machine, colour Doppler ultrasound, BW ultra sound, ECG, two kidney transplant operating theaters, surgical ICU, etc. The construction work of the project is planned to be completed within two years.

Better quality growth ahead
China's GDP will moderate to 6.5% next year,  amid robust consumption and exports
China will see softened growth in the coming quarters due to tighter credit conditions and the deceleration of property and infrastructure investment, but growth quality will improve due to robust consumption and exports, economists said on Wednesday.
The country's GDP growth will moderate to 6.5 percent next year and fall further to 6.3 percent in 2019 as policymakers step up industrial capacity cuts, leverage controls and property curbs, according to Robin Xing, chief China economist with Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd.
Growth will be dragged down by slower investment as property investment growth is expected to drop from this year's 7 percent to 5 percent next year, and infrastructure investment falls to 13 percent from 15.6 percent, Xing said at a news conference in Beijing.
"While there is short-term downward pressure, the slower growth is a reflection of the policymakers' commitment to prioritize growth quality, and we are more confident on China's long-term outlook," Xing said. The improvement of China's growth quality was highlighted by the trend that consumption is becoming a main driver. Its share in China's real GDP growth is expected to rise further to 67 percent next year on the back of a resilient job market, according to Xing.
Other supportive factors include China's robust exports supported by stronger global recovery and the steady growth of investment from the private sector, Xing added.
Song Yu, chief China economist and vice-president of Beijing Gao Hua Securities Co Ltd, shared similar views with Xing, expecting China to see modest growth deceleration next year with a 6.5 percent real GDP growth rate, down from a forecasted 6.8 percent this year.
The relatively higher growth rate in China-compared with an expected global rate of 4 percent-will continue to lead global economic growth, which could help some economies jump out of the deflation trap, according to Song.
Both economists forecast rising inflation in China next year, with Song expecting the consumer price index to move higher to 2.3 percent from this year's 1.5 percent. But he said it is still within the government's comfort zone.
Song expected China's monetary policy to be broadly stable, adding that policymakers should accelerate economic reforms with continued targeted tightening to contain financial risks, restraints on house price appreciation in top-tier cities, as well as "shadow banking" leverage.
When it comes to credit conditions, Xing from Morgan Stanley believed that China will likely see incrementally tighter financial conditions with a possible rate hike next year by the Chinese central bank, combined with continued regulatory tightening on shadow banking and scrutiny of local government financing.
The People's Bank of China will likely raise interest rate by 25 basis points in the third quarter of next year in the face of rising inflation and upcoming rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, according to Xing.

Speed up installation of humps at railway-crossings
Another tragedy has occurred, this time at Hindeniya rail-crossing at Veyangoda. It is reported that despite the presence of a bell and light warning system, the vehicle driver has negligently driven his vehicle to disaster. This tragedy again points to the fact that negligence over-rides high-cost technical solutions such as barrier gates and bell and light warning systems. Constructing overhead bridges for motor vehicles at rail crossings is a very costly solution.
Readers will recall that a simple, low cost and an effective proposal sent by me in the form of installing speed-breakers (humps) on both sides of rail crossings appeared in both Sinhala and English press in the month of July 2013. Though belated, the Railway Department started responding to it and by May 2017 they were reported to have installed 111 humps. It is unfortunate that Hindeniya rail crossing was not protected by Humps which surely would have averted this tragic accident.
In this regard, it is pertinent to quote a villager from Wanawasala (where another tragedy occurred some time ago) who said No one can rely on that bell. Sometimes when it rains heavily it rings continuously till someone fixes it. Vehicles with their shutters closed and the radio on, wouldnt hear it on most occasions. This again proves the inherent drawbacks of technical solutions as well as their inability to adequately warn the motorists who sometimes are really negligent as also in the case of Batuwatte.
Imposing heavy fines can no doubt mitigate this problem.
However, the best option is to speed up the installation of specially painted humps with warning signals at all rail-crossings. Motorists in Sri Lanka are well used to slowing-down or stopping their vehicles on seeing a road-breaker and we have hardly witnessed accidents caused by road-breakers. It is admitted that road-breakers are not feasible at all Railway crossings particularly at those where sharp bends are encountered.
I fervently hope that the authorities will take prompt steps to speed up the installation of low-cost, quick to construct and effective road-breakers also known as Sleeping Policemen in order to prevent these unfortunate accidents in the future.

Colombo University debunks opinion poll
Academics from the Journalism Unit of the Colombo Universitys Arts Faculty have decried an opinion poll on who the next leader of the country should be in 2020, referring to it as baseless, false and fabricated.
Journalism Unit Coordinator, Prof. Samantha Herath in a strongly worded statement has denied the lead story which was published in the Mawbima newpapers Sunday publication. Prof. Herath has distanced the university from the said opinion poll adding that the unit had no prior knowledge of such a survey being conducted and it is neither endorsed by them.
No such opinion poll has been conducted by the unit,Herath said.
There are no researches or studies on who would make a suitable Presidential candidate or leader of the country in 2020.
Prof. Herath added that neither the Arts Faulty nor the Colombo University or the Journalism Unit had been officially informed of such survey reportedly conducted by the Journalism Unit, as reported in the newspaper. As a general practice, the relevant department or individuals should be alerted or informed when such surveys are carried out, which was not the case with this one. Prof. Herath stressed that the particular news was baseless and the survey unsound.
A Sinhala weekend publication, Mawbima had published an article detailing an opinion poll reportedly conducted by the Journalism Unit of the Colombo University on the traits that would define the next leader of the country in 2020. In it, they have revealed that the next leader of the country would be an intellectual patriot and autocratic leader who could also govern with an iron fist.
Prof. Ajantha Hapuarachchi of the Journalism Unit along with her assistant were quoted in the newspaper as having interviewed 505 individuals over a period of three months for this poll.
Titled Gauging the peoples verdict on who the next President should be in 2020 the interviewees were asked to choose between five candidates: Maithripala Sirisena, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, Anura Kumara Dissanyake and GotabhayaRajapaksa.
Compiled through a quantative method, the research allegedly targeted interviewees between the ages of 18 to 75 representing various ethnicities, religious backgrounds and professional spheres. Out of the 505, 231 are women while 274 are men.
According to their responses, researchers had come to the conclusions that the 134 respondents believe that none of the present leaders should come into power again. They were also of the opinion that the they do not believe in the promises made by political party or leaders, and were of the opinion the none of them had the intention of governing the country. According to the statements made by the respondents, most of them were of the opinion that the country needed a patriotic, autocratic leader who can fearlessly govern with a military rule.

The Asiri Group of Hospitals recently launched a complete diabetes care programme at its new ultra-modern Asiri Diabetes Centre located at Asiri Medical Hospitals.
The goal of this centre is to assist patients living with diabetes with the least impact on the quality of their lives, Asiri Diabetes Centre, Administrative Head, Dr. Samanthi de Silva said.
We believe prevention is better than cure. We encourage the detection of diabetes early, especially if there is a history of the disease amongst family members. We can educate patients and assist them in making the lifestyle changes required to manage the condition and provide necessary treatment to delay the onset of complications. A diabetic with a well-controlled diet and regular exercise can lead a perfectly normal life, Dr. de Silva added.
With our progression toward being a developed country, newly adopted lifestyles, food and dietary habits are all precipitating factors leading to a higher prevalence of diabetes. In Sri Lanka the clinical practiced guidelines for diabetes state that any individual over 35 years should screen for diabetes, she explained.
The Centre offers basic and advanced screening packages, follow-up and specialised services, foot care and eye clinics, counseling and nutrition education. Basic screening packages include a consultation with a doctor, physical examination, measuring of the patients blood pressure, weight, height, calculating body mass index and patients are counseled on long term management of diabetes. Screening for complications of the disease is also carried out.
The Centre urges diabetic patients to be conscious of performing routine screenings to reduce or prevent the onset of complications. Dr. de Silva noted, If you are a diabetic regardless of your age, you should have regular screenings.
It is of utmost importance, because today we see a lot of patients who have complications due to neglect.
Elaborating on the significance of early interventionand appropriate treatment, the Centre aims to reduce the onset of diabetic neuropathyor nerve damage.
Through Digital Retinal Photography (DRP), the Centre detectsearly changes in the eyecaused when diabetes affects the small blood vessels in the retina. Similarly, appropriate management of foot care including foot abnormalities and foot ulcerations is collated and reviewed.

Total turnover value amounted to LKR1.83Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR4.69Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR0.46Bn (-51.21% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.94Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.03% W-o-W (or LKR 0.84Bn) to LKR2,922.66Bn cf. LKR2,923.50Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms) 
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 38.65% (or LKR 0.71Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by Commercial Bank, Sampath Bank, HNB & NDB which accounted for 86.72% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 18.40% (or LKR 0.34Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by JKH which accounted for 78.53% of the sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 14.12% (or LKR 0.26Bn) to the market driven by Cargills and Cold Stores which accounted for 84.21% of the sector turnover.

In terms of volume, Dialog Axiata & JKH led foreign purchases while Commercial Bank & Chevron led foreign sales. In terms of value JKH & Sampath Bank led foreign purchases while Commercial Bank & Chevron led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equities closed flat this week as investors adopted a watchful stance in the absence of any major economic/market developments and as concerns over delays in LG polls and the lack of clarity over certain policy measures weighed down sentiment.
The broadshare ASPI closed the week largely unchanged at 6411.8 points (6413.6 points last week) as an 11.9 point loss on Tuesday was mostly offset by a 10.1 point gain over the rest of the week.
Dull activity however, pushed turnover levels to a 3-month low, and daily average turnover levels fell to a paltry LKR0.46Bn this week, the lowest since August when it hit a low of LKR0.45Bn. Low HNI and Institutional participation also contributed to the general sluggishness, with crossings for the week accounting for just 31% of total market turnover cf. last weeks 36%. Markets over the month of November have fallen 3.1%, wiping off the 2.8% gain in October and the 0.7% gain in the Index in September.
Flat earnings performance over the September quarter along with policy uncertainty post the national budget have contributed the Indexs weaker performance in November.
Corporate earnings of 95% of the market totaled LKR60Bn in the Sept17 quarter, unchanged from the LKR60.2Bn recorded in the Sept16 quarter. Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain largely unchanged as they continue to consolidate at the current levels.
Exports surpass $1 bn for third consecutive month 
Exports in September surpassed the $1Bn mark for the 3rd consecutive month, driven by i) stronger textiles/garment exports and, ii) the re-export of petroleum products which rose both due to higher price and volume.
Export gains were minimized however by higher imports, which grew at double digit levels for the third consecutive month on the back of higher fuel imports (for thermal power generation) and base metals (for cement & construction).
The trade deficit consequently widened in September 2017 to $656Mn (cf. $610Mn in Sept16) and pushed up the cumulative trade deficit during the first nine months of 2017 to $6840Mn from $6125Mn in Sept16.
Performance in other major inflows to the current account meanwhile remained lower in Sep17 as lower tourist earnings (-2.3% Y-o-Y) on the back of lower tourist arrivals and declining worker remittances (-16.7% Y-o-Y) on the back of slow growth and geo-political instability in the Middle-East dampened inflows.
Financial flows to Sri Lanka however, continued to remain strong over Sept, with foreign investments in G-secs continuing strongly for the 7th consecutive month and helping offset the impact of the net outflow from the CSE on the back of a one-off transaction in secondary markets.
Gross official reserves at end-Sept consequently increased to $7.3Bn (ie: 4.2 months of imports), helping the LKR stabilize and record a relatively modest depreciation of 2.5% YTD against the USD.

A deadly catch
Following the recent adverse weather, fishermen in Batticaloa and Nawaladi were in for a rude shock as they kept catching deadly snakes instead of fish in their nets.
During the last couple of days, a large number of snakes were caught in fishing nets around Batticaloa and Nawaladi area, a fisherman said.
Fishermen and people in the area believe this to be a bad omen which could be a sign of a major natural disaster in the offing.
They say that before the Tsunami struck in 2004, a similar phenomenon had occurred in the Batticaloa area. However, an official of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) allayed peoples fears noting a reduction of salt level in the sea water and rise in temperatures could be the reason for the unusual occurrence.

Death machine
The debate about allowing people to take their own lives as a way to seek relief from pain and suffering has been going on in countries across the globe. As Victoria becomes the first state to legalise euthanasia, a man nicknamed Dr Death due to his support for the practice has come up with a machine for the same.
The machine invented by Dr Phillip Nitschke is 3D printed and comes with a detachable capsule that can be used a coffin. Nitschke developed the device named Sarco with help from Dutch engineer Alexander Bannick.
The machine which allows people to commit suicide by simply pressing a button can be 3D printed and assembled anywhere in the world. Its free open-source design was released on the internet after it was unveiled at the euthanasia conference in Canada in late October.
People need to answer a mental questionnaire online to get an access code for the capsule. As soon as the machine is activated, liquid nitrogen fills the capsule as oxygen drops leading to a peaceful death in a matter of minutes. The Scientist

Demand for apartments in Hulftsdorp
While the recent growth of apartment complexes in Colombo and its suburbs is quite evident, potential locations such as Colombo 12 or otherwise known as Hulftsdorp, have not been largely targeted by developers for residential purposes.
Hulftsdorp is largely known for the courts and is surrounded by law firms and busy shopping streets. With high-rise residential developments being scarce in the location, Glorious Residencies began to cater to the buyers interested in Colombo 12.
Lamudi Sri Lanka was given the opportunity to interview the Chairman of Glorious Residencies, M.P.L. Ariyaratne, to learn about the project and about the developers view on the booming real estate market of Sri Lanka.
Tell us a bit about Glorious Residencies and why you targeted Colombo 12.
The inception of Glorious Residencies happened here in Colombo 12, which is one of the most densely populated and economically developed regions in Sri Lanka. While many people live here, theyre unable to move to another area, since their livelihoods are tightly intertwined with this region. When we launched our business in 2005, we noticed that this region has a housing and population issue. This was the inspiration to create Glorious Residencies. We built it with 88 apartments, as our small contribution to easing the population issue here.
How would you describe the future demand for apartments in Colombo
As of now, there are numerous residential projects being constructed in Colombo. However, we believe that these projects arent sufficient to handle the population growth of the city. Theres a belief among some, that there may actually be a surplus of houses in Colombo. But, we think the number of house hunters would increase faster than a number of houses that would be available to them. Hence, we dont think there are reasons to be concerned.
What are the main factors that influence the prices of properties in Sri Lanka
One of the main factors is the availability of properties in a given region. If the scarcity of properties is high in a certain area, then the prices will go up. Another important aspect is the safety and the availability of amenities of a given property. For example, in recent times, due to heavy rains across the country, some regions experienced floods and landslides. Such properties that were at risk of natural disasters saw their value go down, while properties that were safe from calamities that also offered a wide selection of amenities saw their prices increase rapidly due to heavy demand.
What have you found to be the major barriers in the real estate market What would you like to see improved
One of the biggest barriers seen in the real estate industry right now is the high-interest rate for obtaining a loan from a financial institute. Typically, when someone decides to buy a house, he or she will do it as a way of fulfilling a primary life goal. Therefore, if the obstacles to obtaining a loan are removed, it will encourage more people to buy properties from the local market.
What would be your advice to the local government in order to facilitate foreign investment
Obviously, the facilities provided to foreign investors must be increased. Fewer the barriers to invest in Sri Lanka, the more likely they will come here. For example, the plan to relax the regulation which only allows foreigners to buy a property above a certain floor would motivate them invest further in Sri Lanka.
From the developers perspective who has the BOI approval, there is the barrier of importing construction materials from abroad due to high import taxes. In fact, the tax alone that needs to be paid can be twice as much as the actual price of such materials. Government concessions for such a situation would promote Sri Lanka further as an investment paradise.
What is the current role of the internet within the real estate industry How has this trend affected your business
E-commerce activities have made busy lives of the modern-day city dwellers far easier than ever before. We can easily find the information of the product were looking for right in front of us and even order online to be delivered to the doorstep, thanks to the Internet.
Such convenience has also shown a clear positive effect in the property industry of Sri Lanka. Our business has also profited greatly thanks to the adoption of Internet-based facilities. Especially, the online platform offered by Lamudi, has helped us a lot to spread awareness about our real estate offerings. As a result, many people have contacted us to learn more and purchase our properties.
The booming real estate market does not show any immediate threat of slowing down. Sri Lanka as a whole needs to be promoted on a global scale as an investment destination so that the island nations productivity can be utilised more efficiently and effectively.

Eradicating congenital rubella syndrome
This week Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha (M.B., B.S. PG Dip in Med. Micro., M.D. (Med. Virology), a Consultant Virologist attached to the National Influenza Centre of the Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute (MRI) speaks about Rubella and Congenital Rubella which affects mothers and babies.
Q : What is Rubella and Congenital Rubella 
A : Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. Rubella virus infection usually causes a mild fever and rash illness in children and adults.
Congenital rubella is when rubella infection occurs during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or infants with congenital malformations, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
Q : How does it spread 
A : The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host.
Q : What is the impact of the two diseases on our body 
A : In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash (not a raised and not a pustule rash), low fever (<39C), nausea and mild conjunctivitis.
The rash, which occurs in 50 to 80 per cent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body, and lasts 13 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 310 days.
When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a high chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects known as CRS ( the disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other).
Q : What are the medical treatment available 
A : There is no specific medicine to treat rubella or make the disease go away faster. In many cases, symptoms are mild. For others, mild symptoms can be managed with bed rest and medicines for fever, such as Paracetamol.
Q : How can we prevent these two diseases 
A : There is an effective vaccine either given with measles, mumps as MMR or single vaccine as rubella vaccine. Rubella vaccine is included in our national immunization programme.
Q : How should the persons who cintacted the disease take care of themselves 
A : Rubella is a self limiting disease.
Q : How common is congenital rubella (CRS) 
A : Nowadays CRS is uncommon and it was commonly seen in before the rubella vaccination era. Most of the WHO member states are working towards congenital rubella elimination in their respective countries, including Sri Lanka.
Health Ministry and the Epidemiology Unit authorities say that Rubella vaccine is included in the National immunization Programme which is given free of charge. It is advisable to obtain relevant vaccines at relevant ages. It is the duty of the parents to vaccinate their children according to the instructions given by the Government health institutions and qualified doctors. The public should not believe myths on various vaccines. Medical advice should be followed all the time.

Fun Run for a worthy cause!
In celebrating wellness and good health, Hilton Colombo Residences in collaboration with Thaabit Ahmed Football Academy (TAFA) presented FUN RUN 2017, held for the 10th year. The HILTON TAFA FUN RUN 2017 a charity run spanning 4km and 2km for adults and children respectively and was held last Sunday at 6:30am. All proceeds collected were donated towards the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital. The official press conference was held last week.
At the press conference held to announce the fun run last week, Hilton Colombo Residences, General Manager, Karim Schadloupointed out that the run is a 100 percent fund raiser for the Lady Ridgeway Hospital. Schadlou said that this was an opportunity to give back to the community. Hilton is always keen on familiarizing its team members with healthy living. Schadlou expressed his deep enthusiasm at the prospect of this run.
This year, we have partnered with the Thaabit Ahmed Football Academy (TAFA) for better reach. Hilton as a company has many programs that focus on the overall well-being its guests with the Meet with Purpose initiative and team members with a program called THRIVE that both focuses on mind, body, and spirit. We believe that this family event is ideal for children and parents to participate to spend time together and foster a sense of friendly competitiveness. All proceeds will be donated towards charity, said Schadlou.
TAFA is a very successful academy with energetic soccer players supported by the parents. So partnering with Hilton is a brilliant idea as they share the common goal of healthy living. Hopefully this collaboration will continue into the future.
It has been an extremely memorable event and one that has been very successful in the past and I am sure it will be very successful this time around as well. This is all about the team members, the participants and the public. These kind of events create that change that we all expect, said Schadlou.
TAFA Coaching, Founder,Thaabit Ahmed pointed out that TAFA was started to give children an opportunity to play football. This is done in a fun, safe and organized environment. It was a dream in 2009 and now it has become a reality. Now TAFA has come far with a structured organization. The ages are four to 16 years old and there are roughly 200  220 kids.
Last week we celebrated our eighth birthday. So what started as a little dream has now become a really amazing initiative and an academy. Aside from football we have focused a lot on giving back to the community. This is why this partnership with Hilton is so important. We are also giving back to the community through our Street Kids Project. We want to promote a healthy and active lifestyle. And the fun run supports this active lifestyle. So this is extremely important for us, said Ahmed.
Ahmed mentioned that Hilton is supporting TAFA since 2015, as the official hospitality partner. Every year when there is an international camp, Hilton is very generous enough to accommodate the foreign coaches. Ahmed evinced his pleasure at the fact that all funds will be contributed to the Lady Ridgeway hospital.
Hilton Colombo Residences, Manager  Sports & Recreation, Ranga Perera commented how the event proceeded.
The route for adults will commence from Hilton Colombo Residences at Staple Street, proceed towards Union Place, Rifle Street, Malay Street, and return to the hotel via D R Wijewardene Mawatha end at the hotel. The total distance will be 4.2km. For the under fifteen age group, the 2km route will use the same route but will have a shorter distance. The categories for event will have the winner for women, men, and childrens categories, said Perera. Hilton Colombo Residences, Manager  Marketing,Thivanka Tennekoon explained that the significance of the event is that they are supporting Human Wellbeing. At Hilton Human Wellbeing is within the guests and the employees as well as within the community.
We would like to thank the sponsors who have come on board. I must say that all the proceedings including monetary proceedings will be given to Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospitals. We are buy four infusion pumps for Lady Ridgeway. That itself shows the value of this event, said Tennekoon.
Bolt Gear, Shafraz Mansoor said the Bolt Gear focuses on healthy living and for this purpose you need to have good active wear. They have been partnering with Hilton for a long time and that isone way, where they are giving back to the community.
We are privileged to be a part of this as the proceeds are going towards a good cause. I understand how important it is to be active.

A gendered world!
Can the grace of the abiding female nature be converged into a work of art Can the inert portrayal do justice to its life To explore the matter in question, The South Asia Conference 2017 was held recently at the Womens Education and Research Centre.
The conference was themed on Cultural Productions from a Gender Perspective and was held as a critical assessment of the cultural productions including paintings, literary productions, dramas, folk dramas and films produced in the South Asia region.
The conference was funded by India Sri Lanka Foundation, Sri Lanka.
Here are some inspiring excerpts from the speeches made at the Conference.
Women and the Literature of Protest
Linet Sebastian, Assistant Professor and postgraduate fellow at Research Department of English at St. Josephs College in Kerala, India discussed Historical and Political Narratives of the Select North East Indian Women Writers.
Northeast India is a land historically known for the geopolitical, linguistic and ethnic conflicts, military violence, insurgence groups, and Maoist outbreaks, said Sebastian. For the North East Indian women, literature is a weapon to write back at the oppressive institutions of the state, for their life is intrinsically mingled with the centrality of the Government and military forces.
The prime concerns of the literature from the North East are addressing resistance, the strategy of survival that they experience throughout their lives.
It is a fact that, women are the victims in every institution. As a result the idea of nation, the formation of nation, its stabilization and maintenance, progress, institutionalization, is actually written upon the bodies of women, remarked Sebastian. They used to bear untold sufferings and burdens in the forward journey of a nation.
The major women writers from this region are Indira Goswami, Anuradha Sahrma Pujari, Mita Bhukan,Tamesula Ao, Mamang Dai, and Anjum Hassan.
Irom Sharmila, through her poetry collection Fragrance of Peace draws it clear that there are different dimensions to the concept of freedom. She expresses the anxiety of women over the land of Manipur, said Sebastian. She speaks the language of confidence through her poems.
Wake up, brothers and sisters
The savior of the nation
We have come out all the way
Knowing we all will die
Why the fear is
So shaky in the heart
-Irom Sharmila
Indira Goswami, known by her pen name Mamoni Raisom Goswami and popularly as Mamoni Baideo, was an Assamese editor, poet, professor, scholar and writer. The Chenabs Current (1972), The Pages Stained with Blood (2001), The Man from Chinnamasta (2005) are her famous novels. Indira Goswami writes about Assam Insurgency. The story tells us about the dilemma of Assamese youth to take up difficult choices, stated Sebastian.
Tamesula Ao was a charismatic writer who often formulated the fighting spirit of Nagas and their enormous energy through her poems and short stories. Nagas were the first ethnic group to turn to insurgencies to establish an independent Nagalim.
For the North East Indian women writers, the more the violence, unrest and confusion in their locality means the more of creative writing, remarked Sebastian. It acts as a push factor for them to write. Writing for them is a kind of solution for their issues. The study of the women writers of North East India and their selection of themes make the point clear that these women writers have used writing as their weapon to propagate against violence and terror.
It also gives us a glimpse into the very powerful landscape of womans writing. More researchers and scholars need to explore this powerful writing that comes from the North East, she further stated.
Coming of age
Puberty Ritual, Gender Dynamics, and New Connections among the Jaffna Tamils in post-war Sri Lanka were brought into question by Sanmugeswaran Pathmanesan, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Social Studies at the Open University of Sri Lanka.
Samaththiya sadangu (the puberty ritual) is a coming of age ceremony, performed by the Jaffna Tamils in Sri Lanka, said Pathmanesan. In some villages in Jaffna, people give importance to the day the girl reaches puberty because that particular day determines her future life in terms of wealth, prosperity and fertility inducement.
Kannda thanni varthal or the Bathing ritual is done immediately after the first sign of puberty is noticed. And the big ceremony can take place on the seventh day, eleventh day or even later, stated Pathmanesan.
Older people say the primary purpose of this period is to chase out evils (dangerous powers) or shield the new big girl from the evil-eye (kannuru), the evil-mouth (vaaiuuru), and the dangerous evil spirit (theya sakti), she added. The most important part of the ritual is arati. This ritual is designed to dispel evil spirits. Such symbolic expression denotes dispelling evil spirits from her body.
The concepts of good and bad are a creation of a dominant group in the society and both reflect their morality, but not that of the opposing group, she added.
The study of ritual in anthropology has a long history and very rich ethnographic details of diverse communities around the world.
The girls have to pass the intermediate stage during the puberty period, which divides two separate ends such as before puberty period and a big girl (ready for marriage and womanhood status). - Gennup (1960): Emphasis on transition in ritual process
Turner (1969) explains the ambiguous position during the liminal stage (stage of transition). The attributes of liminality or of liminal personae (threshold people) are necessarily ambiguous
Pierre Bourdieu (1991) argues that this theory does not conceal one of the essential effects of rites. Further, he claims that these rites of passage can be seen as rites of consecration, rites of legitimation, or rites of the institution rather than calling them the rite of passage, Pathmanesan added.
Samaththiya sadangu is a public culture, but people use symbols for interpretations. Through such a large collection of elaborative interpretations, we have the thick description of samaththiya sadangu to understand the human nature of the ritual, said Pathmanesan.
Post-war Jaffna Tamils have changed the rite in ways that suggest they take a different view of both gender roles and the dangers that supposedly threaten (or are connected to) young women during their transition to womanhood. This can be seen, in particular, in the ways, the ceremony is uploaded to cyberspace (Facebook, YouTube and directly through Skype), Pathmanesan noted.
It is very clear that it is difficult to see the origin of this ritual tradition in Jaffna, so the history and interpretation become problematic, she said. In understating the Jaffna puberty ritual, then high caste ritual plays a significant role in shaping the society and dominating the ritual and culture of the society through power, social and cultural capital in the society.
Queer identity depicted
Nelani de Costa explored how the Queer Identity was depicted in the Contemporary Sri Lankan Novel. De Costa is an Assistant Lecturer (Temporary) at the Department of English and Linguistics, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura.
The term queer can refer to the non-normatic sexual or LGBTQI, said de Costa. Her research problematizes the depictions of subversive queer identities in the Sri Lankan novel as they cater to the mainstream hetero-normative perspectives.
* Punyakante Wijenaikes Giraya (1971) - Homosexuality and lesbianism in an upper-class Sinhala Buddhist family.
* Punyakante Wijenaikes Amulet (1994) - Lesbianism in an upper class Sinhala Buddhist family.
* Carl Mullers The Jam Fruit Tree (1993) - The Sexual behaviour of a Burgher family.
It was insisted that the theme of homosexuality in the novel [Giraya] has to be taken out in the [television] series, said de Costa. The TV serial focused primarily on the machinations of Lucia Hamy (played by Trilicia Gunawardena) and Lals problem was explained as due to epilepsy he had suffered from birth.
But then mother always tried to hide the truth about Lal. She wanted the world to know him as a normal man. -Punyakante Wijenaike (2012: 149)
Carl Mullers The Jam Fruit Tree portrays homosexuality in a very casual and light-hearted manner, said de Costa. Gender as a fixed identity leads to coherence between sex gender and desire which enables gender coherence. The idea of gender coherence looks at gender with the lens of heterosexuality, by regarding gender by limiting to the two dimorphic sexes: male and female.
In Punyakante Wijenaikes Amulet, the intense psychic connection between Shyamali and Anula is depicted in a way which threatens the heterosexual connection between Shyamali and Senani, remarked de Costa.
The portrayal of queer identities in the Sri Lankan novel is problematic as it caters to the stereotypical assumptions of the mainstream discourse: as unnatural, deviant and forbidden, de Costa concluded. Numerous streams connected to one spring. The delicacy, the boldness and the raw life of a woman and the countless attempts to express her being. A subject that runs its branches into infinity and an endeavour such as this that extracts some of its content into the reach of the reader is, indeed, a pleasing sight to the eye.

The Glow in the Desert: Queen Rania of Jordan
The first Gulf War of 1991 separated her from her family when they fled from Kuwait with thousands of other Palestinians. When the wish to reunite called her to Amman, Jordan, she might not have dreamed what a transformation her life was leading her into.
Queen Rania of Jordan, also known as Rania Al Abdullah was coroneted as the Queen consort of Jordon when she was 28 years of age. She is a strong progressive female voice in the Arab world and a powerful advocate for education, health, environmental concerns and womens rights. Since marrying the now King of Jordan in 1993, she has used her position to promote community empowerment, youth and cross-cultural dialogue.
She is also an outspoken critic of honour killing the custom of men murdering any female relative found to have committed adultery or lost her virginity before marriage.
Besides her actions to enhance the wellbeing of the society, the Queen also attracts the attention of the world through her radiating good looks. She is known for her affection for designer goods and is also viewed by many as one of the worlds best-dressed women. She is also an avid user of social media and she maintains pages on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter.
Crowned as queen
In January 1993, Rania accompanied a co-worker to a dinner party that marked a turn in her life like no other. When she met Prince Abdulla, it was love at first sight. Rania and Prince Abdullah were engaged just two months after their meeting. Then, in June 1993, less than six months after their first encounter, the couple got married.
In King Abdullahs book, Our Last Chance, he tells that he was struck by how poised, elegant and intelligent she was.
Upon the death of King Hussein bin Talal in February, 1999, Prince Abdullah became King of Jordan. Six weeks later, he officially elevated Rania to the status of queen.
The king chose as a bride someone he considers an equal, said Prince Zeid bin Raad, a childhood friend of Abdullahs to Hello Magazine. He listens to her ideas. They feed each others intellectual curiosity. Theyre a perfect match, two people very comfortable together, who think along the same wavelength.
Early Life
Rania Al-Yassin was born in Kuwait, to Palestinian parents Faisal Sedki Al-Yassin and Ilham Yassin from Tulkarm. She attended the New English School in Jabriya, Kuwait, then received a degree in Business Administration from the American University in Cairo. Upon her graduation from the American University, she worked briefly in marketing for Citibank, followed by a job with Apple Inc. in Amman.
Views on education
Queen Rania has stated that an essential aspect of education is to equip young people with the necessary skills to perform well in the workplace.
It can lay the foundation for lasting peace and development by providing youths with skills to build their countries, she said in an interview with Cond Nast Traveller. If education is missing for years during conflict, then there is nobody to establish peace, civic society, and the economic prosperity needed to create a future.
The Queen is Chairperson of Jordans first interactive childrens museum. In 2008, the Queen launched Madrasati (My School), a public-private initiative aimed at refurbishing 500 of Jordans public schools over a five-year period. In higher education, the Queen Rania Scholarship Programme partners with several universities from around the world.
She initiated the Al-Aman Fund for the Future of Orphans in 2003 and has partnered with international universities providing scholarships for Jordanian students abroad. She supports INJAZ Al-Arab,a non-profit organization that drives youth education and training in workforce readiness, financial literacy and entrepreneurship across the Arab World. As reported in injazalarab.org, she has taught classes, in her capacity as Regional Ambassador of INJAZ Al-Arab, and engaged in dialogue with young people in other countries. She is also an enthusiastic supporter of the micro-fund movement which provides financial assistance to would-be entrepreneurs.
Light across the globe
In 2007, Queen Rania was named UNICEFs first Eminent Advocate for Children. In 2009, Queen Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls Education Initiative (UNGEI). Archive.is reports that she worked alongside other world leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, in a global movement seeking to improve the welfare of children.
In 2009, Queen Rania co-founded and led the launch of the 1GOAL: Education for All campaign alongside English retired footballer and current sports broadcaster, Gary Lineker. The campaign raises public awareness and involvement in achieving education for all the 67 million children out of school worldwide.
In early 2002 Queen Rania joined the Board of Directors of the International Youth Foundation, based in Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States. In September 2006, Queen Rania also joined the United Nations Foundation Board of Directors.
Forbes magazine ranked her as one of the worlds 100 most powerful women in 2011.
Cross-culture dialog
Queen Rania has also been particularly vocal about the importance of cross cultural and interfaith dialogue to foster greater understanding, tolerance and acceptance across the world.She has used her status to correct what she sees as misconceptions in the West about the Arab world.
I think we need to redraw the lines and realize that this battle is moderates against extremists, she said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Its not Christians against Muslims. Its not West against East. Its not Arabs against Americans. It is moderates against extremists. And once we can really understand that, then we can start to fight the real enemy.
Publications
Queen Rania has also published four childrens books to date, inspired by her own experiences as a child: the New York Times best seller The Sandwich Swap, Eternal Beauty, Maha of the Mountains and The Kings Gift.
More than what meets the eye
She told the CBC in the same interview: Id rather be dealt with as a person than a persona. With my children, I am just Mom. At the end of the day, the position is just a position, a title is just a title, and those things come and go. Its really your essence and your values that are important.
Wearing her spirit in her charismatic posture, Queen Rania of Jordan continues on her path to build the world, contributing to the future generously from where she stands. Beautiful on the inside and out, she, indeed, is a bright light in a misconceived world. (SSP)

Good place is no place
What place does utopia have in 2017 It is now half a millennium since the word was invented by Thomas More as the name of his imaginary island, located in the New World and visited by the Portuguese sailor Raphael Hythloday, who describes it, in conversation with a fictitious Thomas More, as an exemplary society. Utopia, as More coined it, means no-place, the prefix ou in ancient Greek connoting negation, and also good place, eu suggesting well or good. Utopia is nowhere, and if utopian societies can be said to have any defining characteristics, then a lack of existence in the real world is probably one of them.
If utopia is conventionally nowhere, however, then in 2016 it seemed to be everywhere, as Utopias quincentenary was celebrated with an array of publications, exhibitions and events. These included numerous academic conferences and books, a year-long festival at Somerset House called UTOPIA 2016: A year of imagination and possibility, and Utopia500, an international project which celebrated utopian thinking as a driver of social change and promoted commemorative events throughout the year. This was a good time for writing and thinking about utopia: a utopian moment for utopian studies.
Acrimonious referendum
Yet dystopia (the Greek prefix dus meaning bad or unfavourable) was also ubiquitous in 2016, when the politics of division triumphed: the American election of a climate change-denier as President; Britains acrimonious referendum; and the strengthening of nationalist political parties across Europe. These victories seemed to remake the political landscape and made imaginable the possibility of dystopia in our own time. With the immediate future in mind, dystopias are certainly easier to imagine, as Ursula Le Guin writes in an essay on utopian fiction, published last year in a new edition of Mores Utopia, introduced by China Miville and produced in conjunction with the Somerset House festival.
This has not always been the case. Utopian literature proliferated in the late seventeenth century, for example, in the wake of the Civil War. Writers such as Samuel Hartlib, John Dury and the rest of the Hartlib Circle devoted themselves to imagining idealized institutions such as schools, universities and libraries, which would give wider access to knowledge and improve humanitys capacity to understand the world in which it lived.
There is a direct line between their utopian imaginings  and those of their predecessor Francis Bacon, whose New Atlantis of 1626 projected a utopian scientific institution, Salomons House  and the development of real institutions such as the Royal Society, founded in 1660.
Seventeenth-century utopian writers often rejected the imaginative trappings of utopian fiction, such as the mythical island and the difficult journey, precisely because they wanted to emphasize the practicality of the ideas they portrayed. They also wanted to be taken seriously; and utopian was already a dirty word by that time, used to describe ideas and places that were too good to be true.
Common consent
In literature, as in politics, utopia and dystopia are of course inextricably linked, two sides of the same coin. It was John Stuart Mill who seems to have used the d-word first, during a debate on Irish land tithes in the House of Commons in 1868: Mill suggested that the Conservative government should be called dystopians, or cacotopians as what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable.
In Mills conception, dystopias and utopias both fail on the grounds of practicality, the one seeming too bad, and the other too good, to be put into action. The word dystopia was not widely used until the twentieth century; it seems to have become characteristic of the early twenty-first. By common consent, we live in a dystopian age, and dystopia, as Gregory Claeys observes in Dystopia: A natural history, increasingly defines the spirit of our times.
Dystopian literature may seem a natural place to turn in the face of international political upheaval: in the first weeks of the Trump administration, as the New York Times reported in January, Nineteen Eighty-four leapt to the top of the Amazon bestseller list, as readers faced with alternative facts sought out fictional parallels. There has always been a protectionist element to fictional utopian societies  an interest in building walls and isolating themselves from the wider world  starting with Thomas Mores island of Utopia itself.
There the entrance to the harbour by which the island is accessed is narrow, and protected by invisible rocks, lying beneath the water and making navigation perilous to foreigners.
Significant differences
Utopian societies in literature are often difficult to access, and harder still to join and to participate in as a citizen. Yet there are also significant differences between, say, Trumps America and Mores Utopia, perhaps the most obvious being that Mores Utopians disdain capitalism and those who covet gold. The Utopians, who use gold to make chamber-pots and slaves chains, and mock visitors wearing expensive jewellery, would have no room for Trump Tower.More may have given us the word utopia, but he  and his book  are curiously distant from much of the writing on utopia that 2016 produced. The trouble with reading Mores Utopia in search of ideas that might be useful today is that Mores book is so multilayered, jokey and ironic that it is impossible to take it seriously. Mivilles introduction to the Verso edition insists that the original Utopia is vitally important to modern society: We cant do without this book, he writes, It gave us a formulation, a concept, we needed.
Without utopia, agrees Rutger Bregman in Utopia for Realists, we are lost. But More and Utopia are rather absent in both books, as if their contribution stopped at the production of the concept. The translation reproduced by Verso is the 1901 Cassells National Library version, more recently edited by David Price (the translator of the text is not named here).

Google launches Datally,  an app that saves data
Google has announced the launch of Datally, a smart and simple Android app that helps smartphone users understand, control, and save mobile data. Datally works on all smartphones running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and higher, and is available today on the Google Play Store globally.
Datally helps solve one of the biggest pain points for smartphone users around the world  worries about data usage. Google found during extensive user research around the world that many smartphone users worry about running out of data. This is an especially acute problem for the newest generation to come online, known as the 'Next Billion Users'. Not only are these smartphone users constantly thinking about data balances, but they do not understand where their data is going, nor do they feel in control over allocating data to the apps they really care about.
Datally empowers users to solve these problems with four key features:
Data Saver.Apps frequently use data in the background for updating content and information. Datallys Data Saver feature lets users control data on an app-by-app basis, so that data only goes to apps they care about. People testing the app saved up to 30% of mobile data, depending on the way they used Datally.
Data Saver bubble.Once Data Saver is turned on, Datallys Data Saver bubble will appear when a user goes into an app that is allowed to use data. Whenever that app uses data, the Data Saver bubble will show the current rate of data usage, and users can easily choose to block that apps data use if things start to get out of control. The Data Saver bubble is like a speedometer for mobile data.
Personalized alerts.Datally alerts users when apps start consuming a lot of data, and it allows them to see how much data theyve used on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
Wi-Fi finder.There are also times when users want to use more data than they have on their mobile plans, such as when they want to watch HD videos. Public Wi-Fi is an important access point for high-bandwidth connectively, so Datallys Find Wi-Fi feature reveals the networks nearby, rated by the Datally community. Once connected, users can rate the Wi-Fi networks themselves based on their own experience.

Indian economy will only get  better from Q1 2018-19 onwards
Why do people continue to flog a dead horse Probably because some people arent convinced it is dead. This comment is about persistent critiques of revision in Indias national income accounts in January 2015. That changed the base, switched from GDP at factor cost to gross value added (GVA) at market prices, altered the source and brought national accounts more in conformity with international practice.
This had been building up since 2008, with contributions from several respected national income estimation experts, and was no sudden sleight of hand in January 2015. This is par for the course and revisions should occur every five years, as better data and better sources of data become available.
There will probably be another revision soon, with base shifting from 2011-12 to 2017-18. If nothing else, transition to GST warrants that. This doesnt mean there are no issues with data. When a substantial chunk of the economy is informal/unorganised, that is inevitable. While this remains a problem even for full-year numbers, it is more serious for quarterly figures. In addition, national income estimates are in current or nominal rupees.
These are deflated (using GDP deflator as measure of inflation) to get constant figures (with 2011-12 as base). There are issues with the GDP deflator. It could be better and will no doubt be refined over time.
Thus, most economists will be more comfortable discussing (a) nominal growth; and (b) full-year numbers. But when Q2 of 2017-18 figures surface, there will be hype and debate about 6.3% real GDP growth in Q2, just as there was over 5.7% in Q1.
Lets stick to real GDP growth, with growth of 5.7% in Q1 and 6.3% in Q2. But do note, after January 2015 changes, whats really estimated is GVA. GDP is derived from GVA by adding taxes and subtracting subsidies. Real GVA growth was 5.6% in Q1 and 6.1% in Q2.
The difference between the two may look like decimal point differences, but there is a methodological issue.
Since GST is under implementation, if you were Indias chief statistician, do you think you would have an enviable task if you were asked to derive GDP from GVA When there are better indirect tax figures, these Q2 numbers are certain to be revised. Sticking with GDP, what does the full year look like
Indeed, and it shall, as reforms introduced by the government take hold.
Starting with Q1 of 2018-19 (probably even Q4 of 2017-18), growth should cross 7% and inch towards 8%. There is plenty of slack within the system, though approach towards 9% requires exports to perform better. (Q2 export numbers arent very good.) Do note that measures introduced by the government are broadly supply-side. These show results with a time-lag. Give it a couple of years.
There was never any reason for the gloom and doom that 5.7% unleashed. No one has conclusively established any link between demonetisation and growth.
There were transient effects, but those passed soon. GST is different. Few countries have implemented GST, as opposed to VAT, and even fewer have implemented something like a dual (Union and state) GST. GST implementation is a process and it takes time. Eventually, it leads to efficiency and growth and addition to tax revenue.
But in the interim, it inevitably has transition problems.
Other measures have also sought to incrementally shift more of the informal/unorganised to formal/organised. Though this too increases efficiency, it does lead to an immediate shock for the informal/unorganised. Part of the challenge for CSO (Central Statistical Organisation), or anyone for that matter, is to estimate impact on informal/unorganised, not only for quarterly estimates, but also the full year.
Behind national income, there is something economists call a national income identity. National income is the sum of consumption, investment, government expenditure and net exports. If growth has to pick up, one of these four has to drive that. With the evidence of Q2, generalising a bit, consumption expenditure and government expenditure have driven growth. But understandably, because of fiscal constraints, there are limits to government expenditure.
What about net exports (meaning both exports as a plus and imports as a minus) and private investments Based on Q2 alone, neither has done that well. However, in some segments, there is still excess capacity, there are signs of private investment recovery, though there is a legacy of stressed assets in banks. Stated differently, to use an expression economists are prone to use, there are indeed structural problems and reforms are meant to address those. This is one way to look at the problem.
Another way would be sectoral.
Based on Q2 again, worries would be agriculture and construction. Both have a strong employment angle. Indeed, higher growth is necessary for employment generation. There too, India has a data problem.
The gloom and doom of 5.7% was unwarranted. That is the bottom line. If you happened to fall for it, Q2 gives you a more realistic picture. From now on, the news will only get better. Expect a bit of that in the last two quarters of 2017-18, but be patient, there will be more in 2018-19.

Its not the first time it has happened
DELHI, Sunday  The incident that took place on the second day of the third Test between Sri Lanka and India at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium where players had to leave the field struggling for breath and even vomited due to air pollution is not the first time it has happened in the city.
Heres a Time line of some of the incidents:
In November 2016, two Ranji Trophy matches scheduled to be played in Delhi  Gujarat against Bengal at the Feroz Shah Kotla, and Hyderabad versus Tripura at the Karnail Singh Stadium  were called off without a ball bowled. The air pollution, to put it mildly, was appalling. Several players complained of headaches and dizziness, while almost everyone experienced burning sensations in their eyes. After match officials inspected the conditions on the first two days, the matches were postponed and relocated.
RP Singh, part of Indias World Twenty20-winning squad in 2007, was part of the Gujarat team, and he tweeted a collage of pictures, with the words: precaution is the best medicine #dressingroom #DelhiSmog #delhipollution #RanjiTrophy. Almost all the Gujarat players seen in the pictures are wearing masks. A third image, taken from the dressing room viewing area, is so hazy that you can barely make out the floodlight tower on the other side of the ground.
Schools were closed in the city not long ago because the Air Quality Index reached crisis levels. But when Sri Lankas cricketers, who are fortunate enough to breathe far cleaner air on their island, complained about the smog, and emerged after lunch wearing masks, the general reaction appeared to be indignation, feigned or not.
Javier Ceppi, who was tournament director of the recently concluded FIFA Under-17 World Cup, the first such event that India has hosted, made his views quite clear on Twitter. You can't host sport events in Delhi from Diwali till end of Feb, at least, he wrote. It is a fact. We had to accommodate our whole schedule to avoid it and others should also think about athletes health first #DelhiSmog
Nic Pothas, Sri Lankas South African-born coach, spoke of an unprecedented situation. It is not normal for players to suffer in that way while playing the game, he said at the post-play press conference.
From our point of view, it has to be stated that it is a very, very unique case. I thought all the officials, the Match Referee and others handled the situation very well. When it is a new situation for everybody, it is not easy to make decisions. I feel for the umpires and I feel for the Match Referee. But the job of myself and the manager is to make sure that the players are safe.
On November 8, pollution surged so high that some monitoring stations reported an Air Quality Index of 999, way above the upper limit of the worst category, Hazardous. +United Airlines canceled its flights to Indias capital because of poor air quality. Visibility was so bad that cars crashed in pileups on highways and trains had to be delayed and canceled.
Hospitals reported a 20 percent surge in patients with pollution-related illnesses, and doctors have declared a public health emergency. +Delhis chief minister went as far as to call his city a gas chamber.
WHY THE AIR GETS POLLUTED
Whats unique about Delhis smog is that the smoke from the burning outside the city is mixing with pollution inside the city  from construction, vehicles, and fires the poor use to cook and keep warm. This mix of rural and urban pollution intensifies in the cooler winter months and the air currents through the region have been unusually slow, allowing the dirty air to linger.
The airborne particles and toxic chemicals that make up the smog and have choked the 19 million residents of the metropolitan area, where merely breathing the air was, at its worst, like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day.  ST

Jaffna University Research, Training Complex project
An initiation ceremony for the Japan-funded project for the establishment of a Research and Training Complex at the Jaffna University Agriculture Faculty, was held recently.
The Government of Japan has extended a grant assistance worth 1.6 billion Japanese Yen (about 2.2 billion LKR) through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the project.
The chief guests for the ceremony included Higher Education and Highways Ministry Secretary D. C. Dissanayake, Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka Counsellor/Deputy Head Mr. Koji Yagi, Jaffna University Vice Chancellor Prof. R. Vigneswaran, and Senior Representative Toru Kobayakawa.
During and after the conflict, the entire Kilinochchi Campus of the university had to relocate for about 25 years until they finally moved back in 2014. The Faculty of Agriculture gradually increased its scale since then; currently 258 young and aspiring students from all around the island are studying together.
The new facilities to be constructed through this project include a building complex with laboratories and lecture rooms, crop and animal farms for field training, farm machinery, and laboratory equipment. At the end of the project, there will be practical training for maintenance and operation of some of the equipment.
With this assistance, students will have an opportunity to receive field-based, hands-on knowledge on agriculture. From 1954 to 2016, JICA sent more than 2,700 experts to Sri Lanka; a considerable sum of them specialized in agriculture. These Japanese agriculture experts are known for their approach to go into the field with farmers to transfer their knowledge by touching the dirt. JICA expects these new facilities in University of Jaffna to produce more of these farmer-scholars of Sri Lankas own and their ideas and innovations to bloom in the field.

Jordan urges US not to recognise Jerusalem as Israel capital

Jordan's Foreign Minister has warned the US of "dangerous consequences" if it recognises Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Ayman Safadi said he had told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson such a declaration would trigger great anger in the Arab and Muslim world.
Speculation is mounting that President Donald Trump will announce the move soon, fulfilling an election pledge.
Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, said no decision had yet been made.
In a tweet, Safadi said: "Spoke with #US Secretary of State Tillerson on dangerous consequences of recognising Jerusalem as capital of Israel. Such a decision would trigger anger across #Arab #Muslim worlds, fuel tension & jeopardise peace efforts."
There was no public response from the US State Department.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is trying to rally international support to persuade Trump not to make the announcement.
His office said he made phone calls on Sunday to world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He wanted to "explain the dangers of any decision to move the [US] embassy to Jerusalem or recognise (Jerusalem) as Israel's capital", Abbas's adviser Majdi al-Khalidi told the AFP news agency.
Palestinian leaders have previously warned the move would threaten a two-state solution.
Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It annexed the area in 1980 and sees it as its exclusive domain. Under international law the area is considered to be occupied territory.
Israel is determined that Jerusalem be its eternal, indivisible capital. But Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state.
Successive US administrations since 1948 have maintained that the status of Jerusalem is to be decided by negotiations and that they would not engage in actions that might be perceived as prejudging the outcome of those negotiations.
During last year's election campaign, Trump expressed strong support for Israel and promised to order the relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on his first day in office.
He has since delayed any such decision but speculation has mounted that he may make the declaration in a speech on Wednesday.
Addressing a think-tank in Washington on Sunday, Kushner, a key adviser to Trump, refused to be drawn and said it was up to the president to announce his intention at the appropriate time.
"The president is going to make his decision and he's still looking at a lot of different facts. When he makes his decision he'll be the one to want to tell you, not me," he said.

Lankan dressing room resembled a hospital ward
DELHI, Sunday Although it was not on television and on public view the Sri Lankan dressing room resembled one of a hospital ward with a team of doctors and medical staff with oxygen masks all attending to players suffering from breathing problems as a result of the high pollution in the
air that affected them on the second day of the third Test against India played at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Sunday.
Asanka Gurusinha talking through the incidents that took place during the days play told the Daily News: We had four guys vomiting  Suranga Lakmal, Dhananjaya de Silva, Lahiru Gamage and Jeffrey Vandersay and everyone else struggling to breath. Suranga couldnt walk up the stairs as he was throwing up because the intensity with which he bowled affected him.
We had four oxygen cylinders and the players were masked up inside the changing rooms. We had five doctors in there working on them. The Anti- Corruption manager gave us the green light to get anyone we wanted and match referee (David Boon) was also present.
For about 1 to 1 hours the readings on the polluted air was very close to 400 and that is extreme danger. It started dropping later on but it still says that if you go and check the index it says its hazardous. We heard that Ashwin after getting out had oxygen in the changing room, he said.
SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT FOR ICC
Gurusinha said that going forward it was an interesting topic for the ICC to look into. I know that David Boon was talking to the ICC and they dont have any numbers to work on. Most probably it might happen at the next ICC meeting where it will come down to medical reports and all of that, said Gurusinha.
I think it is the first time the ICC has faced this kind of situation. None of them knew about it, even the two umpires were struggling in the middle at that time.
SRI LANKAN PHYSIOS VIEWS
Sri Lanka team physiotherapist Nirmalan Thanabalasingham said there could be after effects from the exposure to polluted air and said they had to try and minimise the risk on the players who have already been exposed.
You can get infections from it because these particles in the air get caught and would not be removed from the systems. You can have a higher incidence of things like upper respiratory tract infection, more running nose and throat symptoms. We just have to be smart and give our guys the best possible advice, said Thanabalasingham.
The advice given by the doctors here at the ground was there were no long term effects caused by it, but my question was always thats for someone resting but not playing in an elite sport and having to perform under pressure with the increased stress on their respiratory system, he said.
In the middle of the day it got like there was a lot of pollution in the air. We dont have an exact measure except whats reported by the weather forecast. But there were a few players with respiratory distress in terms of like struggling to take deep breaths and we had a couple of guys who had to come off the field to be nebulised and open their airways up, he explained.
A few actually vomited because of the toxicity of the pollution they werent able to deal with it. We had a couple of guys with vomiting episodes all because of the para-respiratory distress they were under.
It mainly affected the bowlers because they were doing more of the work and the fast bowlers were the ones who probably took most of the toll.
Even me when I was running on and off I could feel heaviness in the air like I was a bit like puffed when I jogged up the stairs, whereas like at the end of the day obviously there was a difference, he said.

Kohli breaks 62-year-old ground record with career best 243
Lankans run out of breath in Delhi Test
DELHI, Sunday  Sri Lanka had to not only battle with the Indian cricketers but also the dreaded Delhi pollution that saw them down toten men on the field and running out of substitutes when Virat Kohli the Indian captain prevented the match from being further delayed by declaring with his teams score at 536-7 on the second day of the third and final Test being played at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Sunday.
Angelo Mathews plays an off drive during his unbeaten half-century.
By stumps facing a massive Indian total and requiring to score 337 to make the hosts bat again Sri Lanka were 131 for three wickets, to trail India by 405 runs. The first session of play took place without any incidents with India moving from their overnight 371-4 to 500-5 and Kohli completing his sixth Test double century - all achieved as captain off 238 balls with 20 fours. He had scored 213 in the second Test at Nagpur and thus had back to back double hundreds.
Sri Lanka managed to grab the wicket of Rohit Sharma on the stroke of lunch for 65 when he essayed a cut shot only to bottom edge it to the wicket-keeper giving Sandakan his third wicket of the innings.
The drama began after lunch when the Lankans took the field wearing masks to prevent them from the polluted air which had got heavier and hung like a haze for almost the day. It was not before long that Sri Lanka suffered their first casualty on the field when Lahiru Gamage who was bowling found difficulty in breathing. Play was stopped for about 17 minutes with the umpires and the two captains in conversation and when it resumed Ashwin lost his wicket to the first ball edging Gamage to Perera at gully. However midway in his 26th over Gamage was forced to go off the field unable to continue struggling with his breathing. Gamages new ball partner Suranga Lakmal followed him to the dressing room soon after with the same problem. With all these interruptions taking place Kohli who had moved to his career best score of 243 lost his concentration and was trapped lbw by a Sandakan delivery that spun back to rap him on the pads to end a brilliant innings that lasted 430 minutes and 287 balls and comprised 25 fours.

Kohli had by then broken a 62-year-old ground record for the highest individual score that had stood to the name of Bert Sutcliffe on New Zealand since 1955. Sutcliffe made 230 not out. Kohli also passed 500 runs in a Test series for the third time in his career with only Sunil Gavaskar ahead of him amongst Indians with six. With Sri Lanka struggling to get ten fit men on the field India declared at 536-7 leaving them with 50 overs to bowl at the Lankan batters.
Faced with such a daunting total Sri Lanka got off to one of their worst starts losing opener Dimuth Karunaratne first ball to a peach of a delivery from Mohammad Shami that squared him up and resulted in an edge to the wicket-keeper. Sri Lanka also lost Dhananjaya de Silva making a comeback to the Test side for one to be 14-2. But Dilruwan Perera promoted to open as Sadeera Samarawickrama was under observation played a gutsy knock of 42 off 54 balls (9fours) and put on 61 for the third wicket with Angelo Mathews before losing his wicket. Perera survived a chance at 16 when Shikhar Dhawan dropped him at second slip off Shami but what was worse was that the ball hit the helmet placed behind him the wicket-keeper and Sri Lanka earned five penalty runs. Mathews and Chandimal saw Sri Lanka through to the close on an eventful day remaining unbeaten on 57 and 23 respectively having so far figured in an unfinished stand of 56.
Samarawickrama suffering from mild concussion did not take the field yesterday.
He was struck on the forehead of his helmet while fielding at short leg by a pull shot from Murali Vijay on the first day of the third Test and left the field and took no further part in the match.
A precautionary CT brain scan cleared him of any danger but he was kept under strict observation.

Tribute to Professor T. Nadaraja
Legal icon remembered for brilliance
It was in Peradeniya that I first met Professor T. Nadaraja. We were then in our early thirties, an age when one is neither too young nor too old, when friendships made are of closeness that survive the passage of time.
As I now look back in my twilight years on those happy carefree days, my memory lingers on those who made a deep impression on me, one of those persons was Professor Nadaraja. A friend told me that he was dead, he brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to shed.
It was with great sadness that I learnt of the passing away of this very learned man. It was such a pleasure and an education in itself to converse with him. He has often been described as an eminent jurist and an outstanding academic scholar, but he was much more than that.
Ever since his undergraduate days at the University of Cambridge he had been a collector of books. The library at his home had books on various subjects. He had an excellent collection of books on Indian philosophy, religion, art and sculpture.
He was interested in the ancient civilisations and culture of Greece and Rome, China, Egypt, Persia and the Mayas of South America, as well as the more recent history and culture of the Western world.
His library contained well-known books on English Literature and poetry and comparative religion. He was a master of the English language and very precise in the use of the spoken and written word.
He had a profound knowledge of Hinduism and that can be judged by a book written by him called The Cult of Siva with special reference to the Dances of Siva.
His mother a gentle and cultured lady, was the daughter of Sir P. Arunachalam and it was her great influence on her son that made Nadaraja a lover of books, and music. At an early age she taught him the Thevarams (hymns) the Tiruvasagam and the other Tamil classics.
He was a firm believer of the Perennial Philosophy. In the preface of the book Islam and Perennial Philosophy authored by Frithjof Schoun the meaning of Perennial Philosophy has been explained as The Philosophia Perennis has come to signify for those devoted to traditional studies an eternal truth at the heart of all traditions, corresponding to the Sanatana Dharma of Hinduism and al-hikmah al-khalidah of Islam.
Inherited knowledge
It is not surprising that he should have inherited this vast knowledge of Hinduism, as his paternal and maternal ancestors have been known as builders of temples. On his paternal side he came from a wealthy family well-known for sponsoring charitable causes.
His great grandfather built the Sithy Vinayagar Temple and pilgrims rest in Colombo where Swamy Vivekananda visited and gave a lecture. Nadaraja was the chief Trustee of this temple from 1945 onwards.
On his maternal side, his great grandfather Gate Mudaliyar Arunasalam Ponnambalam, the father of the three famous brothers P. Coomaraswamy, Sir P. Ramanathan and Sir P. Arunachalam built the well-known Sri Ponnambalavanesvara Temple in Colombo, His son Sir P. Ramanathan renovated the temple and modelled it on the lines of the famous South Indian temples.
His grandfather Sir P. Arunachalam built another well-known temple in Mutwal, Colombo, called the Arunachaleswara Temple. Professor Nadaraja was a Trustee of all these temples.
He was the patron of the Hindu University Society at Peradeniya when the Law Faculty was there. He has contributed many well-known and learned articles on Hinduism to various journals.
An interesting account of Nadarajas family background is in a book about the genealogy of the Jaffna Tamils. It states that Mudaliyar Aramuganathapillai Coomaraswamy was the first Tamil to be appointed to the Legislative Council in 1833.
His son Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy who was the first person who was neither a Christian nor a Jew to be admitted as a Barrister of London. He was also an appointed member of the Legislative Council. Sir Muttus son was the renowned scholar Ananda K. Coomaraswamy.
Sir Muttu Coomaraswamys sister married Gate Mudaliyar Arunasalam Ponnambalam who built the Ponnambalavanesvara Temple in Colombo. He was the father of the three illustrious sons, P. Coomaraswamy, Sir P. Ramanathan and Sir P. Arunachalam, these three brothers were also members of the Legislative Council.
When Sir P. Arunachalam retired from the Civil Service, he was appointed to the Executive Committee of the Legislative Council. Sir P. Arunachalams son, Sir A. Mahadeva, KCMG, was a member of the Legislative Council and the State Council. It is unique that a member of this family has served in the Legislature in an unbroken line from 1833-1947 for nearly one hundred and fifteen years.
In the sphere of education it was his grandfather Sir P. Arunachalam who first pleaded for a University to be established in Sri Lanka, and he is rightly known as the father of the University Movement.
The first Hall of Residence in the University campus at Peradeniya was named Arunachalam Hall to honour the memory of Sir P. Arunachalam. He also wrote a well-known book on Law called Digest of Ceylon cases.
Legal career
It was his grand uncle, Sir P. Ramanathan who was the first person in Sri Lanka to ask the government to establish a Law College, and it was through his efforts that the Law College was founded. He was also responsible for publishing the Law Reports.
It was into this family that Nadaraja was born on December 27, 1917. Natured from early years in the culture and traditions of his forebearers he distinguished himself in the study of law.
His books on the Roman-Dutch Law of Fideicommissa and the Legal System of Ceylon in its Historical Setting were described as classics and have been cited in Sri Lankan and South African courts, where the Roman-Dutch law prevails. He has written numerous articles on different aspects of the law and these are available in the Law Library of the University of Colombo.
Nadaraja was educated at Royal College, Colombo, where he won many prizes and the coveted Shakespeare Prize. He proceeded to the University of Cambridge for his legal studies and entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge.
He was awarded First Class Honours in both parts of the Cambridge Law Tripos, the Bond Prize for Roman Law, the Davies Prize for English Law and the Post Graduate Law Studentship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.
At Lincolns Inn, London, Nadaraja was awarded the First Class Certificate of Honour by the Council of Legal Education, London, and the Buchanan Prize of Lincolns Inn.
He obtained his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the Cambridge University, and he was awarded the Hon. LLD (Colombo University) and the Jaffna University conferred the degree Hon. D.Litt. on him.
The Bar Council of Sri Lanka honoured him in recognition of the contributions made by Nadaraja in the field of legal literature and legal education by conferring Life Membership Honoris Causa on him.
Professor Nadaraja was a lecturer at the Ceylon Law College from 1943-49. When the University of Ceylon started a Department of Law in 1947 Nadaraja joined the Law Department in 1947. He was appointed Professor of Law in 1951. He was Dean of the Faculty of Arts 1957-1960.
When the Department of Law was made a Faculty of Law, he was the Head of Dean of the Faculty of Law from 1960 until he retired from the University. He was Chancellor of the University of Jaffna from 1984 until he passed away on January 20, 2004.
Nadaraja was President of the Classical Association 1970-71 and a past President of the Royal Asiatic Society, where his grandfather Sir P. Arunachalam had been the first Ceylonese to be elected to that post.
Professor Nadaraja was a soft-spoken and cultured man. He was ready to help anyone who came to him for advice or material benefits. Whatever charity he did was never publicised, he considered them to be unremembered acts of kindness and love.

Life with a legendary cartoonist
Children arrive in a world already made. Their slates are blank, but all the slates around have long been written on. It was simply a given that both of my parents were selfless and energetic. That they could laugh at themselves and crack a joke. That they were politically conservative and believed in God. That my mother was outgoing, disciplined, and persuasive. That my father was a soft touch, and patient beyond reason. That his mind was an overstuffed attic whose door was ajar. That he could draw and paint. That even simple directions on a scrap of paper would be embellished with drawings of houses and trees, cars and cows.
My father grew up in Chicago but was born in New York City. As if called by instinct to some distant spawning ground, his mother insisted on boarding the 20th-Century Limited and returning to her native Manhattan whenever the time drew near for the birth of a child. He began drawing at a very early ageand also began carefully saving his work, as if for posterity, starting when he was about five. Given posteritys likely interest, he also began saving his tests and papers from school.
Simple response
My father signed his work carefully, first as Jack, the name he was always known by, and sometimes as J.C., and only much later with the full John Cullen Murphy. An artist of some kind is all he ever wanted to be if he couldnt be a baseball player, which he accepted early on he could never become. Once, late in his life, when asked by a fan to answer 20 questions about himself, he filled in the blank after a question about what had inspired him to do what he did with the simple response Liking it.
His family had an independent streak and a taste for the mildly unconventional, and encouraged him in his ambitions. His own father had been by turns a book publisher, a book salesman, and a literary agent whose most prominent client was the novelist and poet Christopher Morley. His mothers family included artisans and craftsmen of various kinds. One of them was a coppersmith who produced elegant houseware and small sculptures in the mission style. My father enrolled in drawing classes at the Art Institute of Chicago when he was seven. A few years later, after the family moved back east, he attended the Phoenix Art Institute and the Art Students League, in New York.
One unexpected stroke of luck was that his neighbor in New Rochelle was Norman Rockwell, whose studio on Lord Kitchener Road was about a hundred feet from my fathers back door. Rockwell had seen my father, then 14, with his unruly and very red hair, playing baseball at a field nearbyhe looked like what we have come to think of as a Norman Rockwell character. Rockwell stopped by my fathers house one afternoon to ask his mother if young Jack could pose for some illustrations. In the ensuing years my father found himself appearing in Rockwell paintings. At age 15 he posed as David Copperfield for Rockwells mural The Land of Enchantment, which is in the New Rochelle Public Library. As a cross-legged teenager he was on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post in September 1934, gazing at photographs of glamorous female movie stars. Starstruck is the title of the painting. A baseball glove sits by my fathers side, and a dog nuzzles at his knee. Rockwell once explained that, to make a posing dog or cat behave, you need only apply a slight degree of pressure to the base of the cranium where it joins the spine. In this instance, my father remembered, Rockwell also needed to add a sedative to the dogs water. - Lit Hub

Local electric three-wheelers to storm local market in Jan
An electric three -wheeler has been manufactured by a local entrepreneur for the first time in the Sri Lankan automobile history.
The inventor M. S. M. Rifkhan (Managing Director Sri Lanka Mobility (Pvt.) Ltd, has already built one three wheeler, powered a rechargeable battery c ells and has already completed 80% of the test run. The test which was very successful would be completed next week and the first five electric three wheelers would be ready from next January. We will put out 50 more by March 2018.
He said that he had a passion to do something unique for the country and when he saw foreign exchange bleeding to import three wheelers and then for spare parts and also the environmental pollution he decided to find a solution for it.
M. S. M. Rifkhan
He recalled that when he was in Europe he met former Sri Lanka Ambassador to the Netherlands and former Consul General in Frankfurt, Buddhi Athauda who introduced him to some of the electric car manufacturing companies to gain knowledge. I then also toured China to meet up with electric battery manufactures. Later together with the Moratuwa University guidance and some under graduates who are now employed with him built the prototype vehicle.
He also said that several surveys were also carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers UK, the second largest professional services firm in the world and other research agencies. I have invested around Rs 250 million so far including the factory in Ratmalana.
He said that the electric three-wheeler which would be branded as LENCAR and would be sold for Rs 500, 000 (including a taxi meter) which would be 40% less than competitors. LENCAR would be able to run 120 kilometers and would be powered by a Lithium battery that has to be charged daily. The LENCAR would be fully digitalized and technical support would be provided on-line 24 hours a day.
The project would be initially active in Colombo 1 to 15 Zones due to availability of charging points.
Rifkhan also said the budget 2018 proposals have given him a tremendous boost and encouragement and the government too behind his project.
He is now talking to Colombo Municipality to build several charging pillars along the main roads so that three wheelers could park at night and charge. In addition there would be a charging kit which would be introduced allowing three wheel drivers who have facilities at home to charge. I am now talking to the Register of Motor Vehicles for the registration approvals of the LENCAR and hope this would be cleared soon.
He said that the total project would create over 2,000 new employment opportunists in the first two years and it would also save around Rs 500 million monthly spent for the import of engine spares for current three- wheelers.

Needed accessible societies for people with disabilities!
Yesterday, Sunday December 3 was United Nations International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD). The observance of the Day aims to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilise support for the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities. It also seeks to increase awareness of gains to be derived from the integration of persons with disabilities in every aspect of political, social, economic and cultural life.
It also draws attention to the benefits of an inclusive and accessible society for all. The theme for this years International Day is Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies for all, with a focus on enabling conditions for the transformative changes envisaged in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Negative attitudes
UNESCOs event will focus on the role of inclusive arts in creating sustainable and resilient societies, where persons with disabilities will be entirely integrated among the main actors. This event echoes the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to participate in cultural and artistic activities and recognises their right to have the opportunity to develop and utilise their creative, artistic and intellectual potential. The artistic and cultural integration of persons with disabilities is interconnected with the improvements of other disability-related issues and gender equality.
The estimated one billion people living with disabilities worldwide face many barriers to inclusion in many key aspects of society. As a result, people with disabilities do not enjoy access to society on an equal basis with others, which includes areas of transportation, employment and education as well as social and political participation. The right to participate in public life is essential to create stable democracies, active citizenship and reduce inequalities in society.
Many societies conjure up unfair stigmas about the disabled. It is true that several people still have entrenched negative attitudes about them, particularly when they are involved in their everyday lives, such as workplaces. Worse still is the fact that people with disabilities also face ridicule and are often treated rudely by certain callous members of the general public. Besides verbal abuse they are on occasion subjected to physical abuse. Treating people badly for their physical or mental impediments is despicable, to say the least. Whether intentional or accidental this type of behaviour is intolerably dehumanising.
Make no mistake about it. Disabled people are not second class citizens. They have the same basic legal, civil and human rights as other citizens. They have the inherent right to respect for their human dignity. As full citizens, they are entitled to respect, equal treatment and full participation in society.
In this day and age when we do not condone sexism or racism in the work place or in any social situation, why should we allow prejudice against disabled people to continue. Too many often think of them as sickly, feeble and frail. Far from it, because many of those people rolling around in wheelchairs, except for some possibly temporary ailment, may be far healthier than the ones you see walking around.
Special amenities
But why do some people behave in such an inhumane manner towards others who are simply human beings Several people avoid mulling over the fact that some day they might become disabled too. Many believe that it is something that just happens to other people. Wrong, it can happen to anyone at any time through a debilitating sickness or accident.
Others lack self-esteem or have problems of their own that make them depressed and inferior. So they believe that ill-treating others will somehow give themselves an ego boost or draw other peoples attention away from their own shortcomings. That is why they search for someone vulnerable to hurt or humiliate someone who they think cannot defend themselves.
Also certain misguided folk see any kind of impairment as a weakness and simply cannot deal with it. Why One significant reason is because it reminds them that they too are vulnerable. Death and sickness hold a terrifying prospect for them and they would rather not be reminded about it. As such, interacting with a person in a wheelchair may seem like facing up to their own mortality.
Many modern buildings provide special amenities for the disabled such as ramps to facilitate the use of wheel-chairs and restrooms designed specifically for those with special needs. Several older buildings are being revamped with entrance ramps and other conveniences to make smoother progress for such impaired visitors. Still it is not just the public infrastructure that needs to be more disabled-friendly, because it is equally important that people have to change their bigoted perceptions.
Fortunately not everyone thinks that way. In this day and age attitudes about the disabled are changing, but seemingly but not as quickly as they should. Today the public has had to deal with the disabled on a regular basis, particularly after the end of a prolonged senseless conflict. Often, just by working with or getting to know a disabled person socially, is enough to dispel wrong ideas that they have about them.
Sociably acceptable
Many from a young age were taught not to stare at people with impairments. They were told that staring was rude which is indeed true. Yet at the same time looking at someone in a normal manner and flashing a smile is sociably acceptable. Ignoring people totally is tantamount to avoidance and certainly not a nice way to behave.
But those days appear to be over with acceptance and tolerance being the new catch phrase. Educating the public, particularly children, on disabilities can help destroy stereotypes and misinformation people hold about those with disabilities. Thankfully, many children realise that disabled people are not some gruesome monstrosities or evil alien creatures.
Clearly it is important that your child is made aware of a few aspects about peoples disabilities. Make it quite plain that someone with a disability should not be feared in any way. Make them understand that one is either born with a disability or you acquire it through sickness or an accident. And more important: Disabilities are not contagious.
You would have realised by now that people with disabilities are entitled to the same courtesies you would extend to anyone. That includes their personal privacy. If you find it inappropriate to ask people about their sex lives or their incomes, extend the same courtesy to people with disabilities.
There are many different ways to be courteous to a person with a disability.
The best way is to treat them as you would anyone else. Because people with disabilities are just people and do not deserve or need to be coddled or treated differently. Do not treat their disability as something to be pitied or ashamed of.
All of us have barriers that we have to overcome. You may not have a disability, but remember that it could happen to you.

Never skip breakfast
Skipping breakfast could increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease, according to new research. A study found that having a morning meal triggers the body's fat cells to eat up sugar rather than store it.
The process could help regulate the hormone insulin, which controls blood sugar levels, and prevent the body from producing excess fat which commonly triggers diabetes and heart disease.
This research adds to the popular idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, as it has been found to decrease the risk of obesity, regulate metabolism and provide lasting energy to get you through the day.
Skipping the meal has been linked to atherosclerosis or the build-up of fats, cholesterol and plaque in the artery walls which can lead to various other conditions including heart disease.
And though not eating breakfast may be thought to induce weight loss, as promoted by British actress Joanna Lumley, the study published in the Journal of Physiology says otherwise.The team in Bath and Nottingham, England, found that fat in obese people responds less to insulin than in lean people and the decrease related to the person's total amount of body fat.
For six weeks, the researchers asked 49 adults, 29 lean and 20 obese, to either eat breakfast every day before 11am or fast until mid-day. Participants in the breakfast group were asked to consume 350 calories within two hours of waking up and at least 700 calories by 11am each day.
The fasting group consumed no energy until midday. Before and after the six weeks, the researchers measured metabolism, body composition, appetite responses and markers of metabolic and cardiovascular health. They also measured the participants' fat for the activity of 44 different genes and key proteins.
The team studied the ability of the fat cells to take up sugar in response to insulin and found that eating in the morning increased that ability.Breakfast has been long-regarded as the most important meal of the day due to it being the initial source of energy when you first wake up. The body's blood sugar level is typically low in the morning and breakfast helps replenish it. Without that initial fuel from food, you may feel depleted of energy and may be more likely to overeat later in the day.
Studies have found that the consumption of breakfast can lead to lower levels of bad cholesterol and lower the chances of being overweight, as well as promote better memory and concentration.

The Public Service United Nurses Union (PSUNU) is to launch an island-wide lightning strike after December 5 if the Government fails to provide an acceptable solution for the demands of the union, PSUNU President Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo recently, the Thera said the union presented 12 demands to the Ministry and to recognise the nursing service island-wide was one. But the Ministry did not heed the demands.
Therefore, the Ministry should take the sole responsibility for all unpleasant incidents that may occur at hospitals during the strike, the Thera said.
"The union is to solve the issue through discussions but the Health Ministry and health officials seem they are not ready for it," the Thera said.

The original single lady
On Saturday, August 1, 1936, the woman who was poised to become the Depression-era guru of the smart single girl was alone in her midtown Manhattan apartment, preparing to celebrate the release, and the early glowing reviews, of her first book. The following day, the New York Times would sound a note that would soon become familiar, calling it amusing, sensible, worldly wise and very practicalnot gushing words, perhaps, but perfectly suited to both the book and its author, a plain, good-humored magazine editor in her midforties, who would soon be Americas most famous bachelor girl. But this description wont quite do, still less the sour-sounding spinster.
The best word for who and what she was is the one she coined herself: Live-Aloner. It explains her by the choices she made, not the husband she happened to lack. It was a status that depended on equal parts knowledge, pluck, willpower, and self-indulgenceall of which she would share with readers in her book: the bluntly titled, wildly popular self-help manual Live Alone and Like It: A Guide for the Extra Woman.
Most loved
For a celebratory occasion like this Saturday night, a single lady needed rituals. First came a long soak in the bathtub, and with it the habitual prayer of thanks that she wasnt at that moment being jostled onto a train at Grand Central Station by commuters bound for the suburbs. After the bath came whatever lotions and perfumes she most loved, whether they were gifts from admirers or treats shed bought herself. Then, wrapped in a summer-weight negligee (single women ought to own at least two, to be changed with the seasons), she might pour a glass of sherry or shake up a cocktail from the small stash of liquor she kept on a pantry shelfsomething her teetotal parents would never have done, but which was now not only acceptable but a marker of a single womans sophistication. With glass in hand, she could apply her makeupanother formerly scandalous practice, now perfectly commonplaceand choose what to wear for her evening out.
Marjorie Hillis had never been a beauty, especially not in the wide-eyed, china-doll style that was popular when she was growing up in the first decades of the twentieth century. But by the age of forty-five she had grown into her height and strong features, and knew how to command a room. Working for more than twenty years on the staff of Vogue magazine, rising from caption writer to associate editor, had taught her how to dress and set her dark hair in flattering and fashionable finger waves.
Careful choices
Although she could afford to shop at the best department stores in town, with money she both earned and inherited, she was no spendthrift. Instead, she invested thoughtfully in well-made clothes, making sure they coordinated with what she already owned, and taking care of them diligently so they would last. This philosophy had implications far beyond her wardrobe. Happiness, she believed, lay in making ones own careful choices about everything from what to wear, to where and how to live. And now, in a slim little greenish-gold jewel of a book, she was going to share those lessons of glamorous independence with single women everywhere. The shiny cover of Live Alone and Like It was deliberately enticing and slyly misleading. It depicted a series of bellhops in matching red uniforms marching to the Live-Aloners door, bearing flowers, gifts, and invitations, suggesting that the ultimate goal of her solitary lifestyle was romantic attention from menand plenty of it. In his introduction to the book, the irreverent Vanity Fair editor Frank Crowninshield played up this idea, suggesting that the truly successful Live-Aloner was just playing hard to get.
Like medieval nuns, he wrote, self-reliant single ladies would soon find suitors playing the guitar under their windows  placing ladders against the walls, sending them amulets by the Mother Superior. But Marjorie Hilliss model of the Live-Aloner was far more proactive than this cloistered sister. She made her own choices, mixed her own cocktails, and enjoyed the company of men without feeling any desperation to land one for life. She might spend her evenings in thrall to the adventures of Scarlett OHara in Gone with the Wind, another brand-new best seller in 1936, but she had no intention of behaving like the swooning heroine of romantic fiction.
Solo state
Live Alone and Like It announced in its first sentence that it was no brief in favor of living alone. Marjorie was not here to argue that a solo state was preferable to any other arrangement, but rather that it was quite likely, even if only now and then between husbands. A woman could be plunged by death or divorce, as much as by choice, into what the book called solitary refinement, and in these circumstances the challengeand the necessityof learning to make the best of it was more important than ever.
Although marketers and reviewers preferred to focus on the lighter, sexier model of the Live-Aloner, a stylish young woman having too much fun to settle for marriage just yet, the author herself never lost sight of those who were single against their will, nor of how quickly the sands could shift under a persons feet. - Paris Review

PM opens UNESCO seminar on ending crimes against journalists today
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will inaugurate the UNESCO's main seminar for the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists in Colombo today.
The 2017 International Day to End Impunity main event, entitled Reinforcing regional cooperation to promote freedom of expression and the rule of law in Asia through ending impunity for crimes against Journalists, will be held at Taj Samudra.
The event will be organised by UNESCO and the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, with the participation of various regional stakeholders including ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission of Human Rights (AICHR) and Human Rights Commissions representatives.
The one-day seminar will seek to advance dialogues and strategies to strengthen the regional cooperation on safety of journalists and ending impunity in Asia.
The event will focus on the role of the judiciary, National Human Rights Commissions as well as on the role of civil society and media in the persisting challenge of combating impunity for crimes against journalists in the region.
Through encouraging the exchange of best practices and identifying steps ahead and concrete solutions, the event aims to strengthen the fight of impunity for crimes against journalists in Asia and inscribe this issue in the larger framework to protect fundamental human rights.
The objective of the seminar will be to promote freedom of expression and the rule of law through fostering safety of journalists and ending impunity in Asia. This event falls under the global framework of the implementation of the UN Plan of Action on The Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity, UN Resolutions and UNESCO Decisions on safety of journalists.
By increasing the safety of journalists, reinforcing the fight against impunity and raising awareness for international standards and regional cooperation, the project aims to contribute to fostering peace and security, good governance and the rule of law.
This comes also with the proposed actions outlined in the Outcome document of the Geneva Multi-Stakeholder Consultation (June 29, 2017).
The event in Colombo will help raising awareness amongst regional bodies, national authorities and institutions, civil society and media on the importance of solving cases of killed journalists in order to strengthen the rule of law and stop the culture of impunity in Asia. The Colombo event will also promote the exchange of knowledge and dialogues between national institutions (e.g. National Human Rights Commissions, judiciary institutions, specialized protection mechanisms), regional organizations (e.g. ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, ASEAN Parliamentarians), civil society (lawyers associations, journalist organizations) and media.

Ports Authority clarifies allegations against Magampura Port
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority yesterday refuted allegations that a group of workers of the Magampura Port Management Company (Pvt.) Limited (MPMC) were terminated and their salaries were not paid for several months.
The Ports Authority stated that several inaccurate and misconceived reports relating to the MPMC and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) were circulating in the recent past.
"The allegation that the employment of the workers of MPMC has been terminated is false and SLPA categorically rejects it. The salaries of all employees for November were paid despite attempts by some workers to cause delays in the payment by sabotaging the administrative functions of the MPMC," the Authority says in a statement.
"We understand the MPMC will continue to pay salaries till further notice and further steps are taken according to law. The MPMC has clearly and repeatedly given the employees these assurances, however, the workers for reasons best known to them have continued to engage in illegal and wrongful activities that prejudice the security of the Magampura Port and the general need for law and order in the area," the statement says.
"There are proceedings before an Industrial Court to decide what relief the employees of MPMC are entitled to upon MPMC's closure. The SLPA and MPMC will continue to participate in these proceedings. MPMC has also offered to all its employees a voluntary resignation scheme with substantially higher compensation than what is required in teams of the law, which a group of employees has already accepted," the statement says.
"The Magampura port in its present state is economically non viable and the State is saddled with heavy debt and debt servicing costs. The Government took a policy decision to enter into a Public Private Partnership to infuse needed investments to the Magampura port to make it financially viable and to reduce public debt.
"It is in these circumstances the MPMC asked its employees not to report to work from November 30. The MPMC has no work to offer but has nonetheless assured employees that their salaries will continued to be paid.

Possible way out of present predicament
The change of regime on January 8, 2015, raised public expectations regarding good governance and socio-economic development. Yet, after nearly three years, most of these expectations have been dashed. Moreover, the developments in the recent months seem to create a conducive environment for the rise of undemocratic and oppressive forces again in the near future. In other words, there is a real danger of the State falling into the hands of oppressive and undemocratic groups. As a consequence, the opportunities for promoting social and economic development and public welfare appear to be disappearing fast. On the one hand, the countrys economy is under severe pressure due to increasing debts, continuing exodus of labour, in particular, skilled labour, widening trade gap and inadequate foreign direct investment.
It is quite clear that the countys economy is not in good shape. While the quality of life of ordinary people is deteriorating, the necessary reforms and improvements in sectors that directly affect the well-being of people have lagged behind. Among these sectors, education, social security, agriculture, health and public transport are the most important. The main reason for this situation is the refusal of the government to reorganize the government machinery on a rational basis as pointed out by the Sound National Policies Program in 2015. We submitted detailed proposals in the above regard but the leaders paid no attention.
Another factor that has significantly contributed to the above situation is the continuation of the earlier practice of appointing close relatives, friends and personal acquaintances to key positions in important public institutions including the Foreign Service without any consideration of the widely valued notions of equality of opportunity and merit, making many such institutions dysfunctional. As a result, scarce public resources allocated to such institutions are not properly made use of to give tangible benefits to the wider public.
Good governance
The situation outlined above has become a major source of frustration and anger for people who value good governance, social justice, public welfare and peaceful coexistence. It is urgent to take steps to change the prevailing situation and steer the country in a more positive direction. We need to point this out to the authorities through a collective effort. We sincerely hope that all right-thinking citizens, professionals and intellectuals will contribute to such an effort.
It did not take much time after the formation of the present government for its opponents to talk about good governance in a sarcastic manner. Today, it is not difficult even for unsuspecting members of the general public to be pessimistic about the good governance credentials of the regime. The credibility of many key members of the government is in tatters. There are many reasons for this but the most important reason is the much talked about bond scam. It has helped the opposition to downplay endemic corruption under the previous regime that was the main reason for its collapse.
The present regime was given a clear mandate by a majority of voters in this country. Those who rallied around the leaders of the regime prior to the elections had certain priorities for the new government. These were:
A) Enforcement of the law against those who abused power and engaged in corrupt practices and taking measures to prevent future corruption
B) Promotion of national reconciliation and establishment of national unity
C) Depoliticisation of public institutions including overseas missions
D) Responsible and accountable management of public finances
E) Adoption of rational public policies in critical sectors in place of ad hoc decision making, and, finally
F) The strengthening of parliamentary democracy and sub-national government including local government based on the subsidiarity principle
Yet, the way the government was formed and the structure of the government that came into being pointed to the fact that the new government was going to be a far cry from what was aspired for by the people. The appointment of over fifty Ministers drawn from diverse political backgrounds to the so-called national unity government headed by the newly appointed leader of one of the constituent parties was sure to create disunity within government and undermine any sense of direction. It was like getting ready to play a cricket match by two incoherent teams without an umpire.
The new government was formed at a time when the country needed a Head of State who could stand above deep political and other divisions, not one who would identify himself with one faction of the government. The country also needed a leader who could appear to transcend ethnic and religious divisions, not one who would closely identify with one ethno-religious group. The Head of State many people wanted was one who would firmly stand by the principles of good governance without fear or favour, not one who would compromise them even reluctantly to accommodate all kinds of politicians for the sake of political expediency. On the other hand, it is equally important to recognise the fact one cannot clap with one hand.
Behaviour of political leaders
Commitment to good governance should have been bipartisan in that the leaders of all constituent parties in the government should have demonstrated it in no uncertain terms. But this has not been the case as is clearly evident from the actual behaviour of political leaders throughout. The bond scam and the appointment of all kinds of people to important institutions are clear cases in point. In other words, against a backdrop of decade-long deterioration of standards of governance, the country badly needed leaders who would occupy the moral high ground and represent the larger interest of the masses and the country. Yet, after nearly three years into the new government, where we stand today is common knowledge and needs no elaboration.
So, what we have observed in the country has been largely politics as usual. While the average politician, by and large, has behaved in the way that he or she got used to for decades, the present, however, would have been different from the past at least with the presence of a Head of State who would remind all politicians that they have to strive to maintain higher standards of governance, irrespective of their party affiliation, and when they fail to do so, take action either to reign them in or to expel them from the government. But, this has not been possible because there has been almost no difference between the Head of State and Head of Government. The result is that the Head of State has not been able to insist on high standards of governance for party loyalists. The same has been true for the leader of the other main constituent party.
In view of what has been outlined above, it is clear that the overall situation in the country is precarious. There is so much at stake for the people and the country. The need of the hour is to pursue economic and social development through integrated planning guided by evidence-based policies and prudent public investment with equal attention being paid to promoting reconciliation and national unity, but increasing political instability today threatens to derail almost everything. Yet, it is still not too late for the leaders to strive to elevate themselves above sectarian party interests and demonstrate their commitment to broader national goals mentioned above. This is the only way to arrest the current negative trends in the country and restore public confidence and trust in the government. Otherwise, they will pave the way for a more disastrous situation than what they inherited from the previous regime.

I advised the former president in order to turn him to another King Dharmashoka or Nelson Mandela, but he did not listen and turned into another Robert Mugabe, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, glorious Robert Mugabe was sacked and the army grabbed power. That was how he ended up.
But Nelson Mandela went home as a glorious man. He was addressing the gathering after handing over certificates and medals to 61 schoolchildren who got through the grade five scholarship examination in the Beruwala electorate.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the Good Governance Government can go ahead without signing agreements with fundamentalists during its journey. Reconciliation is a must to achieve development and walk forward in the world as a developed country. Fundamentalism destroys countries.
The Dr. Rajitha Senaratne Education Centre in Darga Town organized the presentation of scholarships and medals for the third time. Minister Dr. Senaratne donated Rs. 300,000 to the Muslim Balika Vidyalaya.

Recurring wrongs
Over 14,000 children are institutionalized in Sri Lanka, and in the eyes of the justice system, this is the preferred way of dealing with orphans, victims of abuse, and alleged juvenile offenders alike.
Unlike in other countries, where judges often send young victims or perpetrators of crime to foster care or for alternative treatment, in Sri Lanka, the solution is often the same: institutionalization.
Theres a lot of child abuse, a lot of neglect, a lot of ill-treatment, because government officials are not practical, theyre not open-minded, said Marini de Livera, the Chairperson of the National Child Protection Authority.
This situation is a direct result of Sri Lankas laws.
A new report published by the UNICEF and Colombo-based Verite Research found that the current legal framework does not treat the institutionalization of children as a matter of last resort.
Instead, Magistrates have demonstrated a dispensation towards institutionalizing children within the justice system, the report states, rarely differentiating between alleged offenders and victims of crime.
The result is that children, many of whom are dealing with histories of violence and abuse, are often re-victimized by the justice system thats supposed to protect them. They are put into homes that are ill-prepared to deal with them as they wait months, even years, for their cases to go through the Courts.
This dispensation (by the Courts) risks removing the child from a family-oriented environment, the report adds. And subjecting him or her to further psychological trauma.
Punished for being a victim
Mumtaz Faleel is theCountry Manager of the Emerge Lanka Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides education, counseling, and support services to young women living in childrens homes.
She said she sees the effects of this flaw in the justice system in her work every day.
Faleel tells the story of Shenali*, a young woman who went through Emerges programmes.
Shenali was raped as a teenager, and taken into state care as a protectionary measure. But the case against the man who sexually abused her dragged on, and she ended up spending much of her young life in the childrens home, away from her family.
Shenalis situation is not unique: UNICEF found that it takes an average of six years between the investigation of a childs case and the commencement of trial. According to one source at the Attorney Generals department, approximately 40 percent of their total pending criminal cases were cases of child abuse.
After Shenali turned 18, she had to leave the home, and a judge in her case released her to Emerges care.
The nonprofit organization runs a three-month reintegration programme that gives young women life skills training, mental health counseling, and English and IT courses, before setting them up with jobs and boarding when they graduate.
At the end of the programme, Shenali got a manufacturing job, rented a room at a boarding house with a few other Emerge graduates, and began living independently.
But then her case was called again, and she had to travel to the Court, only for it to be delayed once more.
Rather than release Shenali back to her new home and job, the judge ordered that she go back to her childrens home, to ensure that she would come back to testify the next time her case was called up.
Now shes there indefinitely, said Faleel. Instead of earning money and building a new life, she spends her days sitting in an orphanage, waiting for her case to end.
Institutionalization is doing more harm than good, said Faleel.
We got the wrong end of the stick, dont you think In every other country, its the perpetrator whos locked up, or is in a list of some sort, or is subjected to stigma.
But here its completely the other way around, she added. We do all of that to the girl.
Punishing children like adults
The situation is also bleak for young people accused of committing crimes.
There are only two specialized juvenile Courts in the country, meaning that childrens cases are often heard alongside adults.
The UNICEF report found that notwithstanding the obligations under (Sri Lankan law), Magistrates often did not explain the charges to children in conflict with the law in language appropriate to the childs age and level of maturity. For that reason, along with a lack of legal representation, the report stated that many children were led into taking unfavourable plea bargains.
If a young person is found guilty of a crime, the Children and Young Persons Ordinance is supposed to provide alternative sentencing options, recognizing that children have a higher likelihood of successfully reintegrating into society than adults, if theyre supported with counseling and education.
But Verite and UNICEF found that this option failed to play a part in the criminal justice proceedings, to the detriment of children.
Moreover, the report states, since a large proportion of children in conflict with the law are first time offenders, petty offenders, or offenders as a result of an adult using a child for the purposes of a criminal activity, institutionalizing such children adversely affects their reintegration into society.
By being locked up at a young age, you have become vulnerable, through that same system that has failed to recognize your vulnerability, said Sajeeva Samaranayake, a former National Child Protection Authority Deputy Director.
Samaranayake has a long history of being critical of the justice system in Sri Lanka, and was removed from his post this year for criticizing the way Sri Lanka handled cases of child abuse.
Everybody is kind of passing the buck, he said in a recent interview. Police pass the buck to the Courts, the Courts to the institutions, then the poor caregivers in the institutions are overwhelmed.
Potential reforms
The UNICEF report recommends reforms that they say would fix some of the justice systems most glaring faults.
One is to pass the Children Judicial Protection Bill, which right now is just a draft in the Ministry of Justice. The bill would require the Court to consider the best interests of the child in each individual case, and would provide for the appointment of a judicial guardian to assist in legal proceedings. It would also prioritise foster care over institutionalization.
Other recommendations are to create a sex offender registry, allow children to be cross-examined through closed-circuit television rather than in open Court, and raise the minimum age of criminality from 8 to 12. Another key recommendation is to create a database to track and monitor children within the justice system, which would be monitored by the National Child Protection Authority.
NCPA Chairperson Marini de Livera, says she agrees with many contentions of the UNICEF report, and its recommendations. We cant hide behind a narrow approach, she said. She said the NCPA recently received Board approval to start a pilot foster care programme with war widows in the North and East.
Orphanages are a structure that was introduced by the British colonial masters, she said. The British themselves have abandoned it and we are still clinging to it.
She also said the NCPA is in the final stages of developing a database of all the children in the justice system with the University of Colombo.
When Verite and the UNICEF launched the report earlier this month, Minister of Justice Thalatha Athukorala said she would be setting up a steering committee to advance the recommendations of the study.
While Sri Lanka, particularly the Ministry of Justice, has already initiated action related to some areas which the report highlights, such as increasing the minimum age of criminal responsibility as well as amending the Children Judicial Protection Bill to include the principle of best interest of the child as the predominant consideration in all matters related to the child, there remain areas for improvement that need to be addressed with utmost urgency, she said.
Until the laws are changed, situations like Shenalis, where children are deprived of liberty whether theyve committed a crime or not, will continue to be the status quo.
*Shenalis name and some personal details have been changed to protect her identity.

Sweeping changes in health sector
Sri Lanka expects to produce 80% of its drug requirements by the end of 2018, which will save USD 400 million plus annually which the government spends for drug importation, Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said.
Accordingly, the importation of all drugs which can be produced locally, will be stopped by the end of 2018, he also said.
The Minister also predicted that prices of medicinal drugs will further come down due to them being produced locally.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that Sri Lanka has already begun local drug production at two factories situated in Kandy and Horana. He further stated that a total of 38 agreements have been signed between the government and the local drug manufacturers to produce drugs in Sri Lanka.
It was further pointed out that there were 13 local drug manufacturers who locally produce 82 items for the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation(SPC).
Ten more local manufacturers producing 40 more items will join the local drug manufacturing in the near future, the Minister said.
The Minister also pointed out that the SPMC currently manufactures 54 medicinal items, where it will receive 100 more drug items through joint ventures it had engaged in with 37 manufacturing parties.
Accordingly, Sri Lanka will be able to produce 75 % of the 1,250 essential drugs locally.
Minister Dr.Senaratne made these observations at a media briefing held at the Department of Government Information yesterday.
Minister Senaratne also said citizens are now benefiting from a real free healthcare system where as what they had was a system dominated by many multinational corporations selling certain drugs and injections for extremely high prices than actually they are. These multinational companies who had created a mafia were robbing people at broad daylight. When the government implemented new health policy prices of certain injections dropped by 51%, 28% and even 84%. There was one injection which was then sold for Rs. 100,000 which they now sell for just Rs. 19,759. So, imagine the kind of profit they earned those days. When we introduced new policies, Health Ministry could make a profit of Rs. 600 million, Dr. Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne further listed out several revolutionary steps that will be taken by the government to upgrade Sri Lankas healthcare system to a modernized one.
Accordingly, the countrys health care system will be digitized via an E-Health policy. According to the E-Health policy, all citizens will be issued E-Health Cards which will record their health conditions so that any doctor can have a descriptive medical history of their patients. The E-Health System will be introduced to 45 Hospitals in the next two years and it is to be expanded to 300 hospitals following the initial implementation,Minister Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne also said that the World Health Organization and the World Bank have agreed to support Sri Lanka for a project to appoint two to three family physicians for every 5000-10000 families in the country. The project is worth USD 200 million which will be provided by the WHO and the WB.These family physicians are to provide reports on all families they are responsible for, on every six months, he said.
He further said that the government will restart recruiting Public Health Medical Officers and Public Health Medical Nurses for village level health care monitoring activities. As a part of the same modernisation process, Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka is now preparing itself to adapt to the new personalize medication system or the molecular medicine system that will be popular in the world in near future. He pointed out that this new system addresses the genetics of a health issue.
I thought I wont find anybody who has studied genetics, but in there were eleven of them recorded by the Health Ministry. Some have left the country but there are seven of them still remaining in the country. These persons have got MSc qualifications in Genetics. We have now deployed these people to a separate research laboratory. The government is facilitating these persons to achieve their further studies in the same subject area, so when the time comes, Sri Lanka will be ready for this new medication system, Minister Senaratne said.
Speaking of the shortage of medicines which prevailed a few years back, Minister Senaratne said that a new software has been introduced to track and manage medicine availability in main hospitals in the country. With this software, all responsible officers can monitor the drug availability of each main hospital and take necessary steps to fulfill such shortages immediately.
We have also added a feature where these hospitals can Handover-Takeover medicines from the closest hospital available, rather than we sending drugs to hospitals from Colombo. The same software facility will be provided to all the base hospitals as well, Minister Senaratne pointed out.
Similarly, the government is to launch a project to manufacture a key ingredient in medical products using liters of blood plasma daily unused in the country, he added.
We will have a joint project with United States of America and India to produce certain ingredients which are very important in some medical products. When we export blood plasma, these countries manufacture these ingredients and export them back to our country for very high prices. With this new project, we will receive a quantity of these products for our local use, he pointed out.
A similar clinical wastage recycling project, spending Rs. 2600 million will also be launched, Minister Senaratne pointed out.
He also said that European Standard Hospitals will be established in Hambantota, Panadura, Dambulla, Matale and Ebilipitiya with German, Netherlands and French aids.
Dr.Senaratne said that there is a staff shortage in the health sector and pointed out that he has given directions to the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) to double the number of medical specialists in the country in the next few years.
Meanwhile, a proposal has been submitted for Cabinet approval to prohibit selling of cigarettes in a 500 meter radius of all the schools in Sri Lanka, He said due to measures taken by the government, smoking has been reduced by a 15% over the last two years.He further said the government will completely stop local tobacco production in Sri Lanka by 2020.
To further discourage smoking a plain packaging method for all cigarette packs will be introduced.
Minister Senaratne quoting from the World Health Organization report for the year 2016 said that the WHO has praised the present Healthcare System in Sri Lanka to be a role model to the world. Minister Senaratne also pointed out that cigarette sales has decreased from a 1 billion in quantity and that cigarette companies have recorded a loss of 25 billion after the implementation of these measures.
Meanwhile, according to Dr.Senaratne, the Emergency Medical Service System of the country will soon be strengthened with eight Airbus Helicopters and 28 state-of-the-art emergency vehicles.
While pointing out Sri Lanka only have emergency ambulance service in the country, the Minister said the helicopters will be an efficient addition to the system. Funds for the helicopters and emergency vehicles will be provided by a German Emergency Service following discussions with Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
Dr.Senaratne observed that these new additions will strengthen the 1990 Ambulence Service which has saved thousands of patients with its efficient service.
He pointed out the 1990 service has provided emergency service for 21 children and saved all of them.

Ten - man United beat Arsenal in thriller to keep heat on City
LONDON, Saturday: Manchester United held on with 10 men after Paul Pogbas late dismissal to beat Arsenal 3-1 in a pulsating game at the Emirates Stadium on a day when Liverpool and Chelsea also kept up the heat on Premier League leaders Manchester City.
With Pep Guardiolas free-flowing side not in action until Sunday, second-placed United closed the gap at the top to five points with a thrilling display that belied manager Jose Mourinhos reputation as overly defensive away from home.
While goals from Antonio Valencia and Jesse Lingard inside 11 minutes, and a further second-half strike from Lingard, showed United at their best, Pogbas crude studs-up lunge at Hector Bellerin revealed another side in the 75th minute.
The Frenchman deservedly received a straight red card and will miss three games, including next weeks derby against City.
Until Pogbas dismissal, everything had looked perfect for United, for whom David De Gea was outstanding and was beaten only by Alexandre Lacazette just after the interval. What I saw today was the best goalkeeper in the world, said Mourinho, who said he did not know what to make of Pogbas dismissal and would leave it to the television pundits to decide. Liverpool took advantage of Arsenals first home Premier League defeat in 13 games to move fourth after thumping Brighton & Hove Albion 5-1. Juergen Klopps side have now scored 15 goals in four away games in all competitions.
The German made even more changes than his team scored goals, leaving out six of the side who beat Stoke City 3-0 in midweek.
Liverpool were not weakened and after stand-in centre half Emre Can put them ahead with a bullet header, Roberto Firmino hit a double, Philippe Coutinho scored from a free kick and Brightons Lewis Dunk headed into his own net. With the visitors three up, Glenn Murrays 51st-minute penalty was not enough to spark Liverpools usual defensive jitters.
Earlier, Chelsea came from behind to sweep past Newcastle United 3-1 at Stamford Bridge.
After Dwight Gayle gave Newcastle the lead, Belgiums Eden Hazard produced nine shots, six on target, and two goals in a display that, according to Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez, made the difference against a side who have now gone six games without a win.
Hazard also provided a potent reminder of what England can expect when they face Belgium in the World Cup in Russia next year.
At Vicarage Road, Spurs clung on for a 1-1 draw with their near neighbours after Davinson Sanchez was sent off for elbowing Brazilian Richarlison at the start of the second half. - Agencies

A tense situation arose between the customers and employees of a filling station at Kokkawil in the Jaffna Peninsula, yesterday, due to quantities of water being mixed with diesel.
It was further reported that some of the tractors with oil tanks containing diesel filled from the said filling station, were stuck in mud when they were running on paddy fields in the area.
However, the argument which began with some customers and employees of the filling station developed to a fray. Later, the dispute was quelled by the involvement of a third party, while the customers had launched a complaint about the incident to the Kokkawil Police.
Following the complaint, officers attached to the Kokkawil Police station had visited the said filling station for an investigation and taken some oil samples.
Meanwhile, they have ordered to the manager of the filling station to avoid issuing oil to vehicles till they receive the statement on the quality of oil samples.
However, at the time of the investigation, it was also reported that the manager of the said filling station had told the Police that there was a possibility of mixing water into diesel tanks due to the heavy rain that occurred during the last few days.

Tourism Minister  assures more  concessions for industry
In addition to the concessions granted to the tourism industry through Budget 2018, the Ministry of Tourism Development has made other specific requests to the Minister of Finance. These requests include reverting to the previous excise licensing hours, credit facilities for the trade and other concessions.
This was revealed by Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga during his address at the Institute of Hospitality Sri Lanka Branch 19th Chairmans Black Tie Dinner on November 29 at the Colombo Hilton. While Minister Amaratunga was the Guest of Honour, British High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, James Dauris was the Chief Guest at the gala event.
The Minister spoke at length about the many challenges the industry has faced this year and the resultant slowdown in arrival figures. At the very start of the year we faced the challenge of the partial airport closure which went on for four months. This was followed by devastating floods in the southern half of the country followed by the dengue epidemic which resulted in many countries issuing travel advisories. All this took its toll on the arrival figures this year. We will most likely see the same number of arrivals as last year, he said.
The Minister was also optimistic about the year ahead. After much effort we are finally seeing progress in the global marketing campaign which as the industry keeps pointing out, is long overdue. One of the issues we have had is the stringent checks and balances with regard to finance and the fact that officials dont want to take a chance given past experience. These are practical issues that have delayed the global campaign. However the digital campaign is now ready to be implemented early next year, the Minister explained.
Focusing on another challenge, Minister Amaratunga highlighted the need for skills development and proper training for hospitality industry personnel. It is no secret that we are facing a shortage of skilled personnel for the hospitality industry. An organisation such as the Institute of Hospitality is in a unique position to help us overcome this problem by leveraging its experience and know-how acquired through 78 years of existence and a branch network spanning over 100 countries, he said.
Minister Amaratunga called on the institution to actively contribute to the national training efforts undertaken by tourism stakeholders. Im aware that this is already taking place but these efforts must be extended beyond the periphery and directed towards attracting the youth in rural areas who may otherwise be lost to the industry, he said.
The Institute of Hospitality is a professional body for managers and aspiring managers working and studying in the hospitality, leisure and tourism industries. It has been playing an important role in Sri Lankas tourism landscape since the early 90s. Established in the 1930s in the UK, today the Institute of Hospitality has grown in to a global authority in the hospitality business and continues to play a leading role in Sri Lankas evolving tourism industry.

The tusker fallen at mans inhumanity
Tuskers are rare in Sri Lanka. The tusker, having being hunted and persecuted for its ivory for centuries, eventually began to disappear from the gene pool. It was no longer beneficial for the elephant to carry tusks. But once in a while, we have nature throw back a gem, and we are allowed to witness the majestic allure of the tusker. So, Dala Poottuwa was born. A magnificent elephant whose tusks would lightly cross at the end.
Its untimely death and the brutality of the murder would shock the nation. and have it collectively mourn the death of another innocent life taken by mans eternal greed for wealth.
Dala Poottuwa appears
The elephant had spent most of its life unknown to man. Not many had seen it in the wild. But a chance sighting of its unique tusks made the elephant instantly famous and then on, wildlife officials began keeping a close eye on the animal. They had not seen such a large tusker. The officials noted that this was an important point in the elephant genetic pool in the country and that it could make a great difference to a genetic pool where tusks were fast disappearing.
This elephant unseen by many came into the limelight in 2011. It was born in Galgamuwa and was thus identified as the Galgamuwa tusker. It spread its scent all over fields of Galgamuwa as it would head to the Kala Wewa National Park. Its main ornament, the extraordinary tusks supported by his immense stature.
This elephant who started to frequent Kala Wewa became a marvellous sight to many who would come to watch. As people started to see it more at the Lake and it grew in popularity in the Kala Wewa national Park, wildlife officials became more alert to its whereabouts. By that time, the officials noted that the animal's right eye was almost blind. It was steering himself only with its left eye. But it had the talent to move about kilometres at a time in the jungle without making a single sound.
The elephant who would spend most of his time on his own, would meet his fellow elephants at the lake and thereafter slowly proceed into the reserve through Galkiriyagama, Konpolayagama, and Katukaligama. Its trail created a new environment around it and would at times suddenly re-appear from Madatugama. As it entered the village with much flare, the villagers would run for cover, not knowing what was happening. But the elephant would not worry about this; it would calmly proceed in his journey.
First attack
Wildlife officers in search of Dala Poottuwa.
It was during this journey that it ended up on the main Dambulla-Kekirawa road. An elephant who was not used to development, was perhaps shocked at the sight of the main road with its many vehicles. It started walking along the main road and at that point it kept bumping into oncoming traffic. Its massive body started bleeding. As it struggled with pain, it stopped on the side of the road, it was thereafter that the wildlife officials came looking for him. By that time, it had crashed into around 49 vehicles on the road. Veterinary officials from around the country came to treat it and made great efforts in curing it.
This debacle had put officers in treating the elephant for six months at the Kala Wewa National Park Kurugomu Sevana. As it recovered his strength, its main focus became returning to its home ground in Galgamuwa. But it was no longer strong as it used to be.
It was at this time that an elephant herd entered the Kala Wewa Park; they were ideally suited to help this visiting elephant. This herd had close to 30 elephants and thus all the protection needed for Dala Poottuwa was found within the herd. At times when it did not have the strength to feed himself, the officials observed members of the herd help it out by giving it food and helping it out in various instances. In return, it did not fight with any of its members. The leader of the herd, called Hakki was seen to ensure that Dala Poottuwa was well looked after by her family and they took it back to its home in Galgamuwa. They then left it there and returned to the National park.
Many of the areas in Galgamuwa were this elephants stomping grounds. But it was noted for not destroying any paddy fields or farms as it traversed the area looking for food. Hunger would only drive it to uproot one or two cashew trees or eat two or three watermelons growing the area. Apart from that the farmers noted that the elephant did not trouble them at all. The elephant became so well known that one would often see many houses keep pitchers of water outside of their homes so that Dala Poottuwa could quench its thirst.
The villagers of Raswehora, Palukadawela, Usgala, Siyambalangamuwa and Meegalewa were quite accustomed to the elephant and his frequent presence in the area.
Attacks continue
Despite this apparent comradery between the villagers and Dala Poottuwa, in 2015 the elephant would meet a tragic accident at the hands of a treacherous weapon. While walking around in Galgamuwa looking for food as usual, its leg got caught to a trap gun, setting it off and severely injuring his foot.
Its rear left foot was thus hurt and as it walked around suffering with immense pain, unable to cry out for help, its leg started to get infected. Fortunately for him, the wildlife officials eventually got to know of the accident, and they found it and took it in for treatment. But despite their best efforts, they were not able to completely cure the foot. It became partially disabled on his back left foot.
It spent his days thus and as 2016 dawned, tragedy stuck Dala Poottuwa once again during the first half of the year. Reports came in that it had been shot at again. This time, a group of individuals in the Siyambalangamuwa were blamed.
Having heard of the news, I rushed to the crime scene, by that time, many had already encircled the injured elephant and wildlife officials were tending to his wounds.
Wayamba Wildlife Regional Veterinarian Dr. Chandana Jayasinghe and his team worked very hard to cure the elephant who was writhing in pain. As many including myself prayed for his recovery, the doctors were able to cure it.
As 2016 drew to a close, Dala Poottuwa made its usual trip to the Kahallapalla Forest Reserve though Siyambalangamuwa. This was its usual visit to the Kala Wewa to meet his friends. The elephant was reborn once again though its lifespan would not last too long this time around.
On October 16 this year, Dala Poottuwa as usual was walking along chena cultivations and paddy fields and came towards the Moragollagama-Herangama area. It was seen enjoying the produce along the Kahallapalle forest reserve along the Herangama Lake and thereafter it was not spotted for a long time. It had almost vanished without a trace.
Prior to this, Dala Poottuwa had been spotted in June; it had come in search of Palmyra and its seasonal fruits. At around 2pm, it was seen at Gojaragama paddy fields in Galgamuwa along with two other elephants and many received the opportunity to watch them devouruing Palmyra fruits with great pleasure.
Villagers who eagerly watched this great beast marvelled at its calm demeanour and the manner this half blind, limping animal felt its way through kilometres of jungle with no harm to anyone.
The final journey
Not all humans were fans of this elephant. Some perceived the value of its tusks more than its life. On November 22, two suspects were arrested by the Walana Anti-Vice Squad with a set of ivory tusks and six elephant pearls from the Moragollagama-Nikawewa area. At the time, none suspected that these would have come from the famed Dala Poottuwa. Wildlife officials who studied the tusks started to suspect that these had belonged to none other than the Dala Poottuwa.
On November 24, wildlife officials, Civil Defence Force officials, and police officers formed a team to search the forest for Dala Poottuwa. I joined this search operation and together we scanned every inch of the forest, with no rest or food to keep us going but the sheer desire and hope that Dala Poottuwa still might be alive.
But as the days passed by, the hope offinding the elephant alive vanished. The operation though started on 24, did not yield any clue to the whereabouts of the elephant for many days. At the time, the tusks submitted to the High Court had undergone forensic testing proving that they belonged to Dala Poottuwa.
By this time, rumours started to spread around Galgamuwa. They said the killers had brutally killed Dala Poottuwa and cut him to pieces. But the search continued regardless, and the team continued to look for Dala Poottuwa.
Five days later, we started finding certain clues to the crime; the most important being a patch of land the suspects had cleared. It was suspected that they buried the elephant in this clearing, and there were certain areas that had been dug up using a backhoe machine. But having examined this area, we did not find any sign of Dala Poottuwa. As news of Dala Poottuwas disappearance spread, the search team grew in size and as a result, the Special Task Force joined in the search.
By the afternoon of the sixth day, the forest was full of officers of the Special Task Force. As we were ready for some breakthrough, an officer of the Herathgama Wildlife Office received a call from another section of the search team, informing him that a carcass of a dead elephant had been found. We all rushed to that area. We travelled around 10km to the spot where they had found the carcass. When we arrived, not only the search teams, but villagers too had flocked to the scene.
Having engaged in the search operations for the past six days, I could not believe what I saw. The camera which captured the majestic pictures of the tusker who roamed the fields of Galgamuwa now zoomed into its rotting carcass in the midst of the forest. Wildlife officials confirmed the carcass to have belonged to the Dala Poottuwa.
As medical officers conducted post mortem into the elephants death, the Horowwewa area jungle filled with mourners. The animal having lived 52 years of its life among the man and beast was finally brought down by the bestial nature of man.

Whither weather
In 2015, a paper in Nature titled The Quiet Revolution of Numerical Weather Prediction noted that, in the past forty years, the accuracy of three- to ten-day forecasts has been increasing by about one day per decade. Todays six-day forecast is as accurate as the five-day forecast ten years ago, the authors, led by Peter Bauer, a scientist with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, noted. The growth and path of Hurricane Sandy, in October of 2012, were accurately predicted eight days in advance, and both the 2010 Russian heat wave and the 2013, U.S. cold spell were foretold at least a week ahead of time.
Last Tuesday, much was made of the fact that a satellite map of rainfall estimates in the Houston area required two new colours to represent the tremendous amount of rainbetween forty and sixty inchesthat was expected. But no less astonishing, in the end, was the maps pinpoint accuracy.
Followers of the Weather Channel or the NHCs Twitter feed have grown accustomed to consuming visual datathose rainfall maps are the output of NASAs Global Precipitation Measurement mission. Among the dozens of Earth-observing satellites, belonging to various nations, are several used exclusively for weather forecasting. These include four geostationary satellites, GOES-13 through GOES-16, which sit high above Earth and monitor the planet as it rotates below. Five more orbits the poles every ninety minutes, monitoring a fresh north-south swath of Earth with each passage.
The ability to accurately predict the wind speed of mid-ocean hurricanes comes, in part, from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System, or CYGNSS, an array of eight small satellites launched last year by NASA. These detect the signals sent between GPS satellites and measure how they are scattered off the oceana proxy for surface roughness and, by extension, wind speeds.
All this data is fed into forecasting models of staggering power and elegance. They essentially divide the atmosphere into millions of cubes, several miles on a side, each filled with a wealth of known datatemperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Then the laws of physics are set loose, and changes in the atmosphere are simulated in three dimensions.
For a long time, the US model, known as the Global Forecast System, was the top of the line, but it is increasingly being surpassed by the European Centres higher-resolution model, based in Reading, England. (The European model accurately forecast the final landfall for Sandy, while the GFS was off by several miles.) Its almost like a CAT scan of the atmosphere, Mass said.
New weather forecast system makes predictions faster and more accurate
Weather forecasting agencies around the world are constantly developing new systems to produce ever more accurate forecasts, capable of capturing fast-moving, often chaotic and localised weather events. But this means bigger models and even bigger computing capacity. Denmark launched a world-first weather forecast system that can provide more accurate forecasts by the hour, using just a fraction of the computing power of conventional models in June this year.
Scientists at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) have a new forecasting providing more precise weather forecasts, updated every hour while using a fraction of the computing power typically required by such systems.
The new setup offers several advantages over traditional forecasting systems. One is that more frequent updates should make their short-term forecasts more accurate.
The hourly updates use the latest observations from satellite data and data from across DMIs observational network of weather stations and radars and should avoid sudden changes from one forecast to the next after each update.
In 2016, DMI launched a new supercomputer, based in Iceland, where it saves energy by running on geothermal power.
Another improvement is that the new system can forecast conditions for every 2.5 square kilometres, which should help them to capture localised events. The previous system produced meteorological data for every 5.5 square kilometres.
Global interest in new system
Other countries are watching to see how much of an improvement the new setup offers.
Inger-LiseFrogner from the Department of Research and Development at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute describes this type of approach as state of the art and in line with what other institutes are running and developing.
The national meteorological agencies in the Nordics plan to establish a joint forecasting consortium in 2022. The plan is to have one common forecasting system in operation by then.
The new model system
It is based on two existing forecast systems known as HARMONIE and HIRLAM. It runs on a 2.5 square kilometres resolution and is updated every hour. It produces a 24-member ensemble forecast, which means 24 possible scenarios for the weather over the next two days. The meteorologists then produce a forecast based on the probability of what the weather is likely to be doing at a certain place and certain time. This is called probabilistic forecasting.
Uses existing model with a new layer of statistics
The new setup is comprised of two existing models, which are run multiple times to produce a so-called ensemble forecast--essentially lots of slightly different individual weather forecasts that can all be analysed all at once.
This produces an ensemble of possible weather scenarios for a certain location at a certain time in the future, which the forecasters then use to calculate the probability of heavy rain or bright sunshine, for example.
Running more ensembles at regular intervals allows forecasters to see a greater spread of results that are updated as often as possible with up to date observations from weather stations, satellites, and radar networks.
Internet of Things brings new era of weather forecasting
Two years ago, Schneider Electric began selling remote monitoring stations aimed at agriculture that measure atmospheric and ground conditions such as soil moisture. There are now 4,000 of these systems deployed.
That data, when combined with government and private sources of weather data, is used to help develop forecasts that update every hour and help farmers make a better tactical decision about when to apply pesticides, water and fertilizer, said Ron Sznaider, senior vice president of Schneiders cloud service.
The idea is to mitigate the risk of weather, said Sznaider.
There are plenty of challenges ahead. Increasing amounts of sensor data also means trying to capture the physics correctly at those finer resolutions, said Mahoney. The feedback from urban environments, lakes, rivers, streams and many other conditions all influence micro-climates. Those physical interrelationships matter, he said.
For now, weather forecasters arent routinely using a cell phone or vehicle data but thats coming, said Mahoney, who said that over the next few years, research will result in methods and techniques to take advantage of those data sources.

A wise decision
All impediments to holding the local polls have been removed now, with the withdrawal of petitions against the delimitation gazette. The focus will now be on the inevitable political machinations and manoeuvres which is par for the course in our elections. One of the most intensely debated topics in this debate was whether the SLFP and the Joint Opposition (JO), in the guise of the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) would reach an agreement on contesting jointly. It was reported that both sides were insisting on several conditions for this to happen. A major condition from the JO was that the SLFP should leave the Unity Government.
The SLFP has reportedly rejected the demand of the JO to quit the Government as a condition for reunification. This was intimated to JO member of the committee tasked with rapprochement talks, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena by the SLFP committee member appointed for the same purpose, Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, according to media reports.
Abeywardena had been insistent that the SLFP leaves the Government, if the JO was to consider proposals to fight the upcoming LG election jointly, with the SLFP. Minister Yapa had deferred with his onetime Cabinet colleague, saying the time was not opportune for such a move right now, but they would give it a thought on another day.
The SLFP ministers have valid reasons for not ditching the Government at this stage. President Maithripala Sirisena has declared that the Unity Government will be taken forward for the benefit of the country. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is also on record stating that the President had assured him that he will continue the journey with the UNP. This, no doubt, would have been a strong message to the SLFP MPs in the alliance.
Perhaps, like Minister Yapa said, they would take the plunge on another occasion. SLFP spokesmen had been saying that the party would oppose the UNP at elections in 2020. Hence, the onetime arch rivals who have shed their differences to join hands in governance could revert to their earlier roles in the future. However, going by the statement of Minister Yapa, the party is not in the mood to take that decision now. Therefore, in all likelihood, the LG poll will see the SLFP fronting up to the UNP, as of old, but, debilitated by a major split.
The SLFP segment in the Unity Government, perhaps, may also have other valid reasons for not quitting. Many of its ministers holding important portfolios have already dished out largesse to their supporters in the form of jobs. One positive feature in the Unity Government was that no political victimization occurred with the change in Government. Instead there was a congenial atmosphere in workplaces with supporters of both parties working together. Any change in this arrangement will only result in the resurfacing of political rivalry at work places.
There is also the fact that the recent budget has generously served most of these SLFP ministers, under their Financial Heads. It would only be foolish to turn their backs on this gesture merely to join a political grouping to fight a Local Government election. Moreover, leaving the Government, sacrificing all ministerial perks and privileges to fight a Local Government election does not make sense. What stake will they have in the whole matter even if the JO was to win 75% of the local councils, as Prof. G.L. Peiris brags They would simply be cast adrift sans any power to wield, which they did as Cabinet Ministers. Besides, their prospects of re-election too would be bleak. Depending on the perspective of the voters, they will not forgive them for consorting with the enemy, so to speak.
It should also not be forgotten that some of the SLFP ministers were taken from the back door to Parliament via the National List, after losing at the 2015 General Election. Things can only get worse for them if they quit the Government now as they will be left in the cold with their political future ruined.
Besides, any SLFP ministers who leave the Government will have to cool their heels until the next General Election, which is not due until 2020. There is also the very likelihood of disciplinary action taken against them by the SLFP High Command, which will see them exit Parliament. Then they can kiss goodbye to receiving nominations from the party at the next General Election. The JO too is not going to take too kindly to those whom they consider renegades and offer them nominations at the expense of JO stalwarts. Worse, should the Pohottuwa fare badly at the LG polls, these worthies will be left to regret their move.
The only other question at this stage is whether the election would be held under the old PR or the new mixed electoral system, which gives pride of place to the electorate. Regardless of the method, we hope all parties will give nominations to 25 percent women, which is mandatory under the new system. This will usher in a new political culture.

Women biz leaders of SAARC to convene in Colombo
Women business leaders from SAARC Countries who form the executive committee of SAARC Chamber Women Entrepreneurs Council (SCWEC) will gather in Colombo this weekend to deliberate and map out strategies towards enterprise development across borders.
With social entrepreneurship as the main agenda, the forum will carve out specific areas where women across the expanse could collaborate in income generating activities, seamlessly, avoiding unnecessary trade barriers and cross border divides.
Top on the agenda will be the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) at which an E-SAARC platform for women will be established in partnership with Center of Pakistan and International Relations (COPAIR). COPAIR is an Islamabad based platform that empowers women using Information Technology. SCWECs Chairperson Rifa Musthapha will sign the MOU along with President of COPAIR and Chief Executive of Amna Malik Group of Companies, Pakistan, Amna Malik. Intensive online training and learning will be a key focus, to quickly up the skill levels of potential women sellers, to capitalize on the ever expanding e-commerce space.
Having identified that menstrual sanitation among rural women across the stretch of the SAARC region is a vital necessity; SCWEC will undertake an initiative that will re-define feminine hygiene. Determined that every woman in the SAARC region should have access to clean, affordable and quality, sanitary products, SCWEC has identified the need to encourage women to produce, promote and distribute bio-degradable sanitary napkins. Currently an alarmingly large number of women are still using cloth, hay, sand and unhygienic alternatives which affect their ability to carry on daily activities, much less to be involved in income generating activities.
Helping women to launch their own businesses, as well as manufacturing and distributing affordable menstrual pads is a fundamental priority to help prevent women from missing work due to lack of access to hygienic sanitary products, explained Rifa Musthapha. Through this initiative we hope to not only provide the necessary skills but also enable women to help themselves in finding financial independence for improved livelihoods through a self-sustaining enterprise.
Additionally, it imparts entrepreneurial and business skills training to village-level entrepreneurs to help them enforce and sustain livelihood opportunities said Musthapha. Manufacturing units will be introduced across the countries, owned by women who will employ needy women from surrounding communities. The biggest impact of this social enterprise will be the number of women who will be employed and empowered through better quality of life. We believe that every woman has the right to manage her menstruation with confidence and dignity, noted Musthapha.
