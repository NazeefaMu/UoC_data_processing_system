New Probationary Officers enlisted to NCC
A total of 70 Probationary Officers were enlisted to the National Cadet Corps having completed interviews and medical tests conducted at the Military Hospital.
They were selected from around 500 applicants who function as teachers at government, semi-government and private schools. These enlisted POs will be exposed to a 45-day military training at Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force Training School, Diyathalawa under the instructions of the Commandant SL Army Volunteer Force and the Director NCC.
The training includes theoretical and practical military related matters. They will also be provided with knowledge to train school cadets when they pass out and return to schools. During the period of training food, lodging, uniforms and medical facilities would be provided by the NCC under the supervision of the State Ministry of Defence.
The NCC is one of the most prominent youth development organizations under the purview of the Ministry of Defence. Several new developments have taken place on the instructions of present Director Major General A.K.P. Wickramasinghe. It is the intention of the President and the Prime Minister to start cadet platoons in every school.
Bearing the challenge, the HQ NCC has tasked the Commanding Officers of 38 Battalions across the country including Northern and Eastern Provinces to start new Cadet Platoons to achieve the target of training 40,000 at Rantambe Training Centre for 2017. When the probationary period is over, they will be Second Lieutenant. In addition to functioning as Platoon Commanders at school, they will join the mobilized service attached to SL Army, Navy, Air Force, NCC, Ministry of Defence, Rehabilitation Department, Youth Corps and Civil Security Department according to their desire, to serve the country.

No first pet at White House
Politically ambitious pups and kittens: Put your resumes aside. The job of first pet - an enviable White House gig with luxurious live-in privileges, after-hours access to the president and guaranteed positive press coverage - is not currently available.
Thats because President Donald Trump is not looking for a fluffy sidekick at the moment. Asked about plans for a four-legged addition to the White House, Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, said in a statement: The first family is still getting settled so there are no plans at this time.
If Trump stays pet-free, he will be breaking with a long held tradition of presidential pet ownership.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelts had his beloved terrier Fala. President George H.W. Bushs English springer spaniel Millie was featured on The Simpsons. When President Barack Obamas family acquired their Portuguese water dog Bo, it was big news.
In the modern-day presidency, almost all of them have had a pet, said Jennifer Pickens, a White House social expert who wrote Pets at the White House. Still, she noted, all didnt necessarily have them at the beginning of the administration.
Power and pets have long gone hand in hand.
For some reason people in power, they end up suffocating different opinions and dominating their staff, but they in some ways long for someone who will speak up to them, and a pet will, said Doug Wead, a former George H.W. Bush administration staffer who wrote books on presidential children and the 2016 campaign.
Wead noted that political pets can sometimes be used for, well, politics. He recalled an event after Millie had puppies that was carefully choreographed so guests could see all these little puppies.
It was calculated like a state dinner, he said.
While there have been notable pets in the White House for generations, Millie was the first modern White House dog, said Pickens. She added that Barbara Bush was the first one to use the pet as a tool to reach out.
The former first lady wrote Millies Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush, which reached the number one spot on the New York Times nonfiction best seller list in the fall of 1990. The newspapers description: The memoirs of the English springer spaniel who lives in the White House.
Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1998 followed Bushs lead, with a childrens book about family dog Buddy and cat Socks. Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids Letters to the First Pets featured photographs of the pets, details on their habits and more than 50 letters from children to the pets.AP

Pakistan braces for Panama Papers verdict on PM Nawaz Sharif

Pakistan is bracing itself for a landmark court verdict that could see Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif forced to resign over corruption allegations.
It follows an investigation intohis family's wealthafter the 2015 Panama Papers dump linkedSharif's children to offshore companies.
Sharif denies any wrongdoing, but the case has exposed a divided nation.
The Supreme Court will decide if the case is to be dismissed, sent to trial or if he should simply be disqualified.
No civilian prime minister of Pakistan has ever completed a five-year term and Sharif himself is serving as Prime Minister for a record third time.
He is less than a year away from becoming the first to complete a full term in office.
What is the atmosphere in Pakistan right now
This ruling represents the peak of a drama that has fuelled frenzied news coverage and heated social media debates for months, attracting scorn and ridicule as well as trenchant support for the Prime Minister.
The divisions fall largely along party lines but amid the febrile accusations, many have also expressed concerns over Pakistan's political culture.
The Wikipedia profile of the Prime Minister has also been rewritten, dated late Thursday evening and littered with obscenities and accusations.
What are the accusations all about
A probe into Sharif and his family began when leaked papers from a Panama-based law firm linked Sharif's children to offshore companies used to buy several luxury central London flats.
The opposition was quick to accuse the Prime Minister of corruption and a subsequent special inquiry said his family had failed to account for the source of its financial assets.
The report caused an uproar in the country and opposition groups accuse his family of using their political influence to build up their personal wealth and are calling on him to resign.
The Prime Minister - who himself is not named in the Panama Papers - denies all allegations and insists they are politically motivated. There were also questions over the make-up of the investigation team.
What are the Supreme Court's options
Having considered the findings of the controversial investigation into the matter the court now has three options:
It finds there is not enough evidence to show the prime minister has been involved in any wrongdoing, and dismisses the case
If finds enough evidence to declare the prime minister dishonest and disqualifies him
It does not make a final decision but recommends a fresh investigation
What will happen next
Analysts suggests that if the Prime Minister is found guilty he could nominate a close political ally - possibly his brother Shahbaz, who is chief minister of Punjab province - to his post so his government could see out its turn.
Should Sharif be cleared though and stay in office, his acquittal would likely trigger widespread protests by his opponents.
The case also threatens the political future of the prime minister's daughter, Maryam Sharif, who has long been tipped as her father's successor in waiting, but who has been embroiled in the scandal.
A recent document supposed to absolve her of some of the allegations was allegedly dated from 2006 - yet then found to be written in computer font only commercially available the following year.
Widespreadridicule of her case on social mediawas quick to follow.

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered removed from office
Pakistans Supreme Court on Friday (28) ordered the removal of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from office over accusations of corruption, delivering a historic ruling that is likely to shift the countrys tumultuous political balance and deal a serious blow to the legacy of a man who helped define the past generation of Pakistani politics.
The removal of Sharif, who was serving his third term in office, comes roughly a year before his term was to end.
The verdict means the governing political party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, must choose an interim prime minister to replace Mr. Sharif until the next general election, which is scheduled for mid-2018.
Announced by the five-member Supreme Court, the verdict caps more than a year of high political drama, breathless court proceedings and a piercing investigation into the finances of the Sharif family.
Watching the courtroom drama was the countrys powerful military, which has traditionally decided the fate of civilian governments. There had been hushed speculation that the court, in coming to its decision, had the tacit, if not overt, backing of powerful generals.
The charges against Sharif and three of his children  two sons and a daughter  stemmed from disclosures last year in the Panama Papers, which revealed that the children owned expensive residential property in London through a string of offshore companies. In their ruling on Friday, the justices also ordered the opening of criminal investigations against the Sharif family.
Imran Khan, the opposition politician who has been spearheading the campaign against Mr. Sharif since he took power in 2013, stands to gain the most politically from the removal of Sharif. Khan has doggedly and almost obsessively led the charge against Mr. Sharif and rallied a wide swath of the public against him through a mix of street agitation and court petitions.
The Supreme Court had asked the members of the Sharif family to provide a paper trail of the money they used to buy their London apartments. Investigators found that they were living beyond their means.
Despite repeated court exhortations, Sharifs family and its lawyers failed to provide satisfactory documentation, the justices said. Several of the documents they produced were declared fake or insufficient.
Sharif has called the inquiry into his familys finances a conspiracy and has asserted that in his three terms as prime minister he has not been tarred by a major corruption scandal. He repeatedly rebuffed calls to resign and said that he had done no wrong.
The ruling, while expected, leaves unanswered the long-term fate of the man who has been a dominating force in Pakistani politics for the better part of three decades.
I did not expect Nawaz Sharif to go scot-free, said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a prominent political analyst who is based in Lahore.
If he has a long-term vision, he will sit back and guide his political party, Rizvi added. He and his supporters will portray the court verdict as victimization and a grave conspiracy involving international powers.

Workers should exercise union action responsibly: Sumanthiran
TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran urged workers to exercise their sacrosanct right of trade union action in a very responsible and constructive manner.
The MP, joining in the debate in Parliament yesterday, said resorting to strike action at the drop of a hat belittled the most potent weapon in the hands of workforce.
The MP said those who had taken control of the GMOA were often holding the country to ransom by going on strike for flimsy reasons.
The MP said the medical services were in fact an essential public service though not declared in Gazette.
This group of professionals who ought to know better and have taken a responsible oath behave worse than even criminals at times.
They do it to attain their own selfish objectives. Not all the medical professionals, but certainly those who have taken control of the GMOA are often behaving very irresponsibly putting the lives of people at stake.
These professionals have obtained free education at the cost of tax payers money.
I know people who have died for lack of medical attention in the last couple of months whenever the GMOA has gone on strike for some flimsy reason or the other, Sumanthiran said. He thanked the President for declaring the supply and distribution of fuel as an essential service and urged the Government to take stern action to enforce the proclamation and carry on all essential public services uninterruptedly.
We have supported the right of trade unions to resort to legitimate trade union action. Now people question whether the pendulum has swung the other way a little too much. Trade union action has many facets to it. Strike is the ultimate weapon, not the first thing. If the workers abuse it, they are putting their own right at risk. Today TUs dont know that they must give notice on TU action, he said.
I believe I am expressing the general sense of disillusionment of the people of this country today when they see various organisations calling themselves trade unions resorting to what they term trade union action. In reality, those are political actions to cripple the functioning of the country, he said.
Sumanthiran said the strike is not appropriate even as the last resort in todays context, given the host of issues the country is grappling with.
Given the irresponsible way various organisations and TUs act, we believe the Government is left with no other option but to use the law which provides for proclamation of essential services, the MP said.
Vote on resolution under Essential Public Services Act today
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the vote on the resolution under the Essential Public Services Act would be taken up today in the morning.
The debate in connection with making distribution of fuel an essential service commenced yesterday.
The Leader of the House said that after speeches of two government side members, the vote would be taken up. JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the opposition should ask for a vote.
Bills passed in Parliament without debating: Herath
Several bills were passed in Parliament on Wednesday without debating amidst the chaos, and it was a practice against the Parliamentary democracy, JVP parliamentarian Vijitha Herath said.
He made the observation yesterday joining the debate on resolution under the Essential Public Services Act. MP Herath said the JVP expressed its displeasure on the governments move against the parliamentary democracy. The trade unions requested not to hand over the Hambantota Port Oil Tank farm to China, Vijitha Herath said. The peoples plea is not to hand over the tanks to a foreign company as it is a national asset. But the government act against the peoples will, he said.
He said Police arrested the trade union leaders after they had discussions with the SLFP SG and the Army Officer. He said the CPC employees were assaulted by Kolonnawa thugs. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa used thugs from Kollonnawa to assault the people, he said.
Report on CPC losses and damages will be submitted shortly: Ranatunga
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, observing that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has incurred huge losses and damages over the past few days, said he would furnish a report in that regard to the House shortly.
The minister was speaking at the Parliamentary debate on the Gazette Extraordinary issued by the President declaring supply and distribution of fuel as an essential public service.
We issued the Gazette because we saw that the public were inconvenienced because of the trade union action.
The Government has more issues such as the garbage disposal problem and dengue epidemic at the same time.
Had the oil crisis continued any longer, the day-to-day activities of the people could have been crippled. We are ready for discussions at any moment, and at the same time, we are not hesitant to take swift action if public is inconvenienced, he said.
The Minister, reiterating that he is against privatization, said joint investment was necessary to develop certain sectors of the country.
Keep aside your political motives when you are dealing with these matters.
The petroleum strike could have been called off earlier than this, but some TU leaders acting as cats paw of certain rejected politicians did not allow that to happen, the minister said.
Hambantota oil tanks are not under the CPC, but under the Ports Authority.
With joint investment into them, we can yield optimal results. I tried to explain this to the TUs. Some political figures with no vote base tried to mess my work.
I do politics with the people. Doing ministerial duties is not like betting and gaming.
When I was holding the Port and Shipping Ministry, I intervened to get that agreement amended, he said.
Government cannot be toppled by disrupting essential services
The Government cannot be toppled by disrupting the essential services, Opposition Leader and TNA Leader R. Sampanthan said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that disrupting the essential services was an action against democracy and the Joint Opposition was attempting to topple the government by interrupting the essential services.
But everybody should realise the government has received the peoples mandate, Opposition leader said.
The provision of fuel to the people is essential. But the Joint opposition is attempting to disrupt it. That is the reason the President declared the distribution of fuel is an essential service, he said.
He said the trade unions were essential for a democratic country but they should not cripple its essential services.
At such situations, the government should take decisions to resolve the problems of the people, he said.
Government driving democracy towards its grave: Dinesh
The Good Governance Government is driving democracy towards its grave, Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said.
He said the Opposition leader was maintaining silence being unaware that the democracy was facing a critical situation.
He made the observations joining the debate on the resolution under the Essential Public Service Act.
He said the Government had declared essential services at two occasions, one at the Meethotamulla garbage incident and the current issue. Why did the government made such a proclamation MP Gunawardena asked.
They did that to deploy security forces to get the work done and to neutralise the trade unions. All the trade union leaders of the CPC protest were arrested, he said.
He said that although the Kolonnawa comes under the Wellampitiya Police Division, Welikada Police came there. Some came their carrying poles. The same thugs went to Hambantota and assault the workers. The Good Governance Government has no support of the people, Dinesh Gunawardena said. It has the power of the weapons only. The thugs assaulted the SLFP trade union leaders.
He said the Opposition Leader was keeping silent to protect his position.
JO says Security Forces traitors when they protect national assets: Marikkar
Members of the security forces become traitors to Joint Opposition (JO) when they attempt to protect the national assets and serve the people, United National Party Parliamentarian S. M. Marikkar said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the debate on resolution under the Essential Public Services Act. He said the JO attempts to defame him as a thug. I become their target at all occasions even when the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed, flooded or trade unions were attacked, Marikkar said. But I have nothing to do with any of them.
He said that when the unity government attempts to move the country forward after establishing the democracy, some groups strive to disrupt it.
Those groups speak of the patriotism after damaging the country and it assets, Marikkar said. Various criticisms are levelled against the government. But watch the footage of the CPC incident in Kolonnawa. Then you can decide the correct thing, he said.
He said the CPC strike was an utter failure.
However much the JO criticises me, the people know who I am, Marikkar said. We do our politics democratically.

The petroleum strike and its aftermath
The public, no doubt, would have heaved a huge sigh of relief with the ending of the petroleum strike, albeit temporarily. There was large scale dislocation of public life due to the drying up of fuel supplies, with motorists running helter skelter and languishing in long queues to lay their hands whatever is left at the filling stations. The chaos that was caused also resulted in huge traffic congestion, and, what is more, public anger directed at the government for not dealing firmly with the crisis. Fuel being a precious commodity that oils commerce and industry, the overall dislocation, had it been allowed to continue, would have been monumental indeed. What is more, the strike was called at a time the entire nation was reeling from the dengue epidemic. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament: Ceylon Petroleum Corporation trade unions have stopped work at a time the country is facing a crisis situation when the government and others are making a joint effort to curb the spread of dengue.
It is clear that the strikers had wanted the maximum damage caused to public life to win over demands that has nothing to do with their pay, facilities or working conditions but based on what was said to be a patriotic call to prevent the government from selling national assets, not giving thought to the fact that the country would have been plunged deep into the mire, burdened as it is with monumental debt, if the strategic Public Private Partnership was not implemented. It is clear that the overtones of the rhetoric uttered by the strikers was in consonance with that of the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila who are wont to bellow patriotism day in and day out.
The unions are to meet President Maithripala Sirisena next Tuesday for a further round of talks as a follow up to the discussions held with him on Wednesday, after which the strike was suspended. They have vowed to resume their trade union action upon failure to obtain a satisfactory response. For all the rhetoric and displays of bravado, the intervention of the military, under the Essential Service order, no doubt, forced the strikers to cave in and it is as a face saving measure that the trade unions have threatened to continue with the strike if no compromise is reached.
The government, on its part, should not be seen to be giving into pressure tactics by the trade unions, now that it has given a sample of what it is capable of. The unions too, well know, it will not be possible to push their luck, after a taste of the military might that brought the strikers to heel. The government should now not hesitate to go the whole hog and employ the same method in dealing with the other acts of sabotage that are being carried out at the behest of defeated politicians dreaming of a return to power.
No doubt, the public would have reposed confidence in the government that it will similarly deal with the doctors strikes too which have now become a regular feature. True, the military have not the ability or competence to tend to the sick, like it did with operating petroleum bowsers. It is this knowledge that has placed the doctors at an advantage, knowing they would be indispensable, come what may. But the government could consider other options, like that suggested by President's Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya for getting down Indian doctors at times of crisis. Some poo phooed this suggestion, arguing that foreign doctors would not be able to communicate with the free health service seeking locals who are generally the poor and uneducated. But there are ways to overcome this hurdle. Appointing interpreters to these doctors would be one such option.
Desperate situations call for desperate remedies. It is clear that determined attempts are being made to provoke the wrath of the public against the government. Crippling public life by a spate of strikes is a sure fire method to show up the feebleness of the government and what we are witnessing today in part of this relentless strategy being worked out with the active support of certain media establishments. The military option adopted by the government should be seen in this light.
The Yahapalanaya regime was elected to serve its full term and attempting to topple it through extra parliamentary methods cannot be condoned in a democracy. The public will be provided the opportunity to effect a change when elections are held after the regime had served its legal term. Up until then the government is well within its right to use all means at its disposal to ensure it carries on unhindered, and, importantly, to see to it that the public are not made to suffer hardship or put in peril. In furtherance of this, it is obliged to use all the tools at its disposal. The call for the intervention of the military in the petroleum strike, therefore, is amply justified on these grounds.

Petronas' decision to scrap Canadian LNG project 'wise', say analysts
Malaysian oil company Petronas has scrapped a proposed C$36 billion ($29 billion) liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in western Canada due to weak prices, in a blow to both its global ambitions and Canada's hopes of becoming a major LNG player.
Pacific NorthWest LNG in British Columbia was meant to produce 12 megatonnes per year and spur further development of Canada's largest shale play, but industry observers said the move was widely expected given years of delay.
"It is a good decision not to invest in this project which is expensive and risky," said Subbu Bettadapura, senior director, Asia Pacific, Frost and Sullivan. "Only question is why they took so long to come to this decision."
Analysts had been sceptical about the project's prospects given current low gas prices and constraints facing state-run Petronas, which has been cutting costs to deal with lower profits and cash flow.
The decision is the latest setback for Canada's energy industry, already bruised by international oil firms selling off around $23 billion in Canadian energy assets this year alone.
"We have a window of opportunity to develop B.C.'s LNG industry, but the next several years will be critical," said Gillian Robinson, spokeswoman for the BC LNG Alliance. "We risk losing thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in benefits if B.C. does not have diversified access to markets."
Pacific NorthWest LNG received approval from the Canadian government last year, but Petronas delayed its final investment decision on what would have been its biggest foreign investment.
The C$36 billion price tag included around C$11 billion for the export terminal, C$6.5 billion in pipelines, the C$5.5 billion Petronas paid for Progress Energy and its natural gas assets and around C$2 billion a year expected to be spent on producing natural gas.
Petronas said on Wednesday it had made significant investments in the project along with its partners over the last five years, but declined to give a figure. It added it was committed to developing its significant gas assets in Canada.
"We are already producing from the North Montney area, where production has increased from about 200 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) in 2012 to about 540 mmscfd in 2017, to supply gas to Canada's domestic market," it said in a statement.
"We are now working on finalizing our strategy in North America looking at various options to monetise the gas assets further."
TransCanada Corp, which was contracted to build the pipeline connecting gas wells to the LNG terminal, said it would be reimbursed for costs associated with the project. It had spent C$500 million as of April, spokesman Shawn Howard said.
Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (Japex) said it would take a loss of about C$102 million ($82 million) due to the scrapping of the project.
Petronas had planned to produce its own gas to supply Pacific NorthWest LNG, rather than buying it from other producers, but no LNG demand means firms like Painted Pony Petroleum and Seven Generations Energy will continue to see low gas prices, analysts said.
"The demise of the LNG industry in Western Canada means that Western Canadian gas will largely remain captive to the oversupplied North American market," BMO Capital Markets analyst Randy Ollenberger said in a note.
Of more than a dozen projects proposed for British Columbia, only the C$1.6 billion privately held Woodfibre project has so far been given the green light by its developers.
Last July Royal Dutch Shell and partners pushed back a final investment decision on their proposed LNG Canada project, citing global industry challenges.
Michelle Mungall, British Columbia's energy minister, said she will be calling other LNG companies to reassure them her government is ready to work with them, but B.C. Green Party leader Andrew Weaver released a statement saying the future does not lie in "chasing the fossil fuel economy."
The ruling New Democratic Party, which formally took power this month, is backed by the environmentalist Green Party. Its rise has fueled uncertainty about energy development in the province.
A spokesman for Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, said Petronas' move was a business decision.

Port Authority employees call off strike
Port Authority employees yesterday called off their token strike scheduled for today (28) since President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to introduce amendments to the Hambantota Port Agreement on August 1.
The Agreement was expected to be passed in Parliament today (28) and scheduled to be inked on Saturday (29).
All Ceylon Port General Workers Union General Secretary Chandrasiri Mahagamage speaking to the Daily News said the strike was only temporarily called off and depended on the amendments introduced by the President.
Earlier this week, Cabinet approved a framework agreement with the China Merchants Ports Holdings Company (CMPort) Limited and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) over the Hambantota Port. According to the Agreement SLPA would hold 30 percent of the share while CMPort will own 70 percent of the joint venture.
The agreement caused workers at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to go on strike on Tuesday (25) as they protested against the Hambantota Oil Tanks being given on lease to the Chinese. President Sirisena issued a gazette notification on Wednesday (26) making fuel distribution an essential service.
Later, CPC workers reported to work and a discussion with the President has been promised on August 4 regarding the agreement.
"We stand in solidarity with the CPC workers, Mahagamage said, though the Port workers are yet to be granted an appointment with the President.
Mahagamages Union has protested against the 99 year lease of the Port to the Chinese and has asked that if it is to do so, the SLPA should be the majority stakeholder in the venture.
The President is the chairman of the SLFP and the leasing out of public assets to foreign entities is against the policies of the SLFP, and we hope that he does not go back on SLFP policies, Mahagamage said. He said they were hoping for a positive response from the President and if the latter did go ahead and sign the agreement on Saturday (29), they would lose faith and trust in the President.
He said the calling off of the strike was nothing to do with fears that the President could also declare Ports as an essential service.
We stopped because of the amendments. We are not afraid, the union leader said.

The disruption of power will be halted by today, (July 28), CEB Spokesperson Sulakshana Jayawardena said.
He said that the supply of power was disrupted intermittently island wide in order to balance the national grid.
The Spokesperson said that the island wide power cuts were unscheduled.
Jayawardena stated that the third unit of the Norchcholai power plant which has a capacity of 300MW is no longer functioning which has contributed to the need for the disruption of the supply of power.
He also said that capacity of the Kelanitissa power plant had been reduced by 110 MW while Pallekale and Galle hydro power plants do not have sufficient oil to run them.

Contradictions between the UNP and SLFPers in the Government have emerged. The people have realised that the Government has entered into a path of betraying the country and the people, Prof. Vitarana said.
He was addressing the media at the LSSP Headquarters yesterday.
Prof. Vitharana said public protests in the country have shown disagreements with decisions taken by the Government. Appreciating the trade union action by CPC trade unions against the Government decision to handover the oil tanks in Trincomalee to India, among several other demands, Prof Vitarana said the LSSP is with them to win their demands.
He said the Prime Minister has taken over a contract on behalf of the international imperialists. He condemned the Wednesdays attack on CPC trade union activists by a group of thugs.

Publication, website on SDGs indicators in SL launched
The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has launched a publication titled Status of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)Indicators in Sri Lanka: 2017 and a website to disseminate up-to-date information particularly for Sri Lanka on SDGs. In 2015, countries of the United Nations adopted a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as a part of the new sustainable development agenda.
The SDG officially known as Transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, is a set of seventeen goals with 169 targets and 244 indicators between them.
All countries of the United Nations are expected to give high priority in their development agendas to the SDGs.
The commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka in achieving 2030 goals is reflected by establishing the Ministry of Sustainable Development Parliament Select Committee on SDGs, the mandate of which is to make recommendations to ensure that the UN 2030 Agenda for SDGs is achieved in Sri Lanka and having four cluster committees of parliamentarians set up representing four thematic areas.
The first copy of this publication was presented to the Deputy Speaker, Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee on SDGs, Thilanga Sumathipala, on July 26, at Parliament by Dr. A.J. Satharasinghe, Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics.
A website on SDGs in Sri Lanka, was also launched by the Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee on SDGs.
There is an urgent need for a SDG indicator framework to turn the SDGs and their targets in to a management tool to help development of implementation strategies and to allocate resources accordingly.
It also serves as a report card to measure programmes towards sustainable development and help to ensure the accountability of all stakeholders for achieving the SDGs.
Preparing this publication on the availability of data for 244 SDG Indicators (Indicator Framework) is an important endeavour to facilitate compilation of baseline data by the respective agencies, monitoring the progress, and reporting the achievements of SDG Targets, said Dr. A. J. Satharasinghe, Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics, at the launch ceremony.
This publication provides a brief overview on 17 SDGs, 160 SDG targets and 244 indicators.
Baseline data already compiled by the DCS for the indicators are given in this publication.
Also given in this publication are global and local definitions and tiers for these indicators.
The Director General further said that this publication will continue to be updated by incorporating data compiled by the DCS and other institutions of the NSS from time to time.
The Director General of the DCS said that the webpage launched on SDGs in Sri Lanka can be accessed through its website at www.statistics.gov.lk.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, said:We are delighted to be able to cater to the buoyant leisure and business travel demand by increasing our frequency and capacity to Colombo, the gateway to Sri Lanka and one of the most vibrant cities in South Asia. Besides our acclaimed inflight service, our passengers can now also enjoy our modern B777 aircraft when they travel with us on our non-stop service to Doha and onward to destinations in Europe, Americas and the Middle East. The additional frequency will provide passengers with even greater flexibility and convenience when planning their next trip with Qatar Airways.
Sri Lankas Minister of Tourism Development the Hon.John Amaratungasaid: Tourism is expected to be one of Sri Lankas major growth engines as we seek to further strengthen our economy. Sri Lanka, Asias leading destination for 2017, has a wealth of places waiting for travellers to discover. With the support of major carriers like Qatar Airways which has invested additional capacity, we are confident that Sri Lanka can achieve the target of 2.5 million tourists this year.
Now in its twentieth year of operations, Qatar Airways has a modern fleet of 200 aircraft flying to business and leisure destinations across six continents.

Questions of credibility impunity
Last week the news of the attempted abduction of Ryan Jayalath, Convener of the Medical Students Action Committee in the city in broad daylight was received with shock and disbelief by the civil society. Even sections of the establishment were stunned. Media Minister soon issued a statement condemning the incident and promising an inquiry.
The police hastened to say that the van was not a police vehicle but it belonged to the Finance Ministry. The latter also distanced itself by saying that it was not a Ministry van. Then much later the police came out with a long story saying that the van belonged to the police and those who came in it were police officers in civvies who came to arrest a suspect wanted for several cases and they have a legitimate right to arrest such suspects even without warrant from a magistrate. This last argument does not augur well since anyone and everyone could be arrested by any cop on his sole discretion.
Still several questions remain in the public mind. Why did the police use a white van, the customary vehicle that was used in forced abductions during the earlier regime instead of a police jeep Is it to send a signal that vigilante groups such as Praa have become active again and instill fear in the minds of agitating students
Jaffna shooting
It is also customary for the police to jump to conclusions at once and later retrace their steps or speak in double-tongues, as a local idiom says. Even in the case of the Jaffna shooting in which a security officer of a Magistrate was gunned down, the police immediately said that it was not an attempt on the life of the magistrate. Later the assailant was identified as an ex-LTTE cadre. Much more contradictory were the police versions about the murder of the young girl Chaya Sevmini. The police even charged a schoolboy for the murder and remanded him after which the real culprit surfaced and confessed.
We are also reminded of repeated incidents in which hard-core criminal suspects were being shot by the police in violent encounters while escorting them to various spots to unearth hidden weapons etc.
All these create suspicions in the public mind about the credibility of police versions of incidents. This negative image is further reinforced by the increasing number of police officers, even up to the level of DIGs who are being accused of various crimes including murder, robbery, treasure hunting etc.
Of more serious consequences is the existence of a culture of impunity in the country which exempts certain categories of persons from punishments for crimes committed by them. While the Constitution or the law of the land does not approve such impunity it has been the practice either through oversight or willful neglect on the part of the authorities both political and administrative.
For example, for decades no high-profile politician such as an MP or a Minister has been brought before Courts of law and punished for corruption, fraud and misuse of public property though allegations have been made in public against them. Then number of high calibre politicians convicted for bribery and corruption in independent Sri Lanka could be counted with the fingers of one hand, the last being M P de Zoysa MP more than half a century ago. Are we to believe that all our politicians since then were and are paragons of virtue Even now, though several institutions exist for investigations either they are paralyzed for lack of funds, personnel or political will to prosecute even known offenders. Some enjoy such huge immunity that they are not even touched.
How many politicians have been found to be involved in destruction of the environment Of them how many have been prosecuted What action was taken against the encroachments in the worlds end area What actions have been taken against illicit sand mining in river beds The people have a right to know.
Hate speech and preaching communalism
Of late politicians whose sole interest is to come to power or retain power by any means have made it a policy to confer immunity to members of the Buddhist Sangha against any wrongdoing. They consider anyone attired in a yellow robe should not be dealt according to the law of the land, if he commits a crime. This is a new phenomenon. Errant monks have been punished even during the times of ancient kings. Even in independent Sri Lanka Somarama was sent to the gallows. Buddarakkhita was jailed. It did not affect the status of Buddhism in the country. There cannot be impunity for anyone, including bhikkhus to engage in hate speech or preach communalism and place the country in danger.
Security forces constitute another category that enjoys immunity through the neglect and camaraderie of officials or protection afforded by politicians in power. Even the Head of State was enraged at the mere issue of summons to some high ranking officers of the security forces to give a statement to the police. If there are errant officers they should be brought before the law and dealt accordingly. It is more damaging to the security forces to let accusations remain uninvestigated. It is to its credit if the relevant officers are given a chance to clear their names through an inquiry.
The only institution that has gained a measure of public confidence after January 8 is the judiciary. Yet a degree of discriminatory treatment is seen in certain judgements or degrees of punishments given in certain instances. A punishment is considered a form of deterrent.
Yet some seem to be stimulants. For example, a certain politico who pleaded guilty to avoiding the submitting of annual income statements as required by law was fined much less than the common fine for mosquito breeding. While the former is a willful act the latter is never voluntary.
The ease with which certain politicos accused of normally unbailable offenses roam the globe is also an irritant in the public mind. Law seems to favour the rich and the mighty. No wonder in a class society law itself is class biased.

Ramadoss, Vaiko demand lifting LTTE ban

Hailing the European Union Court of Justice verdict lifting the ban on LTTE, leaders including PMK founder S. Ramadoss and MDMK general secretary Vaiko, besides other Tiger supporters demanded that the ban be lifted in India too.
The leaders and pro-Tiger outfits argued that the reasons cited by the European court to lift the ban is applicable for the ban in India too. 
Welcoming the judgment, Ramadoss said this would enable the functioning of Tigers in 26 countries of Europe.
Hailing the judgment as 'historical', he said the verdict would enable mobilising support for the struggle of Eelam Tamils for their rights and power.
The judgment would also pave way for breaking the LTTE ban in Canada and United Stattes and the actions of Tamils throughout the world could be taken forward without obstacles, Ramadoss said.
Vaiko described the verdict as a turning point in the history of Tamil Eelam and said it would open the gates for demanding justice for Lankan Tamils in United Nations Human Rights Council and general assembly.
It gives hope that those who indulged in 'genocide of Tamils' could be brought to book and a referendum for Tamil Eelam could be held.
Sri Lankan government was unable to show that LTTE indulged in terrorist activities after 2009, Vaiko added.
Expressing happiness over the judgment,VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said inclusion of LTTE in the list of banned organizations was a set back to the Tigers.
Tamils throughout the world were unable to mobilise funds and people support for the LTTE after the ban.
Describing the Tamil Eelam liberation struggle as a fight for freedom of a nationality.
Thamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi leader T. Velmurugan welcomed the judgment and said the verdict would pave way to establish that LTTE was a freedom fighting movement and they are not terrorists.
He said the LTTE ban in India should be lifted to enable the activities of those supporting the struggle of Lankan Tamils and working for in the political sphere of Tamil Nadu.

Ravi lauds Belt and Road Initiative, welcomes Chinese investment

Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake has spoken highly of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, expressing the hope that the government would like to see more Chinese investments.
Talking to Xinhua in an interview yesterday, the newly appointed Foreign Minister said China and Sri Lanka had maintained strong ties since ancient times, with the relationship being at its strongest level at present.
While appreciating the large-scale investments China had brought to Sri Lanka, especially since the end of a civil war between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels which ended in 2009, Karunanayake said the country would benefit from more Chinese investments.
"We appreciate the investments that are coming in from China, but we would like to see much more," he said.
While reiterating that Sri Lanka would soon be transformed into a global trading hub, Karunanayake said Sri Lanka's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative would strengthen its trading position even further.
We are happy we are part of this initiative and we as a government, by taking part in it, are implementing a 'Sri Lanka first' approach due to the benefits we will get from the initiative, Karunanayake said.
Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes of Silk Road.
China has become one of Sri Lanka's largest development partners with infrastructure construction projects worth billions of dollars. China is also one of the major FDI sources of Sri Lanka.

Sadaharitha celebrates 15 years
Sadaharitha Plantations will be celebrating 15 years of enhancing Sri Lankas forest cover by encouraging over 26,000 investors to grow trees as a long and midterm, lucrative investment.
Due to the prevailing market conditions on other investment products, many Investors are actively reducing their exposure to equities, and seeking alternative assets to boost returns without dramatically altering their overall risk profile. At this point commercial forestry answers all concerns, delivering assets backed by high returns while being environmental friendly.
Agarwood has been in the trade for many decades. The scent of Agarwood is unique, complex and pleasing. As a result, Agarwood oil has gained great cultural and religious significance with ancient civilizations being mentioned including one of the world's oldest written texts  the SanskritVedas from India.
At present it is known to be one of the most expensive resinous woods in the world with a constant growing demand in larger markets such as Middle-East, China, USA and Europe for chips, oil, carvings and incense products.
Agarwood oil is used as a base raw material by the makers of the worlds most expensive high end perfumes cherished by rich and famous celebrities.
The value of a liter of Agarwood oil depending on the quality and colour, varies from 10,000 to 35,000 US$ which in Sri Lanka is worth LKR 5,250,000 at todays forex rates. Chips are priced around 50 to 15,000 US$ per kilo. Singapore is the bustling trading hub for Agarwood raw materials in Asia and they churn out products worth of 1.5 million SGD annually.
Another reason for Agarwood (Aquiloaria) to be expensive is the threat of becoming endangered. The most important resin-producing species of Aquilaria are A. agollocha, A. malaccensis which are also protected worldwide under the CITES (The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).
Apart from making the world fragrant, Agarwood is an aphrodisiac, both in oil form, and as incense. These are generally for external use, but the oil is also sold in Vietnamese pharmacies for internal use with the same goal. Chinese medicine uses powdered Aquilaria as a treatment for cirrhosis of the liver and for other medicines. It has also been used as a treatment for lung and stomach tumors.
Sathish Navaratne, Chairman of Sadaharitha Plantations explained Agarwood is an essential part of the culture in many middle eastern countries where it is a common practice to showcase wealth and status by using expensive perfumes and incense for spiritual and religious ceremonies. Even jewellery made out from Agarwood is believed to bring wealth and good luck. The Agarwood industry in the world is worth billions of USD. This is why investors can confidently enter into a very lucrative midterm investment of growing commercial forests concentrating on Agarwood.
Sadaharitha holds the exclusive patent for the commercial production of Agarwood. Only Sadaharitha has the expertise, capability and technology to use the CA-kit that makes the Agarwood forestry viable and lucrative in Sri Lanka.

Southern CAA earns over Rs. 6 million in revenue
Investigation officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) of the Southern region, have amassed a huge revenue of over Rs. 6 million from fraudulent traders by way of Court fines in mobile raids and inspections made throughout Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts during the last six months of this year.
According to the Investigation officials, the total number of raids carried out in the Southern region during the period were nearly 2,000.
Accordingly, errant traders were prosecuted in Magistrates Courts in Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts. These vendors were indicted on counts of sale and display for sale food items unsuitable for human consumption, sale and display of expired food items, selling foodstuffs which were decayed and consumed by rats, weevils and insects, deceitfully altering the set prices marked on labels and selling them at excessive rates, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, sales of rice and cement above set prices, non- display of price tags, hoarding essential food items and violating orders, rules and regulations imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority.
According to the CAA, complaints on frauds, malpractices and corruptions committed by unscrupulous traders are now pouring into the Authority. Under these circumstances, the CAA has enhanced its raids and mobile inspections against fraudulent traders throughout the Southern region, Investigation officials said.
Awareness programmes on consumer rights are also being held for school children, members of voluntary organizations, people and also the trading community by the Authority.
On the instructions of District Secretaries of Galle, Matara and Hambantota, the CAA Investigation Officers are conducting these raids and inspections covering the Southern region, they further added.

Sri Lanka to become biggest foreign exchange earner in fisheries
The plan to set up three aquaculture parks across the country and utilise islandwide 10,000 tanks and 116 lagoons for fish farming, aims at turning the inland fisheries sector into a biggest foreign exchange earner, Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday. Minister Amaraweera was addressing the 35th scientific sessions of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) in the NARA premises yesterday.
"Our main objective is to transform fish exports into the countrys first foreign exchange earner by 2020 by developing the countrys coastal fisheries, deep sea fisheries, inland fisheries and aquaculture fleets," the minister said.
Sri Lankas fish harvest has a great foreign demand compared to other countries. Sri Lankan tuna fish has a greater demand in the global market due to its high nutritional level.
A kilo of Sri Lankan Tuna is sold at Rs.20,000 in the global market, he said.
The minister said the demand rose as a result of lifting the ban on Sri Lanka fish exports by the European Union recently. Sri Lanka earlier decided the price of the International Fish Market. Later it was acquired by the Maldives due to the EU ban on Sri Lankan fish, he said.
"We must work hard to regain this position in the next few years," he said.
"We should take precautions not to harvest the entire fish population at once. Around 40 percent harvest of fish is wasted. There should be a plan to prevent the waste, he said. Minister Amaraweera said although researchers spend money for participating at foreign seminars, conducting research and producing inventions, they do not reach the people and do not benefit the country."

Sri Lankans accused of human smuggling found not guilty

Four Sri Lankan men acquitted by a British Columbia (BC) Supreme Court Judge nine years ago on charges of human smuggling were found not guilty by Justice Arne Silverman, yesterday.
The four Sri Lankan men were charged of human smuggling in relation to the arrival of 76 Tamil migrants on the MV Ocean Lady ship.
The ramshackle vessel traveled across the Pacific Ocean for an estimated 45 days before it arrived in B.C. in October of 2009.
Four people aboard Francis Appulonappa, Hamalraj Handasamy, Jeyachandran Kanagarajah and Vignarajah Thevarajah were charged with human smuggling.
"I am satisfied that the sole motive that each of them had was, through mutual aid, to get themselves to Canada," said Justice Silverman in his 57-page decision.
Crown lawyers tried to argue that the men orchestrated the voyage to make a profit, claiming they collected money from passengers.
Justice Silverman said there was not enough evidence to prove that.
"While there is evidence of organized crime, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the activities of any of these four accused were connected to it."
Human Smuggling laws revamped
Lawyers for the men used the argument of what's called "mutual assistance" in their defence of the charges of human smuggling.
That defence arose out of a Supreme Court of Canada judgmentthat ruled the country's human smuggling laws were too broad.
The court found that two sections of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act do not apply to some people who help refugee claimants reach Canada.
"Those people who are seeking asylum, those people who are assisting their families or those people that who are mutually assistingone another to seek asylum, you cannot convict those people of human smuggling. That's an exemption that the court created," said Phil Rankin, lawyer for Jeyachandran Kanagarajah, one of the four men accused.
That defense was used in the case of the MV Sun Sea, where four men were charged with human smuggling for bringing 492 Sri Lankan migrants to BC's coast in 2010.
Lesly Emmanuel, Nadarajah Mahendran and Thampeernayagam Rajaratnam were acquitted by a jury after their lawyers argued they had acted on humanitarian grounds or had been misidentified.
A mistrial was declared for the fourth accused, Kunarobinson Christhurajah, who was found guilty at a later trial.
'We believed we were going to die'
Outside BC Supreme Court, one of the accused, Jeyachandran Kanagarajah, was emotional.
"I'm unable to explain my happiness, because all these days we were expecting we were going to face this decision," said Kanagarajah.
Since he arrived on the ship, Kanagarajah has been living in limbo in Canada because of the charges he was facing.
"Every single day, we were thinking about our future: how it was going to be."
Kanagarajah said he will now try to seek asylum to stay in Canada.
"We did not expectwe would reach here, because most of the refugees believed that we were going to die ... there were so many storms," said Kanagarajah.

Still wanted: Pragmatic leaders!
Independence in 1948 saw Sri Lankas ship of state glide smoothly on still waters as it were, when oceans of rising waves, turbulence and even storms were seen elsewhere. Though on hindsight, the leaders at the time are not seen as great visionaries, they yet managed the ship of state prudently. They were dedicated patriots. They sacrificed their wealth and did not swindle the country. They did not ask for super luxury Benz cars, they used their own. They did not deceive the people; they were not bogus, and they did not fast for exhibitionism, munching biscuits in hiding. Then, trade and foreign exchange balances were good and there were no debts. Even ten years later, Singapores founding father, Lee Kwan Yew would say that he would like to make his own small island like Ceylon as it was called at the time.
We also note that when we got Independence, India, Pakistan (then with Bangladesh), Myanmar (then Burma) Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Hongkong, Korea, China, and many other countries in our region were very much behind us economically and politically.
We have had universal franchise from 1931 and enjoyed democratic values and human rights and those who sat in the highest forum of the Land were men and women of intelligence and integrity. We had a service oriented public service and a good public schools system with education widening and spreading out to all parts of the country. The knowledge and use of English was spreading out from the urban areas and reaching even the rural districts. Central schools coming up to the level of the well known public schools were being established and the intellectual levels were developing and rising. Future prospects were nothing but bright.
UNHAPPY, RUNDOWN AND CRUMBLING
Then the crash occurred, due to the want of an outstanding, principled and non-vacillating leader. In Dharmadveepa, the land of the righteous doctrine arose envy, jealousy, acrimony, hatred, bitterness, sheer wickedness, hostility and indiscipline, all alien to the teaching and the spirit of the noble Buddha who cannot be blamed for the faults of some of his followers. Religion was usurped for politics in a manner that has contaminated religion and politics up to the present day that it has produced degenerate politicians and similarly affected some of those in religious garb. Foolish politicians have politicized all that they surveyed and the religious men have ignored and violated their boundaries and have discarded religious norms and become politicians. They have had to campaign for votes on party policies and various promises. And due to their having to contend with raucous laymen they have had to face not only unparliamentary speech but also subject themselves to the most unbecoming treatment by fellow lay parliamentarians and contend with brawls on the parliamentary floor.
MACABRE SPECIMEN
The socio-economic political system that controls, moderates and orders the social system, system of education, health, inter community relations by its manner of operations impact on the life of people. The uneducated and brainless thugs, rowdies and visionless men who were active in the political fielo often carelessly and thoughtlessly sowed the seeds of social contradiction and societal disharmony and community frustration for selfish ends.
The government that intimidated a religious minority in the style of highway robbers, expropriated their schools and vested them in the State in 1960 on the pretext of establishing a unified national system of education. Neither they nor their political posterity have ever had a truly national policy on education or a system in which all could wholeheartedly cooperate and collaborate. Short-sighted and foolish Ministers of Education imposed their day dreams on education, undermined the liberty of people, destroyed their initiatives and produced state regimented generations of students and teachers and public servants as undisciplined and selfish as themselves without a thought for the country. The present GMOA is a macabre and horrid specimen of that. Along with the public service the Central Bank itself came to be usurped.
Transgressing financiers said touchwood and swindled the credulous. The vicious seeds of racial and religious enmity, suspicion, dishonesty, hate and animosity sown then have never got uprooted and eradicated. The malignant wounds inflicted on the body politic have hardly got healed. The sowers only thought of their personal political and financial gain; they never bargained for the irreparable damage they were doing nor the ghoulish evil spirits within them that were let into the country in spite of warnings then given. We brought on war upon ourselves due to our distorted thinking, twisted relations, attitudes and the way we lived. All the political kattadiyas and manthrakarayas of the UNP or SLFP were and are incapable of exorcising those evil spirits making their ghastly presence felt in the political arena even today. Due to inattentiveness, sundered good relations take generations to repair and rebuild.
Politicians with the power of their positions get enslaved to prestige and privileges attending political office. They show themselves to be shallow minded by surrounding themselves with the meaningless pomposity even while acting with crude flamboyance, not knowing how to handle their privileges and perks at least with a sense of tact or poise if not with humility and gratitude.
This is because due to their lack of human and intellectual depth they are unable to fathom the big social service quotient of their office and gauge the things of real value that are beneficial to the people and the country in the long run. Their individual values run counter to the common good.
They have no social values that shape their thinking and attitudes. Their values are in shambles. The idiocy of some is unbelievable.
They highly value the spacious air-conditioned offices, occasions for buckshee and commissions, from local and foreign investors. They practice all that without any embarrassment or sense of awkwardness or regard for the good name of the country. Politicians demand for perks seem crudely excessive when frugality is called for in the context of a huge national debt of trillions of rupees. We are not out of the woods yet. Benzes imported for CHOGM have vanished into thin air.
They are not aware that transport is provided them to render a service to the people and not to boost a personality lacking self-respect. Politicians have lost the sense of shame and given themselves over to selfish pursuits at the expense of the country and its people. In our living memory floods have occurred over the last 70 years. Though the floods abate, the politicians go to sleep till the next floods come. When even predictable disasters occur those responsible to provide relief are caught napping, as at the time of the tsunami.
The cancellation of the import of limousines for ministers and the opposition cooperating to give relief to flood victims show there is a measure of a sense of shame.
While preaching integration, politicians of the two main parties blow hot and cold and actually promote ethnic majoritarianism, various types of dominance and thwart partnership, equality of all citizens, national solidarity and unity. Politicians not only want to live in a far-above-the-ground privileged ghetto of their own, they are not conscious how heinous the wrongdoings they commit are.
ROTTEN SYSTEM
There is a widespread lack of expertise and personal discipline among powerholding politicians, due to their notable lack of character. The incompetent and unimaginative ministers cannot give leadership to genuine social reform as distinct from social manipulation. They do not create avenues of employment; they merely dump in government departments and corporations their supporters who idle and draw salaries making the enterprises inefficient and uneconomical to run. They do not understand and are incapable of rendering service to the people. The burden of the massive national debt is in no way lightened with a politicized, corrupt, inefficient, undisciplined and rotten horde within public administration, in the field of education, in the health sector, in transport and even in the administration of justice.
Discipline of the will, the seat of responsibility, of choice, options and motives has not been sufficiently inculcated in the homes and schools and universities in Sri Lanka. This is at the base of the rottenness that has set into the prevailing system aggravated by corrupt and vicious nationalizations. This has resulted in many socio-political, economic, community problems as well as indiscipline in schools, universities, government health care services, the public service and in the ranks of the humbler levels of workers.
The problems of sexual promiscuity, unwanted pregnancies, abortions, sale of body parts, juvenile delinquency, drug trafficking and abuse, murder at high noon to all manner of litigations and delays and bottlenecks in government offices and law courts are contextual consequences that have almost naturally followed the absence of civilized discipline.
We also observe abuse of political office. All manner of corruption and injustice are very much the trend. Not whole communities, even a single citizen threatened by any blinkered bigoted satanic outfit is unacceptable. These with culpable ignorance, inequality, racism, religious bigotry, and exclusivity will before long cause violent responses to erupt if the Government merely makes statements, hides behind words and vacillates in taking firm action.
Some individuals in the ruling class seem unconcerned about principled government; they are concocting plans also for money-laundering to finance the next elections without attending to what needs to be done here and now in a crisis situation.
Though quite a few are getting completely out of touch with the people there is hope that the two leaders and those closest to them will keep their pledge to the people come what may.
Then the people who installed them in power will hold them honourable. Some members of the UNP-SLFP coalition have not understood well the mandate given by the people. It was about banishing a privileged and corrupt ruling class.
It was not to get grooved in outdated and petty party programmes but to set about creating a new Sri Lanka, a new political culture, giving equality of status to all citizens and not having MPs with low intellectual capacity who due to sub-standard education, have no knowledge of the thinking of the people and do not even read newspapers; they are as St. Augustine termed, incurvati, navel gazers curved into themselves; they dwell in a nirvana of their own awaiting a bolt from the blue to strike them in a manner similar to the thunder that struck the last regime.
Then while the vast majority of Sri Lankans were democratic, open to national reconciliation, unity and peace, a small group of fascists were able to dominate the political stage and act as autocrats and bring the whole country to an abyss of social disorder and hang it by the noose of a massive debt.
On the whole Sri Lanka today does not show herself to be short of intelligent level headed far-sighted, courageous, dedicated political leaders who treat all sections of the people justly, equally and impartially, recognizing the honour, dignity and rights of all, able to lead this Country to new horizons of freedom. Therefore the two leaders should mobilize the progressive elements and steadfastly strive together to transform Sri Lanka into a state worthy of the genuine democratic aspirations of all the people.
HONEST GREENHORNS
If the Government does not radically reform itself, not just shuffling a few Cabinet posts, but in performance and work output, the people may once again embolden themselves and cast aside and dump even the main political actors of today along with those of the past corrupt regime and next time look towards even the inexperienced but honest greenhorns to do better and to put the country back on the right track. But this is not the time for political experiments.
The people have expressed in no uncertain terms that they are not for either vagabond capitalism or for a derelict totalitarian ideological regimentation or the crooked socialislism of the previous decade but for freedom, equality, meritocracy, honest and efficient government with law and order, with the human dignity, honour and rights of every single person assured and protected. In spite of the daunting challenge it is hoped the two leaders would straighten up and when commemorating Independence in 2018 unambguously show that they are into making good the promises they have unitedly given.

UNs Target 9.2 framework coming to Sri Lankan industries
UNs specialized agency for industrial development is to usher and inclusive and sustainable industrialization framework to Sri Lanka.
The new initiative of United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) is part of a vast array of strategic interventions under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed globally in 2015.
SDG 9 involves the three Is -Infrastructure, Industrialization and Innovation, said visiting New Delhi based UNIDO Regional Representative Rene Van Berkel, in Colombo recently.
UNIDO Representative Van Berkel was in discussion with Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen. Joining the meeting were Head of UNIDO focal point office in Sri Lanka Nawaz Rajabdeen and Senior Advisor to Minister Bathiudeen Himali Jinadasa.
SDG 9 focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation, said Van Berkel. We aim to structure around inclusive and sustainable industrial development and investment, including SMEs. SDG9.2 (referred to as Target 9.2) promotes sustainable industrialization and raise industrys share of employment and gross domestic product, and in in least developed countries, double industry share. SDG 9 can assist proposed industrial reforms as per the vision of the Government of Sri Lanka. We can work on new industrial parks and also on sub-sectors of the economy such as agri-business and farmer markets, farmer produce collection and storage, food processing and packaging, exports and stronger industry linkages to exports such as leather production.
During his first visit to Sri Lanka in February 2015, UNIDO Director General Li Yong hinted of bigger plans for UNIDOs Sri Lanka operations in his meeting with Minister Bathiudeen.
Let me stress that it is time that Sri Lanka receives a fully-fledged UNIDO country programme. Sri Lanka is a very important member of UNIDO. The long history of national and international engagement by Sri Lanka is very commendable, D.G. Yong said.

USAs MCC grants Rs 1.1 bn  for progress of aid
A delegation from the U.S. Governments Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) led by Fatema Z. Sumar, Regional Deputy Vice President for Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America, visited Colombo to advance progress on the development of the MCC compacta five-year grant programwith the Government of Sri Lanka that aims to reduce poverty and promote economic opportunity for Sri Lankans.
In December 2016, MCCs Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact. Sri Lanka became eligible for assistance after passing 13 out of 20 indicators on MCCs policy scorecard. 
We are pleased to announce Rs. 1.1 billion (US$ 7.4 million) in funding that the Millennium Challenge Corporation is providing now to support the development of a compact, including identifying and analyzing specific projects for potential investment, Sumar said.
Because the compact is still in development, the total compact funding amount has not yet been determined. The US$ 7.4 million in funding is in addition to the total MCC compact funding amount.
Based on an analysis of the constraints to economic growth, MCC and the Government of Sri Lanka are now conducting due diligence on potential projects in the transport and land sectors.
The Sri Lankan Government has established a project management unit - the Sri Lankan Compact Development Team - within the Prime Ministers office to work with MCC on the compact. The goal is to develop a high-quality, evidence-based and sustainable compact aimed at addressing these economic challenges in a way that drives growth and reduces poverty. MCC holds partner countries accountable through rigorous oversight, monitoring and evaluation. Sri Lankas Compact Development Team is consulting with a wide group of stakeholders to collect input - including potential beneficiaries, civil society, the private sector, other donors and relevant government entities.
In December 2016, MCCs Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact. Sri Lanka became eligible for assistance after passing 13 out of 20 indicators on MCCs policy scorecard.
Sri Lanka will need to be re-selected by MCCs Board in December for compact development to continue.

You cant tolerate poor batting -Vaas
GALLE: Sri Lankas fast bowling coach Chaminda Vaas came down hard on the Sri Lanka batsmen for not putting up a decent batting performance on the second day of the first Test against India at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
If any side gets 600 there is pressure on the opposition teams batsmen. But even so, we didnt bat well. Some batsmen got out early. Thats something that a team cant tolerate  but thats the nature of the game, said Vaas at the end of the second day.
At the moment Angelo Mathews and Dilruwan Perera are batting well, so tomorrow hopefully they will stay at the wicket and bat well until lunch. If we can bat until tea we might be able to escape danger. Thats what we should aim to do  to bat well in the first two hours, he said.
Sri Lanka requires a further 247 runs with effectively four wickets in hand to wipe out the deficit and make India bat again.
Vaas stated that Sri Lanka came to this Test with a few plans but the way the match went and given the state of the pitch they had to change their plans.
Some of the things we did didnt go well. We did as well as we could. When we saw that the wicket was really good for batting we thought of surprising the Indian batsmen by bowling a few bouncers, Vaas said.
The short ball proved very effective as Pradeep and Lahiru Kumara managed to get some purchase out of the flat track.
Pradeep produced his best spell of fast bowling to take a career best six wickets for 132 runs off 31 overs to keep India down to a total of 600 after they had resumed at 399-3. Kumara ended up taking 3 for 131. It was the first time in his career that Pradeep had taken a five-for.
When you get four wickets, you have to bowl 15/16 overs, and youre very tired after that. If youre bowling more than that you still have to maintain that intensity and still bowl quickly. I think I did that, said Pradeep who had seven four-fors before yesterday.
I maintained that intensity and bowled fast in my later spells. I think I couldnt get to that fifth wicket before because of tiredness.
Lasith Malinga was the last Sri Lankan fast bowler to take five wickets or more in an innings in a Test match in Sri Lanka with 5/50 against India at Galle seven years ago which happened to be Muthiah Muralitharans farewell Test.
We are well poised at this stage - Pujara
Cheteswar Pujara who contributed 153 towards Indias total said that he doesnt need extra motivation to score hundreds.
Whenever I play cricket, whether its at international level or first class, I enjoy the game. I dont need any extra motivation because I love playing this game. I love my batting, so whenever I get the opportunity to score runs or do something on the field, I always like the challenge and Im always very well prepared, said Pujara. Before any Test series or first-class games, I work hard on my preparation. Whenever there is a challenge, Im always up for it.
Speaking on the present context of the Test, Pujara said that India was well placed at this stage of the game.
The key for us, even in the last session was that weve bowled really well. Our bowlers are bowling good lines and lengths. On this wicket, you know what areas to bowl on, even the batsmen they had some inputs on what kind of line and length we can bowl, said Pujara. I think tomorrow onwards, well see a little more turn on this wicket. The pitch is drying up, so there will be more assistance tomorrow onwards.
When youre playing at international level, it doesnt matter whether the wicket is flat or whether there is some assistance for the bowlers. You always want to score big runs and put up a big total. As a team, we always want to win matches whether we play against a good team or not. If they are not playing well at some stage, we would still like to dominate because were the number one team in the world. We would like to maintain that standard. We have scored enough runs, and weve got five wickets today. We are very well poised at this stage.

AGs absence spoils GMOA, Govt efforts
All agreements reached by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and the Government remained futile as the Attorney General failed to appear before courts yesterday as scheduled, the GMOA said.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the Attorney General defeated the efforts made by the Prime Minister and the President to solve the issue.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Health Minister has appointed a Director of the Tobacco Company as a member of the Director Board of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital. This was, he said, despite the discussion with the President and the Prime Minister in connection with the minimum standard of the medical education. He cited this as a reason for the GMOA decision to withdraw from the discussion.
According to Dr. Aluthge, it seems no matter how hard discussions with the President and Prime Minister, at the end, one person changes everything according to his requirements.
The GMOA will not let the patients lives be in danger by lowering the standard of medical education using the political clout of certain Ministers, he said. Appointing a person who holds a position of a Director in the Tobacco Company into the Director Board of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital is a disgrace for the Government, he said.

Changes needed in Customs Ordinance to cater to e-commerce
Sri Lanka Shippers Council Past Chairman, Sean Van Dort urged the need to bring in necessary changes to the Customs Ordinance on e-commerce to better reap emerging benefits from the shipping and logistics industry.
Lashing out at successive governments over the last 30 years for their inability to take swift measures to address issues relating to the shipping and logistics industry, Van Dort said, From a logistics industry point of view, we havent even touched e-commerce, which is a US$ 3 trillion industry.
He made these views while speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 held in Colombo, this week.
Nobody has looked at our concerns; there is no think tank in the government to identify the emerging trends, innovations in the industry or to appoint a target-oriented team to see how we can benefit from e-commerce.
The present consumer wants e-commerce; he wants his products faster. How can local businessmen provide a service to a manufacturer or an industry with three-star rules requiring five-star services he queried.
Commenting on Sri Lankas excellent geographical location, Van Dort claimed that the country is not geared to tap true potential since it has not even touched the potential of its excellent geographical potential to achieve its set economic targets.

Drama family!
Indomitable is a word that can be used to describe the thespians of Ananda College. These boys have gained a mastery of society mainly through their insights into life and behavior all achieved through drama. Dramatic Moves features Ananda College a bold group of dramatists who feel the pulse of society.
The Drama Circle was initiated in 2006 under the patronage of then-Principal Mr. B.A. Abeyratne, who invited Founding Director Mr. Nishantha de Silva to revive English theatre activities at Ananda College together with Master In-charge Mr. R. R. Rohana. The purpose of the Drama Circle was to improve the standards of English amongst the students whilst enhancing the schools reputation for English language proficiency in wider society.
Understanding inner selves!
Master In-charge of the English Drama Circle and the English Literary Union, Coordinator of English Language and Literature, Rambukkanage Ranjith Rohana felt that doing drama can put the world at your feet!
Through teaching drama I have gained the experience to identify different individuals and have developed a sensitivity to understand their inner selves. At the same time, it helps us widen the awareness of different spheres of the world while improving team consciousness to reach a common goal ultimately, said Rohana.
Working with the boys is a very rewarding experience.
Drama is a love presentation that showcases different aspects of life. It is a pleasing experience to work with these boys who are very efficient and dynamic people. Working with them promotes our potential to think of life in a novel way and understand current trends. Boys are innovative and they feature original ideas and strategies. It is a refreshing experience to work with a young team. They have plenty of physical and mental strength to face any difficult situation. Practising a play is not a bed of roses, but it is a long march on a path of thorny bushes. The boys have the potential to do the task, explained Rohana.
Drama offers you the opportunity to master society.
Drama is once again a live presentation that reflects human life and society at large. It also deals with actions, gestures and language skills. Drama is an event where actions speak rather than words. So I see those capabilities in these boys. They learn how to deal with real life situations. It promotes sensitivity and empathetic feelings towards their fellow men, pointed out Rohana
They develop confidence to face the audience and to face the society while improving their language skills along with performance capabilities. They also develop aesthetic faculties. Finally they learn to feel the pulse of the society - Their ability to face the society with confidence and promoting their ability to be sensitive. Drama also develops their powers of language in aesthetic situations, he added further.
Building actors
Secretary Lakshitha Edirisinghe felt that a chief goal at Ananda is to raise thespians who appreciate the richness drama has to offer.
One of our strengths is that our mindset is not entirely focused on making drama something competitive. What we focus on is building actors. Build people who have a passion and love for theatre. Through that we also establish drama to be a place where you come to have fun at the end of the day even though you do a certain amount of work. We dont necessarily call ourselves the drama circle we call ourselves the drama family. We have a bond. So we dont approach it with an entirely competitive mindset, but making it a place where you have fun, said Edirisinghe.
Improving the English Language is definitely one of the benefits that the Drama boys of Ananda gained.
Improving in English is not just talking or writing in English. It is also about the subtle things. So it has established us as better individuals. Drama is a very good way to learn about society. The moment you start to understand characters and the moment you start to study these specific roles, you recognize these people in society as well. You learn through the characters you enact. You identify a person doing a certain action and you give it your own interpretation, added Edirisinghe.
Drama has taught Edirisinghe to love the simpler things in life. Look at things and appreciate things for what they are. All in all it has all been benefits.
It is all about family!
President Thilina Udayaratne stressed on the importance of leaving a legacy for others to follow.
I joined the drama circle in 2010, and to be really honest, drama is the only place I find peace inside school.Drama is the place where there is least drama at school! It is all about family. It is not only about the technicalities. You learn to survive and go forwards as a team. Theatre is not all about competition. As the Drama Circle we make sure that we encourage all our youngsters to strive towards and take a more passionate approach to the theatre scene in Sri Lanka rather than just acting to win. Coming runners up in 2010 at Theatre Fest was a pleasing and delightful moment for all of us. As we grew year by year, we realized that doing this with the mindset of winning is not what we want. What we want is to leave behind a legacy where other people would look at us and understand that we do theatre for the love and passion we have for it, said Udayaratne
Udayaratne pointed out that Ananda has progressed over the years with a bunch passionate and talented juniors and seniors. So what they want to do is to make this a collective, so that they ensure the audience that watches Ananda perform, has one heck of a day to remember. That is the goal.
When we take part in the Drama Comp. organized by the Royal College Interact Club, what we do is we use the inter-house drama competition that happens prior to this at school. We take the four plays from the four houses. And we develop one of these plays into the drama comp. so what we do is, we dont take our most senior and experienced actors and put them on stage. We experiment with the new talent we have and put them on stage giving them the chance to act and see how they perform. And from that we take it to drama comp. so that we take the young lot more than the most senior and experienced actors, so that the young ones get a chance. And that is the most fundamental thing. So you do drama for the love, and you share the love with each other. Because, for me drama is everything. That is the core insight I have gained, explained Udayaratne.

The oil tanks at the Hambantota port are owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and not by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Petroleum trade unions have no right to strike over oil tanks, United National Party (UNP) Kurunegala District MP Nalin Bandara said.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha, the UNP Headquarters yesterday, he said the goal of the petroleum trade union action is to disrupt, and create inconvenience to the Government.
Bandara said the trade union action is regulated by a political force to satisfy their narrow needs while causing disruptions to the economy.
He said, the Government has no links with the attack on petroleum trade union members. The riot was controlled by Police and the Military forces. He said the loss of the Hambantota port for 2016 was Rs. 47 billion. Measures should be taken to develop the port and to utilise it to create revenue for the country, he said.
Sri Lanka acquires an ownership of 40.45 percent of the port under the 99 year lease out agreement with China, he said.

Donald Trunk
Juliet Coombe interviews Stick No Bills who just launched a stunning surfing elephant poster to help the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Societys elephant protection campaign, just before a real-life Sri Lankan elephant took to the waves
Was it a coincidence Was it a PR stunt Was this a case of magic realism shaping reality Do elephants really surf, and did this elephant lose his surfboard somewhere off the east coast Well, it would seem that pigs might not fly but elephants definitely surf.
Theres a new club out there for thrill seekers. Its called The Ten Mile Out Club and its founding member is a Sri Lankan elephant.
This elephant, now known as Donald Trunk, took to the seas in most uncharacteristic fashion, using his enormous, gas-filled belly to take Archimedes floating principle to a new extreme and his long trunk as a giant sea-snake-like snorkel to cruise a massive ocean current ten miles out into the Indian Ocean.
It is thought that, tired of being the biggest kahuna on terrafirma, Donald Trunk decided it was time to catch some waves and maybe even meet his almighty sub-aqua equivalent - the blue whale.
So, off set the elephant following Poseidons dorsal fin to surf his way into the deep blue seas. The navy team of divers that came to his rescue report that Donald seemed disappointed to see them and appeared to be loving his surprisingly buoyant sojourn across calm seas to nowhere in particular, spurred on by dancing dolphins, tantalising turtles and a huge host of beautiful tropical fish, with gorgeous views of the golden sands of his homelands palm-fringed coastline fading into the distance behind him.
Just as the navys remarkable elephant rescue operation was taking place, Meg Williams, co-founder of the trail-blazing Stick No Bills poster design business which now straddles the two island paradises of Sri Lanka and Mallorca, was sitting down to breakfast in Palma. As usual, Meg had been up since well before dawn to communicate with Sri Lanka which lies in a timezone four and a half hours ahead of the Balearic Isles.
Founding members
However, this very morning, i.e. the day Donald Trunk learnt to surf, was unusual in that Meg had literally just committed to donating profits from her retro style surfing elephant advert to the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society (SLWCS) to boost its crucial mission to protect the endangered elephants of Sri Lanka.
For those of us who are unfamiliar with Stick No Bills or Meg, here is a quick run down. Meg was formerly Vice President of one of the worlds premier security firms, a company founded in London in 2001 by senior ex-special forces agents in which Meg headed up the intelligence, due diligence and risk analysis department for seven years and from which she resigned in 2008 to start a family and be the change she wanted to see in the world.
Meg and her husband Philip moved to Galle where they managed a surf hotel and Meg - cathartically tapping into the experiences and contacts she had gained during her career working in the intelligence arena in the United States, United Kingdom and across conflicts zones of the Middle East, Africa and Asia - became the script advisor to the highly successful prime time British TV show Spooks.
Between when Sri Lankas war ended in 2009 and 2014, the couple had their two daughters, surfed most sunrises, launched the Galle Fort Flea Market and became founding members of Greener Galle, the community-launched initiative to transform Galle Fort into the first carbon neutral UNESCO world heritage city. They also founded an advertising and marketing services company with the aim of giving post-war Sri Lanka free positive branding worldwide through the promotion of vintage and retro Ceylon/Sri Lanka poster designs, encouraging tourists to come to the war and tsunami-torn island and to take idyllic travel posters home with them in the form of posters and postcards.
The British couple recognised that by exploiting Philips commercial and creative expertise gained working in advertising for the Financial Times Group in London and latterly as an advertising photographer in the Middle East and America, they could do something good for Sri Lanka and good for us by setting about providing the best national branding campaign the Sri Lankan government never paid for, through their exhibition of digitally re-mastered lithograph Ceylon and Sri Lanka travel posters in Galle Fort and their launching of the No Bill Piece Prize, their open-ended international travel poster design contest.
The extraordinary rescue
In the meantime, with the help of a well known Sri Lankan, a Galle based restaurateur and businessman and a highly dedicated all-female team of gallery assistants, Stick No Bills first poster gallery, the retail outlet for sale of the British couples designs, was born. The doors of the flagship gallery at 35 Church Street have been open from 8am to 8pm 365 days a year, ever since, and Stick No Bills now also supplies a dozen other mini-galleries set up at prestigious high end locales island-wide.
As soon as Stick No Bills started to thrive, the company also began to donate proceeds from specific designs to noble local conservation and sustainability-orientated causes such as The Galle Heritage Foundation. Fast forward to Tuesday, 11th July 2017 in Spain, at breakfast. Megs phone rings. An old friend of hers from the United States Drug Enforcement Administrations maritime division hollers down the line all the way from Long Island, New York: Holy crow, have you heard whats happened The Sri Lankan Navy have just rescued an elephant swimming ten miles out to sea off the islands east coast! We first thought they were onto a narco-sub. But incredibly its an elephant!!
Meg was confused by the tip off; was this some kind of joke Her surfing elephant design had just gone into production and now the Sri Lankan navy had rescued a surfing elephant
Sure enough, within hours, video footage of the extraordinary rescue operation had gone viral. By the end of the day the story had become headline news around the world.

Former Govt. sold our lands outright: We changed it
President Maithripala Sirisena in a speech encompassing all issues that have been in public discourse said that a majority of the people should not be victimised due to the conspiracies of a few.
It was the previous regime that sold our land outright, unlike any previous regime. 200 acres were sold outright for the port city project to a Chinese company.
It was after we assumed duties that we changed it to a lease agreement he said. He further said that under his leadership not an inch of the soil would be given to a foreign entity.
He pointed out that during that time, there were no protests or strikes against such action.
Today everyone has the freedom and it is this freedom that is being misused by a few. We cant let this few cause hardship to the majority he said.
Speaking at an event in Ibbagamuwa, where the President declared open a centre for education resources at the Hameedia Muslim school, the President pointing out to the Petroleum Corporation said that the strikers have been completely misled.
I was listening to some of the speeches made by the Trade Union leaders who led the strike. I was very disappointed to see how incompetent they are in understanding the issue.
The lack of information, lack of knowledge which resulted in the strike was alarming he said. He further said that he made the order proclaiming Fuel Distribution an essential service,due to the severe hardship faced by the public.
He further said that he was willing to have an open discussion with any person, and reiterated that any issue could be resolved through dialogue.
Today the doctors have made striking a game putting the lives of people in peril.
They seem to have no value for human life, he said.

Arjuna to submit report on losses during CPC strike
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, observing that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has incurred huge losses and damages over the past few days, said he would furnish a report in that regard to the House shortly.
The minister was speaking at the Parliamentary debate on the Gazette Extraordinary issued by the President declaring supply and distribution of fuel as an essential public service.
We issued the Gazette because we saw how the public have been inconvenienced due to the trade union action. The Government is grappling with issues such as the garbage disposal problem and dengue epidemic at the same time.
Had the oil crisis continued any longer, the day-to-day activities of the people could have been crippled. We are ready for discussions at any moment, and at the same time we are not hesitant to take swift action if the public is inconvenienced, he said.
The Minister, reiterating that he is against privatization, however pointed out joint investment is necessary to develop certain sectors of the country.
Keep aside your political motives when you are dealing with these matters. The petroleum strike could have been called off earlier than this, but some TU leaders acting as cats paw of certain rejected politicians did not allow that to happen, the minister said.
Hambantota oil tanks are not under the CPC, but under the Ports Authority. With joint investment into them we can yield optimal results. I tried to explain this to the TUs. Some political figures with no vote base tried to mess up my work. I do politics with the people. Doing ministerial duties is not like doing betting and gaming. When I was holding the Port and Shipping Ministry I intervened to get that agreement amended to our advantage , he stated.

Current law holds that all youth must leave government homes when they turn 18. At a press conference that often grew emotional, four young adults shared stories about the trials they faced upon leaving their residential homes.
Akash Moses, who now heads the Voice for the Voiceless Foundation, spent 18 years in a childrens home in Kandy. His parents abandoned him when he was two weeks old, he said. When he aged out of his home, he went to Colombo by himself. He was lucky, he said, and found a family who supported him. But his trials did not stop there  his birth certificate was incomplete, as it did not have his fathers name. That made it hard for him to fulfill basic needs, like opening a bank account.
In society, its decided by this paper whether Im going to sit in a higher position, or in garbage, Akash Moses said.

BROAD CONSENSUS FOR POWER SHARING now - PM
There is sentiment in this country for radical change, and we cant get away from it,Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday as he placed his hopes of further strengthening unity in the country on a new Constitution.
Politics has changed very much since the time Dudley Senanayake, people do not have the same issues with devolution as they used to, said the Prime Minister as he discussed the changing nature of power between the centre and periphery, delivering the 17th Dudley Senanayake Memorial Lecture at Temple Trees.
In the present framework giving devolution is not an issue, it is how the provincial executive is going to make use of it. Can they make the best use of it Those are some of the issues, the PM explained.
Dudley Senanayake, he said opposed the Executive Presidency at the time and said the British system of governance was good enough but given that the 1972 Constitution allowed the Prime Minister powers to remove the President, Wickremesinghe said that many believed that the Executive Presidency was needed to ensure government stability.
In the last decade however we saw the further strengthening of the Presidency, except during when I was PM under President Kumaratunga.The Presidency was strengthened at the expense of Parliament and the public control of finance by Parliament was only in name. As a result our debt servicing by 2020 has risen to just Rs 4.2 trillion, he said.
The Prime Minister explained that there was general consensus that the powers of the Executive needed to be reduced. He hoped that by the end of August the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly will be able to produce an interim report. After the debate in the Constitutional Assembly, we will be able to reach a consensus on the final report, he said.
The Prime Minister explained that they had many questions to answer on the nature of the Presidency, the relationship between the centre and the periphery, power sharing, stability of Parliament, electoral system and the manner in which the President and Parliament would be elected.
The nature of the executive and the person exercising executive power have to be looked anew. We cannot go back to the pre 70s Constitution because today we have a devolution of power and we are committing ourselves to maximum devolution of power without changing the character of the state, he said. The people want a modern government, peace and development, said the PM and added that a proper report would be able to bring about a stable democratic order acceptable to everyone in the country.

CASA elects Ruwan Waidyaratne of Hayleys Advantis as Chairman
The Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents (CASA) announced that Ruwan Waidyaratne, Managing Director, Hayleys Advantis Limited, had been unanimously elected as its Chairman for 2017/18 at the Associations 51stAnnual General Meeting (AGM) held on July 26, 2017.
Having served as the Vice Chairman of CASA from the year 2014/15, Ruwan will be taking over as Chairman from Capt. Ajith Peiris, Group Managing Director of Ceyline Agencies.
Commenting on his appointment, Ruwan said, I am honoured to have been elected as the Chairman of CASA and would like to thank the members for placing their trust in me.With the support of my executive committee, I hope to continue the good work done by the past Chairmen and their respective Executive Committees in shaping the shipping industry in Sri Lanka.
Ruwan is a Board Member of Hayleys PLC and holds responsibility for its Transportation and Logistics arm Hayleys Advantis. He has contributed to the shipping and logistics industry for over three decades and he is a former Chairman and member of the Advisory Council of the Sri Lanka Freight Forwarders Association (SLFFA).
He has also served in related committees such as the Steering Committee on Ports, Shipping, Aviation and Logistics affiliated to the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. With his election as the Chairman of CASA yesterday, he becomes the only person to have held the Chairmanship of both CASA and SLFFA, two of the leading industry bodies in the shipping and logistics sphere.
Addressing the Associations members and other key stakeholders at a cocktail held later that day, Ruwan said, We are all aware that the shipping industry plays an important role in our countrys economy. Statistics show that the transportation and logistics industry alone accounts for 12% of the countrys GDP. I firmly believe that the sector can make greater contributions to the national economy. We need to work together with all stakeholders, including the Government, on capitalizing on our strengths and emerging opportunities to realize our true potential.
Speaking on one such area of growth, he said, We can anticipate high demand for deep water terminals given the wave of new generation ships that are rolling out. Therefore, we appeal to the authorities to make use of this opportunity by operationalizing the East Container Terminal (ECT) as soon as possible. We need to act fast, before the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) reaches capacity which could lead to potential berthing congestion and loss of business.
Welcoming the new Maritime and Logistics Policy, he extended the Associations support to it and commended the Hon. Minister and his team who are working tirelessly to develop this legislation.
I sincerely hope that the opinions of our industry experts will be given due consideration, and we can collaborate our strengths and work together to come up with a pragmatic policy document that will help us achieve the countrys goal of becoming the maritime hub in the region, he added.
Ruwan also touched on several issues plaguing the shipping industry in Sri Lanka today. He noted that the removal of the terminal handling charge four years ago had affected shipping agencies and said, At a time when the country is aspiring to be a regional Maritime Hub, Colombo cannot afford to be the only hub in the world that doesn't permit lines to recover a local terminal handling charge.
Speaking at the event the Chairman of SLPA Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake said that there are many changes taking place in the shipping industry in Sri Lanka and that the industry needs to be prepared to embrace change. Acknowledging Ruwans thoughts on considering industry opinions for the Maritime and Logistics Policy he said It is an inclusive approach that we have, and we are engaging all the stakeholders in the process. He added,We can see a Minister who is trying to walk the talk and who is trying to make things happen.
Hambantota port is also becoming a reality and we have received cabinet approval to pursue the concessionary agreement on the Port with the establishment of two Sri Lankan companies. At the same time we have realized that we have an issue with the congestion of deep draft berths and the Minister has already given direction for the SLPA to launch the ECT as soon as possible.
Formed back in 1944, the Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents, acts as a leading voice for the Shipping Industry of Sri Lanka. With its ever expanding membership CASA has become stronger over the years and plays a major role in shaping the Shipping and Logistics industry of the country.

Chinese investments will help reduce debt: Prime Minister

The Hambantota deal will bring in an investment of USD 1.1 billion this year and another USD 1.1 billion the next, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Addressing the media at the Central Bank today he said China Merchants Ports Holdings Company Ltd. (CMPort) would make an additional investment of USD 300 million to further develop the Port.
The Prime Minister said these investments would greatly help reduce the debt burden of the country.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera addressing the same conference said that it was estimated that by the end of 2019, the government would have to cough up Rs. 3.2 trillion to service its debt payments.
Around 82 percent of this debt was taken on during the Rajapaksa regime, he said.
Premier Wickremesinghe pointed out that while many have disagreed with the deal with China, it had helped reduce the massive loss of Rs. 46.7 billion incurred by the Port since 2011.
We could have used this money to give 2.5 million people free healthcare or increase the education budget by 60 percent but we dumped it in a hole, the Prime Minister said.

Promoting A/C coaches
Presently the traffic congestion on the main roads of the country is high and the public transportation system of the country still seems to be inadequate. This is specially so during the rush hours of the mornings and evenings. This results in commuters having to waste hours on the road and some even having to do so standing in crowded buses. This also contributes largely to air pollution which presently is an important topic. Promoting the use of air-conditioned coaches in public transportation will be a solution to these problems.
The use of air conditioned (A/C) coaches should be promoted in both the medium and short distance public transport system in Sri Lanka. This is already available for long distances and some medium distance bus routes. This should be introduced to the short distance routes as well. It will have the following benefits:
l It will reduce the number of cars and other vehicles on the road and thereby reduce the fuel cost to the country.
l It will reduce the traffic congestion on the roads especially during rush hours by reducing the number of cars and three wheelers.
l It will benefit both the middle/lower class commuters.
Air conditioned private coaches are already available in middle distance routes such as Kollupitiya to Kaduwela. They are popular and is in great demand. They should also be introduced to routes such as Colombo to Panadura and Colombo to Homagama and to short distance routes as well.
A/C coaches are narrow (but tall) and do not take much more room on the road than cars. Hence when commuters using private cars transfer to A/C coaches it will reduce the number of cars on the road and will reduce traffic congestion significantly.
A fair number of car users use cars for travelling to office and back due to the inadequate public transport system. This is costing them a high amount as fuel cost. The government also spends a large amount of foreign exchange of the importation of fuel to the country. This could be reduced by the promotion of AC coaches in public transportation.
Presently the public transport system of the country requires many passengers to travel standing for as long as two hours inside buses to get home after office even at distance of about 15 miles. Some commuters still have to travel on foot board of buses during rush hours. (Such as in the Kollupitiya to Kohilawatte route) These problems could be solved effectively by promoting the use of AC coaches.
Since people in the higher income category are allowed to use cars at their own expense other people too should be allowed to travel in air conditioned coaches at their own expense.

ComBank introduces SLs first chip and PIN debit card
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has introduced Mastercard debit cards with chip and PIN technology for the first time in Sri Lanka.
These cards replace the existing Maestro debit cards with magnetic strips. The new chip and PIN debit card will minimise the possibility of fraudulent transactions at point-of-sale (POS) due to the PIN requirement, the Bank said.
This technology renders the new Mastercard debit cards smart and significantly increases the security level of the card when transacting.
Commercial Bank always believes in introducing technology that matters to customers. In this day and age, security is a primary concern of customers and this new card will ensure more secure purchases not only locally, but also when they are overseas, Commercial Banks Deputy General Manager Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe said.
Cardholders will receive their personal identification numbers (PIN) via SMS to registered mobile numbers when branches issue the card. Cardholders simply enter their PINs at POS machines to authorise transactions.
The Mastercard debit card with chip and PIN technology is deemed risk averse since it requires the card holder to authenticate each EMV transaction using a PIN, or use an OTP (one time password) for e-commerce transactions. It does not support contactless transactions and cannot be used at e-commerce sites which do not support 3D secure technology, or at POS terminals which do not support PIN, the Bank said.

The striking workers of the CPC were attacked by a group of thugs and the Police gave protection to the thugs, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake complained.
The MP also charged that the Welikada OIC had assaulted a trade unionist while in police custody. We demand the Government and the IGP to take action against this act. An investigation into the Welikada OIC must be conducted after arresting him, he said.
The MP participating in the Parliamentary debate yesterday asked Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe to state in the House whether he condones the attack by thugs on striking workers while the Police looked on.
Wickremesinghe often talks about democracy and UK Parliament as if he is the father of democracy. We would like to hear his position with regard to the incident on Wednesday, he said. This is the first adverse strike against this Government. The Government used thugs armed with rods and swords to suppress it. If this is the way the Government is dealing with the peoples problems, we vow to prepare the people to face it, he noted.

The programme, which has been specially created for managing directors and CEOs of mid-sized companies, will be held at the Hotel Galadari. Organized by Inspire One and supported by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Chambers and the Sri Lanka Printers Association, the workshop will provide a unique opportunity for its participants to revisit, review and reflect upon their business strategies, methodology, the means by which to inspire employees to follow the set plan and how to manage their busy lives, under the guidance of Sooriyaarachchi.
Over the last few years following my retirement from full-time work, I have been working with a large cross section of medium and large business enterprises, and especially with MDs and company owners. Currently they struggle to convert their business from being informal to formal, from person-dependent to process-dependent, without losing the entrepreneurial spirit of the enterprise. I conceptualized this programme taking in to account these specific challenges, said Sooriyaarachchi. 'Success Siksha'is structured upon four themes  strategy, execution, people and self and is made up of rich content made up of local as well as international examples and insights.
Sooriyaarachchi will also use case studies and interactive activities in order to make the programme more interesting and memorable. Before the workshop, Sooriyaarachchi plans to offer a leadership programme for the same audience based on the concept of the Leadership Code expounded by the RBL Group. The participants will also be able to avail themselves of the opportunity to be mentored by Sooriyaarachchi.

Diana Shipping remains in red
Athens-based dry bulk owner Diana Shipping has managed to slightly improve its financials by shrinking its net loss in the second quarter of 2017.
Although the net loss decreased, the company still ended the quarter with a net loss of USD 23.8 million, compared to a net loss of USD 31.3 million seen in the same three-month period of 2016. Diana Shipping's operating loss stood at USD 15.5 million, compared to an operating loss of USD 24.2 million reported a year earlier, while the company's time charter revenues reached USD 37.8 million, up from USD 28.3 million seen in the same quarter of 2016. The increase in time charter revenues was due to increased average time charter rates achieved for the company's vessels during the quarter and increased revenues resulting from the enlargement of the fleet.
Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to USD 50.3 million, compared to a net loss of USD 62.7 million reported in the same period a year earlier. Time charter revenues for the first half of the year increased to USD 69 million from USD 59.1 million reported in the same six-month period of 2016. World Maritime News

Digital  transactions:financial industry must shift gear
In line with the unfolding saga of innovative technologies pushing boundaries to disrupt traditional business models, ever so powerful forces are transforming the banking industry as well.
Consistent growth remains relatively elusive, costs are proving difficult to contain while Return on Investments (ROI) remain stubbornly low.
Regulators are struggling to keep pace with the ever-changing technologies and emerging business models. Technology is rapidly morphing from a traditionally expensive challenge into a potent enabler of both customer experience and efficient operations.
Non-traditional players are challenging the traditional establishments more than ever before, leading with customer-focused innovation. New service models are emerging constantly to challenge the traditional banking establishments. Customers are demanding ever higher levels of service and value. At the same time trust is at an all-time low.
With the emergence of disruptive new entrants to the market who are threatening to take away share by offering an enhanced customer experience via superior technology, many have predicted that the traditional banking industry would collapse very soon. Surprisingly, this has not taken place yet even though many old bastions are beginning to feel the pinch.
Hence, despite the emergence of new competitors and models, it seems more than likely that the traditional bank still has a bright future. The fundamental concepts of a trusted institution providing value, a source of finance and a facilitator of secure transactions is almost impossible to change overnight.
However, much of the landscape will continue to undergo rapid change in response to the growing demands of customer expectations, regulatory requirements, newer technologies, demographics, new competitors and shifting economics.
In this context, banks need to take off their traditional hats and rethink their strategy against these significant changes; whether to be a shaper of the future, a fast follower, or to manage defensively by putting off change.
Staying with the same status quo is no more an option. I believe that the superstars in the new millennium will not only execute relentlessly against todays dramatic changes, but also innovate and transform themselves to be better prepared for the future. This future will require institutions to be agile and nimble footed, ready to explore different territories in a much more uncertain business environment.
So, is this change a revolution, or an evolution In reality, it is a combination of both. All the signboards for change are here. Many players are innovating and experimenting with new products and delivery channels based on decisions made via analytics.
The industry has historically changed slowly, in other words, it had been an evolutionary change. And the changes we envision are less about imagining some unknown future, but more about implementing and integrating all the things we know today.
Yet the pace at which the change is happening is increasing rapidly. Hence, banks that fail to shift to a faster gear risk being left behind. And if any institution could truly master all the priorities, it would be revolutionary indeed.
Business as a service
In addition of having to face with their own traditional business models being challenged, the banks now have to also face the new reality of ever changing customer dynamics.
In the digital age, a plethora of organizations are beginning to emerge with new business models to offer business as a service, without even owning a single product or a service they offer.
Some of the examples are Uber and PickMe - private driver, Postmates - favourite delivery channel, UpWork - favourite workforce and Airbnb- private lodging.
However, all of them have something in common. They dont own a single asset of the service they are selling.
For example, Uber and PickMe dont have their own vehicles, Postmates has no delivery trucks, Upwork hasnt hired any workforce and AirBnb doesnt own a single property.
The underlying enabler for all these businesses is the fact that a large segment of the worlds population (>1 billion) is now connected to each other via smart phones 24X7. What is the end result This disruption is leading to elimination of traditional business models. For example, 'Yellow Cab' was the largest, dominant and most stable taxi company in San Francisco and at the time was thought as impossible to be displaced. Prior to 2015, the size of the taxi market in San Francisco was US$ 140 million. However, after their launch, Uber generated US$ 500 million by themselves alone in 2015, which was more than triple the previous total market size.
Uber changed the business dynamics by creating a much bigger market that never even existed before. The end result was in 2016 'Yellow Cab' filed for bankruptcy.
Uber not only disrupted the transport industry, but also more than tripled the market size. Yet, unresolved question is could PickMe replicate this phenomenon in Sri Lanka
Smart mobile apps defining the future
The important question faced by the banking industry is whether they are geared to cater to the ever-changing requirements of their customers. Gone are the days where people are looking for just banking only apps.
Lets face the reality. How many banking transactions would an individual perform during a week as opposed to the other transactions that he engages in Such as ordering dinner, getting a taxi or buying groceries. The answer is a no brainer.
The winner, obviously, is the latter against banking only transactions and that too by many folds. The success or the failure of mobile applications just lie right here. Banks are spending millions in order to develop mobile banking applications and yet they complain that the adoption is low.
Obviously, they are not seeing the bigger picture. PickMe is a transport app, but not a banking app, which was designed to help a person to get from location A to B. Making the payment to the transport provider is a subsequent requirement of the user. Would I use a banking app just to make the payment to PickMe
Highly unlikely. Every individual is more likely to use an app that helps them in their daily chores or addresses an actual need. How would the usage of this comapre to a banking only app that would be used very infrequently
Banks must stop thinking of payment as the customer's requirement, where the problem solved by PickMe is how to get from A to B conveniently. Making the payment to PickMe becomes secondary, but if supported, it must be facilitated via the same app.
This is where FinTechs are getting it right and the banks are lagging behind. FinTechs are coming up with apps that addresses peoples needs, not only peoples banking needs.
They are trying to fix real-life problems and not payment-related issues. Ironically, banks are thinking payment first and put a lot of effort to fix that problem. They forget to look at where the majority of the future payment transactions would take place.
Obviously, a person would make more transactions via an app that caters to his daily needs than his banking only app.
The above logic is supported by the unprecedented growth experienced by some of the market leading apps. For examples, to acquire 50 million customers, which is more than double the population of Sri Lanka, the time taken by the following apps were:
Facebook took 30 months, which is fast paced in a traditional sense. WhatsApp took 15 months, which has halved the time taken by Facebook. Angry Birds took 15 days, now what do you call this
All the above are not banking or payment apps. These apps are trying to address specific needs of people, and thus, have become tremendously successful in the process.
More often than not they could emerge as direct competitors to banks in terms of carrying out financial transactions. A person who is hooked onto WhatsApp is more likely to make a payment via the same app than switching to a banking app.
In fact, both Facebook and WhatsApp are now facilitating payment transactions. So, what it really shows is that the rules of the game are rapidly changing. Are the banks who decide to manage defensively by putting off change ready for such challenges
There is also the significant impact created by the highly tech savvy generation, who grew up with the Internet and mobile devices. The so-called millennials are rapidly coming into decision-making roles.
In 2015, Chase bank in a Digital Adoption Survey found out that a high percentage of millennials (25-34 year-olds) are using mobiles apps and also make payments via the Internet than GenXers (35-49 years) or Baby boomers (50 years and above).
Another survey done by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics suggests that by 2030, 75% of the workforce will be made up of millennials. They are reshaping the way transactions are done as individuals, thus, impacting the businesses as well. If the banks continue to ignore these hard facts, they would certainly be left behind.
Technology is reshaping user experience and identity
The success or failure of adoption of any payment-related technology would be determined primarily by two factors, which are usability of technology and the establishment of trust. In addition to the smart phone-based apps, technologies such as Apples iBeacon could create potential customer pull impact by its ability to broadcast promotions to nearby devices.
For example, a retail store might be able to broadcast an attractive discount to nearby potential customers and entice them to visit the store. They could also deploy smart mobile apps to devices that have the presence aware capability and enable easy-to-use 1-click payments that is bound to drive adoption. The other aspect is the establishment of trust among the users of mobile payment applications. The fast emerging innovations in biometric-based technologies have certainly improved security, and thus, enhanced the trust and provided better user experience. Authentication technologies such as facial and fingerprint recognition via smart devices have vastly improved customer perception of trust and are becoming widely available. So, the trust factor is also being taken care of to a greater extent by innovative technologies.
Change is inevitable
Hence, as we speak, all the ingredients that make these smart mobile apps to be successful, especially by increasing user adoption, are falling into place. However, the big question still remains to be answered is Do the banks get it
Are they still focused on developing their own mobile banking only apps or are they not afraid to take the plunge by partnering with mobile app developers who think out-of-the-box to address the needs of real people.
Their success will be determined by the willingness and the ability to move into win-win partnerships with the mobile app industry rather than stubbornly trying to build their own banking app.
It is time they realize that most of the innovations are happening outside their four walls. They would be wise to look outside the box and get into revenue sharing business models with innovative mobile app developers to overcome ROI issues.
Thus, banks could rapidly acquire FinTech capabilities via such partnerships without attracting too much risk. If they dont, they will be left far behind by others and will only be left with the option of having to ponder what hit them.

ECLs specialised design expertise contributes  to BIA runway upgrade
The recent resurfacing of the runway of Sri Lankas Bandaranaike International Airport marked an important milestone in the countrys aviation history.
In support of Lankas aim to develop the industry, to expand tourism, and especially in enabling bigger commercial aircraft such as the Airbus A380 to land successfully, the runway rehabilitation project was a long-felt need.
Three decades ago when the runway was commissioned and constructed, the Netherlands Airport Consultants (NACO) served as the design and supervision consultant, working jointly with Engineering Consultants (Pvt) Ltd (ECL).
Following the Airport and Aviation Services Limited (AASL) decision to embark on its first major rehabilitation of the original runway and completing due tender proceedings, NACO and ECL were once again tasked with the colossal responsibility to conduct the design review and construction supervision for upgrading the runway.
ECL, as pioneers in multi-disciplinary consulting, have been endorsed as the most respected engineering services provider in the industry, providing a diverse range of services with expertise to handle the most challenging projects.
Rehabilitating the existing runway posed a major operational challenge for NACO and ECL.
The BIA runway was closed for operationsfrom 8.30 am to 4.30 pm daily, for a period of three months, from January 6 to April 6, 2017.
As a result, the contracting and supervision team were only able to work on the runway during that 8-hour period each day.
Air traffic and operations at the airport had to resume outside those working hours on an ongoing basis. Due to such an aggressively phased project timeline there was no room for mistakes and ensuring zero risks was vital.
While the construction supervision was challenging, given the very aggressive schedule and the number of affected parties, the ECL team worked tirelessly ensuring that the project was completed within time and costs tightly controlled and maintained within the budget.
The critical implementation of construction safety procedures when closing and re-opening of the runway throughout the timescale was another daunting task which ECL successfully managed. In fact, ECL has won aviation kudos for the implementation of the project minus any mishaps.
Every engineering infrastructure project is unique and must be approached with a solid understanding of the requirements, technical skills, and engineering creativity to be able to deliver the project successfully, on time and within budget.
The BIA runway project was a formidable challenge to everyone, especially as the risks were high and logistics of utmost importance. However, quality and safety was not comprised at any stage during the project.
ECL takes pride in their ability to complete the project on time with no accidents or delays and has been able to deliver an exceptional project outcome.
ECL continues to provide clients with an exceptional service helping clients take projects from concept to completion and beyond bringing in expertise and insights gained from work on other projects completed locally and globally.
A few ongoing local projects which showcase ECL expertise are the Port City reclamation, the development of fisheries aarbours in the Southern part of the country, the Mahaweli Water Security Project, and Kandy City Wastewater Project.

EDB holds Entrept Traders Forum
The EDB conducted a forum on entrept trade with the participation of a large number of traders and exporters and others engaged in such business.
Entrepot trade or the re-export trade involves importing goods from one country and re-exporting to another, with or without any additional processing or repackaging. Goods are exempt from duties at the point of import and re-exports.
Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders Association (SLFFA), Sri Lanka Shippers Council (SLSC), Shippers Academy Colombo and several public sector institutions relevant to the trade including Sri Lanka Customs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority and BOI collaborated with EDB in organizing the Entrept Traders Forum held at EDB Auditorium recently.
This forum provided a platform for the traders and exporters engaged and interested in entrept trade to understand current entrept trade procedures in Sri Lanka and to discuss the issues that need to be addressed to develop the trade.
Commercial Hub Regulations introduced initially in Part IV of the Finance Act No 12 of 2012 of Sri Lanka was amended by Finance Act No 12 of 2013, cited as the Finance Act  Commercial Hub Regulations in the Gazette Notification No. 1818/30 of July 11, 2013. Goods are exempt from duties at the point of import and re-exports.
The introduction of these regulations made entrept trade a distinct sector. t traders as follows:a) entrept trade under the Commercial Hub Regulations (foreign investors falling under the purview of the BOI); and b) entrepot trade under the Customs Ordinance without entitlements to all of the benefits under Commercial Hub Regulations (local traders).
Commercial Hub Regulations demarcated six areas in close proximity or within the ports and airports as free ports or bonded areas (areas which are geographically inside Sri Lanka but are legally considered outside its customs territory and supervised by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka or the Director General Customs or any other authority under the Commercial Hub Regulations) to facilitate trade.
These are the Colombo Port, Hambantota Port, Mattala International Airport, Katunayake EPZ, Koggala EPZ and Mirrijjawala EPZ. Although not under the Commercial Hub Regulations, the Colombo Airport Cargo Terminal is also a customs supervised bonded area.
Superintendent of Customs Thilak Arumapperuma Arachchi, Shippers Academy Colombo CEO Rohan Masakorala, Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders Association (SLFFA) former Chairman Dushmantha Karannagoda, BOI Acting Executive Director Mahinda Ramanayake, Sri Lanka Shippers Council Chairman Chrisso De Mel, and Director General of the Export Development Board Jeevani Siriwardena were among others who participated in the forum.
Thilak Arumapperuma Arachchi spoke on the challenges faced in entrept trade.
Mahinda Ramanayake said the Government has announced the setting up of free ports and bonded areas to create trade-related infrastructure to facilitate import and export of goods and services with freedom to carry out transactions in convertible foreign currency.
Dushmantha Karannagoda spoke om Customs documentation process, locations for entrept handling, entrept trade activities, registration process to handle entrept activity, prohibited items under entrept trade and exchange control provisions governing entrept trade.
He said the bottlenecks and red tape need to be ironed out before we start promoting entrept trade. Bad experiences could divert the traffic and winning them back would be an uphill task.
According to Rohan Masakorala, Sri Lankas location on the international maritime map has put it at a better advantage to be a major player in this field than it is for the leaders in entrept trade such as Dubai and Singapore.
Jeevani Siriwardena said the EDB has identified the necessity for entrepot trade and successfully conducted four roundtable meetings with the stakeholders concerned to identify ways to develop the trade.
She said that the current entrept rules and regulations have been reviewed to make it conducive to businesspersons.
A session for issues that entrept traders currently face was also conducted. The first Entrept Trade Forum was a great opportunity for entrept traders and exporters entering the global market.
The major entrept trading hubs that excel at present are (1) Singapore (which bridges South Asia with the rest of the world); (2) Hong Kong (the Gateway of China to the world); and (3) Dubai (which connects African countries with the rest of the world).
Globally, the top three entrepots (excluding the USA), consisting of Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai have contributed 161%, 83 % and 26% from re-exports to their GDP respectively in 2015.
Hong Kong, the worlds largest re-exporter, serves as the conduit to the Chinese mainland, facilitating much of the mainlands trade, taking advantage of its location and an investor-friendly tax regime for entrept trade.
Its main market segment is mainland China. Singapore serves as an entrept port mainly for goods destined to regional markets such as Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan and Japan, apart from the USA and the EU.
Dubai, emerging from a barren desert, is positioned as the gateway to the Middle East and also re-exports goods to many other countries including China, India Saudi Arabia, Germany and the USA.
These three entrept ports combined commanded 75% of the global market in 2014 as per ITC statistics, with Hong Kong dominating the landscape with 44% of the global market share. Singapore, the second largest re-exporter lagged behind Hong Kong with 21% and UAE with 10% of market share respectively.
Commodities popularly re-exported are machinery and equipment from Hong Kong and Singapore and pearls, precious stones and metals from Dubai.
These global giants are high-income countries characterized by political stability, high investments in superior infrastructure and warehousing facilities, high labour and utility costs, low taxes and duties, streamedlined procedures and focused policies to take advantage of their location on the trade route map.
The ports and airports of the countries are amongst the busiest in the world. Logistics are mostly outsourced to private operators leading to operational efficiencies.
In 2016 Sri Lanka re-exported to 32 countries around the world: UAE (24%), India (23%), China (11%) and Singapore (11%) accounted for the majority share of 69% of the total FOB value.
Similarly, 63% of the CIF value of imports classified under entrept were from four nations, namely, China (25%), Canada (17%), UAE (11%) and the Netherlands (10%).

FCID completes 12 cases, 89 forwarded to Attorney General
Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) has received 335 complaints so far and 12 cases have been filed in the High Court, Police media spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Gunasekara said 89 cases have been forwarded to the Attorney Generals Department, 115 cases have been either closed or directed to another institution and 131 cases are under investigation. He further said the reasons for the delay in prosecution was because they also need the support of some foreign countries to complete the investigations.
We have sent 86 requests to 25 countries and we have received responses to around 36 requests so far, he said. When questioned about the Nallur shooting and that Jaffna High Court Judge M. Ilancheliyan had contradicted the statement made by the police that the shooting was neither planned nor aimed at the Judge, SP Gunasekara said as the investigations are under way, he cannot make a statement regarding the incident. When asked whether complaints filed by Joint Opposition were not investigated by the FCID, SP Gunasekara said the 131 cases that are under investigation include complaints that the JO filed.
Responding to a question about Police arresting the protesters against Trinco Oil Tank deal and not the thugs who were present, SP Gunasekara said he received no complaints that the protesters were assaulted either by police or by some others who were present.
If police assaulted a protester, he can complain to a higher ranking police official.And if he was assaulted by some other people, he can file a complaint to the police station.
We cannot do anything without a complaint and so far we have not received any such complaint, he said.

Fiction just takes its time
Twenty years after Arundhati Roy won the Man Booker prize for her debut novel The God of Small Things, the Indian author has been longlisted for the 50,000 award for her second, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness.
On a longlist thronged with literary titans, whose combined trophy Cabinet would include the Pulitzer, the Costa, the Baileys, the Folio, the Impac and the Goldsmiths prizes, Roy  the only author to have won the Booker before  is listed for her novel about an Indian transgender woman, which judges called a rich and vital book. Speaking about why it took her two decades to produce a second novel, Roy told the Guardian earlier this year that fiction just takes its time. Its no hurry. I cant write it faster or slower than I have; its like youre a sedimentary rock thats just gathering all these layers, and swimming around.
The Man Booker judging panel, picking from more than 150 titles, also went for four writers who have been shortlisted for the UKs most prestigious literary prize before but not won it. Ali Smith was chosen for the humane, zany, delightful, optimistic post-EU referendum novel Autumn; Zadie Smith was picked for her story of the friendship and rivalry between two London girls who meet at a dance class, Swing Time; Sebastian Barry is in the running with Days Without End, about an Irish man who migrates to the US in the lead-up to the civil war; and Mohsin Hamid for Exit West, a love story set in a world where refugees use wormholes to travel from city to city.
American writers
The Booker was opened up to US authors in 2014, with Paul Beatty the first American author to win, for The Sellout last year. This year, three of the biggest names in US letters are competing for the prize: Paul Auster with 4321, which explores one mans four simultaneous lives and was deemed magisterial by the judges; George Saunders, a short-story writer whose first novel Lincoln in the Bardo follows Abraham Lincolns visits to the graveyard where his 11-year-old son has been laid to rest in a crypt; and Colson Whitehead for his fantastical novel The Underground Railroad, about a female slave escaping from a Georgia cotton plantation, which has already won the Pulitzer and the National Book Award for fiction in the US.
Obviously it has been very controversial, opening it up to the US, said chair of judges Baroness Lola Young. Before the Americans were included, I personally felt it did seem quite strange, to say it was for any book written in English from the UK, or the Commonwealth, and Ireland, and Zimbabwe  it was a slightly odd configuration. So (including America) seemed like a logical step and I dont think readers, writers and publishers should feel too nervous. This year, added Young, around a third of submissions were by American writers  slightly down on last year.
Saunders, Whitehead and Auster will be competing with two new names: 29-year-old Fiona Mozley, from the UK, and 38-year-old American Emily Fridlund, both picked for their debut novels, Elmet and History of Wolves respectively. They are joined by the Impac Dublin award-winning author Jon McGregor and his novel Reservoir 13, about the life of a Peak District village after a 13-year-old girl goes missing on holiday, and Kamila Shamsies Home Fire, a modern retelling of Sophocless tragedy Antigone that opens in an interrogation room in Heathrow airport.
The longlist is completed with Irish writer Mike McCormacks Solar Bones, a single-sentence novel that won him the Goldsmiths prize last year. First published in 2016 by tiny Irish publisher Tramp Press, McCormacks novel was ineligible for last years Booker because Tramp is not based in the UK. After being picked up by Canongate, Solar Bones was made eligible for the award.
With a split of four UK, four US, two Irish, two UK-Pakistani and one Indian writer; seven men to six women; three debuts; and three novels from independent presses, chair of judges Baroness Lola Young insisted that only when the judges surveyed the 13 remaining contenders that they realised the diversity of their list.
The longlist showcases a diverse spectrum  not only of voices and literary styles but of protagonists too, in their culture, age and gender. Nevertheless we found there was a spirit common to all these novels: though their subject matter might be turbulent, their power and range were life-affirming  a tonic for our times, said Young. Together their authors  both recognised and new  explore an array of literary forms and techniques, from those working in a traditional vein to those who aim to move the walls of fiction.
Former Booker winners
With 144 novels submitted for the prize, and 10 books called in by the judges, the selection of Young and her fellow judges literary critic Lila Azam Zanganeh, author Sarah Hall, artist Tom Phillips and travel writer Colin Thubron overlooked new novels by names including former Booker winners Salman Rushdie and Roddy Doyle.
Its always a struggle (rejecting titles) because one is very aware of the energy and commitment it takes to produce something. You have to bear that in mind, said Young. Having said that, I wouldnt say we found it incredibly difficult, in terms of having lots of arguments  there was a fair amount of consensus.
Young and her fellow judges will now reread the longlist of 13 titles to come up with a shortlist of six, which will be announced on September 13. The winner will be unveiled on October 17, to join a roster of winners dating back to 1969, including Hilary Mantel, Iris Murdoch and Ian McEwan. Last years winner, The Sellout, has now sold more than 360,000 physical copies, with sales in the week after the prize announcement jumping by 658%.

Flat track becomes a deathtrap for Sri Lanka
GALLE: On a flat Galle track where India scored 600 in their first innings Sri Lanka batsmen were left floundering for survival as they closed the second day of the first cricket Test at 154 for five wickets yesterday.
Sri Lanka face an uphill task of saving the follow-on needing to reach a total of 401, which at this stage seems quite a distance away as effectively they are six down with Asela Gunaratne ruled out of the match with an injury. Sri Lanka trail India by 446 runs and need a further 247 runs to avoid the follow-on.
On former captain Angelo Mathews rests the task of batting Sri Lanka out of the predicament they find themselves under. He was unbeaten on 54 at stumps with Dilruwan Perera on six. How far Mathews can take Sri Lanka depends on the support he can get from the tail.
It was not so much the pitch but the ability of the Indian bowlers to extract something out of it that made the difference between the two sides.
After Umesh Yadav had initiated the breakthrough in the second over of the innings by trapping Dimuth Karunaratne in front of the wicket, Mohammad Shami pushed Sri Lanka onto the back foot by sending back debutant Danushka Gunathilaka for 16 and Kusal Mendis for a duck (his first on home soil) in the 15th over.
Upul Tharanga and Angelo Mathews figured in a rescue act adding 57 for the fourth wicket and just as when Sri Lanka seemed to be gradually gaining in confidence, they lost Tharanga through an unfortunate run out.
Tharanga came out to Ashwin and played the ball to Mukund at silly point who reacted sharply and flicked the ball back to wicket-keeper Saha who whipped the bails off as Tharanga struggled to gain his ground. India appealed and the decision was put to the third umpire who ruled Tharanga out as his bat was in the air at the time the wicket-keeper broke the stumps. Had this match been played after October 1, Tharanga would have been ruled not out as there is a change in the rule that comes into effect from this date.
Losing Tharanga at that stage was a big blow as he was well set for a big innings. Sri Lanka also lost Niroshan Dickwella for eight when Mukund came up with another brilliant effort pulling off a one-handed reflex catch at silly point to give Ashwin his first wicket of the innings.
Sri Lanka for long has always looked to the left-arm spin of Rangana Herath to run through a batting side with other bowlers simply chipping in. Yesterday Nuwan Pradeep decided to put his hand up and came up with a fine spell of fast bowling on an unresponsive track to finish with career best figures of 6 for 132.
For a long time Pradeep has shown promise of doing something different and he seized his chance yesterday to break away from the hoodoo of finishing with four-fors in an innings on seven previous occasions.
Sri Lanka attacked the Indian batsmen with short balls and it paid off as both Pradeep and his new ball partner Lahiru Kumara ended with the most number of wickets  9.
Herath was kept without a wicket for 31 overs before he finally had Saha caught by Perera at mid on.
India who resumed at 399-4 slipped to 503-7 by lunch but ninth wicket pair Hardik Pandya and Mohammad Shami added 62 off 51 balls to ensure India reached 600. Pandya on his debut scored a half-century off 49 balls and Shami made 30. Between them they shared six sixes.
Cheteswar Pujara made his sixth score of over 150 before being dismissed for 153 scored off 264 balls with the aid of 13 fours.
Sri Lanka captured the wickets of both overnight batsmen inside the first hours play but were stalled by India late order and tail that rustled up 97 runs in 16.1 overs with Pandya leading the lower order onslaught.

The 1930s love affair between the American socialite, and King Edward VIII, ended with the King abdicating so he could be with the woman he adored. In those days, it was considered unacceptable for a British monarch to marry a divorce. Not only had she already been divorced once, but she was still married to her second husband when her romance with the man who would soon be wearing the crown, began.
She was Wallis Simpson - the lady who triggered an abdication crisis, in the momentous period leading up to World War II. Wallis first marriage failed, and when married to the businessman Ernest Aldrich Simpson, she met the man who was to become her third husband  then the Prince of Wales. In a 1970 BBC interview, Wallis recalled her first impression of Edward. I thought he was ahead of his time. I thought he had pep. I thought he wanted to establish things that the world was not ready for.
According to socialite Nicholas Haslam, it came as no surprise Wallis proved irresistible to Edward - she possessed tremendous personal magnetism. Haslam still remembers the first time he set eyes on her. Suddenly there was a total hush in the restaurant and people dropped their spoons and their cutlery and she walked in and the entire room was silentand she sat down and she saidHi, Im Wallis. You cant beat that.
While Edward VIII wanted to marry Mrs. Simpson, once Wallis realized that marriage to her would cost the King the throne, she tried to change his mind. But he was determined. This was the only subject on which she was unable to dominate her future husband, observed historian, Philip Zeigler.
Yet, for a love story that changed the British monarchy forever, Edward VIII's wedding to Wallis Simpson was a relatively modest affair.
Six months after his abdication from the British throne that rocked the royal family and the nationthe former King of England, now Duke of Windsor, wed his beloved American divorce at the Chateau De Cande, in Monts, France.
Free of the pomp and circumstance associated with royal weddings, the controversial union was a small ceremony. And while press photos weren't allowed during the event, Time magazine reported the events of the day in detail, noting that Edward was "hallow-eyed" as Wallis walked down the aisle to the march from Handel's Judas Maccabeus, wearing a dress of "soft blue crepe with a tight, buttoned bodice, a halo-shaped hat of the same color, shoes and gloves to match. At her throat was a tremendous diamond-&-sapphire brooch."
"Only two incidents disturbed the ceremony," noted the Time reporter. "When Vicar Jardine asked, 'Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor and keep her' overwrought Edward cried 'I will!' in a shrill voice that was almost a scream. When he put on her finger the plain wedding ring of Welsh-mined gold that has become a tradition in the British Royal Family, the trembling of his hands was noticeable even to the farthest watchers."
Champagne and toasts followed, with notable guests including Randolph Churchill, Baron Eugne Rothschild, and best man Major Edward Dudley Metcalfe, but no members of the groom's family.
And while the newlyweds were granted a wide berth from the press following the wedding, at least by modern standards, Time did report that "reporters were waiting when the royal honeymooners reached Wasserloenburg Castle in Austria. The moon was shining as the Duke carried his Duchess over the threshold."
Despite everything hed given up to marry Wallis, the Duke told the BBC in 1970, I have no regrets, I stay interested in my country, Britain, your land and mine. I wish it well.
Although their marriage forced Edward into exile (which explained the move across the English Channel to Paris), Wallis was granted some acceptance from the royal family as the years went on. When Edward died, his funeral was held in England, and she stayed at Buckingham Palace for the event.
Her own funeral in 1986 was held at St. Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle and she is buried alongside her husband in the Royal Burial Ground Cemetery near Windsor.
Looking at the marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla it is sad to note that if the British monarchy had been as liberal minded as they are today back in the 1900s, Edward could probably have kept his crown and had Wallis as his queen. In 1938, when she met Adolf Hitler, even he realized, she would have made a good queen.

GSP+ is linchpin  to exports and job  creation - PM
The European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ECCSL) successfully conducted a seminar titled 'Sri Lanka - The Next Asian Economic Miracle', resetting economic development priorities.
The event was organized in partnership with the Delegation of the European Union (EU) to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
The conference opened with remarks by ECCSL Vice President Arnold Perera who spoke on Sri Lankas potential to become the next Asian economic miracle. Commenting on the work done by the Chamber, Perera mentioned efforts made by the ECCSL to upgrade Sri Lankas OECD country risk classifications which were downgraded in 2009.
He said that the ECCL had also made an effort to promote public-private partnership (PPP) initiatives through the European Investment Bank (EIB) which had expressed interest in working with the local private sector.
In his remarks, EU Ambassador Tung Lai-Margue said, Sri Lanka was readmitted to the GSP+ scheme in May this year. This has the potential to significantly boost Sri Lankas exports to the EU. In addition to GSP+, the EU is also funding a series of activities under its EUR 8 million Trade-related Assistance Project, which includes the development of a National Export Strategy for Sri Lanka. In order for Sri Lanka to maximize the benefits of GSP+, it needs to diversity its exports within existing sectors as well as to entirely new and non-traditional markets in the EU.
The Chief Guest, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, stressed the importance of having a business-friendly environment for exporters and went on to say that there would be a new policy statement in the 2018 budget to stimulate the private sector engagement in the economy.
He went on to say that the government would enact a new Foreign Exchange Bill and highlighted the importance of enhancing productivity, competitiveness and maintaining a dialogue between the private and banking sectors to ensure funding.
Ministers Malik Samarawickrema and Mangala Samarweera also graced the occasion and spoke on the governments economic development efforts.
Minister Samrawickrema said that he would consider facilitating a trade adjustment package to local industrialists to upgrade machinery and introduce modern technology so that companies could be more competitive.
Minister Samaraweera said government is committed to providing a stable policy regime with a simpler, clear and more transparent tax policy to attract investment climate.
The event was well attended by ambassadors and diplomatic staff from EU Delegation office and the missions of Germany, France, Slovania, UK, USA, and the Netherlands, senior government officials, researchers and corporate executives.
Orion City was the main sponsor of the event while Coats and Walkers CML were the Gold and Silver sponsors respectively.

He served beyond the call of duty
The village of Kumarakatuwa in Chilaw lies almost 20km away from a main city. It is over 300km from Jaffna. But it is in Jaffna, that Sub Inspector (SI) Dhamhewage Sarath Hemachandra (51) of Kumarakattuwa spent most of his time during the last two years. For the last 15 years, he worked as the Security Officer of Jaffna High Court Judge, Illancheliyan Manikavasagar (54).
On Saturday (22), SI Hemachandra was killed by Selvarasa Jayandan (39), when the former tried to intervene in an argument the latter was having with his relatives. While the police have claimed that the attack was not pre-planned, Judge Illancheliyan maintains that the attack was targeted at him. Hemachandra, as far as he is concerned - is a hero.
Hemachandra who joined the police force on November 22, 1986, lived his whole life in the same house in Kumarakattuwa, as his parents. On Thursday (26), his final rites were performed within the very same half painted walls of the house, complete with a high tin roof and a wooden partition to separate a small hall into a living room and kitchen.
His father was a World War II veteran and his younger brother had retired from the Army after the usual time of service. His wife too was a police constable, she left her job soon after their first child was born. They have two children; a daughter of 16 and son aged 11.
IGP Pujith Jayasundera has offered, Hemachandras wife; Kumudu her old job back to which she responded in a favourable manner. She is to work at a police station close to home.
Joins the Force
We met in Grade 6 at the Kumararatna Vidyalaya and have been friends ever since, said Lionel Wickramasinghe as he stood up to speak at the funeral of SI Hemachandra.
The Vidyalaya, just over two kilometres from his home, was a central part of Hemachandras life and even after he failed his A/L exams, Hemachandra and Wickramasinghe would return to school to teach at its Sunday school.
We did not have electricity then and we used to meet in his home to study under the kerosene lamp, recalled Wickramasinghe further.
In 1986, as family economic conditions worsened, both Wickramasinghe and Hemchandra decided to join the Police Force.
On November 22, 1986 we were chosen to the Force and sent to the training school in Kalutara for training. During that time, the war was raging and our batch of 31 was turned into a separate division and sent in for military training, said Wickramasinghe.
Hemchandra and his batch mates were one of the first police officers to be given military training as frequent LTTE attacks of police stations and the worsening security situation in the country meant that the police too had to gear themselves to fight the war.
In 1987, we were sent to the Kahatagasdigiliya Police station in Anuradhapura, we worked there for 10 years, said Wickramasinghe.
As the war raged, the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) entered Sri Lanka in 1987 and as they prepared to leave, defeated in 1990, it was Hemachandra and his batch of militarily trained police that were sent to keep the peace in the North and East.
We took over the Trincomalee Police station in 1991, after the IPKF left and together we worked for five years there. Thereafter, we were transferred to Wellawatte, said Wickramasinghe.
After Wellawatte, Wickramasinghe and Hemachandra would part ways. The former soon opting for early retirement while the latter choosing to serve in the Judges Security division.
Though we parted ways, every year we would meet on November 22 at one of the houses of our batch mates to celebrate the date we all joined the force, said Wickramasinghe. Last year however, neither Hemachandra nor Wickramasinghe made it to the annual get together due to work commitments.
An unlikely friendship
The better part of the last 15 years, Hemachandra spent in the service of Judge Illancheliyan; as his Police Sergeant. As the judge progressed in his career, Hemachandra followed, all the way to the High Court of Jaffna.
He joined my service when I was in Vavuniya, at the height of the war, recalled Judge Illancheliyan,
He safeguarded my life for six years there. Then I was transferred to Trincomalee for two years and he followed me there. Then to Colombo for six months, then Kalmunai, Trinco and when I was appointed as the permanent High Court judge of Kalmunai, he came there too. Then for the last two years we have been in Jaffna. For the last 15 years, he stayed with me in my bungalow, not in the Police barracks. Even during the nights, sometimes until 12am, when I used to work in my office, writing judgements, he would be sitting outside the door and would only go to sleep after I switched off my lights, said the Judge sitting on the Veranda of Hemachandras house.
Despite such extraordinary service however, Hemachandras promotion only came after his death and for most of his career, he earned a salary close to Rs 30,000 per month.
At Kumarakattuwa, the Judge was accompanied by almost all members of the Judiciary in the North; judges, magistrates, court staff and lawyers from the North sat in the scorching heat of Chilaw to pay their last respects to Hemachandra.
He was an exceptional man, he talked less and acted more. He always thought of my security and would not allow anyone to talk to me without my permission, but he never tried to control any Tamil people or talk to anyone outside of his official duty. He was a gentleman and trusted lieutenant, who has given his life to protect mine, said Judge Illancheliyan.
Even my food was checked by him and I would always follow his professional advice; if he tells me, dont go to that area, there is trouble there, I wouldnt go, he added.
Just being humane
The death of his security officer had cut the High Court Judge deeply and as videos of him apologising in tears to Hemanchandras wife for the latters death went viral over the media, Judge Illancheliyan said to perceive his emotions within a racial prism was being limited in perspective.
This is not a racial issue, this is what you call humanity. Racism has destroyed our humanity for so long. In my case, it is true that I am a Tamil Judge, but Hemachandra protected me not only in peacetime but also during the war. We were not thinking in terms of Tamil or Sinhala here, he said.
His respect for the slain policeman has overflowed into all aspects of Jaffna society with students of the University of Jaffna too choosing to light candles in honour of Hemachandra.
For the first time in the history of Jaffna, banners have gone up for a man in Khakki uniform, said Judge Illancheliyan.
When asked if this what true reconciliation looked like The judge was quick to respond, I dont know about that, I dont know about the politics of that.
The High Court Judge speaking to Hemachandras family also promised to look after his two kids and treat them as his own and to do his best to provide them with a good education.
Those we trust are our closest kin
It is not often that the villagers of Kumarakattuwa see people from the North and East visit their homes and their presence at Hemachandras funeral was a welcome surprise to all.
Most people here are those who worked with him. These people have come from so far, this alone speaks of the character and work of Hemachandra, said Ariyadasa, his neighbour.
These differences people tell us about the North and South are lies. These people have left their work and travelled all the way to pay their respects to Sarath Hemachandra, it seems that the he was able to bring the North and South together, he added.
Delivering an anusasana at the funeral, the Chief Incumbent of the village temple said that out of birth, life and death, it is life that is the most important point in a mans life.
I believe that Sarath Premachandra fully appreciated and used his life for a good purpose, the priest said, adding that Hemachandra did not confine himself and instead went over and beyond in performing his duties as a Policeman.
While saying that many people would attempt to obtain transfers back to their home towns, the priest pointed out that Hemachandra instead was willing to perform his duties in any part of the island in the toughest of circumstances.
This was another instance where he utilised his opportunity at life, he said.
Meanwhile, speaking about the close friendship between the Judge and Hemachandra, the priest said that their bond has once again proved that any loyal and trustworthy person is ones relation or kin and not just ones caste, creed or religion. It is his loyalty that has evoked so much of emotion on the part of the Judge, the priest said adding that this showed the calibre of man, Hemachandra was.

A healing touch for lasting wellness
Inspired by the power of essential oils as a form of natural healing, and alternative therapies helping people stay well in every aspect of life continues to drive the Kemara ethos.
Established nearly two decades ago to enhance lives through holistic wellness, Kemaras founder Kishani Gunawardenas deep-seated dedication to promote health and well-being continues to manifest. Kishani says. Wellness has become an integral part of lifestyle; Kemara goes beyond the ordinary, ensuring positive and lasting benefits using everything natural.
Successfully promoting the powerful benefits, aromatic qualities and tropical applications of essential oils, Kemaras essential oil range is based on a comprehensive wellness philosophy. We use essential oils for a wide range of emotional and physical wellness applications. They can be used as single essential oils or in complex blends depending on the desired benefit, she noted.
Emphasising the choice of oils is important as it can vary for each person, Kishani explained, The choice of oils for stress, fatigue, work related issues would be oil of basil, rosemary, lavender and bergamot. Apart from helping you to relax these oils help you to focus and enables clarity.
For depression we use frankincense oil, which has amazing anti-depressing properties helping to deeply calm the person and open up the lungs. For an uplifting aroma, citrus orange and mandarin oils are ideal. For anxiety, oils such as ylang ylang and sandalwood are suitable. Apart from emotional wellbeing we also use oils for physical ailments such as a cough and cold where oils help decongestion, she added.
A common thread that echoes in all Kemaras therapies is to inculcate holistic wellness in mind, body, and spirit. Thus, Kemaras Wellness Center is positioned as a destination that inspires healthy lifestyles. When a client comes in, even though we have a menu, we never do a treatment without a consultation  we take into account their diet, exercise programme and day to day activities which gives us an idea of their lifestyle, Kishani noted.
While consumers today are better-educated and more aware, many still think a spa is a luxury. But I want people to understand that holistic therapies have amazing powers and their highest purpose is the prevention of illness rather than treating symptoms. Please dont wait till you fall ill, she added.

Hilarious Stand up Comedy at the Hilton!
The Thomian Society is gearing up for another of their famed Dinner Theatre events this Sunday but this time with a twist! They will host the first FREDDY Stands Up show directed by Ferose Kamardean featuring a stand up comedy from 4 distinguished performers - Dominic Kellar, of Pusswedilla fame, Gehan Blok, Dino Corera and DamindaWijayaratne.
This Stand up comedy show promises a fun-filled evening of laughter. In fact, all four performers have a common bond in that they were all part of the hugely popular Pusswedilla Plays.
While Dominic played the title character of the lovable dictator, His Glorious Honourable Excellency ChamindaPusswedilla, Gehan Blok played the constantly outsmarted journalist, Robert Westernthinking. Dino Corera portrayed the envoy of the the British Government, Lord Bryce Pontlewhaite while DamindaWijayaratne played the grovelling street-smart Minister, Honorable Sweetie Bolay.
With all the cast having become famous in political comedy, FREDDY Stands up also takes a political twist with each of the performers discussing life in Sri Lanka in the light of political humour. From the garbage crisis to the GMOA, to the second anniversary of the National Unity Government, to the prospect of a burger President, FREDDY STANDS UP promises to be to great evening of entertainment.
Speaking to this newspaper, FREDDY said the boys have been very hard at work and finding solutions to some of these problems has been challenging, but we seem to have figured out most of them. In addition to the political issues, we are also trying to find answers for the following:
What is Colombo's fascination with the Hi Magazine
Why is S. Thomas' College not spelt St. Thomas' College
Why do most Australians talk in questions
What is etched in our Sri Lankan DNA
What's the best place to get a boat to go to Australia
further, freddy cautioned people coming for the show, saying : this show is for adults only. this show contains language & situations that some people might consider offensive.
recording of this show by any means, audio or visual is strictly prohibited.
All Children should be left at home under the care of a responsible adult. Should any children be smuggled into the venue, it is quite possible that they may get an accelerated course in profanity. I strongly recommend that Adults pay due attention to the fact that I have previously stated that this show is for Adults Only.
FREDDY STANDS UP! Stand-up comedy show comes up on stage at the Colombo Hilton this Sunday, 30th July. Tickets, naturally, selling like hot cakes! For more information call Monisha on 112 574083.

How Do You Park Your Car
I do believe, all our driving skills are seen, not in the speed we drive, not with our ease of overtaking, our dexterity of working our way through traffic jams, but with how you and I park our cars.
My wife and daughters grumble theres no need for me to look from my window as they bring their cars in to park or take them out. Plan your parking! I tell them, and slowly but surely, Ive seen a change.
Yes, plan your parking in your mind. Unlike speeding and overtaking where again split-second planning is also required,here you have a little more time when you park, and planning your movement, going forward or back, how much forward, and how close to the kerb helps.
Let me hasten to assure you that Ive had my awkward moments: I remember once driving from one city to another, entering my colony, then reversing my car directly onto my neighbours car!
The same ones who had accompanied me, and who had been amazed at my driving skills during the drive, now looked at each other, then looked up and crossed themselves, thanking their lucky stars theyd arrived safe!
I had driven all the way using good reflexes, but in parking, hadnt done my planning.
Thats so true of life, isnt it Without a plan, we can destroy everything in a moment or become the laughing stock of those around.
I remember a friend of mine and I once walking to his car, parked in a very crowded car park near a market area. The car was in the middle of a number of parked cars. We looked at the parking attendant helplessly and he pointed to a woman in a tucked up, matter of fact sari, who came towards us, took the key from my friends questioning hands and then, with a dexterity that was beyond our comprehension, pushed, nudged, reversed and moved forward his car, with a skill wed never seen ever before or seen ever since.
How did you do it I asked amazed and watched as she smiled and pointed to her head.
Yes, she had done it with her mind.
But let us move from the parking lot to life. Without planning what we are going to do. How we are going to do anything, you and I can land ourselves in big trouble.
Planning isnt a waste of time. It may appear so as you stand and look at the situation in front of you, but in the end, as you succeed, as you park yourself in life into a unique position, its good planning that worked.Also remember theres a Master Planner up there who can help you on your drawing board.
Meanwhile start with your car, plan your parking, as I look out of my window and watch..!

Huge wall of Christ Church Girls College collapses
Due to uprooting of trees when clearing of mountainous areas for three storied school building:
A highly precipitous area having a protective wall of great height had been cleared using heavy machinery for the construction of a three storied school building.
As a result, a huge land area comprising boulders and rocks and the age-old protective wall constructed over the edge of the precipitous mountain in close proximity to the school building collapsed posing great dangers.
The motorable road to the Christ Church College had been closed due the risky location.
There are several residential houses in addition to water pumping tanks adjoining the damaged area of the Christ Church mountain. Cracks could be seen in the remaining part of the road leading to the church. Huge boulders, rocks and soil are visible at the location. Rev. Father Palitha who is residing in the Church, said the engineers attached to the Building Construction section of the Galle Education Office and private contractors who had undertaken the construction of the school building, should be held responsible due to their utter negligence and inefficiency in clearing the mountainous terrain.

JVP slams Hambantota Port lease agreement
The agreement approved by the Cabinet to lease out the Hambantota Port to China, came under fire by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka.
He said the harbour is being constructed at a cost of US $ 1,380 million and the government is going to alienate it for 99 years to a Chinese company for US $ 1,400 million along with its services and businesses.
According to the agreement, the company, Chinese Merchant, is also to receive an extra 1,150 hectares of land adjoining the harbour which is in excess of the 400 acres on which it is located, Dissanayaka said at a press conference at the JVP Headquarters.
They do not seem to have included in their agreement the estimates as regards the value of land in total, he said.
The construction of the Hambantota Harbour has cost the country US$ 1,380 million. Four years have gone by since the completion of the project. If one is going to construct a harbour in the present day, the cost would involve an extra 20 percent, he pointed out.
Therefore, he said, the government has apparently made an attempt to sell a valuable public asset in the country for a song as with this agreement.

Lankan writers invitation to literary conference revoked
Sri Lankan writer, poet and activist, Sharmila Seyyids invitation to the Tamil Literature Conference has been revoked in opposition to her talk on the prevalence of Female Genital Mutilation among the Sri Lankan Muslim community.
Seyyid speaking to Daily News said that the organizers had initially invited her to speak on the subject on 30 July and later cancelled it following opposition from the Muslim men in the organizing committee.
The Conference which was initially started as an endeavour by the Sri Lankan Tamil speaking Diaspora in 1989, is the biggest meetup for Tamil language writers and poets. For the last two years, the event which was usually held in a European country or Canada, has been held in Sri Lanka.
In 2015, they held in Batticaloa, last year it was in Jaffna. So this year they wanted to bring it to the Hill country Tamils and it was to be held in Nuwara Eliya, Seyyid said.
Despite the Muslim organizers reluctance to deal with the subject, Seyyid believes that FGM is very much prevalent in the country and that it is usually done when the girl child is around 40 days old. Her research conducted in Muslim communities in Mawanella, Akurana, Batticaloa, Ampara, Trincomalee and Puttalam show that the practice still continues to this day.
In Sri Lanka, FGM involves making a tiny incision on some part of the females genital area, explained Seyyid,
They believe the practice is a ritual purification and a symbolic act to integrate the baby into the community, she added and has no basis in Islam.
According to the World Health Organization, FGM can have serious health impacts on the girl child later on in life and is an extreme form of discrimination against women.
When carried out on a young child, it is a violation of a childs right to health, security and physical integrity.
It is more often than not, carried out in secret. At times, the father would not know that such a thing has been done to his daughter, said Seyyid as she explained that given the lack of knowledge on the procedure and its secretive nature, many who objected to it, often did not know whom to complain to in order to stop it.
