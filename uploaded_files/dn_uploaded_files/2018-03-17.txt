Ban on portable electricity generators in fishing boats
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has decided to impose a ban on carrying portable electricity generators in fishing boats.
The decision was taken after considering the findings of a research conducted by the Ministry, which revealed some negative impacts on certain fishing gear due to the use of electricity generations in non-electric traditional boats, one-day boats, etc. During a meeting held recently at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera instructed Ministry officials to take necessary measures to add new regulations to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 2 of 1996 in order to ban the use of portable electricity generators on boats for night fishing.

CEB, LECO get together to encourage solar energy usage
Measures have been taken to encourage the use of solar energy to prevent environmental pollution and meet the high end electricity needs of the general public.
The CEB and the LECO along with the approval of the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, the solar service providers have implemented a system to export the excessively generated solar electricity from the domestic solar users to the National Grid.
In return, the CEB/LECO will pay the domestic user for the number of units contributed to the national grid by paying Rs.22.00 per unit for the first seven years and Rs.15.50 for eight to 20 years.
The payment arrangement is applied for Net Accounting and Net Plus solar scheme users. Another plus point for the solar energy consumer is that they do not have to pay electricity bills unless their consumption is more that the solar energy generated at their own rooftop. This helps the electricity consumers to reduce their bills up to 0.00 and benefit with unlimited electricity usage.
Highly effective areas for solar energy generation and usage have been reported from Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Vavuniya, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Mannar, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Colombo, Batticaloa and Ampara
We should give more attention to sustainable energy. The Battle for Solar Energy (Soorya Bala Sangramaya) is environment friendly. We should use the solar energy with a sustainable power existence plan and need to develop and provide more infrastructures for the same. I am using solar power to obtain electricity at my home. We should make the best use of the constantly shining sun in areas such as Anuradhapura, North Central Provincial Council Chief Secretary Anoma Manel stated
"We are happy to mention that a total of 100MW electricity generated in excess from solar system have been exported to the national grid after catering the domestic needs of the solar system owners within one year. Our expectation is to cover all parts of the country with solar electricity by installing roof-top solar system on every building in the island. We are confident that this is an achievable and result oriented target which is not too far in seeing ahead," Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
We sincerely support the Srilankan Government hand in hand with Sunleaf Solar Solutions (Pvt) Ltd that is the sole distributor of UKSOL panels in this island, to fulfil the Governments objective of generating solar electricity for the capacity of 200MW in 2020 and achieve the target of 1000MW electricity generation by 2025," Andrew Moore, the Founder and CEO of UKSOL Limited. the solar panel producer from Great Britain said.

CENORA executive members receive appointment letters
Centre of Ocean Resources Analysis Sri Lanka (CENORA-SL) executive members received their appointments from Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi on March 14. Accordingly, retired Commander Fazal Mohammad was appointed CENORA Director-Chairman, while Ayesh Ranawaka was appointed Executive Director.
The concept of Blue Economy reached its pinnacle point of recognition during the past few years, when it was named as the 14th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations Development Programme. As a result, it saw its inclusion in Sri Lankas 2017-2018 national budget, which was dubbed the Blue-Green Economy Plan for the fiscal year.
The concept of Blue Economy naturally encompasses its agenda in it. Since 2016, the Fisheries and Aquatic Research Development Ministry had spent an immense amount of resources, both internal and external, for the said programme, which is the brainchild of State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi.
As a result, the decision to establish a Blue Economy-oriented think tank, was approved by Cabinet earlier this year and thus, CENROA was established. The center would bring together stakeholders from various avenues of life, thus giving it the opportunity of tackling various ocean-based opportunities such as extraction of non-living resources, harvesting of living resources, goods and passenger transport and maritime security and marine environment protection, with its primary goal of creating innovation through the creation of job opportunities in the local market.

Disappearance of 11 youth: aear admiral directed to assist cid
Colombo Fort Magistrate Court yesterday issued an order directing the Navy Commander that Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge be referred to the CID to record a statement regarding the investigations into the disappearance of 11 youth in Colombo.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order pursuant to a request made by CID through a motion.
Filing a motion in court, the CID complained that Rear Admiral Guruge had disregarded court orders, even though he was noticed to appear before the CID to make a statement regarding the incident.
At a previous occasion, the Magistrate rejected a request made by the defence that investigations pertaining to former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and nine others be transferred from the CID to any other police station. In this case, former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and nine others are accused of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009.

Dispelling myths
Sri Lanka has a very high literacy rate that is on par with that of the developed world. But this has not prevented the people from accepting many downright myths and falsehoods en masse without any questioning.
This was certainly the case with the recent incidents in Ampara, where it was alleged that a trader had mixed sterilization pills in the Kottu Roti served at his establishment. This led to clashes that targeted the traders community. Now the Sri Lankan medical community has come forward to firmly deny that there could be a contraceptive pill that can cause infertility or sub fertility by simply being added to food. Moreover, the Government Analyst has conclusively proved that the pill in question was just a particle or clump of starch.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Medical Association Auditorium, a group of independent senior medical specialists said there are no known sterilization pills in the pharmaceutical sector known to the medical profession that can cause permanent infertility. This was a welcome declaration, because these lies have a habit of persisting despite repeated assurances to the contrary. If indeed such a pill existed, there would be no need for expensive surgical procedures to seek male infertility. Even the womens contraceptive pills are not sterilization pills at all  they just change the hormonal and menstrual patterns. There are no such pills for men in any case. The doctors also dispelled another myth  that underwear infused with certain chemicals could cause infertility in both sexes. Common sense dictates that this is an outright impossibility.
We take our hats off to this group of professionals who voluntary came forward to dispel a few myths that could create rifts among the different communities. More professionals should come forward to debunk myths and superstitions that exist in society, from astrology to occultism. The media should give wide publicity to such myth-busting programmes.
With the Government lifting the temporary blockage on Facebook, one must remember that most of these lies originate on social networks. One recent example was the fake news on plastic rice which alleged that rice was being made from plastic. It was later shown that this was a complete canard. There is simply no point in making rice from plastic, as rice is cultivated on a massive scale around the world, with plenty of excess stocks. The next time you see something hard to believe on the Net, question whether it is possible at all. A little more logic and reasoning will help avoid a lot of unnecessary problems.
A Beautiful Mind
There will be a gaping black hole in the scientific world with the demise of Prof. Stephen Hawking at the age of 76. Hawking, an astrophysicist and scientist who defied a debilitating disease (ALS - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) for nearly 55 years to fill our minds with knowledge and awe, will forever be remembered for his pioneering work on the origins of the Universe.
Hawking built upon the legacy of the one man on Earth he has been compared with  Albert Einstein, whose General Theory of Relativity tried to explain the concepts of space and time. Hawking wanted to go further, to bring a Grand Unified Theory that would explain everything about our universe. Speaking through a voice synthesizer linked to a specially built computer, Hawking travelled the world enthralling audiences with his theories on the universe.
In fact, no other scientist had so successfully taken science to the masses, to the point where Stephen Hawking is a household word all over the world. He used television effectively  making guest appearances on everything from Star Trek to The Simpsons. His bestselling book A Brief History of Time written for the layman was well received, having a 10 million copy print run. He helmed several major documentaries as well. Since then, scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson have followed suit.
Hawking used his popularity and clout to raise concern about various issues. He recently argued that mankind should intensify the search for other habitable planets, lest the Earth become uninhabitable due to climate change, warfare, asteroid impact or a killer virus. Spreading out into space will completely change the future of humanity. It may also determine whether we have any future at all, he once said. He was also worried about the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which he said could one day threaten the very existence of humanity. He feared that self-replicating AI beings could wipe out humans.
Hawking was keen to find evidence of life out there in the universe, but admitted that he did not particularly relish contact with any advanced alien civilization that may pose a threat to humanity. That did not prevent him from boosting efforts at finding alien life through the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) initiative.
Hawking was an inspiration to us all in so many ways. He conquered a major disability to become a powerful voice for science and reason and made science accessible to the ordinary masses. Hopefully, the work he started will go on in research labs everywhere, honouring a great man who had unraveled many mysteries of our universe.

Five balls that shook the cricketing world
Sean Abbott once again came into spotlight, not because of his wickets, certainly not because of his batting but because of a bouncer which struck the batsman right on the helmet.
This time Australian cricketer Will Pucovski was at the receiving end.
The incident happened in a Sheffield shield match between Victoria and New South Wales at Melbourne's Junction Oval. The incident happened in the 19th over of Victoria's second innings when Pucovski got hit on his helmet while trying to duck Abbott's bouncer. Abbott rushed to the aid of Pucovski who was treated for a concussion and withdrawn from the remainder of the match.
This is not a first time when something like this has ever happened. Instances like this have been occurring on and off the field since the birth of cricket. Earlier, such occurrences were common as protective equipment were uncustomary.
There have been several instances in the past where the outcomes have been more tragic.
Here's the list of 5 such incidents in the history of cricket.

The General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) held its inauguration ceremony of the Masters Degree Programme for the year 2018 today. High Commissioner of India Taranjit Singh Sandhu was the Chief Guest at the function. Delivering the key- note address on India - Sri Lanka Relations for a Shared and Secured Future, he noted that India - Sri Lanka relations are special and unique and standing on its own footing.
The High Commissioner recalled that Sir John Kotelawala was one of the most illustrious and brave sons of Sri Lanka. He noted that it was no coincidence that the motto of KDU was For the Motherland and Forever. The High Commissioner cited the quote that the quality of a university was not measured by the type of students it takes in, but the quality of students it turns out. He complimented the KDU for living up to the expectations of its countrymen.
The High Commissioner further highlighted the importance of higher education and research in the growth of a country. He mentioned that India currently, has the third-largest scientific and technical manpower in the world. India has also become the second largest market for e-learning with more than one-third of the top 1,000 global R&D spenders having their centres in India. Citing the 750 scholarships and 400 ITEC fellowships that India provides Sri Lanka every year, the High Commissioner said that India, as a country, had never believed in keeping its resources to itself. Even while having to confront with its own developmental challenges, India has always believed in sharing what it has.
The High Commissioner reiterated that whether it be the rehabilitation of the KKS Harbour, or setting up of model villages across the country, or helping the farming and fishing communities in the South or extension of emergency ambulance services island-wide, India is proud of the fact that she has been able to write the development partnership stories in Sri Lanka, based on Sri Lankas own priorities and requirements.
This is important considering the strong democratic credentials of both India and Sri Lanka.

A land of giants
And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free..
On our social media or even mainstream, it is not uncommon to find somewhat astounding statements and claims, grossly exaggerating happenings in the country and the doings of our countrymen both of the present and past. This penchant for embellishment is also reflected in common social discourse, even among persons who one may consider better informed and could be expected to be more skeptical. Some things being said by these people are so far from the truth that they amount to untruths.
For the story teller, facts are secondary to the telling, the drama of the tale overriding the demands of objectivity and accuracy. Butthey are not telling fairy tales, but talking about real events and persons here. These are things that with time become history, and like any discipline, dependent on the integrity of the records, for its legitimacy. The reader relies on these narrations to understand the past, to assess the personalities involved, interpret the processes in motion. There is a big difference in saying for instance that one hundred and twenty three died of a plague in the Eastern Province and claiming that five hundred thousand perished from it. The second figure, rounded to a convenient half a million, if true, would have effectively depopulated the sparsely populated Province.
Sri Lanka has got talent, the small country that produces giants or even the mouse that roared is the obvious message that we come across often in these stories. Over-emphasis only reflects the inner doubts of the narrator, invariably contradicting the claim. There is no need to paint the lily.
Richest man
The other day I read a piece on late Upali Wjewardena, the controversial business tycoon killed in an air crash about 35 years ago. It was not a simple accident, there was a deep conspiracy behind his death suggests the writer, describing Wijewardena as Sri Lankas wonder boy destined to become the richest man in the world, had not dark forces brought about his tragic end.
When the accident occurred, somewhere over the East Asian seas, Upali Wijewardena was flying on an executive Learjet, the preferred mode of travel for the ultra- rich then. I am not certain whether the airplane belonged to Wijewardena or whether it was on charter, the kind of detail that professional business writers would explore. It is immaterial for our purpose; with his riches he was able to do either and much more.
Wijewardena hailed from what is commonly referred to as privileged family background in this country. After a short stint at the local office of a British Multinational he moved out on his own to the world of business; confectionaries, radios, assembling of cars, newspapers among other things. Not wanting to remain a big fish in a small pond, Wijewardena was one of the earliest local businessmen to venture into other countries, Malaysia, Indonesia and so on. These were the days of rigid exchange control and such a move was virtually unthinkable to the average entrepreneur. Wijewardena was well connected, belonging to the same clan as JR Jayewardene by birth and by marriage to the then Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike.
There is no doubt Upali Wijeardena was a maverick and an intrepid businessman, but could he have ended up as the richest man in the world At the time of his death he was not the richest man in Malaysia or even Indonesia, maybe not even among the first ten in those countries. In the context of our reality, calling someone rich is one thing, but even to suggest that he would have ended up the richest man in the world is surely taking enormous liberties with the writers license. We are in the realm of a fairyland where there is no distinction between fact and fiction, possibility and fantasy; it is only the telling that matters, the truth can be just papered over. By such writing, the reader is being given a distorted view of the world of business and relative financial strengths, but a view perhaps in harmony with his own narrow mindset. There is no effort to explore the massive gap between a Dollar Millionaire and a Dollar Billionaire. Imbalances caused by valuations made in a weak currency when translated into a hard currency are just ignored. How much of his wealth is net, minus the credit the local banks had so obligingly extended The reader is placed on the same chair the child sat reading Grimms Fairy tales. To question the story is to deny one the thrill of the fairytale. Economically, geographically, even racially, Upalis prospect of becoming the richest man in the world was well-nigh impossible. Even with all the economic advances made in the developing world since the 1980s, they have none in the top 10 richest in the world today, and this includes China and India.
Strongest Army
According to some writers we also have (had) the worlds best army commander (and the army), who by a trick of fate was pitted against the most ferocious terrorist group in the world (LTTE). In military matters having a distorted assessment of ones strengths is dangerous, even fatal. It is an area of human activity where you need the coolest and the most objective minds. On the other hand, overestimating the prowess of the enemy, is not as potentially harmful as overestimating ones strength, but perhaps indicates a fearful attitude and a dramatic mindset.
It was only natural that the ending (in 2009) of the long drawn out war against terrorism (more than 30 years) was joyfully celebrated by a long suffering nation. During these three decades neither combatant gained a decisive victory nor did the various governments that confronted the LTTE offer a solution to the problem. Eventually the LTTE, although outnumbered and outgunned by the government forces, overestimated its strength and decided to fight conventionally, defending the territory it held. The result was their total destruction.
The conduct of wars, their scope and intensity, are a reflection of the fighting abilities and resources of the conflicting nations. We have sports meets at school level, national level, SAARC games, Asian games, Olympics and so on, with vastly differing performance levels. For the participant, any event taken separately, whether it is a school sports meet or the Olympics, the challenges, effort and the eventual triumph are individually special. But if we were to compare them, one against the other, we will see a world of a difference between them. Wars are similar; there are wars and wars.
Historically, those living in the Indian Sub-Continent, by inclination and culture are a people generally conquered by outsiders and not conquerors themselves. Periodically, various groups have only entered the Sub-Continent to conquer, settle and eventually assimilate, the last, being the Moghuls, followed by the European imperial powers.
This does not mean that there were no wars in the Indian Sub-Continent. But they were mainly against each other, long drawn internecine conflicts that went on interminably, neither party strong enough to bring it to an end. I am not certain how a terrorist group is assessed for their ferocity, but if we take casualties as the yardstick, the less than 100,000 inflicted in thirty years of fighting the LTTE (both sides, including the injured) will make our war a low-intensity conflict. In the two World Wars fought in early 20th century, we observed battles where millions died in a matter of months or even weeks. Horrendous casualties suffered in recent civil wars in countries like Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq make our war look like a small skirmish. But the dramatic mindset is unfulfilled. Even today, nearly 10 years after the end of the fighting in 2009, various politicians and military bigwigs impose themselves on a helpless public with huge security details, defensively prepared for a massive attack any moment. There has not been a single terrorist attack since 2009!
Best brains
This adulatory approach is not limited to these categories. We had SWRD Banadarnaike who was referred to as the silver tongued orator of Asia, JR Jayewardene the 20th century fox in reference to his acclaimed cunning, NM Perera the golden brain who was going to lead us to a socialist State, Sirima Bandaranaike leader of two thirds of humanity, many so called specialists whose unique skills can only be described in the superlative and of course, a whole lot of other outstanding benefactors clamouring to serve the people.
Yet, the country is much troubled and remains one of the poorest in Asia. In the corruption index our position worsens, in the ease of doing business (including government run services) the situation deteriorates daily. You need more than 150 rupees to buy one dollar today. Every institution in the country has been sullied and diminished.
Does a laudatory reference by a third party, unsubstantiated and loosely made, change an obvious truth If a country claims so many exceptional personalities, especially in public life, could it be so bad As so plainly stated in the Bible, there can be no freedom where the truth is not known. Maybe we can put the question another way; does freedom have any meaning to a people so indifferent about the truth, or unable even to grasp the difference between substance and puff
A friend of mine uses a certain three wheeler regularly and in the course of time has come to know the driver well. The man has no sense of traffic rules and will overtake from the wrong side, take drastic U-turns, squeeze his way forward through the slow moving traffic (jumping the queue, a national trait) and horn incessantly (noise is good, another national trait!)
My friend finds him useful when he has to get to a place in a hurry. Otherwise, safety concerns compel him to limit the use of the three wheeler for short errands only. I have met the driver; thirtyish, though sporting an incipient paunch, thin in a wiry way; ingratiating smile, a man living on his wits.
He is also superstitious and given to rituals, about which he talks excitedly and with assurance. Around his wrist and neck are several talismans and lucky charms, for protection, as he explains. On certain days bathing is to be avoided.
His usual hangout is near a big hotel in Colombo where tourists looking for city tours can be found. This way the man has picked up some English, which is liberally interspersed in his conversation.
One day my friend said to him patronizingly, I say, you speak very good English.
The man wanted to explain what he took to be the truth; perhaps he has a natural skill for languages.
I took a Sudu Mahathmaya around the city the other day. He said I speak better English than even him!
A white tourist, enervated by the press of Colombos heat and noise, humours the earnest three wheel driver, little realizing that a whole universe could be built on those words.

Lankan baby elephants, cynosure at Nagoya Higashiyama Zoo
Four Kangaroo cubs were presented to the Dehiwela Zoo by the Higashiyama Zoo in Nagoya, Japan, yesterday.
<U+200B><U+200B>The Director of the Dehiwela National Zoological Gardens Dammika Malsinghe, said the Kangaroo cubs are kept at the Ridiyagama safari park for safety.
A black Rhinoceros cub was born at the Dehiwela Zoo in 2013 and named 'Mihiri.' The parents of the cubs were presented under an animal exchange programme from Japan, in 2007, for which, Sri Lanka presented Japan two elephants. The pair of rhino cubs was therefore called Anula and Kosala.
The <U+200B><U+200B>Director of the Higashiyama Zoo Masami Kurome, said the female elephant delivered a baby elephant on 2014. The baby elephant had been the first Asian elephant to be born at the Higashiyama Zoo and the third Asian elephant to be born in Japan.
Anula and Kosala were brought to the Higashiyama Zoo in 2007 from the Dehiwela Zoo. The birth and growth of the new baby elephant at the beginning of the New Year was symbolic of the growth of the longstanding friendship between Sri Lanka and Japan, he added.
He further said that according to Zoo authorities, the most popular attraction at the Zoo were the Sri Lankan elephants.
The Assistant Director of the Ridiyagama Safari Park Hemantha Samarasekara said that they provide quarantine facilities, regular care and regular veterinary care for the Kangaroo cubs.<U+200B><U+200B>

Names of members elected to 10 LG bodies published
Names of members elected to Local Government bodies in 10 districts have been published by the Department of Government Printing.
The names published through Extraordinary Gazette No. 2061/42-9 on March 9 2018 under the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance (Chapter 262), gives details for the districts of; Hambantota, Killinochchi, Matara, Puttalam, Moneragala, Anuradhapura, Ratnapura, Kaluthara, Matale and Polonnaruwa.
Elections Secretariat sources revealed that they have forwarded all names to the Department of Government Printing and that they would publish them in due course.
The Department needs to publish the names to 15 more districts.
The Local Government elections which were held on February 10 had 340 Local Bodies electing members to the councils.
The gazetting of names however had been delayed due to 15 councils not being able to fulfil the 25 percent female quota in these bodies.
The Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) however has pointed out that political parties and independent groups have appointed close to 1,991 women to office making the overall female member percentage 29, in all local bodies across the country.
Political parties fielded 17,128 female candidates as a result of the quota this year.
The Elections Commission has gazetted a list of 2,526 female local Councillors. Of the women who contested wards, 535 were returned. The UNP has appointed the highest number of women from the Additional List, stated CaFFE.
This increase of 29 percent from the previous 1 percent has been seen as an overall improvement in female representation in Local Government and thus has prompted the Elections Commission to go ahead with the gazetting of names to the 15 problematic councils even without their quota being fulfilled.

Nepal captain delights in massive ODI status
HARARE, Thursday - Nepal skipper Paras Khadka hailed his amazing team after they secured one-day international status for the first time with a six-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea in Harare on Thursday.
The Asian side were in the World Cricket League Division Five as recently as 2010, while their cricket association has been suspended by the ICC since 2016, although the ban doesnt affect on-field matters.
Only a thrilling one-wicket win off the final ball over Canada even got Nepal to the World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe, where they followed up Mondays win over Hong Kong by beating Papua New Guinea in a play-off to become crickets newest ODI side.
Its massive, its something we have worked towards for a very long time, said Khadka.
As a team weve been pushing ourselves. Were very glad that were winning games through different situations, players are standing up and everyones contributing.
As a captain Im happy to lead such an amazing bunch of boys.
Nepals fanbase has grown back home in recent years, with attendances for matches reported to have reached 20,000.
Former Australia captain Michael Clarke and Pakistan greats Inzamam ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed were among those to congratulate Khadkas side on Twitter.
Congratulations to Nepal on getting the ODI status, wrote Mushtaq. Way to go lads. A historic day for your country.
Nepal bowled out their opponents for only 114 and chased down the small target with 27 overs to spare.
Dipendra Singh Airee and teenage leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane both took four wickets, before Airee hit an unbeaten 50 to ensure that Nepal would become an ODI team until at least 2022, with Papua New Guinea losing their elite status.
A big proud day for all the people of Nepal, Lamichhane, who was the first Nepalese to be signed for the Indian Premier League earlier this year, wrote on Twitter. What a beautiful journey so far. Together its Possible. Nepal - An ODI Nation!The other play-off game saw Hong Kong lose their ODI place after a defeat by the Netherlands.  AFP

Alleged financial fraud over MiG deal :
Open warrent for Udayanga
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday issued an open warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
This is in connection over the financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF).
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order pursuant to a request made by FCID citing that he is continuously evading courts.
The FCID conducting investigations into MiG aircraft transaction had named Udayanga Weeratunga as a suspect in the case through a B report filed in the Fort Magistrates Court.
The Court was informed through FCID that INTERPOL had issued a Red Warrant on Udayanga Weeratunga, naming him as a fugitive wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities.
The FCID had informed Court that Udayanga Weeratunga had directly intervened into the questionable transaction in procuring MiG-27 ground attack crafts. The FCID said the deal amounted to US$14 million.
On June 9, 2016 the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued notices on Udayanga Weeratunga to appear in Court July 15 but he did not turn up. Thereafter, on October 20, 2016 court had issued a warrant for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga.
The FCID had told Court that they were investigating whether the former Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia had invested money in a company called Sri Lankan Limited Liability Company in Moscow, which were earned through the Mig-27 transaction.
Meanwhile, the FCID named foreign nationals and foreign company as suspects regarding this case.
The FCID launched this investigation following a complaint lodged by defence columnist and political writer Iqbal Athas.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price. He told the Police that these ground attack aircraft had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983.
He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine.
Chief Inspector Nihal Francis appeared for the FCID.

President calls for nuclear-free world
Everyone yearns for the elimination of all nuclear weapons and the genuine realization of a nuclear-free world, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made this statement after visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, which had been appealing continuously for the elimination of nuclear armaments and the realization of permanent world peace. On arrival in Hiroshima, he was received by the city's Mayor.
The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, located at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, in central Hiroshima, Japan, is dedicated to documenting the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II on August 6, 1945 at 8.15 am.
At that moment in history, the city of Hiroshima fell victim to the worlds first atomic bombing. The entire city was virtually leveled to the ground.
Thousands of lives were lost in seconds. Many who managed to survive, suffered irreparable physical and psychological damage and still suffer the effects today.
The museum was established in August 1955 along with the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Hall. The Museum collects and displays belongings left behind by victims such as photos and other material that convey the horror of the atomic bomb.
The exhibits describe the situation and effects before and after the nuclear bombings. Also, it presents the current status of the nuclear age.
Each of the items displayed embodies the grief, anger or pain of the people who were victimized. After visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, the President visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and the Atomic Bomb Dome, where the atomic bomb exploded just over 500 metres above the building. The Atomic Bomb Dome is located almost directly underneath the explosion.
It had somehow avoided complete destruction and the remains of the building still stand today. The residents of Hiroshima had decided to keep this tragic reminder of war intact. The site was designated as a World Heritage site in 1996.
President Sirisena also paid a floral tribute to the victims of the atomic bomb attack.

When the case came up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, the defence party sought a further date citing that their counsels have to appear before the Supreme Court regarding a Special Determination petition.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former Economic Development Ministry Secretary Dr. Nihal Jayatilake, former Divi Neguma Department Director General Kithsiri Ranawaka and former Divi Neguma Department Deputy Director General Bandula Tillekasiri in the Colombo High Court for allegedly distributing roofing sheets costing Rs.2991 million in the run up to the January 2015 presidential election.

Social Media: The new front in Media Freedom
As the violence that affected parts of the Kandy District quietly moves into the history of ethno-religious confrontation in the country, society is faced with a new situation and issue of considerable importance that arose from the violence of recent days. It is the issue of handling Social Media, which brings a whole new area of the freedom of expression and the rights of Internet users into the considerations of politics and government.
Sri Lanka has undergone many years of censorship of the media due to left-wing and trade union protests, ethnic and religious confrontations, and the three-decade long war with the separatist LTTE. The voices that were critical of the use of censorship have been many, and since the lifting of the Emergency by the last government, many months after the defeat of the LTTE, the country has seen a prolonged period of free expression.
Under the present government, there has been a major advance with the passage of legislation for the Right to Information. The current government has certainly opened the paths to media freedom, although there have been concerns about the use of this freedom by sections of the media, and management of news and information by the government itself.
Fear of the Censor
But the things did change with the situation in the Kandy District requiring the government to declare a State of Emergency throughout the island. Although this did not see the usual introduction of regular media censorship and a Competent Authority who would pass a copy for publication, the new developments in the Internet and the involvement of Social Media in a very wide role of social, personal and corporate communication, did bring about the banning of social media networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Viber which have presented a new area of media, and involvement of the people in an expanding area of communication.
Many diplomats from western democracies have been strong in their call for these bans to be lifted. The ban has also impacted strongly on local politics, with most political parties, other than those directly associated with the government, calling for the lifting of the ban. Some of the affected networks such as Viber and WhatsApp are already free, and Facebook is due to be free very soon. The protests that have come out, and very loud and effective indeed, have brought to light the importance of an area of the media that was largely unknown to administrators and regulators until the Kandy crisis erupted.
The Government has now declared that laws will soon be introduced to control Social Media. The situation that developed in the Kandy District and the threat of it spreading to other areas too, due to alleged wrong and false reportage and comment in social media networks, certainly points to the need or a good regulatory practice in this regard.
The government also had to face attacks from the JO and other political opponents that its control of social media was due to its own weakness, following the recent defeat in the local government polls. Some comments by the governments own ministers, too, gave an impression that the government had fears of the political impact of social media.
All of this makes the new proposal to impose curbs on social media a matter of considerable interest, with regard to the safeguarding of media freedom, the right to free expression, and the hopes of widening the freedom of expression that the country has seen in the past three years. Measures to genuinely ensure reportage of the truth and fair comment on social media will be most welcome, as well as genuine moves to prevent hate speech on all media, with necessary democratic judicial controls.
Past fears and modern trends
A country that has seen the activity of the Free Media Movement at times when the media was under serious threat, and one with a past (not too far, too) where the killing of and attacks on journalists, and white van dispatches had been the order of the day, it is not surprising that any calls for control of social media could raise many fears and opposition. It is necessary for the government to engage in a wide discussion with the public, media organisations, the journalists on the Internet in this day of blogging, and social media network users and contributors, before such rules and regulations are introduced. The examples of such regulations in the UK and Germany, and any other democracies, as well as the rules in developing countries such as Kenya, require careful study; to ensure that any necessary curbs of social media, in given situations, do not threaten the core principle of freedom of expression in a democracy.
Persons such as the US Ambassador in Colombo who has been very vocal in calling for removal of the ban on social media networks, should not forget or ignore the problem that social media has allegedly caused in the US, seen in allegations of Russian interference in the last Presidential election which brought Donald Trump to the White House in 2016. Congressional inquiries have shown that Facebook, Google, and other organisations had to deal with several millions of what is seen as fake news or communications with special or misleading interest, that were planted on those sites. Facebook, Google, and other institutions have announced their intent to prevent such misuse of their networks. True the US did not impose any ban on social media networks, but it did not have to face a situation of violence, and only election propaganda, which may have benefited the current president (whose attitude to the Third World is highly questionable), and helped defeat the candidate who received the wider majority votes, and was no friend of Sri Lanka. The situation in Sri Lanka is certainly different. We can learn from the US records on Freedom of Expression and the First Amendment to its Constitution. But we also need to look at our own problems, from the point of view of a society that has different thinking on gun ownership and control. Democracies can and will differ, and it is best to encourage such differences, without unreal punditry.
The Provincial Polls
The Government is likely to face much opposition if there are any delays in holding elections to three Provincial Councils - North Central, Eastern, and Sabaragamuwa  which saw their terms end in October last year. The assurance given in Parliament was that these polls would be held by March 31 this year, once the related Delimitation Report was submitted and the necessary recommendations approved by Parliament.
The Delimitation Report has now been submitted to the special Parliamentary Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is scheduled to be taken up for debate on March 21, but it must be passed with a two-thirds majority. If the two-thirds is not available, elections to these three PCs cannot be held. It will be interesting to see if the two-thirds could be obtained, following the divisions in politics after the recent local government polls.
Obtaining two thirds will require the full support of the UNP and SLFP-UPFA within the government, as well as the TNA and JVP, unless the JO decides to give it their own support. This vote will certainly be a good pointer to the developments within parliament after the political shakeup with the local government polls.
The JO and the SLPP with the Pohottuwa will certainly be looking forward to these provincial polls, which they believe could push further their opposition to the government, and the call for a change of government. This will also raise questions about the actual role of the SLFP-UPFA members within the government, and whether they and the leadership of the government really want to be sure of an early poll in these provinces.
The electoral process will also move further with the polls to three more PCs  Central, Northern and North Western  expiring in September this year, and needing a clear acceptance of the necessary amendments to ensure these elections too. The adoption of the necessary amendments, with the least delay, will be necessary for the proper flow of the electoral system in the country, and the need to prevent the public opposition as caused by the major postponement of the Local Government poll, which led to such a bad defeat to the SLFP-UPFA and a lesser defeat to the UNP.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Mustapha will also have to look at amendments to the Local Government polls legislation to overcome the problems it has caused in the proper selection of candidates to all local authorities, after the February 10, election. Many analysts have seen the need for changes to make the local authorities more manageable, with the absence of too many members, as well as the proper assurance of having a 25 percent membership in the local bodies.

Sri Lankan housemaid shot dead in Saudi Arabia
A Sri Lankan housemaid employed in Saudi Arabia reportedly was shot dead by a mentally retarded person in the house where the woman was working.
The woman was Priiynaka Jayasekara, 38 of Abeysundara Watte, Kataburawa in Wanduramba, Galle. On Wednesday, her family was notified of the death of Priyanka over the phone from overseas. The message had stated that the alleged shooter had also committed suicide by shooting
On visit to the victims house in Wanduramba, we came to understand that she was a mother of three daughters. The eldest, Chamila Aspire, (21) is married. The other two are Avishka Hemali, (12) and Nethmi Navodya (8). The eight-year daughter is suffering from a chronic heart ailment.
About 20 years before, she had got married to L.G.Upul (44), who is a labourer at a stone quarry. He is at present incapable to work due to a hand impairment caused while working at the worksite.
A relative daughter of the victim's mother, M.G.Nadeeka Lakmali, who was there at her house when we visited the place said that her (deceased mothers) youngest daughter had a prolonged heart disease and her family had numerous economic hardships which forced Priynaka nenda (aunt) to go overseas to work as a housemaid.
She had gone to Middle East on several occasions earlier. This time she went nine months before. She had not communicated with the family members since her departure. Subsequently, her husband complained to the Foreign Employment Bureau over the situation after failing to contact her through the respective employment agency. Thereafter, she was allowed to talk to the family members once a month with the intervention of the bureau. We urged the authorities to hold a proper inquiry into the incident and facilitate us to bring the body to Sri Lanka, relative daughter said.
Priyankas husband, Upul, who also confirmed that his wife went to Middle East on several instances for employment, said that for the last time she left the country nine months ago.
"Unlike on previous occasions this time my wife did not talk to me for long after she left us. She did not at least send us a letter. So I made a complaint to the Foreign Employment Bureau over the problem as there was no positive response to my similar complaint to the employment agency," Upul said.
"Meanwhile, I got a foreign call demanding me to withdraw my complaint to the bureau.
However, with the kind mediation of the bureau, I got an opportunity to talk to my wife once a month.
During our conversations she never told us about a mentally handicapped person at the house where she worked.
She last talked to me on March 10 and then on March 14, a relative brother informed me about my wifes sudden demise. We did not know what happened.
I earnestly beg the authorities to arrange for the dispatch of her body to the country and make a proper investigation into her death and do the justice for our destitute family.
Deputy Minister of Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara said that immediately after the news of the death of the Priyanka was brought to their notice, the ministry swiftly intervened into the incident.
"We have already detailed a special group of officials to look into the matter and take necessary action to firstly bring her body to the country as soon as possible.
We are also working on a special initiative to probe into the alleged shooting," the Deputy Minister said.

Ven.Thera also urged Sri Lanka Bar Association to extend their support for this Bill.
"A large number of individual in our society who faced with injustice are reluctant to file court cases due to the long period of time the case are pending in court. he said.
An executive member of Jathika Vidwath Sangha Sabha, Ven. Hedigalle Vimalasara Thera said that the proposed amendment to the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978, once enacted into law will enable the Attorney General to directly forward cases to the Special High Court of a three judge bench.

Sweden establishes CryptoCurrency as their official coin
Its finally happened. A major worldwide government has just bestowed a huge vote of confidence and legitimacy onto the world of cryptocurrencies. Sweden, in an unprecedented move, just announced that they are officially adopting a certain cryptocurrency as Swedens official coin!
The Swedish government just informed us that they have chosen a preferred firm for the purchase and marketing of their new coin - Kryptonex Research Group. The sales of Sweden's coin officially started in March 14 of 2018 and currently these coins can be bought only from Kryptonex Research Group.
In fact, Swedens deputy minister of finance, Elias Karlsson, informed us that their new official coin starting price is just 0.30 cents! Thats right, their coin is incredibly inexpensive in comparison to most other coins out there. Bitcoin for example trades at 9,000 at the time of this writing, and Ethereum, trades at around 700.
In fact we were able to get Sir Richard Bronsons thoughts on Swedens new coin and this is what he had to say:
Sir Richard Bronsons states: Anytime a major corporation announces even a small partnership with an individual cryptocurrency that coin's value skyrockets. I can't wait to see what happens when a government officially adopts a crypto. When the name of Sweden's coin is released many people will become millionaires practically overnight.
A few of us at Coindesk were curious enough to buy a couple coins just to see how everything looks and what the trading fees are like.
It was fairly easy to get the coins, but I would like to show the whole process for those who are interested.

Village temples strengthen conmmunal harmony Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who attended the opening of the Gold plated fence, Bodhi Prakaraya and Bell Tower at the Damunupola Sri Anandarama Viharasthanaya in Kegalle recently, observed the need to strengthen the village temple to ensure communal harmony.
Thanking Jagath Karunaratne and his family for their generous donations for the temple, he stated that he agreed with the sermon of the Chief Incumbent in the sense that it was through the village temple that Buddhism has been protected in the country for so long.
Despite the presence of large Buddhist temples around the country, everyone eventually comes to the village temple. If the temple has strong benefactors, they support the temple and its monk. It is a strength to the village then. Even if the people are divided politically or any other way in the village, they can all come together to work through the TempleDayaka Sabha. We have to protect that strength, the Prime Minister said.
We need to create an environment where as Sinhala Buddhists, we can work together. And in a majority Sinhala Buddhist country, we need to work to win the confidence of other religious groups. When that confidence and faith between communities break, the country falls apart. So we need to always protect that trust, he said.
"Last week, Kandy, Digana, and Teldeniya experienced tense situations. We need to rebuild trust in those communities," the Premier said.. "We had a 30-year war in our country. As a result we were left behind. Now we need to focus on how we can bring development to the village," he said.
The first two years of this government has been very tough. We spent most of our time firefighting and repaying debt. So the people ran out of patience, and we saw the consequences of that at the recently concluded Local Government Elections. They voted against us because we were unable to deliver on many of what was promised whilst other promises took a long time to bear fruition. Cost of living rose higher than what we expected and there was a fertilizer shortage. The shortcomings cost the government a heavy price. As a government, we now have to work according to the will of the people and go forward according to what they ask of us, the Prime Minister said.
"Politics is not just a tug of war between a few groups. We need to understand that it is also working for the betterment of the people. We have to correct our mistakes and move forward," he said.
"A month after the election, we had to face tensions in Kandy. We now have to bring the situation under control and move ahead," the Prime Minister said.
By the Sinhalese New Year, we need to have the goods the people need in the country. They need to have money in hand. After the New Year, we have planned to start several programmes with foreign investors to many jobs in the country. We will start factories, hotels and ports and various other projects. They should bear fruit in the next 2-3 years. By 2020, we will see results, the Premier said.

Western allies confront Moscow over spy attack
UK: Britain and its allies on Thursday blamed Moscow directly for a poison attack on a double agent in England, escalating diplomatic tensions as Washington separately announced sanctions against Russia for allegedly meddling in its elections.
The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and the United States said there was no plausible alternative explanation for the use of the Soviet-designed nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury.
In a joint statement, they demanded Moscow address all questions related to the attack against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, which they said amounted to a breach of international law.
Skripal moved to Britain in a 2010 spy swap and had taken his daughter Yulia, who was on a visit, out for lunch before they both collapsed on a bench in the street on March 4.
Intelligence agencies now believe the nerve agent used on the pair was planted in the daughter's suitcase before she left Moscow, the Daily Telegraph reported late Thursday.
They are working on the theory that the toxin was impregnated in an item of clothing or cosmetics or else in a gift that was opened in his house in Salisbury, meaning Miss Skripal was deliberately targeted to get at her father, the newspaper said. In her first visit to Salisbury, where she also met a police officer injured in the incident, British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was important to send a united response.
This happened in the UK but it could have happened anywhere and we take a united stance against it, she said.
US President Donald Trump said: It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it. Something that should never, ever happen, and we're taking it very seriously.
May on Wednesday announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats and suspended high-level contacts, including announcing that British royals and ministers would boycott this summer's football World Cup in Russia.
She warned more measures could follow, noting that the US-led NATO alliance and the UN Security Council had discussed the attack, while it was also expected to be on the agenda of the European Union summit next week. The crisis comes as Russia prepares for a presidential election on Sunday in which Vladimir Putin is expected to easily win a fourth term. Russia has denied any involvement in the attack, the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since World War II. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would respond by expelling British diplomats soon.
He said his country had no motive to target Skripal, but suggested other players could use the poisoning to complicate the World Cup.
He also accused Britain of trying to deflect attention from its decision to leave the European Union, which has cast uncertainty over its place in the world.
NATO allies on Wednesday put out a joint statement condemning the attack, and Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said it must have consequences. He said Britain had not invoked the alliance's Article 5 mutual defence clause.
But he noted the attack came against the backdrop of a pattern of reckless behaviour by Russia -- a point also made in the US, British, German and French statement.

Windies spinner Narines bowling action reported again
SHARJAH, Thursday - West Indian spinner Sunil Narine faced a new storm on Thursday when his bowling action was again reported during the ongoing Pakistan Super League Twenty 20 tournament in the United Arab Emirates, officials said.
The 29-year-old, who is playing for Lahore Qalandars, was placed on the warning list but can continue to take part in the event.
Narine has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action during Wednesdays PSL Twenty20 game between Lahore Qalandars and Quetta Gladiators at Sharjah, said a Pakistan Cricket Board statement.
Lahore are already out of the play-offs and will play their last match against Peshawar Zalmi in Sharjah on Friday.
The match officials report on Narines bowling action will be sent to Cricket West Indies (CWI) and he will have to go through the process that is followed by the CWI, for suspected illegal bowling actions, added the statement.
Narine, who has played six Tests, 65 one-day and 48 Twenty20 internationals, was first reported for an illegal action during the Champions League in India in 2014.As a precaution he was withdrawn from the West Indies squad for the 2015 World Cup and only returned after remodelling his action.
Narine was then reported again in an international match in Sri Lanka in November 2016 and was suspended after biomechanical tests proved his action was beyond the 15 degree limit allowed under the International Cricket Councils rules.
Narine was only cleared in April 2016 before the Indian Premier League (IPL), another Twenty20 tournament where he plays for Kolkatta Knight Riders.
The latest report may jeopardise his participation in the IPL starting early next month.  AFP
