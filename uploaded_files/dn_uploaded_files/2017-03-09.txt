Joint statement on garbage issue
Anunayake Thera of Amarapura Maha Nikaya and Chief Incumbent of Dharmapalaramaya, Mount Lavinia, Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera and Colombo Archbishop His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith issued a joint statement on the garbage issue yesterday.
They requested the government to adhere to the decision of President Maithripala Sirisena and avoid dumping garbage collected from the Colombo city at Othekelle in Ja Ela.
The Anunayake Thera and the Colombo Archbishop stressed the need to make a long term plan to get over the problems of garbage without causing environmental pollution.
They said that they do not condone dumping garbage in Meeotamulla.
The statement: "In the first place, we wish to express our gratitude to President Maithripala Sirisena, for having personally informed us through telephone that the plan to dump garbage collected from the city of Colombo at Othekelle in the Ja-Ela area will not be implemented. We are happy that the President has responded to the voice of the people.
"As religious leaders, we made this intervention of behalf of the people of this area solely because, they appealed to us and also in consideration of the negative effects of this move on them. We have never had any political motive or have been influenced politically in making this appeal.
"The main reasons for our acceptance of the peoples plea was because of the fact that the Athanagalu Oya which flows through this area supplies drinking water for thousands of families in the Seeduwa-Katana area, drawing water from this river close to where the dumping was to take place. If the garbage from Colombo is dumped in that area, the water would be polluted and will bring adverse effects on the life of all these families.
"Besides, at present 11,000 families are on the Social Services Department's dole due to frequent floods that occur in the area. Dumping the garbage would intensify this problem further and more people will be rendered destitute during flooding. We are aware that most of the people in this area drink well-water and there are many paddy fields around. All of that would be heavily polluted.
"We do not condone dumping garbage in Meetotamulla either. We are sure that the President is well aware of the need to make a long standing plan to get over the problem of garbage without causing environmental pollution. We are grateful to the President for his decision and all praise is due to him.
"In line with that thinking, we request the government to adhere to the decision of the President and to avoid dumping garbage in Othekelle, Ja-Ela and request them to plan a recycling project for garbage to seek a permanent solution to these problems. We are sure that the Prime Minister too would stand by the people in the matter. We expect a positive response from the government to our request."

Navy preparing to host annual Kachchativu Church Festival
As tensions grow over the death of an Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters, the Sri Lankan Navy is preparing to host its annual Kachchativu Church Festival this year and Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva asked that the recent incident not cloud the festival which brings together fishermen from across the Palk Strait under a common faith. Over 1,500 Indian fishermen in 150 boats are expected to arrive for the Festival which is to take place over the weekend.
The Festival which hosts both Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen has been held for many years on the island of Kachchativu and since the end of the war, the church feast has been arranged by the Sri Lankan Navy.
The biggest issue between India and Sri Lanka is the fishermen issue, apart from that we share warm relations,de Silva said.
The Deputy Minister was speaking at a media briefing yesterday on the tensions caused between the two countries as a result of the death of the Indian fishermen. The Indians charge that the fisherman was shot by the Navy while the Navy has denied such allegations.
Indian fishermen encroaching into Sri Lankan waters is an issue both countries have been grappling with and according to the Deputy Foreign Minister, over 100 boats and 146 Indian fishermen are languishing in Lankan jails for having illegally crossed the countrys maritime boundaries, while four Sri Lankan fishermen remain in Indian custody. We are investigating into this incident in depth and we say to India, this matter should be resolved. In January, we had fisher talks but they were not fruitful and we expect to have another round of talks in April. We hope for better results there, Deputy Minister De Silva added.

Paid specialised services soon at state hospitals
Specialised paid medical services such as consultants services, medical tests, surgeries etc will soon be made available at state hospitals after 4.00 p.m., Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said at present, the Government spends Rs. 987 million annually to repair various medical equipment which needs upgrading every three years. But, the state sector uses this highly valuable medical equipment for only eight hours per day while the private sector use them throughout the day. The Minister was speaking after commissioning a new MRI Scanner for the Colombo National Hospital.
Minister Senaratne said the paid services should be made available at very reasonable prices as it would also bring in an income for the free health sector. The health expenditure can be minimised. Several requests were received to commence a paid services section in every state hospital to cater to the people willing to obtain the services. The health trade unions will oppose this move but this is not privatising the free health service. They should organise their trade union activities aiming at building the health sector, the Minister had stated.

Govt. to formulate new tax collection mechanism to suit modern day: PM
The attention of the government has been drawn to formulate a new tax collecting mechanism which would suit the modern day, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in response to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian S M Marikkar during the round of questions to be asked from the Prime Minister on the debts that the country had to settle in the coming years. He also asked if the government's programme to uplift the economy.
The Premier said the government had to settle a loan of US$ 15,000 billion from 2017 to 2020. He added that the government has had to implement many a programmes to face this challenge. "Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa held an untimely presidential election as he was not in a position to settle these loans," the Premier said. "His plan was to increase the prices of goods after the election and answer the people with bullets like he answered the Rathupaswala people later, who stood against him. However the people reached a decision to win the common candidate Maithripala Sirisena."
He said the entire world has placed their confidence on the unity government that it would be able to settle the loans and develop the economy. He further said that the government has had to settle US$ 3,196 billion, US$ 3,568 billion, US$ 1,945 billion, US$ 1,847 billion, US$ 3,904 billion and US$ 2,522 billion in 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 respectively.
"In addition to the debt trap, the country had also had to face the global economic crisis," the Premier said. "However, we are not ready to take more loans to get rid of this situation. We have planned to increase the income, increase employment opportunities and find international markets for our products. One of our concerns is that the national resources have to be used to settle the loans. However, the government's attention has been drawn to formulate a new tax collecting mechanism to suits the modern day."
The Premier also said the people would have to join together to solve these issues leaving aside their differences.
The Premier also stated that the government expects to collect US$ 1,100 billion through the Hambantota project in 2017 and to collect another US$ 1,400 billion from other projects in 2018.
When S M Marikkar questioned the government's stance on public institutions that incur losses to the country, the Premier said the highest loss incurred so far was by the Sri Lankan Airlines and the government has plans to develop it through public private partnership.

Opp. Leader calls for release of military held lands to its owners
Opposition Leader R Sampanthan yesterday in Parliament, called on the Government to return the lands held by the military in the North to its people.
Moving an Adjournment Motion in the House, he observed there could be no justification for not returning these lands.
You are violating human rights. The 2015 UNHRC Resolution says return of lands to the people should be expedited. Whether the Government is given more time at the UNHRC or not, our people cannot wait for two more years. They have come to the end of their patience, he stated.
People are protesting because they wish to live on their lands and continue their agricultural activities. Should these lands be used for people to live and cultivate or for golf courses and tourist resorts I thank the people, particularly those from outside the Northern Province who support this protest to release these lands. I want the Government to formulate a policy with regard to the release of these lands. I am thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena for the land released after ourmeeting, but there should be a plan to release all these lands, he said.
Would the Government let this happen to other people in Sri Lanka This makes it look like the Tamil people have no power, he added.
Most of these lands were taken over from the civilians for security purposes. For instance, civilians were evicted from several thousands of acres of land in Valigamam North in order to protect the Palaly Air Base from artillery fire almost 25 years ago. But even after the fighting had ended in 2009, only a fraction of that land had been returned for civilian resettlement, while large tracts of land are still occupied by the military, which is engaged in farming and trade, including running tourist hotels, while the original occupants languish in welfare centres and with host families, he explained.
We urge the government to take quick action in the regard and release all lands that are occupied by the security forces, in which civilians lived prior to the hostilities breaking out, be returned to the original inhabitants without any further delay, he stated.
However, NFF member Jayantha Samaraweera speaking at the debate, expressed his strong opposition towards the Governments move to release the lands removing Army camps in the North.
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena, replying to the motion, reiterated the Governments commitment to gradually release the military held lands, while taking measures not to compromise national security.
When the war ended in 2009, altogether 82,555 acres of lands in the North and East were held by the military and out of them, 30,300 acres were private lands. As of now, most of these lands have been released. The rest would also be released gradually, he said.
SDC responsible for implementing nationalpolicies: PM
The Sustainable Development Council(SDC) that is to be set under the Sustainable Development Bill(SDB), would be vested with the responsibility to implement the national policy of sustainable development, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He made this observation yesterday, commencing the Second Reading debate on the Sustainable Development Bill which was to provide for the development and implementation of a National Policy and Strategy on Sustainable Development in Sri Lanka; for the establishment of a Sustainable Development Council and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
The Premier said that although the Unity Government, President Maithripala Sirisena and the Cabinet is committed for sustainable development, there is no mechanism to implement the same programme. He said that due to this reason the Sustainable Development Council is set up under this Bill and would be given responsibility to implement sustainable development national policies.
The Premier also said the debate would be continued to another day before the same was passed.
Only when complaint is received by OMP
Action will be taken against anyTri Forces member, Police or civilian
The Government will take action against any member of the tri
Forces, Police or civilians, only if the Office of the Missing Persons(OMP) receive complaints
against them aboutforced disappearances,said Prime MinisterRanil Wickremesinghein Parliamentyesterday.
He also said that steps would be taken against those persons only according to the law and not against institutions.
He said that investigations would be carried out on Forces disappearances that had taken place when a suspect surrendered to the Police or the Security Forces.
He added that action would be taken in accordance with the Missing Persons Bill.
He made these observations when TNA MP Sivashakthi Ananthan raised a question to this effect during the round of questions to be asked from the Premier.
The Prime Minister said the gazette containing the amendments to the Office of Missing Persons Bill would be presented to Parliament in April.
The Premier stated that there were around 80 suspects who had surrendered to the government, while most of them had been dealt by law.
Land around Thirukoneshwaran Kovil can be declared sacred: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, yesterday observed that he would direct the matter if the land extension of 378 acres around the Thirukoneshwaran Eeshwaran Kovil could be declared as a sacred site to the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister.
He made this observation when EPDP Parliamentarian Douglas Devananda questioned as to whether the land extension of 378 acres around the Thirukoneshwaran Eeshwaran Kovil in Trincomalee could be declared as a sacred site during the round of questions to be raised from the Premier.
MP Devananda said the Kovil had been situated at the same place since 1300 BC even before King Vijaya arrived in the country.
At this stage, the Premier stated that Thiriyaya and Thirukoneshwaran had been used as a port. The Kovil was destroyed by the Portuguese.
He added that he would direct the matter to the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister.
JO in well-orchestrated dramato create chaos in Parliament
The Joint Opposition staged a well-orchestrated drama yesterday in Parliament with a deliberate aim to create chaos, said Chief Government Whip and Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka.
The minister was addressing a hurriedly convened press conference at the Parliament complex last evening. He said the UNP is of the view that the Speaker must take severe action against those who mess up Parliament sessions.
We as the UNP condemn such tactics, because their objective of disrupting Parliament sessions would be detrimental to the hopes and aspirations of the people. It is public money that is ultimately wasted. We are a party responsible for the people who elected us. We urge the Speaker to take further stern action next time whenever these elements try to sabotage parliamentary democracy, the Minister said.
The Minister said the Speaker tried his level best to bring the situation under control. The Speaker could have given orders to remove MP Dinesh Gunawardena from the House with the assistance of the Police. But he did not do so because it would be a disgrace to the senior MP. The removal was then decided by a vote. It is the House with a clear majority that decided MP Gunawardena should be removed, he added.
UNP MPs Mujibur Rahman, Ajith Mannapperuma, Ashoka Priyantha, Wijepala Hettiarachchi, JC Alawathuwala, Edward Gunasekera, Lucky Jayawardena and MHM Navavi also addressed the press briefing.

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. Counsel expresses dissatisfaction in  manner which AG  conducting proceedings
Legal representative for Perpetual Treasuries Limited, Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando yesterday expressed his dissatisfaction in the manner in which the Attorney General is conducting the proceedings, at the hearings of the Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds.
PC Fernando alleged that the representatives of the Attorney General seem not impartial regarding the matter at hand. Responding to the allegation, the Presidential Commission said the matter in concern is not a crime and thus the proceeding does not take the nature of a prosecution.
Expressing the view of the panel of Senior State Counsels appointed by the Attorney General to assist the Commission regarding the matter, Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera assured to the Commission, despite the magnitude of the issue is not leveled up to a crime, the panels commitment will not be nothing less than the effort put at a murder trial. Mean time, PC Nihal Fernando complained that his client was prosecuted and convicted by the media regarding the CBSL Treasury bond issue. The hassle rose in the back drop when the Commission observed the total accumulation percentage of the market share held by the Perpetual Treasuries Limited at the Treasury bond auctions held on the 29 March 2016 is a 32%. The total number of bids received from the Perpetual Treasuries Limited at the said auctions adds up to 27,560 and the total number of bids accepted at the same, amounts to 26, 410, it was observed.
Meanwhile, the panel of Senior State Counsels to assist the Presidential Commission headed by Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, observed that in two of the four treasury bond auctions held on the said date, the highest percentage of bid acceptance is recorded with regards to the Perpetual Treasuries Limited. These observations came into being as the present Superintendent of the Debt Department T.H.B. Saratchandra was testifying at the Presidential Commission.
Senior State Counsel Shaheeda Barrie led the evidence for the day. The Commission also observed that at the said auctions where the highest percentages of bids were accepted, the yield rates were also the highest.

A network of laboratories will also be set up connecting the health centres to carry out screening blood tests for healthy persons.

He also observed that MP Weerawansa had contested under the UPFA.
The Speaker stated that MP Wimal Weerawansa requested on February 22 to allow him ,together with five other MPs, to act as Independents ,after separating them from the UPFA.
The Speaker noted that Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa in writing requested on March 9, 2016 to accept their party the National Freedom Front (NFF) as an Independent political party, with , Wimal Weerawansa ,as party leader, and guarantee MP Weerawansas right to make statements under Standing Order 23(2) and participate at the Party Leaders meetings. He also said that MP Weerawansa made a similar request on April 05, 2016.
The speaker further stated that there were many instances in the Sri Lankan Parliamentary history where MPs sat independently after being separated from their political party. On such occasions the Speakers had intervened to guarantee their right to speech and in this Parliament too they had made administrative changes to guarantee such rights recently.
He stated that he had to decide as to whether another party, other than the six parties UNP, UPFA, ITAK, JVP, EPDP and SLMC that contested at the general election on August 17, 2015 and accepted by the election commissioner, could be accepted in Parliament. The Speaker also said the Election Commissioner had gazetted on August 19, 2015 that Wimal Weerawansa contested from the UPFA representing the Colombo district at the General Election on August 17, 2015.

'Sri Lanka would soon be in an economic deadlock'
Unless foreign, domestic debt obligations are addressed
Unless Sri Lanka comes up with a cut and dry plan to address both the domestic and foreign debt obligations which are in large volumes, Sri Lanka would soon be at an economic deadlock, Superintendent of the Public Debt Department T.H.B. Sarathchandra said.
Sarathchandra also said the Central Bank of Sri Lanka would have no choice but to bear the brunt with the bunching of large dollar repayments for the International Sovereign Bonds (ISB) which are reaching maturity in 2019 and the following years.
He said these international sovereign bonds have been issued in the years 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015.
The ISBs are maturing in 2019 for $1.5 billion and we also have a payment of over $500 billion as well. We need more than $2 billion in 2019, while we would have to pay a similar amount of dollars in 2020 to 2024 as well, Sarathchandra said.
He also said that there was an outstanding of $8 billion worth of standing stock at the moment.
For these years, we have to raise $2 billion to pay these debt payments. If the government has additional requirements, we may have to raise another $ 1 billion. So how could we go to the market and ask for $3 billion he questioned.
During the latter part of June 2016, we raised $1.5 billion through an ISB. During the time of the former Governor, we raised $2.1 billion in 2015. Almost in every year the ISBs were issued. Sarathchandra also said.
Speaking on domestic debt obligations SPD Sarathchandra mentioned that there was Rs.100 billion to be raised for the payment of bond maturities. I spoke with the former SPDs at the PDD and they have thought our economy would grow by the time these bonds would reach their maturity. They have thought a hundred billion would not be a problem to manage. But still, I feel, this is my personal feeling, a hundred million would be a problem even after another five years, SPD Sarathchandra said.
But to handle those things, there are some other techniques. At the moment the CBSL and the Finance Ministry is trying to introduce buy back facilities. If we have other funding arrangements, we could buy back those maturities. If we had $ 100 billion, we could buy 50 billion and allow it to mature. There are other facilities which are like buy back facility, he further explained.
SPD Sarathchandra also said the CBSL was attempting on a new system to conduct auctions.
This new system would help to stop bunching in future, he observed.
SPD Sarathchandra was testifying before the Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds yesterday.

Former ASPD U.L. Mutugala will appear before the Commission to testify today.

TPG shortlisted as investment partner to turn SriLankan around: Eran
The American Private Equity firm Texas Pacific Group (TPG) has been shortlisted as the main investment partner to turn SriLankan Airlines around,Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
Wickramaratne who addressed a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday, said they had chosen TPG to continue with negotiations which are expected to last a minimum of six months.
Apart from TPG, two other companies; PeaceAir Pvt Ltd and the Maldivian Company Super Group Partners were also chosen from the original nine bidders for SriLankan Airlines.
TPG is a famous private equity fund and it has experience turning airlines around, explained the Deputy Minister and added that TPG had also come forward to bid for Sri Lankan in 1997 when the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga government was looking for a buyer for the airline. At the time, the government chose to go with Emirates which ran the company at a profit for 10 years until it was kicked out in 2008.
The Ministry however has also indicated that it was open to work with other airlines in managing SriLankan Airlines in addition to negotiating with TPG. Though TPG has a sound financial background, there are worries that as an equity firm, it would be looking for short term gains unlike an established airline which would look to invest and develop the ailing national carrier on a long term basis.

Trial bus lane on Parliament road
A trial bus lane on Parliament road from Rajagiriya to the Ayurvedic junction will commence on March 12 to prioritise developing bus transport as a short term strategy to address Traffic congestion, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said that this programme is implemented as a monitoring project and will be introduced countrywide if proved to be a success.
Minister Ranawaka added that the objective of this monitoring project is to identify the issues created by such a programme in the country.
He also said that if this project could reduce the traffic congestion by five minutes each day, around Rs.6,000 million could be saved. He also said that the country loses Rs.350 billion each year due to traffic congestion.
Minister Ranawaka was speaking at a press conference at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry auditorium at the Suhurupaya, Battaramulla yesterday.
The Minister also said that the country has spent Rs.one trillion on road construction during the period of 2013 and 2014.
He added that although such an amount was spent, the issue of traffic congestion has not yet been solved.
Minister Ranawaka said there are 10 million trips made by residents within the Western Province on a day. He added of these, around 50 percent end up in Colombo city and the immediate suburbs. Around 50 percent of these trips are made by public transport. "In the 1980s this was over 85 percent," Minister Ranawaka said.
"Increasing personal incomes and deteriorating quality of public transport have jointly caused this rapid decline. The resulting use of a personal motorbike or car for travel or even the use of a three wheeler has increased rapidly. However, if 40 people using a bus choose to use a private vehicle, the road space requirement to fill a mix of motor cycles, three wheelers and cars needed to carry those same people, will now be equal to 7-10 buses. As the incomes increase, more people buy and use private vehicles and this is creating a huge increase in demand for road space. However government cannot add road space at the same rate as the demand. Land for roads is not always available. Even when available and acquired, it takes time and money. Road construction is also expensive. Elevated or underground roads are much more expensive."
The Minister said that this matter has been discussed with the relevant institutions and hoped everybody ,including the private vehicle owners, would cooperate to implement this programme.
Minister Ranawaka also said that Colombo is not alone in battling traffic congestion. Some cities like Singapore City have avoided congestion by planning it carefully while adopting the most appropriate transport policies. Other cities like Bangkok and Manila have constructed expensive railways and expressways with limited success. Some cities like London, Bogota, and Seoul have stood out having successfully managed traffic congestion through developing buses and trains and getting vehicle owning people to use buses and trains.
Minister Ranawaka also said that a bus lane alone will not be successful. "This is only a start. If indeed a separate lane is found to work satisfactorily, then new and modern low floor buses should be introduced," Minister Ranawaka said.
"Over-crowding should be addressed through better schedules, cashless-ticketing, park and ride, passenger information needs to be improved. The good news is that all these can be implemented in the short term and at relatively low cost- especially to the government. Unlike an expensive rail system or a new road, a modern bus service with new buses and new routes that will attract even car passengers out of cars in traffic blocks can be implemented within a few months. This is the hope with which the trial bus lane is tested."

Uproar in House: Dinesh  suspended for one  week
MPs vote in favourof suspension
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena was suspended from Parliament for a week due to unruly behaviour yesterday.
The motion to suspend the MP was put before the House by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and it was passed with a majority of 63 votes following a division by name called by NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa. The motion received 85 votes in favour and 22 votes against. Three abstained from voting, while 114 were absent.
The TNA MPs voted for the motion along with the UPFA and UNP MPs in the Government. The Joint Opposition group voted against while the JVP MPs abstained.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena walked out of the Chamber following the motion and the JO group followed him making noises to express their objection.
Parliament sittings were suspended for three times yesterday and Parliament Police was called into the Chamber for the first time in recent memory.
A tense situation erupted in the House soon after Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced his ruling over the request by NFF Leader Weerawansa to recognize the five members of his Party as an independent group in Parliament.
The Joint Opposition (JO) led by MPs Gunawardena and Weerawansa agitated in the House requesting the chair to allow them to express their views over the Speakers ruling. The Speaker did not permit this request maintaining that his ruling is the final and that it could not be challenged or debated.
The Speaker told the protesting JO MPs that he would allow MP Weerawansa to raise his concerns on a future date possibly within this same week. However, MPs Gunawardena and Weerawansa defying the Orders of the Speaker constantly disturbed the proceedings of the House and walked near the mace forcing the Speaker to suspend the sittings abruptly.
As Parliament resumed the Speaker urged the members to support him to carry on the days business, but the JO did not obey and resorted to criticise the Chair.
The Speaker gave back to back warnings to MP Gunawardena not to flout the Standing Orders and not to hurl abuse at the Chair. I would like to remind you that your criticisms and insults are disrespect not to me personally but to the dignity of the House he stated.
You are a very senior MP and you should not behave like this. I remember, when you were the Chief Government Whip, you did not even allow me to stand up to move the Right to Information Bill. How can you talk about freedom of speech now the seemingly miffed Speaker told MP Gunawardena.
You cannot change the rulings by pressuring and threatening. There is a limit to patience. You are wasting public money. Please allow me to carry on the business of the House or leave the Speaker told the protesting MPs.
The Speaker gave warnings to MP Gunawardena thrice and then ordered him out of the Chamber using the powers vested in him under Standing Order 74 (1) for seriously misbehaving. However, MP Gunawardena did not obey and remained seated and the Speaker suspended the sittings again.
As the sittings resumed after about 15 minutes, the Speaker insisted that MP Gunawardena should either go out of the Chamber or allow the business of the House be continued uninterrupted. MP Gunawardena objected to the Speaker asking why he did not call for a Party Leaders Meeting to discuss MP Weerawansas issue, to which the Speaker said it was discussed at the previous days Party Leaders Meeting.
You did not speak out about your ruling at that meeting. You cannot keep the ruling inside your pocket and get the Party Leaders to dance to your tune, he objected.
At this point, the Speaker ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove the MP from the Chamber with the assistance of the Parliament Police and then suspended the sittings again.
The Joint Opposition MPs numbering about 15 formed a ring around the seat of MP Gunawardena to prevent him being taken Around 2.40 p.m, about 20 Police personnel filed into the Chamber and stood close to MP Gunawardena. The Serjeant-at-Arms and his deputy were seen requesting the MP to move out, but the JO group flatly rejected it.
If you are to use force, then do so. We will not allow you to remove him, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said aloud to the Police. Ministers Dr.Sarath Amunugama and Mahinda Amaraweera were seen approaching MP Gunawardena and talking to resolve the issue. Then after about 30 minutes, the Police withdrew from the Chamber and the House resumed.
Minister Rauf Hakeem, rising to a Point of Order, pointed out the Speakers order has to be executed as of the conventions in the House, adding that ignoring it would be a humiliation to the House. However, Kiriella pointed out it was not practical as it could even lead to a brawl. Hence, he proceeded to put a motion before the House to suspend MP Gunawardena from Parliament for one week.
At the end of the adoption of the motion, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commented that the trail of events in the House proved that MP Weerawansa is not functioning independent, but working in coalition with the UPFA in Opposition. Therefore, he questioned the logic of recognising Weerawansa and other MPs of his party as independent MPs.

## Title: US hospitals oppose Trump-backed health bill

US hospitals oppose Trump-backed health bill
(The bill was crafted by Republican leaders like Paul Ryan, and backed by Trump)
A leading trade group representing hospitals has expressed fears about the Republican health-care bill, saying poor Americans could lose insurance.
The American Hospital Association (AHA) said current provisions for "our most vulnerable" would be thrown into doubt.
President Donald Trump met lawmakers on Wednesday to rally them behind the bill, after a stormy 24 hours.
Moderate Republicans are concerned people will be stripped of cover, while conservatives sense federal overreach.
The bill, called the American Health Care Act, would replace the signature law of former President Barack Obama, so-called Obamacare.
It would:
limit future federal funding for Medicaid, which covers low-income people
abolish the requirement that everyone should be insured
replace subsidies with tax credits
Overall, the plan is expected to cover fewer people than those who gained insurance under the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act, but we will not know the exact numbers - or the cost - for about another week.
It is now being considered by two congressional committees ahead of its passage through the House and Senate.
What did the hospitals and doctors say about it
The president of the AHA, which represents about 5,000 hospitals and health networks, said in a letter to Congress that the ability to assess the bill was "severely hampered" by the lack of a proper estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.
But the plans for Medicaid "will have the effect of making significant reductions in a programme that provides services to our most vulnerable populations", Rick Pollack wrote.
In a separate letter, a large doctors' group, the American Medical Association, also urged Congress to reconsider reducing insurance for the poor.
The AARP, a lobbying group for older Americans, has opposed the plan too, saying funding for the Medicare insurance programme for the elderly could be cut.
Who is speaking up for the bill
House Speaker Paul Ryan praised the bill as "a conservative wish list" and "monumental, exciting conservative reform."
"This is what we've been dreaming about doing," he told reporters.
President Trump campaigned on repealing Obamacare, which he says has suffered from rising premiums and a lack of choice.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president was "in full sell mode".
As well as convincing Americans, he has to first persuade sceptics in his own party.
Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but it is unclear if they will get enough votes to get the bill through.
The bill will be "dead on arrival" at the doors of the Senate, said Kentucky senator Rand Paul.

Writ petition by Perpetual Treasuries re-fixed for support
The writ petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Private Limited, a primary dealer in government securities, seeking an Interim Order restraining the Central Bank from taking action under the directives issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, was yesterday re-fixed for support on March 10 by Court of Appeal.
The petition had been filed by Perpetual Treasuries (Private) Limited, Perpetual Asset Management (Private) Limited and Perpetual Capital Holdings (Private) Limited through senior counsel G.G. Arulpragasam.
The petitioners further sought an order quashing the directives of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank dated November 7, 2016 in respect of the Perpetual Treasuries.
The petitioners stated that the directions issued on November 7, 2016 are unprecedented regulatory controls over a primary dealer by the Monetary Board and are disproportionate to violations and regulatory concerned cited in the petition. The petitioners said directions are unlawful, unreasonable, unjustifiable, arbitrary and capricious and are in violation of legitimate expectations of Perpetual Treasuries and were imposed without a fair hearing.
The petitioners stated that the directions were issued beyond the scope of Regulation 11(2) of the Local Treasury Bills (Primary Dealers) Regulations No. 1 of 2009 dated June 24, 2009.
The Central Bank, Monetary Board of Central Bank, Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, officials of the Monetary Board and several others were cited as respondents.
The petitioners stated that it is no longer possible to sustain operations without the risk of bankruptcy. Attempts to seek redress, clarification or relief have been ignored by the respondents. The petitioners have no other recourse than to seek relief from Court.
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank had issued directives against Perpetual Treasuries involved in controversial bond deals.
Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando with S.A. Parathalingam PC appeared for the petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appeared for the Central Bank and the Attorney General.

Zeids report has no binding authority over a sovereign nation: Harsha
The UN Human Rights High Commissioners Report has no binding authority over a sovereign nation, said Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Harsha De Silva and insisted that Sri Lanka could not accept all recommendations listed in the report.
The deputy minister who addressed a media briefing yesterday was referring to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Husseins report on Sri Lanka, released on March 3, which called on the government to embrace the report of the Consultation Task Force, to formulate a communications campaign to inform the public about details of the reconciliation agenda, to invite the UN Human Rights Office to establish a presence in Sri Lanka, to give the highest priority to the restitution of all private land that has been occupied by the military, and to adopt legislation establishing a hybrid court. The last recommendation on the hybrid court however caused the most controversy and Deputy Minister De Silva sought to quell rumours that even the Technical Roll over of Resolution 30/1, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka this year had such a recommendation, The Resolution is the same as in 2015, we have included nothing new in it. This is just a Technical Roll over which we get two extra years before we have to report back to the UN. It has no mention of hybrid courts or foreign judges, the Deputy Minister said.
