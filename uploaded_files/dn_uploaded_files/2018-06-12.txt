Shakira  makes  concert  comeback
Shakira is celebrating her big return to the stage after vocal issues forced her to postpone her world tour by seven months.
The Hips Dont Lie superstar initially had to delay the start of her El Dorado World Tour in Cologne, Germany in November as she struggled with strained vocal cords, but the health issue soon worsened as she suffered a vocal haemorrhage, prompting her to push back the entire European leg. The Colombian beauty also had to reschedule her North American shows, which had been due to kick off in January, but on June 3, Shakira was back in the spotlight as she launched her trek in Hamburg, Germany.
The gig went off without a hitch, and the singer took to Instagram moments after stepping offstage to thank fans for their huge show of support.
Wow, I did it...! beamed an out-of-breath Shakira in video footage posted online. Hamburg, I love you...! We did it!!!!, she captioned the clip. It felt like performing for the first time!!!
The musician has since shared a series of photos from her comeback performance, dubbing the tour kick off one of the best times of her life.
She also promised to deliver a big party every night for her fans on tour, adding, Theres nothing like seeing you so happy!!!
The El Dorado World Tour will continue in Cologne on June 5 and keep her on the road until November, when she will conclude the trek with a homecoming show in her native Colombia.
Shakiras busy schedule means she will have little time to support her soccer star boyfriend, Gerard Pique, as he plays for Spains national team in the World Cup, which begins in Russia on June 14. Music News

SL Economic Summit from Sept. 12
Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2018, organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lankas premier business chamber, is to take place from September 12-14 at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
The theme for this years Economic Summit is On the Fast Track to a Turnaround.
Sri Lankas economy is once again at a crucial juncture in need of a swift and well strategized turnaround to bring about economic stability and development. This is in the backdrop of weak local economic growth, rising global commodity prices and uncertainty in global trade.
The summit, spanning over the course of three days, will be a wholesome opportunity to learn about government plans to develop the Sri Lankan economy (as well as the progress in implementation of plans), to improve business through knowledge enhancement pertaining to relevant sectors, to identify potential sectors and projects for investment in Sri Lanka, to clarify concerns with key government officials/industry leaders, and also to meet and network.
Last years Economic Summit saw the participation of many Chairpersons, CEOs, Directors, Senior Managers, foreign investors, senior government officials, and academics. Furthermore, over 40 resource persons, consisting of high profile cabinet ministers, policy makers, business leaders and academics shared insights and made recommendations on how Sri Lanka can transform its economy to realize its potential.
The outcomes of the discussions held at last years summit have led to policy strategies such as the Innovation and Entrepreneurship strategy and Digital Economy Strategy. Furthermore, at last years summit, the discussions around trade policy and in particular the Singapore FTA has moved forward with the signing of the SLSFTA earlier this year with a policy focus on accessing the ASEAN region.
At this years summit, the emphasis will be on shaping a turnaround for the Sri Lankan economy whilst delving deep into areas such as trade, investment and services that will help drive this. The focus will also be on learning from successful companies and steering the bureaucracy to work more effectively, thus meeting the emerging challenges.

Sonakshis four new singles  to release soon
Sonakshi Sinha is geared up to impress the audience with her upcoming film Happy Phir Bhag Jayegi. But meanwhile, the actor is also exploring her inclination towards music. Previously, Sonakshi has judged music reality shows and also sung before. This time around, Sonakshi has recorded four different genres of singles with composer Vishal Mishra. As per reports, these singles are scheduled to release some time in the coming months.
Sonakshi Sinhas first single Aaj Mood Ishqholic Hai was recorded back in 2015. And post that, she managed to sing in few of her own films but never recorded her own singles.
The Action Jackson star who has lent her voice for one of the songs in the third installment of Yamla Pagla Deewana, decided to record the singles too after an interaction with Vishal.
According to what Vishal stated in reports, the first single is expected to release in August. Describing the first single, the composer reportedly revealed that it is a Punjabi track with some international elements like dancehall, jazz, and even R&B.
He even reportedly mentioned that they are putting in a lot of creativity in videos as they are striving to make it look great.
The composer has also asserted that there will be more tracks that will be recorded in the forthcoming months. TNN

Standing up for Rights
A few months ago, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has urged Sri Lanka to adopt a comprehensive Bill of Rights that fully incorporates economic, social and cultural rights. The Committee added it was concerned that at present most economic and social matters relevant to the individual or groups are confined to the Directive Principles of State Policy Chapter of the Constitution.
It said: As stipulated in article 29 of the Constitution, these Directive Principles do not confer or impose legal rights or obligations and are not enforceable in any court or tribunal. No question of inconsistency with such provisions shall be raised in any court or tribunal.
The Committee recommended that Sri Lankan Government expedite its Constitutional reform process, including the adoption of a comprehensive Bill of Rights that fully incorporates economic, social and cultural rights.
What is the purpose of a so called Bill of Rights What does it serve Most important of all, the Bill of Rights serves to protect citizens from excess government power. It achieves this by ensuring there is a separation of powers between different government branches, the judicial, executive, and the legislative. A Bill of Rights, sometimes called a Declaration of Rights or a Charter of Rights, is a list of the most important rights to the citizens of any democratic country. In other words, the purpose is to protect those rights against infringement from politicians, public officials and private citizens.
Sri Lankan experience
Sri Lanka, in fact, was talking about Bill of Rights for the past several years. In 2011, a Committee reporting to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights prepared a draft Bill of Rights and submitted to the Ministry of Justice for review. Not much action has been taken to take this draft forward by the Government at that time.
And, in June 2016, the official committee on constitutional reforms in Sri Lanka came up with an exhaustive Bill of Rights. It covered 32 types of rights, ranging from right to life (not included in the 1978 Constitution) to rights of people with diverse sexual and gender identities. Lal Wijenayake, chairman of the committee, told an Indian newspaper that the Bill of Rights as proposed by his panel, if accepted by the country, would be among the the most modern documents on rights in the world.
Meanwhile, the Government has confirmed that Sri Lankas proposed constitution will include a Bill of Rights that takes into account economic, social and cultural rights of the people. Sri Lankas current constitution covers only civil and political rights that are considered to be the most basic rights of a human being.
Entrenchment
Bills of Rights may be entrenched or unentrenched. An entrenched Bill of Rights cannot be amended or repealed by a country's legislature through regular procedure. Instead, it requires a supermajority (eg., 2/3 votes in Parliament) or referendum; often it is part of a country's constitution, and therefore subject to special procedures applicable to constitutional amendments.
A Bill of Rights that is not entrenched is a normal statute law and as such can be modified or repealed by the legislature at will. In practice, not every jurisdiction enforces the protection of the rights articulated in its bill of rights.
Unfortunately, there has not been much awareness among common Sri Lankan citizens about adopting a Bill of Rights. Perhaps, most of them are not adequately educated what it is and what benefits it can deliver to them.
However, the need for the adoption of a Bill of Rights must be considered against the background of recent events here and abroad. Those events have thrown a spotlight on deficiencies in Sri Lankan protection of individual rights.
A Bill of Rights is now a central feature of the constitutional or public law arrangements of major jurisdictions which share the common law tradition - the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand, to name four of them. In common, all of them have democratic governments. Yet they have found it necessary to temper the will of the majority by providing for additional protection for individual rights for the very reason that neither the law nor the political process sufficiently protect them.
Power abuse
Historically, the emphasis on protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms arose out of the need to protect minorities and individuals from discrimination and oppression on racial, religious and other grounds. Additionally, it came to being to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals from the overriding exercise and abuse of state power.
During the times of terrorism, most countries make special and wide-ranging arrangements for security. We have witnessed how in our own country the political process has been tampered with to compromise basic individual rights and to countenance procedures which are inconsistent with basic elements of the rule of law. For example, lengthy detention of suspects without any or speedy access to the courts has been one feature of the so-called War against Terror.
Law protection
Politicians have a powerful survival instinct. They are anxious to keep on side with popular sentiment, even more so when popular sentiment has been fanned by media-fuelled anxiety about crime, corruption and threats to security. No politician wants to be labelled as soft on those issues. So, the political process is willing to compromise on basic rights and on the rule of law so as to convey the impression that politicians are seen doing the right thing.
In the result, statute law may override basic law protection of fundamental rights and basic elements of the rule of law. This willingness to compromise on basic rights is not confined to crime, corruption and security, where the justification may seem stronger.
That is why most democratic countries brought in Bill of Rights concept to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, mostly by constitutionally-entrenched guarantees.
Bill of Rights
We urgently need a Bill of Rights in Sri Lanka. The main arguments for its adoption are: (1) it would bring Sri Lanka into line with the rest of the democratic world; and (2) it would protect basic individual rights from interference by political (legislative and executive) interference.
There are two other advantages. (1) Principled judicial decision-making would replace political compromise; and (2) Government and administrative decision-making, on policy and other issues, would necessarily have close regard to basic individual rights.
A constitutionally entrenched Bill would certainly give more power to judges than they have. It would enable the judges to override Parliament or political pressure. But a statute-based Bill, would not have that result; it would leave the judges with their ordinary role of interpreting the laws made by Parliament, but in the light of the Bill of Rights. A statute-based Bill of Rights in this form can be changed by Parliament. Parliament also has the capacity, by specific and clear language at any time, to override or qualify statutory rights. But if Parliament takes this course, it must confront the impact of its proposed law on the rights protected by the Bill and deal with that impact specifically.
The experience in other countries also confirms the lesson of history - that the rights of individuals are better protected by judges than by politicians. Politicians and administrators are primarily concerned with the exercise of government power and policy. Judges are primarily concerned with the rights of individuals. That is what court cases are all about.
If Sri Lanka is to consolidate the democratic gains of 2015, it is vital that the Government should bring in the Bill of Rights to the Parliament approval without further delay. Once the Constitutional Reforms are finalised at a future date, the Bill of Rights could be entrenched into the Constitution itself.

Swap flowers for a pizza bouquet on your wedding day
Your wedding should be an expression of you and your partner, merging your shared interests and love in a special day for your friends and family to enjoy.
Now theres a perfect way to show your cherished guests what youre all about  a pizza bouquet.
For people who dont love flowers (they just die!) or want something with more personality, Villa Pizza in the US are giving couples the opportunity to walk these beauties down the aisle. They come in bouquet format or as a button-hole for the groom, and are made of freshly prepared pizza dough, 100 percent whole milk mozzarella, fresh California tomatoes and zesty pepperoni.
These creations were dreamed up by Villa and food stylist Jessie Bearden to look like real flowers, with all sorts of swirly patterns and doughy petals.
Unfortunately those of us who dont live in America wont get a chance to live our cheesy dreams, as its part of a competition by Villa stateside.
Couples getting married before the end of September in the US can simply enter the details of their big day and be in with a chance of stonebaked goodness for their nuptials. Itd be a miracle if it makes it to the altar in one piece.

War-torn country prepares for its first ever Test
Teenage Afghan googly wizard wows cricketing world
NEW DELHI, Monday - Hes 19 and from a country at war for decades, but Rashid Khan of Afghanistan is the toast of the cricket world with his leg-spin wizardry.
From Thursday, the worlds top-ranked Twenty20 bowler will be in action as Afghanistan play their first ever Test match, the gruelling five-day format beloved of purists, against the mighty India in Bangalore.
Khan started playing with a tennis ball in the remote and poor eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar as one of 12 children, and says he learned the tricks of the trade by himself.
Nobody taught me... leg-spin and wrong ones, he told the Times of India recently. I just observed Shahid Afridi and Anil Kumble, he said, greats of Pakistan and India respectively.
Khan began his professional career in Afghanistans domestic league where he caught the eye of national selectors.
At 17, he made his international debut against Zimbabwe.
Since then he has gone from strength to strength, becoming the fastest to reach 100 one-day international wickets during the World Cup qualifiers in March with his darting leg-spinners and vicious googlies.
This year he was the star of the Indian Premier League, the cash-rich extravaganza in short-format Twenty20 cricket, helping the Sunrisers Hyderabad reach the final and more than justifying his $1.41-million price tag.
Khans well-disguised doosra ball did for stars from Virat Kohli, the India captain, to batting maestro Mahendra Singh Dhoni, helping to propel the youngster to the top of the International Cricket Councils T20 bowling rankings.
I wouldnt hesitate in saying he is the best spinner in the world in this format... (and) hes got some batting skills as well, Indian cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar said on Twitter.
Australian spin legend Shane Warne said Khan got him excited, while Kumble was also full of praise for the 19-year-old and his 17-year-old teammate Mujeeb ur Rahman.
Its fantastic to see two young Afghanistan spinners bamboozle world batsmen, Kumble, the third-highest wicket-taker of all time and now a commentator, told AFP.
Both Rashid and Mujeeb are extremely talented and if they get it right they are certainly capable of testing... Indian or any batsmen, the former leg-spinner added.
NEW CHALLENGE
The duo have become a potent weapon for Afghanistan, with Mohammad Nabi adding edge to a spin-heavy squad picked for their historic Test against India this week.
Last week, they completed an impressive 3-0 ODI whitewash over Bangladesh.
However, Kumble said switching from T20s to the five-day format would be a challenge for the teenagers.
It will be interesting to see how they go, because bowling four overs and bowling to get wickets in a Test match is totally different, the former India captain said.
Khan, who is also an agile fielder and a useful lower-order batsman, said that fitness has always been key since he made his ODI debut.
In the last one year, I have tried to stay fit, and improve upon my fitness, which has changed everything, he said.
I have managed to contribute in the field, with ball and bat.  AFP

Sri Lanka Tourism is aiming for all time record revenue of US$ 4 billion from the industry for 2018, said Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) 39th Graduation Ceremony at the BMICH main conference hall yesterday, he said that this will better last years revenue of US$ 3 billion.
Minister said the tourism industry is an important contributor to the national economy and it has been moving to be among the highest foreign exchange earners. Today Tourism is the third highest FOREX earner and soon it would be number two.
Amaratunge also said that The City of Colombo today is attracting top global hotel chains and this too shows the confidence they have in Sri Lankan Tourism.
However, I would like to see some of these global hotel chains moving out of Colombo and investing in the regions as well.
Commenting on the arrivals Minister said that there is positive trend and this will continue.
Last year Sri Lanka attracted 2.1 million tourist arrivals and we predict that Sri Lanka will pass the 2.5 million arrival figure by end of 2018.
For the first five months of 2018 so far 1 million visitors have come to Sri Lanka and the 2.5 million arrival target is a reality.
China, India, Britain, France and Germany are the five key international tourist markets.
Minister however said that the 2.5 million mark is still not adequate.
If you compare this arrival figure to the region we cannot be satisfied. We have to do more to attract additional tourists and this is currently being done.

Vettel claims 50th win
Montreal, Monday: Sebastian Vettel claimed the 50th win of his career and reclaimed the lead of this years world championship on Sunday when he ended Lewis Hamiltons run of supremacy at the Canadian Grand Prix.
The four-time champion German drove his Ferrari with near flawless aplomb to convert his 54th pole position into a triumphant afternoon ahead of Finn Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes and determined Dutchman Max Verstappen, who was third for Red Bull.
Vettel's third victory this season lifted him to 121 points ahead of Hamilton on 120 after seven races, ending the defending four-time champions hopes of a record-equalling seventh win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve where he won from pole for the last three years. It was Ferraris first win in Canada since 2004 and came from their first pole there in 17 years. It was also Vettels second win in Canada where he won in 2013 for Red Bull.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo, who clocked the fastest lap at the end, managed to resist a late charge from Hamilton in the closing laps and retain fourth place ahead of the Englishman who extended his record points-scoring run to 32 races.
Finn Kimi Raikkonen finished sixth in the second Ferrari.
German Nico Hulkenberg came home seventh ahead of his Renault team-mate Spaniard Carlos Sainz, Frenchman Esteban Ocon of Force India and Monegasque Charles Leclerc of Sauber. "Perfect is a good way to describe this," said a delighted Vettel. AFP

Virtusa Hosts a Panel on How Women Can Overcome Career Challenges
As more women enter the workforce the pressures and challenges they face only begin to increase each year. Despite these growing obstacles many women persevered and surmounted even the most difficult barrier and reached the upper echelons of industry.
Virtusa recently sat down with some of these trailblazers at a panel discussion on How to Achieve Career Nirvana to understand the secrets of their success and to impart some wisdom on many who were just starting out on their journey.
The four panelists gathered at the moderated discussion hailed from diverse backgrounds and excelled in different fields, however, reached the pinnacle of their career facing similar challenges. The packed crowd, of mostly women, in attendance were given a rare glimpse of the thought processes the panelists applied in overcoming these challenges and their unique point-of-view in understanding the problem before them.
On the matter of a work life balance the panelist agreed that it can seem that, especially as a woman, they are being pulled from all directions. They have to fulfill their traditional role as wife and mother as well as work twice as hard as others to prove to their colleagues and superiors that they are committed to their careers. This can be a demanding task but it need not be a zero sum game.
Sanjeewani Ranashinghe de Silva, Country Head of Corporate Affairs, Brand and Marketing at Standard Chartered, Sri Lanka, began her career as a journalist during the civil conflict and had a stint in advertising before making the unlikely transition to the corporate world with a position at the Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC). She believes that for women to achieve that ideal work life balance they need to first build a strong resilience. She credits this for her enormous confidence and taking her far in her career.
If women are to get anywhere in this world they will need the confidence that comes from being resilient. I am up here today because I had that. After my second child was born and the opportunity came to advance my career I had my doubts. And even worse, others fed those doubts  from all sides. But if you want to have it all then you have to prove those naysayers wrong and the only way to do that is prove it to yourself first, she said.
People will question you whatever you do so its important to not hide your head in the sand simply because things get a little tough. Answer those questions for yourself and be sure of what you want to do, she added.
Renuka Fernando, Director / Chief Executive Officer of Nations Trust Bank, also believes that being certain of what you want for you and your family plays a major part in holding on to both your career and personal life.
It came to the point that I even considered giving up my career. But it is when times are toughest that its important to just be yourself. As long as you know, and are comfortable with your decision, that this is how you do your best for your family then you have to stay the course, she said.
One day, you may not even realise it but your child will understand everything you did and appreciate you for it. And you will become their role model, she added.
The discussion then turned towards the matter of overcoming the challenges of the workplace which can be demoralizing for anyone but women, who may be under greater scrutiny, can often let one error be their undoing. However, it need not be and can actually be a learning experience that strengthens their resolve.
Prasansani Mendis, Chief Executive Officer of NDB Securities, explains that the challenges you face change at each stage of your career and your ability to handle them and how well equipped you are to do so will differ. But it is important to keep a positive attitude, be committed to your goals and enjoy everything you do.
You will face many challenges early in life but it is important to view them as opportunities and tackle them head on. These are learning experiences that will shape you and your future. Later on in life there will be a completely different set of challenges, your focus may be split between family and work but it is important to be equally committed, work on being a multi-tasker, be clear in your communication, and have a positive attitude. There is no such thing as an unsurmountable challenge. Everything is possible and thats the mindset you need to have, she said.
Building on Prasansanis point, Dr. Dulini Fernando, Associate Professor at the Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, UK, explained to the audience that one of the most important lessons she learned in her life was to not over analyze things and block out everyones voice except her own.
I feel that a lot of these things women face can sometimes be in our minds. People will always say things but its important for us to not take notice of it. Garbage in, garbage out. Because if we stop to think about everything people say to us it will take up all our time and may even make you feel victimized which will only hinder your ability to manage and be detrimental to your career. Remember that you can be your own worst enemy. Being aware of that can help you to get out of your own way, she said.
Its not an easy task but you can train your mind over time to achieve this until everything else is white noise, she added.
In the final moments of the discussion, echoing the thoughts of her fellow panelists and touching upon the underlying theme of everything discussed, Renuka Fernando explained that women need to be comfortable in what they want to be and it should be for them, their family and their employer. Nothing else matters.
We have to admit to ourselves that we are only human. Society usually places heavy demands on us to be super career women, super daughters, super wives, super daughter-in-laws, and super mothers. But we have to realize that we are not super everything all the time. Depending on the situation, we may be super career women or super mothers but we cannot be all things to all people all the time. You need to be confident in what you are doing is right for you, your family and your employer. This alone can be a huge challenge for women in Sri Lankan society but we can overcome it, she said.

Wayamba Ela project first stage to be completed in 2020
The first stage of the Wayamba Ela project, built to carry Mahaweli waters to the areas in the Kurunegala district suffering from a severe shortage of water, is due to be completed by the end of 2020, Wayamba Ela Development Project Director Asoka Peiris said.
Eight large-scale tanks and 300 small-tanks would be developed under this project, which would facilitate irrigation for cultivation of 12,000 farm lands in both seasons without any shortage. The project will provide direct dividends to 13,000 farmer families and indirect benefits to another 80,000 farmer families, Peiris said.
This will also help resolve the acute drinking water shortage leading to the proliferation of kidney diseases in the region and also bring new employment avenues for the people.
The project will be completed in two stages. The first stage involved the distribution of excess water of the Nalanda reservoir received by the Wemedilla reservoir to the Wemedilla scheme and Devahuwa reservoir through proper canal ways and other development work, and to take Nalanda and Mahaweli waters to the Kurunegala district for storage by building canal ways and development of tanks.
The second stage involved the distribution of water diverted to the Kurunegala district up to Polpithigama, Ehetuwewa, Galagamuwa, Ambalanpola and Mahawa by building canals and also build canals and other development work needed to direct the Mahaweli waters received from the Bowatenna reservoir to the Dambulu Oya to the canals built under the first stage from the vicinity of the Wemedilla reservoir.
The project is implemented under a Rs. 110 million fund from ADB.
Meanwhile, work on the Ihala Elahera Ela project, implemented under the Mahaweli water safety investment programme, is also being carried out successfully.
The investment in this project involved 450 million US dollars or Rs. 65,000 million. This will augment irrigation supplies to 30,000 acres or 12,000 hectares of cultivated lands.
In addition, it is hoped to provide 25 million cubic metres of water to supply drinking water to 25,000 families.
This project will also supply water to other tanks in the Anuradhapura district including Nachchaduwa, Tissa Wewa, Nuwara Wewa and Mahakanadarawa. Apart from this, work on the Kalu Ganga project is proceeding successfully while Laggala Pallegama town is being developed as a fully-equipped town.

We have one of the most consistent lower-order batting in the world - Jason Holder
PORT OF SPAIN, Monday: Captain Jason Holder attributed West Indies massive 226-run win over Sri Lanka in the first Test in Trinidad on Sunday to his team having one of the most consistent lower order batting in the world.
Sri Lanka, who required 277 on the final day, with seven wickets in hand only managed to add 51 runs as spinners Roston Chase returned a four-wicket haul with Devendra Bishoo taking three.
The second innings wasn't where Windies exterted their domination on the match. It was in the first innings when Shane Dowrich added vital runs and solid stands with the lower order as Windies, who could've been bowled out for less than 200, finished with a total of 411 for 8 declared, with Dowrich unbeaten on 125.
The batsman shared stands of 90, 102 and 75 with Jason Holder, Bishoo and Kemar Roach respectively. In reply, the visitors were bowled out for 185, handing the hosts with a very handy 229-run lead.
"Our lower order has been one of the most consistent lower orders in world cricket for the last two or three years," Holder said, although statistics don't back his claims in the context. "I always back the guys to come in and put up a partnership and put up a fight. It really started with the partnership that Shane and I had, and then Devendra came in and played an outstanding knock.
Not only did he take time out of the game, he scored runs as well. That not only took time out of the game, it wore down the Sri Lankan bowlers and made it tough for them. I was always backing our guys to get us up to a really good score.
"The declaration was one where we felt we had enough in the first innings," Holder said. "And with time lost on the second day, we wanted to be able to bowl at Sri Lanka that evening. It worked out in our favour."
Sri Lanka were reeling at 30 for 3 owing to a fiery spell from Shannon Gabriel, setting the visitors back before they were bowled out cheaply.
Kieran Powell's 88 in the second innings, helped Windies extend their lead, and Holder's chipping in with another handy knock (39) before declaring ensured they finished with a total that would've been a mighty task for Sri Lanka to chase down in the fourth innings.
Eventually, Sri Lanka's failure with the bat, despite a century from opener Kusal Mendis (102), meant that the hosts reversed a trend of them losing the first Test of a series - having lost each of the first Tests in the nine previous series, barring the one against Zimbabwe.
"We had a lot of time to sit back and reflect on how the last year ended," Holder said.
"To start this series the way we've started it is quite pleasing. Knowing that in the past we've lost at the start of the series and were playing catch-up cricket, it was good to come out of the gates on a winning note," added Holder, who led his side to their first win since 2014 where they picked up a win over a side in the top nine in the ICC Test rankings in a first Test.

Incredibles 2 team wants sequel pushed for gender equality
The team of Incredibles 2 is batting more for gender equality as it features a very relevant plot line at a time of female empowerment in Hollywood, with the character of Elastigirl called to save the world while the character Mr. Incredible stays home to take care of the children.
The sequel is being made after 14 years and will show the adventures of Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and their three super-powered children - Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack, picking up exactly where the original left off.
According to a report, the writer and director of the films, Brad Bird, who also voices the character Edna Mode, said it was an essential choice to not jump the story forward into the future.
Bird told, Im not interested in making that story because I chose the powers around the roles that the characters had in the family.
He added. Fathers are always expected to be strong so I made him super strong. Mothers are pulled in 10 different directions at once so I had her stretch. Teenagers are insecure and defensive so I made her have force fields and invisibility. Ten year olds are energy balls and babies are unknown, so maybe he has no powers, maybe he has all the powers. That works if they are the ages that they are.
Producer Nicole Paradis Grindle said, that the first movie had a lot of really strong female characters.
Grindle said Brad had the idea that he wanted Helen (aka Elastigirl) to be the one to get the mission 14 years ago. There was that and the idea that the family did not that know Jack-Jack had powers, that informed the story that he wanted to tell. It turned out that it was a very timely issue, but I like to say that this is not a message film at all, this is just the way people live. Hollywood Reporter

Pawan Kalyan, Trivikram gave me complete freedom
Lyricist-turned-director Krishna Chaitanya speaks about his love for cinema and the making of his next film Chal Mohana Ranga.
On long break
My first directorial Rowdy Fellow was released in November 2014. Two years later, I started working on my second film Chal Mohana Ranga (CMR) on November 16, 2016. Trivikram and I discussed the story of CMR and worked on the screenplay for six months. Once everything is locked, we started the shooting before he moved to Agnyaathavaasi. That way, I took a gap of two years but technically speaking, as far as the release date is concerned, I took a break from the direction for four years (smiles).
A light-hearted story
Chal Mohana Ranga is a light-hearted entertainer. Its a simple story of two young people, who fall in love, part ways and fall in love all over again. Most love stories are similar to identical situations but the way the narrative unfolds makes the difference here. The film has a compelling narrative with memorable and relatable characters. Megha Akash will be seen as a half-Telugu and half-Tamil girl Megha Subrahmanyam, while Nithiin plays Mohana Ranga, who aspires to leave for the US for better prospects. Its a proper Telugu film with a moderate cross-culture drama in the second hour.
Once in a lifetime opportunity
Trivikram Srinivas liked Rowdy Fellow a lot and he was interested in working with me when I met him with Nithiin post the release of AAa. When he offered me this film and said he is providing the story...I took it as a privilege and grabbed the deal because its once in a lifetime opportunity. Being a director, we should be flexible enough to direct films penned by other writers. That way, he was convinced that I can do justice to his script.

Sri Lanka stands first in the world when it comes to immunization, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, Sri Lankas immunization programme has achieved a success of 99.9 percent. USA stands just below Sri Lanka, achieving 99.2 percent.
The Minister was addressing the gathering after opening the new Child and Maternal Health Clinic in Warakagoda, recently. The facility was built at a cost of Rs. 10 million. The clinic will serve 3,500 people in the area.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that UNICEF reports show that Sri Lankas infant and maternal mortality rates are significantly low and in parallel with two rich countries in the world, USA and Kuwait. This is because of the development of the primary health care service in Sri Lanka.
Today, there is no limit to the expenses made for cancer patients and all required drugs are provided to them. This is the real meaning of free health service. But in the past, the value of human life was measured by rupees and cents and there were limits to the expenses made for cancer drugs and treatment, the minister added.

Achilles the Cat, Russias deaf but highly gifted World Cup soothsayer
Saint Petersburg, Saturday: A deaf, white cat named Achilles is soon to begin his work as Russia's official soothsayer for the World Cup, following in the tentacle-prints of Paul the Octopus who became a star in 2010.
Paul predicted winners for that years' World Cup by choosing one out of two boxes containing food, while Achilles will be presented with bowls marked with teams' flags.
We went for Achilles because he is beautiful, first of all, but also because -- like all white cats with blue eyes -- he is deaf, so he has a great deal of intuition, he sees with his heart," said Anna Kasatkina, a vet who oversees guard-cats at Saint Petersburg's Hermitage museum.
For the World Cup, Achilles will move out of his lifelong home of the basements of the Hermitage, where he works with a team of dozens of other cats to keep the world-famous museum free of rodents.
Instead he will live at the "Cat Republic" cafe nearby.
He's going to live here for the duration of the tournament to keep him 'on form', since he has more opportunity to move and also meet guests, Kasatkina told AFP.
The cat is not the first animal to be positioned as successor to the celebrated Paul, who became the world's most famous mollusc when he correctly predicted all the matches of the German team during the South African World Cup. He went on to predict the victory of Spain in the final.
Swiss guinea pig Madame Shiva made a play for the crown in 2014, as did British Piranha Pele, but neither quite had Paul's foresight. AFP

Aloysiuss revision petition fixed for further argument on July 4
A revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena seeking an Interim Order to release them on bail was yesterday fixed for further argument on July 4 by the Court of Appeal.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General informed Court that there is no illegality in the order made by the Colombo Fort Magistrate regarding suspects bail. He further submitted to court that the petitioners have no legal rights to invoke Court Appeals jurisdiction through a revision petition.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana had informed Court that the prosecutors have followed an illegal procedure by presenting the Presidential Commission into the Central Bank Bond issue before the Magistrate in order to contaminate the Magistrates mind. He argued that bail has been refused after perusing the recommendations made by the Presidential Commission without having a proper magisterial inquiry into the issue.
When the matter came up before Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne, the matter was fixed for further argument on July 4.
The suspects were remanded in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issuance.
Arjun Aloysius states that by his application he was seeking Courts Jurisdiction to set aside the order dated March 9, 2018 of the Colombo High Court in Revision Application No. HCRA 22/2018.
The High Court refused notice in the Revision Application for affirming order dated 16-02-2018 made by the Magistrates Court of Fort in proceedings bearing No.B/8266/18, refusing the grant of Bail and committing the Petitioner to remand custody.
Aloysius states that he was arrested and produced before the Magistrates Court of Fort on February 4, 2018 and committed to remand custody by the Magistrates Court of Fort on February 4 and February 16 and thereafter, at the behest of and on the strength of further reports filed by the Criminal Investigation Department, in connection with an investigation commenced upon a complaint dated 25-11-2016, made by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Controversial sil redi distribution case
Appeal petitions to be heard on Nov 26
Two appeal petitions, filed by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita, challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court, were yesterday fixed for argument on November 26 by the Court of Appeal.
Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita had been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
When the two appeal petitions came up before Court of Appeal Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli, both Weeratunga and Palpita were directed to file their written submissions on October 5.
The Attorney General was directed to file his written submissions on October 5.
On September 7 last year, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC over the controversial sil redi (fabric used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Through their appeal applications, two accused-appellants stated that they were seeking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to review and set aside their conviction imposed by the High Court dated September 7, 2018.
In their petitions, the accused-appellants stated that neither a sum of Rs. 600 million nor a part of it was utilised by them for their personal gains. They further stated that the High Court judge had given them a short period of time (13 days) to pay off the compensations.
While handing out a lengthy judgement, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015 Presidential Election.
While observing that a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
Each accused were further ordered to pay a fine of Rs. two million and in default of the payment of fine, they will have to serve an additional one years imprisonment.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former TRC Director General Anusha Palpita under three counts, in connection with a criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015 Presidential Election campaign. They were found guilty of all charges.
Counsel Kanchana Ratwatte with J. Ratnayake appeared for the appellant-accused. Senior State Counsel Jayalakshi Silva appeared for the Attorney General.

Bangladesh beat India by 3 wickets to clinch Women's Asia Cup
KUALA LUMPUR, Sunday - Six-time defending champions India suffered a three-wicket defeat against Bangladesh in the final of the Women's Asia Cup Twenty20 cricket tournament at the Kinrara Academy Oval in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday.
After India scored 112/9, thanks to Harmanpreet Kaur's 56, Bangladesh managed to get over the line in the final ball of their innings.
Bangladesh were in control for the major part of the match. Even after Nigar Sultana (27 off 24) got out in the second ball of the 16th over, when Bangladesh were 83/4, Rumana Ahmed (23 off 22) did well to bring down the required runs to 13 off the last two overs.
In the penultimate over, Deepti Sharma gave away only four runs, keeping India in the match. In the first three deliveries of the final over, delivered by Harmanpreet, Bangladesh got six runs, including a boundary from Rumana.
Harmanpreet made it a pulsating affair by removing Sanjida Islam (7) and Rumana -- a victim of run out, in the fourth and fifth deliveries. Rumana was stopped from reaching for her second run in the penultimate delivery, meaning Bangladesh needed two runs from the last ball.
Jahanara Alam scampered for two runs off the final ball to seal Bangladesh's first title in the continental championship which had seen India winning every title since its inception in 2004.
Bangladesh had earlier in the week defeated India by seven wickets -- which was their first win over the sub-continental giants in any format.
India 112/9 in 20 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 56; Rumana Ahmed 2/22, Khadija Tul Kubra 2/23)
Bangladesh 113-7 in 20 overs (Nigar Sultana 27, Rumana Ahmed 23; Poonam Yadav 4/9, Harmanpreet Kaur 2/19).

Bangladesh per capita income to surpass India in two years
Bangladeshs per capita income will breeze past Indias by 2020, provided the countrys economy continues to deliver market beating growth statistics.
In order to overtake its larger neighbour, Bangladesh will have to hold the GNI and GDP lead it has maintained over India in recent years.
Bangladesh has already outperformed India in social indicators such as child mortality rate, gender equality, and life expectancy. 
According to data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Bangladeshs per capita income went up by 39.11% to $1,355 in 2016 from $974 in 2013. Meanwhile, Indias per capita income moved up by 13.80% to $1,706 and Pakistan saw 20.62% growth to $1,462 over the same period.
In the three years from 2013-2016, Bangladeshs gross domestic product (at current prices) in dollar terms grew at a compounded annual rate (CAGR) of 12.9%, more than double the 5.6% by India.
Bangladeshs GDP has been showing steady growth in recent years. In the last fiscal year, Bangladesh witnessed a 7.28% growth in GDP, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).
In the budget for FY2018-19, Bangladesh is reportedly going to set a GDP growth target of 7.5%.  
Considering Bangladesh maintains the same growth gap in Gross National Income (GNI) and GDP with India, the country will overtake its larger neighbour in terms of per capita income by 2020, Centre for Policy Dialogue Research Director Khondaker Golam Moazzem told the Dhaka Tribune.
An advantage for Bangladesh is that its economy has been doing well in recent times and growth may remain the same, the economist said.
He added that while the future is bright for the country, the Bangladesh government should focus on employment generation to further increase per capita income.
He also urged the government to ensure a business friendly atmosphere in order to increase private sector investment .     
The manufacturing industry, especially the countrys $28 billion RMG sector, has been one of the heaviest contributors to Bangladeshs economic development.
The RMG sector has benefited from China shifting its business focus towards more hi-tech and value added products due to increases in labour costs. According to a World Bank study, a 1% apparel price increase in China would create 1.36% additional demand for Bangladeshi products.
Efforts to reduce child marriage, as well as increasing access to education, and financial inclusion for women, also played a role.
Furthermore, the completion of mega projects, such as the Padma Bridge and the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, in the coming years is also set to give Bangladeshs economy a boost.
The government has also made it a priority to set up a number of Special Economic Zones across the country in an effort to boost investment.
A key driver of economic growth in Bangladesh is its young population and the governments efforts to engage them in information technology. The government has already established aHi-Tech Park dedicated for the ICT sector.

Abhimansala 2
Caring for our disabled war heroes
Sergeant Major B. Sugadhadhasa (55) can neither walk nor talk properly. He was one of the victims of the attack on the Army Headquarters on April 25, 2006. His head was badly injured during the attack, resulting in his losing his memory. Today, he lives under the care of the Army rehabilitation centre, Abhimansala 2, in Kamburupitiya.
There are few people Sugadhadhasa recognises; one of them is Officer in Charge of Rehabilitation at Abhimansala 2, Major Sampath Palliaguru. When Major Palliaguru speaks to Sugadhadhasa, he immediately identifies him and says hello in return. According to Major Palliaguru, much has changed in Sugadhadhasa. He is not the same as he used to be, but with continuous medication and care given by the medical unit, he can now identify people and recall some events.
War and terrorist attacks were the most unfortunate events ever to have taken place in Sri Lanka. And it was the soldiers at the front who sacrificed their lives, eyes and limbs to safeguard the freedom and security of the country. If not for them, the country would still be facing terrorism.
In the aftermath of the war, what remains of them is fragments of what they used to be. Termed as disabled war heroes, they are only remembered either for political gain, or once a year, as the country commemorates the end of the war. On the days which are not so significant, they live out their lives in centres like Abhimansala Wellness Resort, established by the Sri Lanka Army to provide lifelong care for those who need it the most.
Commandant of Abhimansala, Lieutenant Colonel Aruna Wijekoon said the focus of Abhimansala was not only to give the disabled soldiers medical and physical support, but to also provide them support to lead a normal life, as much as possible.
Chief Ward Master Aravinda Eranganath added that this place gave war heroes strength to regain their confidence and uplift their spirits.
Not only do we give them medical treatment, but we also help them to physically, mentally, socially and spiritually reform themselves, he said.
Facilities at Abhimansala
Abhimansala was initiated by one-time Sri Lanka Army Commander Lieutenant General Jagath Jayasuriya and established under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in November 2012. All expenses of the facility were covered by the Sri Lanka Army and the villas and cottages were donated by well-wishers and corporates.
The primary motive was rehabilitation of disabled army personnel in every possible way.
Major Palliaguru explained that this was the second Abhimansala to be established; the first is in Anuradhapura, and the third, in Kurunegala. There is also Ranaviru Sevana in Ragama and Minhindu Seth Medura in Attidiya.
Lt. Colonel Wijekoon added that some of the disabled soldiers hardly had a choice when it came to returning to their families and lives before the war, and many would spend the rest of their lives in Abhimansala.
Strengthening their minds and changing their attitudes to think positively is the primary focus, he explained.
The entrance to Abhimansala looks more like a resort than a rehabilitation centre. It overlooks a lakefront and a chilling breeze envelopes cottages, villas and a swimming pool. The complex includes a reception, medical unit, gym, conference hall, basketball court, library with internet facilities, cafeteria and a swimming pool.
Major Palliaguru said that at present, Abhimansala 2 is home to 43 disabled soldiers.
Soldiers who are disabled but are still mobile have been given rooms in villas. There are five villas and each has two double rooms, where a total of four inmates live with a caretaker.
According to Lt. Colonel Wijekoon, Abhimansala has included unique aspects like allowing the families of the soldiers to come and stay over for a few days. There are fully-equipped cottages to accommodate the visitors.
Major Palliaguru said that a soldier has only to inform the administration of his familys visit and they would be provided all facilities, including free food.
Chief Ward Master Eranganath added that Abhimansala functioned not only as a caring centre, but also as a fully-equipped hospital, where medical treatment was provided, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychotherapy and hydrotherapy.
Many inmates still suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and need full-time care and attention, he said.
Mental strength initiatives
Inmates have received different types of injuries - from gunshots, motor blasts, explosions and artillery. There are 20 inmates in the medical ward who require 24-hour attention and the rest of the inmates live in the villas. There are 17 inmates who have no legs, four who have no hands, six who are blind and the rest suffer from memory loss or epilepsy.
Eranganath explained that priority is given to their medical requirements. In their spare time, they get involved in various activities such as music, art, crafts and meditation.
Major Palliaguru further said the challenge at times was to treat their mental health issues rather than their physical problems, as the several traumatic experiences they have undergone have left permanent mental scars.
Therefore, they are given counselling every month. Apart from that, special programmes are conducted to support them. They are also given vocational training to uplift their lives. There are very young soldiers who are in their late 20s. We give them all the support we can, so that even if they leave Abhimansala, they would know a skill to make a living with, said Lt. Colonel Wijekoon.
In the meantime, he said that the vocational training courses are held at outside locations and the soldiers are not very comfortable going out of Abhimansala, because those places are not equipped to meet the needs of the disabled.
The inmates are given holidays every 22 days to visit their homes. The administration also provides them with transportation.
Major Palliaguru said that there was an inmate who had packed his bags to go home, but he could not be sent home due to his physical condition.
We need to deal with such issues as well. The family members do not have enough facilities to treat and take care of them. And they are not used to their mood swings as well. Sometimes, they get very angry and we need to deal with them carefully, he said. Eranganath added that they never ever raise their voice to the inmates and take good care of them.
Major Palliaguru explained that recovery of these soldiers involved many aspects and added that each one of them carried some kind of personal issue that they have to deal with, along with their physical disability. We always try to help them through therapy and counselling and try to give them hope and strength to lead a happy life.
Lt. Colonel Wijekoon said that once the inmates feel that they could manage to lead a normal life with their families, they could go back to their homes and it is their choice to make a decision that best suits them.
Major Palliaguru said that some of the soldiers got married last year, but they were still with Abhimansala.
They can stay here until they fully recover. They can stay here and begin a new life with their families. We have trained them for that. Each soldier is taught to make a living, he said.
Every month, music, art or similar events are held at Abhimansala to lift their spirits. According to Lt. Colonel Wijekoon, many of them were talented and could sing, dance, make handicrafts and draw.
Major Palliaguru said that these activities keep them busy and help them forget their traumatic experiences. He said that they had a very experienced art teacher, but he passed away a few weeks back.
The soldiers really liked him. They got attached to him and produced a lot of art, under his tutelage. It is not easy to work with the inmates, but he did a good job, he said.
Major Palliaguru further said that they have requested the zonal education department to provide them with a new art teacher.
the disabled soldiers speak
Most of the injured war heroes are in their prime, but with disabilities that make them dependent on others. The majority of them are wheelchair-bound or bed-ridden, while others have impaired mobility, hearing, vision or speech defects. They need specialised nursing care and other assistance, which may not be possible in their own homes, as many hail from poor and rural backgrounds. The country, at present, has over 300 soldiers who are permanently disabled with multiple injuries.
Warrant Officer Sugath Ranjana who was injured a few days before the war ended, is now married and has two children. His second child is just three months old.
I talk to my wife and children over the phone and visit home whenever possible. I am very happy here, he said.
Corporal Tharindu Chamara (31) of the Vijayabahu Regiment was injured in a motor blast in May 2009. He was in Ranaviru Sevana prior to Abhimansala. He was injured just three months after he joined the Army.
Corporal Sandaruwan of the Gajaba Regiment was also injured in a motor blast, and both his lower limbs have been amputated. Today, although wheelchair-bound, he plays badminton. I have been undergoing physiotherapy, and I do not feel much pain now. Initially, it was very hard for me. Now I am at a much better place. I feel that even my legs have improved. So hopefully, in the future, I will get much better, he said.
Corporal Ruwan Madusanka (27) of the Gemunu Regiment was injured by a gunshot in Pudhukudiyiruppu in March 2009. He said it has been four years since he came to Abhimansala. With the help of the administration, Corporal Madusanka is making paper crafts and has been doing it for the last one-and-a-half years. There is some hope for us. We get enough moral support to do these activities, he said.
The majority of the soldiers residing in Abhimansala 2 were injured during the last phase of the war. Many carry the hope that they would one day recover and once again lead normal lives with their families.

Ceylinco General Insurance uses drones to inspect flood claims
Registering another industryfirst, Ceylinco General Insurance became the first insurance company in Sri Lanka to use drones to inspect locations still under water in order to settle claims speedily, enabling its customers to return to normalcy in the shortest possible time. Staff of Ceylinco General Insurance acted promptly to pay compensation to all of its policy holders with flood cover within 10 days, fulfilling its promise of swift settlement of claims, which is strongly embedded in the companys core value chain. Accordingly, claims were paid to flood- damaged Vehicles, Warehouses, Go-downs, Shops, Offices, Factories, Construction sites and to Home Owners numbering several hundreds.
Staff members of Ceylinco General Insurance visited each and every location affected by the recent floods. The areas they could not reach due to flood waters not having receded were inspected by sending a drone from the furthest place that they could travel. By sending a drone, we can determine the extent of damage then and there, without waiting for flood waters to recede. This saved a lot of time and we were able to compensate some of our customers who were affected by the floods even before the flood waters receded, a staff member said.
Several individuals affected by the floods expressed their gratitude to Ceylinco General Insurance for the prompt action taken to pay compensation in such a speedy manner. M. C.M. Ajwad, Proprietor of Faumia Rice Products in Wennappuwa, said that his claim was paid no sooner his estimate was submitted and that he was able to restart his business within a few days due to the prompt settlement of his claim.
Similarly, E. M. Thilakasena of Shanthi Batteries, Kuliyapitiya said that he was surprised to see staff of Ceylinco General Insurances Kuliyapitiya branch inspecting claims whilst water levels were still about 2-3 feet high and expressed his gratitude for the swift settlement of his claim.
Patrick Alwis, Managing Director of Ceylinco General Insurance said, This is the third year in a row that our country experienced floods during the same period of the year.
Also, we always give prior notice to our customers regarding safety measures that they could follow to minimise the damage. We have taken every precaution through proper reinsurance arrangements since we are backed by worlds best reinsurers. Our catastrophic risks are comprehensively covered through a NAT CAT cover from a world-renowned AA rated reinsurer.
In 2016, Ceylinco General Insurance announced a comprehensive Natural Disaster cover for Traders and Home Owners to cover their properties, including buildings and the stocks of traders; and in the case of home owners, to insure their homes and valuable contents.

Cancerous issue
Recently it was reported in the papers that the Health Minister has approved of two Russian cancer drugs for use in our cancer hospitals after seeking the advice of the WHO. The GMOA, who has earned a reputation for using other peoples paws for pulling the chestnuts out of the fire, is demanding that the minister first obtain the approval of our oncologists before sanctioning the use of the drugs in our hospitals.
Now before our oncologists grant approval it is presumed they will have to depend not on their intuition but on a fully fledged double-blind trial for which they may not have the competence or the resources. Double-blind trials are costly and highly technical things and not the bread and butter of common or garden oncologists, where the placebo at times, playing a startling role giving a cure rate that supersedes the drug.
The GMOA has a habit of barking up the wrong tree. It is more profitable if they stay in hospitals dispensing the usual panadols and aspirins and not on the roads than get into terrains that are beyond their blockheads.
Then doctors were admired and venerated. Now they are hated and despised for holding the poor and helpless to ransom at the drop of a coin.

## Title: Cock-of-the-walk and chicken talk!
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Tuesday, June 12, 2018 - 01:00
Cock-of-the-walk and chicken talk!
I have never considered myself a fancy cock-of-the-walk by any standards. But my Chinese zodiac birth sign insists that I am. That is because I came squealing into this world in the Year of the Rooster. In Chinese astrology the animal signs assigned by year represent what others perceive you as being or how you present yourself.
To tell the truth, I found it agreeable to be associated with the positive characteristics of the chanticleer that marked me out as a bird of the feather. Naturally, so would you if you were branded with such head-swelling correlated attributes as conveyed in the ancient astrological chart. Which states: The Rooster can be forthright, brave, enthusiastic, loyal, tenacious, resilient, adventurous, astute, well-dressed, proficient, down-to-earth, gregarious, communicative, sensible, generous, charming, ebullient and terminally witty.
But the negative features of my alter ego described in the subsequent chapter are far from complimentary. Because just as you are floating on air with the flattering tributes ringing in your head you find yourself on the depressive down-swing of the pendulum.
Although decidedly unfavourable it appears to have a neutralizing effect on your psyche when assailed by such analysis as: The Rooster can also be cranky, fussy, vain, self-involved, blindly egotistical, pretentious, high-handed, cynical, mercurial, self-absorbed and quixotic as hell.
So the jaunty cockerels are virtually in the same breath adulated and admonished in the same blasted almanac. Well, birds of a feather sometimes do flop together! When I was eight-years-old an uncle once placed an almost hatched egg under the Christmas tree. It was to be my eggs-tra ordinary gift. It was placed in a cotton-wool padded shoe box with a light bulb for warmth.
When I woke up and was enjoying opening up my presents I was delighted by the sight of a fuzzy little black chick chirping at me from a cracked shell. It turned out to be quite a chic chick and began ranging the house and large garden.
Everyone was quick to call him the eggs-plorer! It was not difficult to hand-raise him. He turned out to be a bantam cockerel and I named him Bravo. The iridescent feathers of his green and red tail and wings against his black body shimmered with his cocky walk when he followed me around.
People often commented that the pet bird had an uncanny resemblance to its little owner, or was it the other way around They claimed we demonstrated the same feisty and insufferable characteristics. But to my utter annoyance they never mentioned that he was as handsome and flamboyant as they come.
The dumb clucks stressed on the likeness of the swagger, the full-throated crowing, the cockscombs and the confrontational attitude. And never mind the wicked, insinuating hints of the birds personal pleasurable proclivities they predicted I would inherit in the future. I was not amused. After all, it was inconsequential cockamamie chicken talk and humour most fowl.
Chickens may seem an odd choice for a pet, but they can be very engaging, friendly and entertaining. Contrary to popular belief they can easily be tamed and trained with food rewards. Chickens have distinct and interesting personalities. Bravo had a great soul in a little body.
Still, it takes a tough man to tame a wayward spring chicken or a rambunctious old rooster. Bravo was the epitome of the ostentatious, socially dominant strutting cockerel who strayed quite often. Everyone realised that the little rooster had soon established top social rank in the free-ranging flocks pecking order.
Although the hand-raised bantam seemed to favour my companionship more than that of his own feathered kin and followed me around on my jaunts. Yet he had a tendency to disappear suddenly.
But he would always come home to roost looking a bit bedraggled with a triumphal twinkle in his beady eye. I aptly nicknamed him The Shuttlecock. Such absences were constrained by his overwhelming passion for romancing the neighbouring free-ranging hens.
Bravo to be sure, was a plucky little fellow and displayed his fearlessness among the domesticated roosters, many of them twice his own weight. He may have been a Bantam but he would never hesitate when taking on the ruffled heavyweights.
His cocky attitude had given him a reputation for arrogance, aggression and promiscuity. The cockfights usually took place when Bravo boldly entered their domain with one thing in mind. He was courting their jealously guarded feminine flocks. And at least five aggressive males formed an impressive phalanx to guard their harems from his advances.
But the tough country cocks were no match for my beautifully-plumed bantam even when they ganged up on him. The feisty Bravo charged his opponents in one kamikaze onslaught after another.
Bravo usually had his way with the hens of his choice after several brief skirmishes with the ruling roosters of the flocks. He loved hanging around the chic chicks and even the old hens never even put up a token squawk when he made his concupiscent forays.
All they seemed to say in chicken cackle was: Cluckety cluck, what eggs-traordinary luck! The biggest of those roosters was a coward. He was a big blustering bully. But the fact remained that he was chicken even for a chicken. As a fighting-cock, Bravo set the feathers flying and beat him into a cocked hat.
Besides, everyone thought that the hens fancied the handsome coquettish chanticleer far more than the bland coloured males of their own brood. Concerning Bravo, we may have been the cocks-of-the walk but although we did have our differences he deferred to me in the pecking order.
After all, going by the old parody of sticking feathers up where Yankee-Doodle stuck his does not make you a chicken. You have got to have flair. So all you kukula types out there simply shake a tail feather and start strutting your stuff.
Besides, Chinese astrology doesnt seem all that cockeyed as far as the positive aspects of my rooster personality are concerned. As for the negative viewpoint I would say its a whole lot of poppycock! You can be cocksure of that.

Business Focus  Part 28
Competitor analysis key to unlock winning marketing strategy
The extent of rivalry in an industry is subject to the number, size and intention of the various players. The competition is aggravated when the market is not growing and when costs are escalating. Companies in such an industry find it difficult to make decent returns or even to survive. This is where assessing the competitors becomes a crucial process in business planning.
A competitor analysis provides you with the knowledge to make an informed decision on what aspect of your company gives you a competitive edge. Creating a PR or marketing plan without solid research on your competitors is like competing in a game without knowing the judging criteria.
The customer is your judge, and they have done their research. So, should you! Depending on your niche, professionals create different types of competitor analysis reports based on ratings and research.
Besides the basics, there are four stones that usually remain unturned in a competitor analysis. They are the keys to strong positioning and should be a fundamental driving concept to your overall campaign.
Understand your horizontal
Finding the balance between your opposition in the industry, and where to find the highest return, is one of the most effective ways to create a strategy. Correlate where your competition is light - allowing you to pick the low hanging fruit - and you still could earn a return on investment (ROI).
Understanding your horizontal plane is a common-sense formula. It keeps you grounded to reality, and whats actually possible. This doesnt mean dont dream big, but you mustnt miss the more obvious opportunities either.
Understand your vertical
Part of understanding where your companys low hanging fruit grows is finding your vertical market. Vertical refers to the various niche markets surrounding your industry. For example, if you sell motion sensor water sprinklers, your horizontal competitors are other home and garden companies selling water sprinklers.
Think in vertical terms, and you can narrow the competition by specializing in a particular niche, water sprinklers to keep animals out of your yard, for example. This presents your company with an entirely different target audience to pursue.
Explore the big picture marketplace for your products, and the competition in each niche.
Behind the scenes activity
Once you know your vertical, and horizontal -where your low hanging fruit grows, its time to figure out how to beat your competitors. Find out where your competitors are seen online. Simply type in your competitors URL to view what websites link back to their website. Odds are, if the blog or news site carried an article from your competition, they will accept one from you as well.
Knowing your competitors online activity gives you an upper hand in discovering their strategies and goals. If you see a competitor lowering their prices it might be a tactic to increase their market share. Keeping an eye on your competitors activities will help you anticipate their goals and respond strategically.
Ranking popularity
Your competitions fiscal performance only tells one side of the story. Whats behind their success or failure is what you need to find out. Studying a competitors shortcomings is just as important as knowing why they succeed. Your campaign must take into consideration both preventative and proactive tactics.
Investigating customer reviews online, and comments on social media, creates a different approach to analyzing competitors, as well as your own SWOT analysis. See whats trending about your competitor on the Internet, or read the tweets they were mentioned in. Consider gathering a good portion of your competitor analysis data on Twitter. This will help you better understand your competition in the eyes of your consumer.
Now, let us come back to basics
Some businesses think it is best to get on with their own plans and ignore the competition. Some become obsessed with tracking the actions of competitors - often using underhand or illegal methods. Other businesses are happy simply to track the competition, copying their moves and reacting to changes.
Competitor analysis has several important roles in strategic planning: (1) It helps management understand their competitive advantages/disadvantages relative to competitors. (2) It generates understanding of competitors past, present (and most importantly) future strategies. (3) It provides an informed basis to develop strategies to achieve competitive advantage in the future. (4) It forecasts the returns that may be made from future investments (e.g. how will competitors respond to a new product or pricing strategy
Casual knowledge about competitors usually is insufficient in competitor analysis. Rather, competitors should be analyzed systematically, using organized competitor intelligence-gathering to compile a wide array of information so that well informed strategy decisions can be made.
Framework
The framework for analyzing competitors is based on the following four key aspects of a competitor: (1) Competitors objectives, (2) Competitors assumptions, (3) Competitors strategy, (4) Competitors capabilities. (Note  1 and 2 are what drive the competitor, and 3 and 4 are what the competitor is doing or is capable of doing).
Sources
There are a number of sources of information for competitor analysis. The sources of competitor information can be neatly grouped into three categories:
(1) Recorded data: this is easily available in published form either internally or externally. Good examples include competitor annual reports, press releases, newspaper or magazine articles, Government reports, presentations and product brochures;
(2) Observable data: this has to be actively sought and often assembled from several sources. A good example is competitor pricing, advertising campaigns, tenders;
(3) Opportunistic data: to get hold of this kind of data requires a lot of planning and organization. Much of it is anecdotal, coming from discussions with suppliers, customers and, perhaps, previous management of competitors, trade shows, seminars and conferences and recruiting ex-employees.
The process of gathering competitive data is similar to a jigsaw puzzle. Each individual piece of data does not have much value. The important skill is to collect all pieces and to assemble them into an overall picture of the competitor. This enables you to identify any missing pieces and to take the necessary steps to collect them.
Business Objectives
To predict your competitors future moves you should first have a good understanding of their business objectives. Where and how they want to grow their business and how are they different to your own.
(1) Do any of your competitors have fundamentally different objectives to your own organization You should be able to determine why they are so different. Are they successful Should you be interested in adopting them as your own These fundamentally different objectives need to be monitored and analyzed as they tend to have the ability to shift the market dramatically one way or another
(2) Examine your main rivals past actions and objectives. What were the drivers for these
(3) Are there indicators of failure with the objectives / evidence of past capital expendture, trademark or research activity If so has this made the firms risk adverse and is this reflected in the scope of their objectives
(4) What are the implicit objectives of your rival firms down the street What are the directors saying to their clients and to the press Are they different to the objectives you understand to be true If they are not known to be true, what else are they exaggerating the truth with
(5) Monitor on an ongoing basis what the directors and management are saying. What are they not saying Do they indicate any current objectives Monitor your own firms press coverage. What are you giving away to your rivals What are the industry experts saying about you and your rivals future position
(6) Where do your rival organizations want to go What are their plans Will these plans distract them from their core activities or will they be forced to drop non-core sectors Are there opportunities for you
It is likely that your objectives as well as those of your rivals will probably have a number of strategies. You would like to  sell more of the same products/services in existing markets, develop more business in new markets, introduce new products/services into current markets, - acquire or move into suppliers or customers areas of expertise to ensure continued supply of own services, achieve increased sales, profits, return on assets or investment etc.
These are critical objectives upon which your organizations future development rests. Determine carefully what your rivals strategies are in these fields.
Strategies
The purpose of competitive strategy is to build a sustainable competitive advantage over the organizations rivals. It defines the fundamental decisions that guide the organizations marketing, financial management and operating strategies.
Three basic strategic approaches are possible:
Offensive strategy - This strategy often requires significant capital investment and includes radical options. (a) Changing or altering the competitive structure or environment in your industry (forward or backward integration, acquiring competitors, etc.). (b) Anticipating industry competitive structural change and positioning your organization to exploit this change before others recognize it (developing substitute products, changing the mode of sale or distribution, etc.). (c) Diversifying into more attractive markets.
Defensive strategy  This strategy accepts the industry competitive forces as a given and position your organization to best defend against them. As a last resort this could include harvesting and selling the business before competitive conditions cause its value to drop.
Guerilla or niche strategy  This includes minimizing or neutralizing barriers by reducing the size of the playing field and taking an offensive or defensive position in a smaller, more attractive market segment.
Every business has some sort of a competitive strategy. However, many strategies are implicit, having evolved over time, rather than explicitly formulated from a thinking and planning process. Implicit strategies lack focus, produce inconsistent decisions, and unknowingly become obsolete. Without a well-defined strategy, organizations will be driven by current operational issues rather than by a planned future vision.

CPC Private Bowser Owners call temporary halt to planned strike
The Ceylon Petroleum Private Bowser Owners Association (CPPBOA) which met Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) officials and Minister Arjuna Ranatunga yesterday decided to temporarily halt their strike action..
The Minister said that there were few problems in the previous price formula for the transportation of fuel and that the officials and the members of the Association would have to work out a new one, CPPBOA Secretary Shantha Silva said.
He added that the report on the above subject would be submitted to the Minister on Friday. Depending on the formula and prices, we would decide on whether to strike or not, Silva said.
The formula for fuel transportation had been previously worked out by CPC officials and the Association in 2016 and it was scheduled to come into effect on December 1,2016.
The Union had earlier asked for a 12.5 percent increase. With officials and ministers being changed however, the pricing formula too has found itself back on the drawing board. In April this year, the government introduced a fuel pricing formula which would reflect world oil prices and it would be changed every two months.
Thus fuel transport prices too would have to be adjusted to keep in line with new fuel prices. Private bowsers transport close to 80 percent of the total volume of fuel island-wide.
The CPPBOA has more than 8,500 bowsers whilst the CPC manages with 600 bowsers.

South Africa name four-man pace attack
Dale Steyn picked for Sri Lanka Tests
JOHANNESBURG, Monday: Much-injured fast bowler Dale Steyn was on Monday named in a 15-man South African squad for two Test matches in Sri Lanka next month.
Steyn, who turns 35 on June 27, has missed 27 of South Africas most recent 32 Test matches. He has been plagued by groin, shoulder and heel problems and was unable to complete the most recent tests he started, against Australia in November 2016 and India in January this year.
The South African squad includes three spin bowlers, including uncapped leg-spinner Shaun von Berg, while Steyn is one of four fast bowlers.
Steyn is spending a short-term stint with English county Hampshire.
In his first match since suffering a heel injury in the first Test against India in January, he took one for 80 in a one-day match against Somerset last week and he claimed two for 91 in the first innings of a current first-class fixture against Sussex.
Although South African coach Ottis Gibson has said a fully-fit Steyn would be included in the countrys team, Steyn will be competing with world number one bowler Kagiso Rabada, experienced seamer Vernon Philander and exciting youngster Lungi Ngidi for a starting place in a country where it is unlikely that more than three fast bowlers will be picked.
Selection convener Linda Zondi welcomed Steyn's return "in our pack of world-class seamers, particularly in view of the retirement of Morne Morkel."
Zondi said Rabada had fully recovered from a "lower back stress reaction"  a possible prelude to a stress fracture  that kept him out of the Indian Premier League recently.
Steyn has 419 Test wickets  two short of Shaun Pollocks South African record of 421.South Africa picked a varied trio of spinners.
Left-arm orthodox spinner Keshav Maharaj will be backed up by left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi and leg-spinner Von Berg, who is also a capable batsman.
The Tests will be followed by five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 international. Squads for these matches will be announced later.
South African squad: Faf du Plessis (captain), Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wkt), Theunis de Bruyn, Dean Elgar, Heinrich Klaasen (wkt), Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Lungi Ngidi, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi, Dale Steyn, Shaun von Berg. AFP

Deadpool 2
Deadweight thrill for  comic fans
Wade Wilson decides to commit suicide. But death doesn't come easily for him. He has to wade across the rough stream with several barriers: juggernauts, cyborgs, mutant kids and a haunting past that targets his fiance. Deadpool 2 would have been just another stinker if not for its storyline well-scripted to a comic effect.
Marvel comics are primarily known for comedy. Yes, it makes sense. Comedy writers have that knack for thrilling the audience with laughter over laughter with black comedy elements. [Deadpool 2 is no exception.
The movie deserves the attention of the comic fans and maybe a welcome escape for the other genre-enthusiasts. Typical of a Marvel comic we are introduced to sanguinary scenes. But for the other genre-enthusiasts, there is a bit of homework recommended. To enjoy every dialogue in its entirety, you need to be familiar with allied movies (at least Avengers: Infinity War, for instance). You cannot just step into the movie out of the blue and enjoy the movie. The full thrill is exclusive for Marvel fans. The overly used f-word characterises Wade Wilson and the R rating of the movie. Wilson's character is sweet-natured, his voice calm and quiet. The words pour in the venom and filth but his tone is otherwise. Reynolds voice overcoming through the superhero fabric is intoxicating enough.
The scriptwriters, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds (who stars the title role) deserve kudos for a brilliant job with a script full of witty and humorous dialogues. If the dialogues were to be written down, it would have to be read between the lines. But then thats what makes comics so popular  the witty dialogues.
Wade Wilson is an offshoot of a Marvel character launched in the 1990s. The character satiates the audiences taste for superhero thrill. Metal poles piercing Wilson's head and a moment later Colossus pulls it out as if it is a pin.
Sight and sound matter quite much in this movie. Thats it with the gory scenes of how his X-team dies one by one (except for lucky Domino) along with incredible Hulk type Cyborgs and juggernauts. The beautifully crafted yet comic tension is when Wilson is torn asunder and a few days later the so-called Batman is up and about to fight injustice. Thats exactly what the scriptwriters to drive the point home, imperishable nature.
Even though Wilson tries to commit suicide by immolation, he would not succeed in it. His body parts are still alive to make sure his story is not over yet. Wilson tries to seek revenge, but later he comes to terms with his own fury. He chooses the other path  good over evil. His R rated language, comic voiceover aside, it is his sense of righteousness that emerges. That is subject to glorification especially through his association with the fellow characters.
With Russell, the mutant kid, he tries to convince that revenge is not the remedy. He overpowers Cable, the Cyborg time traveller, with his sense of righteousness. Colossus rejects to assist him but turns up at the last minute. On face value, here is someone who is quite vicious. But as the plot progresses, the audience gets to know the genuine figure within him. Wilsons companions, both enemies and friends at certain stages, Cable, Colossus, Dopinder and Russell lament his death.
All this is set against the love story between Vanessa and Wade. The story comes alive with Vanessas death and Wade trying to reunite with her in the afterlife. Vanessa is not only his love but also his guardian angel. The constant vision of her in Wilsons mind elevates the comical scenes into some philosophically questioning grounds. That strikes the ultimate balance between the mere comedy and the science-fiction.

Forestpin hosts session on Fraud Risk Management
The importance of Fraud Risk Management is significantly highlighted globally due to the dynamic business environment with increase volumes of operations and complexity, leading towards greater vulnerability of risk. Therefore, the focus on mitigating such risk is essential to ensure that stakeholders are safeguarded by potential fraud affecting their respective organizations.
In order to ensure the awareness and discuss upon the Role of board of directors towards Fraud Risk Management, a session was organized by Forestpin PVT Ltd recently at Shangri-La Hotel Colombo, focusing on Board Directors from major companies within Sri Lanka.
The session was able to cover a broad spectrum of Fraud Risk Management ranging from understanding the basics of fraud, identifying the best practices towards combatting fraud and analyzing real life case studies for better understanding which enabled the participants to grasp the importance of the entire concept.
The program commenced with a networking session over breakfast leading towards a quiz where the participants focused on fraud case studies to obtain an initial understanding on different types of fraud, their scale of impact along with subsequent penalties. The participants also went in depth by analyzing some financial record based questions to identify hidden potential human errors and fraud with the potential towards operational risk. The main focus of the program was concentrated towards the lecture conducted by Dato Raveendraumar Nathan, Managing Principal of Rimbun Malaysia and Mr. Raymon Ram, Managing Director of Graymatter Forensic Advisory, Malaysia. The session was rich with content analyzing the core basics of fraud and the entire spectrum related to managing fraud.
Fraud was identified as an intentional act or an omission which is designed to deceive external parties resulting in a victim suffering a loss or where the perpetrator achieves a gain.
These occupational frauds where analyzed upon the categorization as Corruption, Asset Misappropriation and Financial Statement Fraud.
The 2018 Fraud statistics by Association of Fraud Examiners (ACFE) were discussed which revealed that 55% of the total fraud cases were relate to Asset Misappropriations. Even though the higher frequency of such cases it was identified that when the impact of fraud is analyzed, Financial Statement Fraud even though with lesser frequency had the most impact.
Through the intuition gained from actual statistics, measures to safeguard organizations were analyzed which highlighted the role of the board of directors to provide governance oversight to safeguard interest of shareholders.
Further managing fraud was identified as a continuous cyclic process focusing on detection, prevention and responding where immense responsibility was upon those in positions of authority making them the custodians of the wealth.
The session was of immense value and was an eye opener for the participants towards Fraud Risk Management which is of great importance although currently an area of minimal attention.
The feedback from the participants highlighted the effectiveness of the session and their willingness and thoughts on the future such sessions which they were interested in the domains of fraud risk management.

Girl who was told  she was paralysed defies odds
A girl who was told she was paralysed from the skull down is defying doctors by getting out of her wheelchair to run, rock climb, dance and swim.
Nine-year-old Seattle Lennox, from Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, lost her ability to walk after suffering a spinal cord injury called Transverse Myelitis (TM) after suffering a cold at 15 months old.
The paralysis was caused by an inflammation of both sides of a section of the spinal cord that can develop at any time and interrupts messages sent to the rest of the body.
Doctors didnt think she would survive the attack, which rarely occurs in young children, and believed the best-case scenario was paralysis from the skull down.
However, thanks to years of therapy, Seattle has been able to get out of her chair, and has even forced herself to try activities alongside her siblings.
Miraculously, Seattle can now swim, run, dance and rock climb.
Despite being active again, Seattle suffers from crippling fatigue and low muscle function. However, she battles on  often pushing herself to the point where her legs physically stop working.
The symptoms of fatigue affect her while shes in school and sometimes cause her to fall asleep on her desk.
Her mother Lindsay said, The doctors still stare in amazement every time they see her. They cannot believe it. She sees her brother, sister and friends doing things and shell want to do it so badly that shell just push herself. Shes willing to try anything. She is just so determined. Thats how she has been able to do all of this. Sometimes she even pushes herself so much that shell suddenly fall down.
She continued, Before, doctors either thought she was going to die or be completely paralyzed for the rest of her life. Shes the best swimmer in the family. We go swimming every day in the summer and she just swims for hours and hours. Running really gives her momentum. She usually doesnt even have to stop.
Seattle also stays positive while going through medical treatments, even smiling during her procedures.
After having a foot reconstruction surgery in September, she was supposed to stay home for two months, but returned to school a month early.
Lindsay has shared her daughters positivity online to inspire TM patients around the world.
She said, Ill look at her when shes going through an intense procedure and shell be smiling. Even though she needed to recover, she wanted to be back in school. Ive had other families write to me and tell me that they are thankful that our story is out there and that it inspires them. We have Transverse Myelitis friends all over the world.
Alongside a supportive family, Seattles classmates are also very encouraging, and try to help her as much as they can.
She has never dealt with bullying, and the other kids are incredibly fond of her.
However, Seattle will get upset sometimes that her body gets tired, meaning her friends can keep playing while she cant.
Her limited muscle strength also makes it difficult for her to write.
Lindsay said, Shell have so many good ideas sometimes, but she wont be able to get them down on paper. Sometimes shell have to take a seat and it will really bother her that her friends are still running around the playground.
In addition, something as simple as cold can cause her to relapse, losing her walking abilities again and possibly leading to Multiple Sclerosis.
Lindsay said, Were constantly trying to make sure she doesnt get sick and we keep her home as much as possible during flu season.
Although many TM patients have suffered from a virus leading up to the injury, Gabrielle deFiebre of the Transverse Myelitis Association says a cause has not yet been identified.
Gabrielle, the associations associate director of research and education, said: There are no known risk factors or behaviors that predispose someone specifically to Transverse Myelitis.
Effects include residual motor weakness, sensory changes and bladder and bowel problems.

## Title: Gotas sudden love for Muslims

Gotas sudden love for Muslims
It appears that the Rajapaksas are at great pains to reconcile with the Muslim community which was virtually under siege during the latter stage of the former regime. A series of Ifthar ceremonies are currently being held with the participation of Mahinda Rajapaksa who do not fail to mention about the recent Kandy incidents and squarely lay the blame on the Yahapalanaya Government. Efforts are also being made to show that the Muslims were now repenting for voting en-bloc against Mahinda Rajapaksa on January 8 and to make out that the results of the recent local government election was a clear indication that Muslims have once again returned to the Rajapaksa fold.
Not to be outdone, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa too has been busy these days attending Ifthar ceremonies, when not presiding over Vipath Maga sessions, and going to great lengths to endear himself to the Muslim community. Attending an Ifthar ceremony at a leading star class hotel the other day, Rajapaksa junior did a mea culpa of sorts saying they (meaning the Rajapaksas) could have done certain things differently without leaving room for opportunists. He was of course referring to the rash of incidents targeting the Muslim community during the tailend of Rajapaksa rule. An English language Daily quoted Gota thus; The lies that were spread within the community and the actions that were instigated to cause unfortunate incidents led to a perception that the Muslim community has cause to be wary of the Rajapaksa administration. This is very far from the truth. Continuing he said; However those Muslim leaders who work closely with me and the former government know very well that we took great care to uphold the security and dignity of the Muslim people under very sensitive circumstances. He further said the false impression created by the lies and orchestrated incidents was so strong that they were unable to convince many in the Muslim community about the sincerity of their actions.
The Muslims present at the Ifthar attended by Gota may have been a handpicked audience loyal to the Rajapaksas. However the Muslim community at large could not have forgotten the events that unfolded during the last days of the Rajapaksa regime. When Gotabhaya says that they (meaning the Rajapaksas) took great care to uphold the dignity of the Muslim people under very sensitive circumstances he was being economical with the truth, to put it mildly.
How could he have upheld the dignity of Muslims by being pictured with a Buddhist monk who was running amok heaping calumny and gravely insulting the Muslim community, and their faith, by the latters virulent anti-halal campaign, to only name just one of a series of attacks launched against the community. Can the dignity of Muslims be more wounded than when GR is seen declaring open an office of the Bodhu Bala Sena, led by the self same maverick monk, only days after the latter leading the Aluthgama mayhem where mosques and businesses of Muslims were set on fire and many members of the community killed
He mentions about actions that were instigated to cause unfortunate incidents implying of course the anti-Rajapaksa elements. What, as the all powerful Defence Secretary, did he do when mobs led by the saffron brigade were hurling stones and causing damage to leading Muslim business establishments such as the Fashion Bug, while the police looked on. Was this the work of local and foreign elements attempting to drive a wedge between the Rajapaksa government and the Muslims, as reiterated by GR at the Ifthar ceremony
Nay, elections were fast approaching and this see no evil approach by the Rajapaksas, vis-a-vis attacks on the Muslim community, was clearly a means of harvesting the hard line nationalist vote in the South as was plain to anyone even with a modicum of intelligence. At a time when anti-Muslim sentiments were running high in the South it was, indeed, politik not to rock the boat by taking action against the perpetrators. Hence, the kid glove treatment given to the likes of Ven. Gnanasara, in the face of the virulent anti-Muslim campaign.
Rajapaksa, also at the Ifthar, spoke about uniting all communities living in this country. He said the intention of the Rajapaksa government was always to create a nation where Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims and people from every community in this country can get on with their lives, knowing that they are safe.
This from an individual whose brother, while he was President, banned the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil in schools and at public functions in the North and held Victory Parades in such a manner making the Tamil community feel they were a conquered race. So much for promoting unity.
It is plain to one and all that Gota is busy trying to win over the alienated Muslims knowing very well that he has as much a chance as a snowball in hell in inveigling the Tamil community in his all too obvious Presidential bid.

History beckons for Trump and Kim today
Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un are the unlikeliest of statesmen, but fate has thrown the US President and the North Korean Leader an opportunity granted to few historic figures -- together they can change the world.
Their summit in Singapore today -- which will begin with a one-on-one meeting, alongside translators -- represents an opening awaited for 70 years but that was unthinkable just months ago as they traded insults that sparked fears of a slide into nuclear war.
It could launch a process that could open the worlds last Cold War frontier, finally usher in a permanent peace to end the 1950-53 Korean war, reshape the geopolitics of the Asia-Pacific region and bring millions of North Koreans out of famine and isolation.
Nonetheless, the meltdown potentially raised political pressure on the President to come home from his summit with Kim with some genuine progress.
But if successful, the summit will be mentioned in the same breath as President Richard Nixons journey to meet Chinese patriarch Mao Zedong and the superpower talks between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev that precipitated the end of the Soviet Union.
But it also represents a massive risk, since a failed summit could short-circuit diplomacy and bring the two countries closer to a disastrous military conflict. Each side enters the talks in a plush resort on Singapores Sentosa island expressing optimism. - CNN

How the Trump-Kim Summit could play out
I have been to North Korea and spent 30 years working on the dangers posed by its development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. No matter how you slice it, next weeks summit in Singapore between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will be a major milestone. Regardless of how we got here, it presents an opportunity to make progress on one of the most challenging and intractable proliferation challenges of our era.
Over the past few months of on-again, off-again summit preparations, the most frequent question I have gotten is: What is the best thing that could happen, and what is the worst thing that could happen Ive expanded that to consider a wider range of outcomes, since Trump and Kim are both untested and unpredictable, to put it mildly.
How Little Rocket Man and the deranged dotard trod a path from insults to handshakes.
Best-case scenario: Real talks begin. Despite the ridiculously high expectations that have arisen ahead of the summit, the best outcome Trump and Kim could achieve at the hastily arranged meeting is to agree that the end goal for this new process is the full and verified elimination of nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula, along with diplomatic and political normalization between the United States and North Korea. To achieve this ambitious set of goals within a realistic timeframe, the two leaders should adopt a clear and detailed joint statement to guide the work of a team of negotiators to pursue both paths in parallel.
The goal should be for the leaders to come back together in a reasonable amount of time (six months or no more than a year) to codify the results. In the interim, the two should agree on how to define and ensure that the current North Korean testing freeze continues (what is allowed, what is not allowed) and on what the United States and its partners can agree to do to ensure the diplomatic process continues, including curtailing certain types of military activities that North Korea sees as preludes to offensive military action.
Worst-case scenario: Kim pulls a fast one. Trump claims he has mastered the art of the deal, but so far my perception is that he has been far too eager for a summit and that Kim has gained considerable ground over the past year at the expense of the United States in East Asia. If the summit makes progress on denuclearization, it will be worth it, but that remains a long shot. Failure to move the disarmament needle will have given Kim a major propaganda victory  equal status with the worlds only superpower  in exchange for little or no real sacrifices on his part.
This skeptical view could play out even worse in Singapore. Eager for the appearance of progress, and a bid for his own Nobel Peace Prize, Trump might just jump at a bad deal. There are many forms this could take. My nightmare is that Kim will try to sell Trump half a loaf, offering to hand over, say, 10 nuclear weapons and destroy 20 long-range missiles, claiming they are all he has.
North Korean offer to disarm
Even though the United States believes with good reason that Pyongyangs arsenal is much larger than that, Trump might try to sell this as a complete win, despite North Korea holding onto many more capabilities. Just as he took Russian President Vladimir Putins word that he did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump might take Kims word that his arsenal is smaller than the intelligence community  of which Trump is not a fan  says it is.
This is not the only bad scenario. Another might be a North Korean offer to disarm in two or three years  but only after the United States withdraws all troops from the Korean Peninsula. Given Trumps well-established views that alliances are more of a cost than a benefit for the United States, he might very well take the opportunity to bid the U.S.-South Korea alliance a fond farewell. Once committed to withdrawal, the United States would find it hard to reverse, and North Korea would have gained considerable leverage over the pace of nuclear disarmament, if indeed it ever gets there.
The unicorn deal. Beyond the best and worst cases, there are other possibilities. In one scenario, the United States pursues the idea that North Korea could and should immediately disarm at or just after the summit. Represented in the form of U.S. National Security Advisor John Boltons Libya model, the idea that North Korea should ship all of its nuclear weapons to an airport to be shipped abroad, and rapidly destroy all of its ballistic missiles, is neither politically nor technically feasible.
The number of nuclear weapons and amount of nuclear material North Korea has produced will take months, if not years, to determine and verify. No one could or should take North Koreas word. The details and intrusive access needed to confirm North Korean claims will take thousands of hours to achieve, and it will be years before the United States gains confidence in them. This has always been more than just a fantasy; rather, it is a proposal designed to sabotage the prospect of real progress toward disarmament in North Korea.
Disastrous effect
The train wreck. This possibility, sadly, remains all too possible. Thinking back to Trumps disastrous phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in January 2017, it is clear that when tired or unprepared, Trump can not only veer off script but become openly hostile. Singapore is almost a full day of flying time away from Washington. Even on Air Force One, that takes a toll.
If Kim offends Trump or pulls a bait and switch, or if Trump finds that one of his own advisors or South Korean President Moon Jae-in has misled him, things could turn nasty. He is not far removed from fire and fury and comparing nuclear buttons with North Korea and clearly feels he has the upper hand. If things turn out poorly, the summit could derail quickly, with disastrous effect.
While both leaders have an incentive for the summit to go well, Trump has displayed a lack of personal control time and time again, and Kim, having appeared as the more reasonable actor over the last six months, may have an incentive to goad Trump into a hostile display to further bolster his perceived position in South Korea as more reliable and less volatile than the U.S. president.
In the end, no one  neither Trump nor Kim nor anyone reading this  knows what will happen in Singapore. Summits are usually capstone affairs, where agreements negotiated by staff are codified. Sometimes leaders have to get together to make things happen, and this may be one of those times. But there is always a risk when negotiations happen this way, and given the personalities involved, those risks seem very real.
We should all be hoping for real progress, and if they achieve it, Trump, Moon, and Kim will deserve real credit. But youll excuse me if I reserve judgment until after the summit.

Ian Bell hits rare ton in tight Warwickshire-Glamorgan game
LONDON, Sunday - Ian Bells first Championship ton in two years steered Warwickshire to a 30-run first-innings lead over Glamorgan as they were dismissed for 250. But the visitors reached 55 for no wicket at the close, now 25 runs ahead.
Bells serene unbeaten 106 off 248 balls was supported by Jonathan Trott (run out in a mix-up with Bell for 57) and number nine Chris Wright (29).
Lukas Carey (3-56) and Andrew Salter (2-65) bowled well before Timm van der Gugten (4-65) cleaned up the tail.

England Test opener Alastair Cook kept himself in good form with a fourth first-class half-century of the summer to help county champions Essex rally against Lancashire at Old Trafford. Lancashire earned their third batting point before being bowled out for 301.
Cook survived a dropped catch on 22 and the early loss of Varun Chopra to Graham Onions as Essex raced to 119-1.
But Cook (58) and Tom Westley (41) both went in a burst of wickets before Ryan ten Doeschate (43) took Essex to 221-6. Rikki Clarke took 5-29 as Surrey gained the upper hand on day two by forcing Hampshire to follow on at Southampton.
Surrey were bowled out for 368, with Rory Burns making 151 and Ben Foakes 90 as Fidel Edwards claimed 5-93.
But Hampshire were soon in trouble against the Surrey seamers and lasted under 50 overs, with only three batsmen reaching double figures.Rilee Rossouw top scored with 46 in their 135 all out and they will bat again on day three, 233 runs behind. AFP

World Day Against Child Labour
ILO hails Sri Lanka as beacon of hope in South Asia
As the world celebrates World Day Against Child Labour today (12), the International Labour Organization (ILO) hailed Sri Lanka as a beacon of hope in South Asia.
In recognition of its efforts, Sri Lanka has been highlighted as a Pathfinder Country within Alliance 8.7, a global movement for the eradication of child labour.
According to the latest Child Activity Survey of the Department of Census of Statistics, only 1 per cent (or 43,714) of the child population in Sri Lanka is engaged in child labour, stated the ILO,the ILO added in a press release yesterday.
However, challenges remain in eliminating child labour and its worst forms. Some 39,007 children (0.9% of the child population in Sri Lanka) carry out hazardous forms of work. Children engaged in child labour must be removed from all forms of work for which they have not reached the minimum age; and hazardous child labour in particular, needs to be prioritised in a multi-agency approach to eliminate child labour.
In Sri Lanka, the majority of the children in child labour and hazardous forms of child labour are to be found in industry and services, rather than in agriculture.
There are more boys than girls in child labour and its hazardous forms. However, girls tend to work much longer hours than boys, while earning a lower income, the press release said.
Further, school attendance among children engaged in child labour was as low as 20%; dropping to as little as 12% among those in hazardous work.
These are the children often exposed to unsafe working conditions; and who suffer from work-related injuries, which impact their school and work attendance.
At the 4th Global Conference on the Sustained Eradication of Child Labour in Buenos Aires in 2017, the Government of Sri Lanka pledged to eradicate the worst forms of child labour by 2022. Sri Lanka has already raised the minimum age of school completion from 14 to 16 years, helping children begin their working lives later. Sri Lanka is also progressing towards ratification of the ILOs Protocol on Forced Labour that will provide greater protection to children in conditions of vulnerability and exploitation.
This year, the ILO Country Office in Colombo has partnered with the Ministry of Labour and Trade Union Relations to rally public opinion against child labour through electronic media programmes; and with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health to raise awareness of hazardous forms of work to children through school programmes, and to young workers through certified skills courses. Further, building a generation of healthy and productive people and protecting the rights of children was vital in reaching the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

It was his calling
Chrisantha de Silvas talent enabled him to win TNL Onstage 2007 and initially he had these great musical ideas and lyrics. But right throughout, he envisioned a band. Salvage was a kind of calling.
They are a group of people connecting on stage and delivering lyrics full of power and energy. They are a group of people who are vessels of music forming a super vessel. They are a great beast on stage. Melodies spoke to De Silva and found out how successful and forceful this super vessel is.
As with most good things in my life, Salvage was born out of necessity. Back in 2009, I needed a creative vessel for my musical ideas and lyrics. I had already been a part of a few projects and even tried performing solo, winning TNL Onstage 2007. But after a while I was back in limbo, when a guitarist called James Mather reached out to me after hearing my vocals on another track. And we met up to jam several times and work on some original Rock n Roll. I still remember taking a song I wrote, Follow You Home, to James, and how it came out completely different from what I had in mind, but still loving the final composition. We performed as Salvage in 2009 at a mini outdoor concert called No Handlebars with a few session musicians, said De Silva.
Not long after this, James had to migrate to Canada, and the current rhythm Guitarist Sajana Bupathi and De Silva went through a long list of line- up changes before they arrived at the current line- up, which is the most cohesive and explosive one yet. The beast or the super vessel was complete. Then it was a matter of unleashing the talent and power of the band.
We operate within the Rock n Roll spectrum. I hate to specify a sub- genre, because our songs range from Acoustic, Alternative to Hard & Progressive Rock. I am proud about this. Diversity always keeps it interesting for us and our fans, explained De Silva.
De Silva stated that inspiration finds them. It can come from the most unexpected sources. With the kind of brains and diversity they have in the band, one can could guess that the lyrics are highly creative.
Every human is a creative being and will express ideas in unique ways. Ive chosen lyrics, melodies and singing to do so. What Im trying to say is, inspiration can come from anything, from a personal emotion to a catchy guitar riff to the tale of a forbidden apple. Recently Ive written quite a bit from a story telling aspect for a very cool project we are cooking up soon, pointed out De Silva.
Composing the music and then performing in front of a live audience and seeing the crowd appreciate the music has made De Silvas dream come true. They have a vessel that is irresistible. The vessel is a juggernaut.
Truthfully, composing, performing and having people connect and respond to our music gives us purpose. For me, it is also therapeutic. Rock n Roll especially is a very passionate and sometimes aggressive form of music. It is a release to sing and play this music. It is also very hard to explain on paper. Come see a show, explained De Silva.
When it comes to fellow artistes, De Silva instantly connected to those who can make life interesting for him. If they can awaken something within him then he instantly focuses on them.
I love any artist who can alter how Im feeling. Music is like medicine, not only in the sense that it heals, but you respond to a song depending on what you are going through or how you are feeling. Timing is important. My friends would attest to the fact that I have some unusual tastes in artists. I recently discovered Regina Spektor and absolutely love her. My everyday playlists however include bands like Alter Bridge, Shine Down, Live and GnR, added De Silva.
The band has big plans. With the talent they have how could they not have big plans They are always looking at the next big gig. They are always looking forwards. They are positive thinking and they are looking to grow bigger and bigger.
We have some exciting things lined up over the next two years: a couple of music videos, live album and even a hybrid-theatre production. Other than that, a dream of mine is to play at a major Rock n Roll festival. Lollapalooza/ Download Festival anyone said De Silva.
De Silva correctly points out that they have a lot to be grateful for when it comes to success. They have a loyal following and though they have achieved a lot, they cant lose sight, for their fans have made them. They are blessed to have a following. No band is really self- made. Fame is fickle friend. The music industry is controlled by the audience.
The list is extensive. But really, I want to thank everyone who has come to see Salvage play. This is from the bottom of my heart. Our families have been a blessing to us. I am not sure how success is measured for a Sri Lankan, English Rock n Roll band. But persistence is key. Our music and lyrical themes tend to be uplifting, explained De Silva.
De Silva has message to anyone who wants to take up music. You need to be authentic and original. Dont let anyone prune your mind. At the end of the day you want your audience to love you and not your idol.
Thats a serious question. I wont recommend full time music to anyone who is making original music in Sri Lanka. But this what we need more to make a mark on the international charts. Finding your artistry is an excruciating process. It is however worth it. Idols are good, but remember you are (fortunately) not your idol. Be yourself, in every sense of the word. Work overtime on perfecting your skills. Perform as much as possible. For practicalities sake, dont give up your day job. It will put food on the table and inspire the artist in you to create, summed up De Silva.

Journey in search of conscience
The first to be named as having taken ill-gotten money from Perpetual Treasuries that is accused of being the principal actor in the Treasury bond scam was Dayasiri Jayasekera MP, one of the Sweet 16 that sits on a two-legged stool. Not content to be alone who revealed that there are 118 MPs in all who are similarly involved. It led to a frantic search involving appeals to the Presidents Secretary, the Speaker of Parliament, Director of the Government Archives etc. which ultimately drew a blank as the Honourable Speaker announced that there is no list of names of MPs having got money from Perpetual Treasuries.
Ironically it was revealed in Court on the same day that State Minister Sujeeva Senasinghe had received Rs.3.2 million. By this time Minister Sarath Fonseka has confessed to having received Rs. 100, 000. One can only infer that there could be many others despite the amicable Speaker being unaware of.
Now all these gentlemen have an excuse. They say the money was given for election expenses. It is fair, they claim in unison. Though it may not contradict the law, which has its own drawbacks, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth when a criminal finances a peoples representative. What altruistic motive has the former to finance the latter, unless to exert an undue influence on his conduct of official duties, if elected.
JO politicians
The latest situation is that some JO politicians have started accusing left and right various personalities including those in civil society movements so that the whole matter is converted into an insoluble puzzle which may give a chance to real culprits to pass the blame on strangers, for in local politics accusations are only traded but not pursued or proved.
This gives the culprits a time to lie low and then rise up with venom asking Have you proved us guilty This is the stand taken by leaders of the last regime accused of large-scale fraud, corruption and misuse of public property as the arm of law seems to be too short to reach them as Nanda Malini says in a popular song that her arm is too short to pick flowers.
That, however, is different from how an honourable gentleman would act if he is accused wrongly. He would prove the accusers wrong with facts and figures or seek redress from Courts of Law against defamation of his character. Anything else would mean hypocrisy.
There is a popular belief that one could lie to anybody but not to ones own conscience. So we set on a journey in search of conscience and immediately came up with a roadblock. Conscience is individual and others cant reach it or unlock it.
The only way to gauge it is through observation of the relevant persons words and deeds. In such instances circumstantial evidence such as the ash marks on the shoulder of the proverbial pumpkin thief becomes useful in pinning guilt. That is why investigating authorities search evidence among telephone conversations, Short Messages, correspondence and bank accounts of the accused persons.
Lies, damn lies and statistics
It must also be noted that voters too elect the same law-makers despite their drawbacks such as proven criminal past. That is how known rapists, murderers get elected, at times with enhanced votes too. It seems that voters have also lost their conscience.
Mark Twain wrote that there are three types of lies according to their intensity lies, damn lies and statistics. Our politicians use all of them so liberally that their conscience would have fled. Look at some of the beautiful ones that have flowed down their sacred mouths.
There was another reason for our failure to find conscience among politicians. The majority of them seem to suffer from dementia, even from a relatively young age. For example we lost our Worlds Best Finance Minister because he forgot how he came into possession of the house he was living with his family.
Another Minister who resigned from the Cabinet saying it was a shame to be a member of it stealthily returned to it after a period of time either because he lost his memory or because he lost his shame. Dayasiri Jayasekera MP forgot who had signed the cheque for Rs. 1 million he received from the Perpetual friends. Until the investigating officers told him Minister Sujeeva Senasinghe had forgotten the entire transaction with Aloysius.
The biggest tragedy at the moment is the crisis in the SLFP. It is split into three with one forming a rival party and yet claiming to be SLFP too. The latest faction  Sweet 16  also claims to be in the SLFP and even its members have high designations in the SLFP. President Sirisena claims to be the Leader of the entire party comprising all three factions. All (except perhaps good old Professor G L Peiris) say they abide by the Constitution of the SLFP. That means all are in the Government with the UNP officially. Hence their claim to be in the opposition is illegitimate. As far as conscience is considered it seems to be split into three!
So our search drew a blank. Perhaps there is no heart in the body politic, at least any sensitive one that would melt at popular grief. The task is then to build up an entire generation with humane characteristics, humanist humans, so to say.

Leo Wijesinghe
Born in Wellawatta 1933, 11 April at Kinross Avenue to be precise, he used to play cricket in the seminary gardens. His play mates were none other than Dr H.I.K Fernando, P.A.T Kelly, Bobby Ghouse and many other Peterites. He caught the cricket bug by listening to the cricket commentaries by the gravel voiced John Arlott, Alan McGilvray and Vic Richardson all these gentleman are no more with us. The voices of these greats were cascading into his living room from his little radio receiver. It was of course the famous 1948 Ashes series. The eager listener was none other than Leo Wijesinghe, he was a young kid then who later became a revered veteran of Sri Lanka cricket administration.
I managed to trace Leo down at Jambugasmulla in the vicinity of St Josephs Church. He resembled late great Arthur C. Clarke. Leo was a genial old gent with a photographic memory. I was dumbfounded when he started rattling away the names of cricket teams of yesteryear. He made me feel at home and without further ado invited me to his library where a mountainous collection of cricket books both old and new was there to be seen. They were neatly arranged in their rightful places.Cricketing documents dating well back were also neatly stacked in their respective shelves.His stock of these invaluable books have been regularly replenished by his kith and kin living in Australia and England.
Getting down to the nitty gritty of this article; Leo Wijesinghe was a member of the Nondescripts Cricket Club for 50 years. He was also the Manager of the NCC for 12 years. Leo recalled that in 2009 he was awarded a medal by the ICC for the services rendered to Sri Lanka Cricket together with Chandra Shaffter, Ana Punchihewa, Upali Dharmadasa and Hemaka Amarasuriya. Although Leo was in such august company, he shunned publicity.
Leo was actively involved with the Lions till he was 80 years. At present Leo is enjoying his retirement at Jambugasmulla together with his daughter and family and passes his time watching TV (he mentioned to me that he watched the recent IPL matches till one 1 a.m.). This goes to show that cricket is not only in his blood but in his bone marrow as well. He also reads and reminisces about the good old days with a close circle of friends.
Rewinding back to school cricket in the early fifties Leo stated that he represented only his house team and that was that. However his son Rohan has made up for that being a talented cricketer who played for Sri Lanka schools and St Josephs.
After an insignificant school career Leo joined Brooke Bonds in 1954. He was posted to one of their factories as a supervisor, again nothing to write home about. After grafting away for 37 years he was ultimately promoted as an executive.
Incidentally 4 years after joining Brooke Bonds, Leo was roped in to become the Secretary of Brooke Bonds due to the fact that the guy who was there had a nasty misadventure and was duly punished. Leo stated that he was utterly clueless as regards to the duties that were relevant to the post then. Late T Jayalingam who was a higher-up in the hierarchy at Brooke Bonds took Leo to meet late Mr Harold Broom who was the Chairman and that was it. According to Leo he spent 20 long years as the secretary of the sports club which covered a multitude of sports such as cricket, football, athletics, hockey, netball etc. Leo learnt the trade from grass roots which stood him in good stead for his future endeavours as an administrator.
Leo mentioned that he also served in the Mercantile Cricket Association Committee with Jayantha Mendis of Maharajas fame at the helm. In the good old days members were elected according to their merit, honesty and integrity unlike today where its a different ball game.
He made 3 overseas tours as the assistant manager to Michael Tissera with the Ceylon team. In the book Sunny Days by Sunil Gavaskar a mention has been made of Leo Wijesinghe, late Harold de Andrado and Eddie Melder had looked after me well during my last visit and I was looking forward to meeting them again. All three of them are not only cricket-mad but also keen students of the game and we have spent a lot of time talking cricket.
Leo was assistant treasurer of the Cricket Board for eight years when the late Minister Gamini Dissanayake was at the helm.
Leo was a gentleman to his fingertips and his son Rohan was really a chip off the old block.
Cricket administrators akin to Leo are hard to find and his wealth of experience could be invaluable to those fortunate to seek his advice. (Leo Wijesinghe could be contacted on 0723332772). On a humorous note my boss S.T. was fond of Leos wifes cutlets and thereafter he was nicknamed Cutlet.
Last but not the least Leo reminded me that Ranjit Fernando was also a good friend of his.
Changing the theme a little bit and hope Leo does not mind me encroaching, this does not apply to Leo Wijesinghe and Muthumudalige Pushpakumara. It could be a plight of a scribe and that is to state that however much I sweat out to compose articles and arrange times etc, by and large the interviewers do not even bother to call and say thank you. Am I digging my own grave by thinking that my articles are boring or do I put it down to plain ignorance or more importantly the lack of mastery of the Queens language what a pity!

Liquor ban on women case fixed for July 16
Three Fundamental Rights petitions filed by several social activists including popular actress Samanalee Fonseka seeking an interim order to suspend the re-imposition of the liquor ban on women by Gazette Notification dated January 18, 2018 was yesterday fixed for July 16 by the Supreme Court.
Three petitions were fixed for next month in order to look into the outcome of another FR petition filed over a similar issue.
The court was informed that the Supreme Court is to make a ruling regarding a parallel matter on June 18.
The petitioners had also sought to declare that the Ministry of Finance or the State are not entitled in Law to revoke the Excise Notification in a manner which prevents a female from lawfully being employed at a place of production and sale of liquor.
The petitioners cited Finance & Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga and the Attorney General as respondents.
The Petitioners state that by Excise Notification No.02/2018 dated January 10, 2018, the Minister of Finance has inter alia revised the Excise Notification No. 666 by inter alia repealing paragraphs 5(v) and 11(c) of the said Excise Notification No. 666.
The petitioners said Paragraph 11(c) indicates - Persons to whom Liquor is not to be sold or given - No liquor shall be sold or given.. (c) to a woman within the premises of a tavern
The Petitioners state that this prohibition was a draconian measure that was arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable and discriminatory to female citizens of the Republic.
The Petitioners state they were reliably informed that at a media briefing, a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Mahinda Samarasinghe has declared that at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers ostensibly held on January 16, 2016 the Cabinet of Ministers has purportedly decided to revoke the recent Gazette allowing women to purchase alcohol which the Petitioners verily believe refers to the said Excise Notification.
The Petitioners state that the above circumstances gives rise to a reasonable apprehension regarding an imminent infringement of the Petitioners right to equality and equal protection of the law guaranteed to them by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution in as much as-
(a)Any revocation of the said Excise Notification would be unreasonable.
(b)Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who have attained the requisite age specified by Law from being lawfully employed at places of production and sale of liquor.
(c)Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who has attained the requisite age specified by Law from lawfully purchasing liquor which is a legal product that can only be manufactured, distributed and sold with the express regulation and control of the State.
(d)An imposition of a prohibition applicable to members of only one gender would tantamount to an unequal treatment of the members of such gender.
The Petitioners state that the above circumstances gives rise to a reasonable apprehension regarding an imminent infringement of the Petitioners right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of their sex guaranteed to them by Article 12(2) of the Constitution.
Counsel Viran Corea with Thisya Weragoda and Thamali Dinushi Perera appeared for the petitioners.
Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

Local women say "me too," and no more
When Dilukshi Dalpethado stepped onto Bus 138 at the Fort Station in Colombo two weeks ago, she wasnt looking for attention. And she certainly wasnt expecting that the story of her ride would go viral.
Dalpethado, an assistant human resources manager from Kottawa, was just trying to get home after a long day at work. She says the bus was fairly empty when she got on, and for the most part it stayed that way. But a few stops later, an ordinary looking man walked on and, out of all the available seats, chose the row directly across from her.
I was minding my own business, listening to my music. After a while, I realized that this guy across the aisle was staring at me. And then I looked up at him and I see him doing his thing, masturbating right there.
Dalpethado recalls a wave of emotion overtaking her, including shame and anger. Mostly, though, she just felt hopeless.
It was really embarrassing, I really didnt know what to do. I was angry and I was upset, but it was an empty bus so I couldnt shout at this man.
But, she adds, I didnt want him to be looking at me. I could see him looking at me, looking at my legs and other parts of my body while he was doing his thing. And the only thing I could do was take a picture of him. When I took the phone out, he just shoved it back inside his pants. And immediately, as soon as I snapped the picture, he got down from the bus.
The story writes itself, and it isnt unique
When Dalpethado took the photo, she didnt immediately have plans to use it. But in a situation which made her feel stripped of her own autonomy, her phone, with its ability to at least document what happened, was the only weapon she had.
She stewed over the evenings events but hesitated to do something with the photo until two days later, when she found herself on the receiving end of a mans unwelcome advances yet again. This time, she was on a train as crowded as the 138 bus had been empty. It made little difference.
In a sea of people, she was groped.
When she got home, she decided shed had enough. Using the photo shed taken of the man whod harassed her two nights earlier, Dalpethado crafted a Facebook post detailing the weeks two incidents. She ended her message with an appeal to women:
If anyone touches you in an inappropriate way please open your palms wide open and give him one thundering slap OR hit him between his legs so he knows never to do that to anyone again!!!!! Don't be a victim of any kind of sexual harassment!!!!
Dalpethados words struck a chord. At the urging of friends, she turned her post from private to public, and within hours it went viral. At current count, the post has been liked over 1,500 times, shared over 4,000 times, and received over 150 comments.
Among those comments, most expressed admiration and solidarity, containing echoes of An identical thing happened to me last week! or I feel the same way!
A nationwide problem
If she didnt already know it, Dalpethados post reinforced the sad reality that as a victim of constant sexual harassment and assault, she is not alone. In her words, This happens to me, and most women I know, at least once a week.
The United Nations Family Planning Association (UNFPA) confirms as much, stating in a report released in March of this year that 90 percent of women in Sri Lanka have been sexually harassed on public buses or trains. Crucially, the report examines the connection between sexual harassment of women on public transportation and their further societal disenfranchisement, finding that the preponderance of such harassment negatively impacts women in other areas too.
On a base level, according to the report, sexual harassment of women on public transportation limits their mobility. Since public transportation is the most economically viable option for most Sri Lankans to move from point A to point B, its utilization acts as a catalyst for womens economic and social growth, allowing them to participate in the workforce.
However, when harassment on public transportation becomes the norm, women are less likely to utilize it. Which means they are less likely to work jobs that depend on them accessing affordable means of transportation.
As the UNFPA report illuminates, that is precisely what is happening in Sri Lanka. The issue is outlined as follows:
Combatting Street Harassment is a Global Effort
According to the Census of Population and Housing, Sri Lankas female labour force participation has decreased from 39.5 percent in 2006 to 34.7 percent in 2014. One of the key findings of the study was that 50 percent of the women surveyed used public transport as a means of travelling to their workplace. Thus, the issue [sexual harassment on public transportation] can be derived as a contributory factor to the decline in female labour force participation in Sri Lanka.
Even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in an economic statement released last Friday, acknowledged safe transportation for women as a prerequisite to their participation in the labour force.
Why not report
While most of the response to her viral Facebook post was positive, Dalpethado faced some skeptics, mostly men. They wondered why, if harassment on public transportation is such a persistent problem, she hasnt reported it to law enforcement authorities.
According to Deputy Director of the Children and Womens Division of Sri Lanka Police, W. A. S. P. Lanka Rajani Amarasena, when women face sexual harassment on public transportation they should immediately dial 119 or call the hotline, 2666666, and inform whoever answers of the bus number and the route, at which point the closest female police officer will stop the bus and inquire about the problem.
Dalpethado says her reasons for not reporting stem from a belief that her complaints wouldnt be taken seriously, or, worse, that she might be asked what she was wearing at the time and otherwise blamed for bringing the harassment on herself.
Right or wrong, Dalpethado isnt alone in this regard, either. According to the UNFPA report, 92 percent of respondents never sought help from law enforcement when facing sexual harassment on public transport, all for similar reasons to Dalpethado.
Attempts were made to contact the police and inquire about what efforts they might be taking to encourage more women to report, but they were unsuccessful.
There have been some external efforts to make reporting a more desirable option, such as the recent development of Women in Needs (WIN) 2six4 personal safety app. The app aims to help women and other bystanders take action against gender-based violence by assisting users in emergency situations, connecting them to service providers, and providing them with crucial legal information in the aftermath of an incident of gender-based violence. But, in the months since its release, the app has been downloaded fewer than 1,000 times.
#MeToo campaign
Coincidentally, at around the same time as Dalpethados Facebook post went viral, an international dialogue on gender-based violence began taking place on social media.
Earlier this month, in response to the barrage of horrific allegations of sexual harassment, assault, and rape levelled against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, American actress Alyssa Milano tweeted the following:
Me too. Suggested by a friend. If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote Me too as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.
And with that, a fire was lit. In its first 24 hours alone, the hashtag #MeToo was used by more than 4.7 million people in 12 million posts.
In Sri Lanka, one of those people was Vicky Shahjahan, a feminist and transgender activist who herself has been the target of endless harassment due to the open expression of her gender identity. She says that when she learned about the #MeToo campaign, she was inspired to participate.
Im one of the victims of this crime, every single day. And this campaign was instrumental in showing me and women like me that were not alone.
Along with an intimate self-portrait included in this article which she drew with graphite pencils on A4 paper, Shahjahan shared a Facebook status documenting the tribulations of life not just as a transgender woman, but as a woman in general. Like the response to Dalpethados, the response to Shahjahans post was largely positive and encouraging.
She says that in the aftermath of the campaign, she feels more empowered than ever to stand up for herself. She recalls an incident just last week when she was approached by strange men in Batticaloa who would not stop inquiring about her gender identity. In not as many words, she responded, Whats it to you
The #MeToo campaign has pushed me forward and shown me I no longer need to keep silent, she says.
Upending power dynamics
A perennial issue for victims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of gender-based violence around the world is that there is an imbalance of power between them and their assailants.
These power dynamics discourage women from reporting sexual harassment, and they mean that preventing it is largely out of a womans control. As the UNFPA report explains, if women avoid utilizing public transportation altogether, they risk disenfranchisement from the workforce. And as Dalpethados experiences prove, harassment happens in empty places as often as in crowded ones. Finally, as even the most modestly dressed woman can be and has been harassed, attire is hardly a determining factor.
So whats a woman to do
This brings us back to Dalpethado. Acknowledging that the odds were stacked against her, she was undeterred nonetheless. Using what little power she had, she stripped the man who harassed her on Bus 138 of his power by exposing him to the world, by shaming him publicly.
And shes not alone.
Across the internet and beyond, women have been upending traditional power dynamics governing gender by calling out the men who dare harass them, either by image or by name.
Within the Sri Lankan social-media-scape, there are even arenas dedicating to pinpointing such activities and the people who perpetrate them. Hi, Madam...bye Machang is a group on Facebook made up of over 1,000 or so denizens of Sri Lanka which aims to expose by naming the men who take to messaging female strangers on Facebook, despite how unprompted or unwanted they may be.
Perhaps this is a sign that the tides are turning, that the balance of power is slowly but surely shifting. After all, there is a common thread linking together all these stories: gone are the days in which women took harassment lying down. Though still skeptical of traditional reporting methods, women are refusing to be silent. And in doing so, in airing their grievances and forcing others to hear them, they are managing to make a difference.
Shahjahan, for her part, is cautiously optimistic.
She explained that earlier this week, she came across a man who lives near her home and who, one year back, verbally harassed her friend. This man told Shahjahan that before the #MeToo campaign, he didnt realize the negative effect his casually-slung words could have on a womans sense of safety.
In the aftermath of it, though, he realized the error of his ways. Reading the harassment stories of the women he personally knew online, he felt ashamed of his behaviour.
He asked Shahjahan to apologize to her friend on his behalf and then vowed never to do it again.

MFSAC opposes absorbing SAITM students into KDU
The Medical Faculty Students Action Committee (MFSAC) opposes absorbing SAITM students into the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). The minimum qualifications for absorbing was decided to get in close friends and minsters relatives, Committee Convener Didula Amarasinghe said.
He was addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday.
The minimum qualifications recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) have been totally ignored, he said. Amarasinghe said KDU authorities have the power to absorb SAITM students and to decide the degree they must follow. This sidelines the SLMC power in this regard.
Abolishing the SAITM could have been included in the Act presented to Parliament on June 8. No plans should be made to set up private medical faculties in Sri Lanka hereafter, he said.

Presidential Commission reveals
Mihin Lanka violated conditions with regard to tax concessions
It was disclosed at the Presidential Commission that Mihin Lanka company had violated conditions with regard to tax concessions and the company has failed to respond to Board of Investment queries.
The Presidential Commission investigating into the alleged frauds and malpractices at SriLankan catering, SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka met yesterday.
It was also divulged at the commission that no document related to the Cabinet decision for the establishment of Mihin Lanka was found from the BoI dossier.
BoI Director (Investment) Gamini Jayathilaka when inquired by Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe told the Commission that SriLankan catering, SriLankan airlines and Mihin Lanka had been exempt from Customs levy through the 2012 budget too.
Wijesinghe said that former Parliamentarian Sajin De Vass Gunawardena had submitted the application for the registration of Mihin Lanka airline with the Board of Investment on October 12, 2006 and he had mentioned his address as Presidential Secretariat, Colombo 01.
The BoI official added that his institution granted the approval on the following day itself and the relevant letter of approval was addressed to Sajin Vass Gunawardena.
He said that Mihin Lanka Chief Executive Kapila Chandrasena had sent a letter requesting the BoI to reduce the investment to US$ 50 million from US$ 100 million.
He had also requested to mention the investment as Rs.3,610 million instead of Rs. 610 billion. The BoI official giving evidence before the Commission said that the BoI informed Mihin Lanka to show reasons as to why the company is making this request to the BOI. He added that Mihin Lanka failed to respond to the BOI letter.

Irregularities in school admissions
Minister complains to President, PM
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has complained to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over illegal school admissions to primary sections of schools in several provinces, ignoring the Supreme Court orders on school admissions.
According to him, illegal school admissions to primary sections of government schools had taken place in the recent past in the North Western, Western, Central and Uva Provinces.
It was revealed that some politicians had misused their authority to admit students whose parents are their relatives and political henchmen.
The Education Ministry has pointed out that if this goes on, remote schools will have to close down in the near future, Kurunegala District Education Director W. M. Balasooriya told the Daily News.

Mobile services by UDA to mark anniversary
Measures have been taken by the UDA to conduct a special mobile service on June 18 from 10 am to 6 pm under the patronage of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, concurrent to the UDAs 40th anniversary celebrations.
Solutions pertaining to building construction, the division of land into plots and approvals, resolving of basic plans, issuance of compliance certificates and provision of solutions to development certification issues will be done during the service.
The UDA will be taking measures to issue the certifications pertaining to development conforming to modern standards and technology. Through this new online system, an applicant could apply for the relevant documentation and approval will be granted from the UDA from anywhere in the world. The UDAs intention is to make their services more efficient and less time-consuming.
Through the social and physical development coordination of the development areas identified by the minister, the UDA, which was established by the 1978 Parliamentary Act No. 41, intends to conduct an unprecedented service to the country.
In their approach to streamline urban development, the UDA intends to resolve issues pertaining to the preparation of development plans and prepare investment facilities. It also aims to resolve issues pertaining to development and related fields of urban population and resolve issues pertaining to other UDA affiliated institutions as well. This is a service to uplift the living standards of the urban population and also an investment for future generations.
The provision of solutions to issues related to urban development is a process involving rules and regulations. In some instances, although the UDA can provide direct solutions to problems faced by the urban community, in other instances, they have to work in collaboration with other affiliated institutions in providing solutions. To resolve this matter, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has instructed the UDA to device a mechanism where the UDA goes to the people to provide solutions to their issues instead of having the people come to them.
Therefore, in addition to the 13 Local Government institutions representing the Colombo district, officials from the Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board, Central Environmental Authority, Agriculture Services Authority, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Cooperation, Coast Conservation Department, Irrigation Corporation and the representatives of the Divisional Secretariats will be attending the mobile service.

## Title: Nchcholai CEB engineers threaten shutdown today

Nchcholai CEB engineers threaten shutdown today
If the authorities fail to provide a favourable response, the CEB Engineers who are currently on a work to rule campaign will decide to suspend work at the Norochcholai coal power plant today, said the CEB Engineers Union President Athula Wanniarachchi.
The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) had earlier warned that it will have to shut down the Norochcholai, Lakvijaya Coal Power Station, if the environmental protection license (EPL) is not granted by today.
Several other plants, including those at Matara and Embilipitiya, which need clearance certificates would also have to be shut down, the CEBEU President said.
This decision was taken by the Executive Committee of the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) last week and it was decided to refrain from attending to any breakdowns after regular working hours and on holidays, during the work to rule campaign.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Wanniarachchi said that they had received a letter from the CEB, but the CEBEU had not taken a decision on whether to call off the strike action today.
We will consider their response and make a decision. We demanded that they withdraw their plan and accept ours. We dont want to inconvenience the public, but as you can see, we cant keep operating power plants that do not have the necessary approval, he said.
The CEBEU claims that although the government had promised to solve the issues raised by the union, two of the main demands had not been fulfilled. The granting of approval to the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037 and appointing professionals with high integrity and an unblemished record to key posts in the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) are the two main demands.
However, the CEB Spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardena told the Daily News that the Norochcholai issue is linked to the long term power generation issue and the CEBEU had declared trade union action and work to rule action. Last week they declared that they would go for further trade union action and shutdown the operations of the Norochcholai coal power plant, Barge power plant, Chunnakkam thermal power plant and the Ace power plant in Embilipitiya which have issues with their licenses, both the PUCSL license and environmental license. The environmental license is applicable for the Norochcholai Coal power plant and the others were requested to obtain the long term power generation approval because those power plants are operating without the proper approvals of the PUCSL.
Last week we had a meeting with the Prime Minister together with representatives of the PUCSL and CEBEU, CEB and the two ministries. During the meeting it was agreed to submit the findings or recommendations of the committees by last Thursday to the PUCSL which they did. The PUCSL considered those recommendations last Friday and last morning they sent the decision to the CEB General Manager copied to the CEB Chairman. According to that decision, they informed that the PUCSL grants approval for the CEB Base Case plan, subject to the accommodation of already Cabinet approved government to government power plants and the latest government policy. That is the approval we received from the PUCSL. There are certain others but this is the main area we have concern over. They have also informed us to submit the least cost generation plan for 2020-2039 on or before April 2019 for the commissions approval. That is the second point they had notified the CEB General Manager.
Now it is up to the CEBEU to consider this decision and convey their stance, he said.
Meanwhile, CEB Trade Union Alliance Convener Ranjan Jayalal of the JVP said the threat made by the CEB engineers union to stop work by today amounts to sabotage and blamed the authorities for being weak in dealing with such threats.
They can threaten to remove their workers from operations, but cannot threaten to stop work. Such a threat is a punishable offence and I dont understand why the authorities are not taking any action against them. The government does not have the power to deal with this issue.
The CEBEU had ordered all bill payment counters to close on Saturdays. They have no authority to do so and although they claim they would not inconvenience the public, closing these bill payment counters is an inconvenience to them. The billing clerks dont want to do it but they are threatened and forced to comply. The government is helpless as they too are caught up in the CEBEU plot, he added.

Nearly 30 pc of farming population fallen prey to kidney diseases
The population in the North Central Province is 1,367,776 and of it, 65 percent earn their livelihoods by farming. It is learnt that 30 percent out of the farmer population in the province suffer from kidney diseases while 6.2 percent of those employed in the government sector are prey to the menace, according to a recent survey.
Those between 51 - 80 years are the most vulnerable to kidney ailments, it was found.
According to the provincial health service information sources, the number of kidney patients registered for treatment at government hospitals in the province is 16,676, which is 10,016 in Anuradhapura and 6,663 in Polonnaruwa. Around 300 persons in the North Central Province die of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
According to statistics, the majority of kidney patients in the country live in Medawachchiya MOH division amounting to 1,609 patients. Patients are also found in Padaviya (844), Kebithigollewa (608), Rambewa (1,100), Horowpothana (882) and Kahatagasdigiliya (549). With regard to Polonnaruwa, the majority of kidney patients live in Medirigiriya and Dimbulagala MOH divisions. The number of patients in these two divisions is 1,922 and 1,292. The least number of kidney patients in the Anuradhapura district is found in Palagala (311) and Rajangane (296).
In the Anuradhapura district, kidney patients were reported for the first time in the first quarter of 1990. Although nearly three decades had passed, the main reason for CKD and CKDu is yet to be found. Contaminated water, water containing heavy metal molecules such as Cadmium and Arsenic, and overuse of chemical fertiliser, insecticides and weedicides are among the main reasons cited by medical agencies and healthcare research teams.
Meanwhile, at a recent meeting concerning the controversial Thambuttegama and Rajangane water project, NCP Water Supply and Drainage Board Regional Manager C. S. Lokubarana said kidney patients were not found in areas that the Water Board distributed treated water. He said this encouraging situation is more evident in Anuradhapura, its suburbs and areas where Mahaweli water is used for drinking purposes.

President fulfills differently-abled students aspiration
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said he would grant an electric wheelchair to the student who obtained 3 A passes at the GCE (A/L) Examination 2017 in the Commerce stream.
The President instructed his officials to make arrangements to grant the chair very soon to P. M. Devin Indusara Rathnayake, who is differently-abled since his birth, but was clever enough to secure the island rank 48 in the Commerce stream.
He directed his officials to grant the wheelchair during the 40th anniversary celebration of the Science College in Mount Lavinia when Indusara was awarded as the 2017 most talented student in the school. Following a brief discussion with the student, the President instructed the officials to fulfill his aspiration to make his life easier.
President Sirisena said he would take steps to renovate the school playground on a request made during the ceremony.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs State Minister Mohan Lal Grero speaking at the ceremony said the future of the school is decided on the discipline and the education of the students rather than on its material properties.
He said the students should be well-taught and disciplined for them to be good citizens. Sri Lankan students are more creative, State Minister Grero said. Learning-by-heart culture has deviated them from using their inborn talent. Now we have reached a crucial juncture where we have to promote creativity in all aspects mainly on science and technology. It will drive the country forward along with the developed world, he said.

Renault Kwid enjoys three digit growth
Driving to the top of small car market French car brand, the Renault KWID, marketed by AMW in Sri Lanka, has reached an envious volume of growth for their vehicles recently.
Renault made its market debut in Sri Lanka at the end of 2016. Renault KWID was generating a monthly sales volume of around 30 cars per month at the beginning of 2017 thereby growing rapidly to generate its current sales volume of over 120 cars per month, and clinching over 4500 customer base in the process.
The brand has experienced a growth of 112% when comparing with 2017 and has achieved a robust three-digit growth in monthly sales.
This is an interesting turnaround for the brand that initially garnered bad reviews and complaints, which has now jumped to the position of being a true game changer after the product performance was proven and becoming a strong contender for other competing brands in the small car segment.
Commenting on these achievements, Chaminda Perera, Director of Renault Sri Lanka stated As per the feedback we have received, it has been shown that consumers look upon the KWID with its SUV-inspired styling and feature-rich interiors as a more premium car that breaks the monotony that the other small hatchback models in the market offer.
This has attracted a large number of young executives to consider the brand as a top option for their first car. It has also been a huge hit with the female market as it is an ideally stylish small car for women.
There are also those who have purchased it as a family car considering the vehicles space and fuel efficiency. On its distribution network, Perera said, the company already has 8 Renault dealers & 21 service outlets by the end of December 2017, making the car available in all the key regions of the country while giving easy access to their after sales network.
Shehann De Zoysa, General Manager of Renault Sri Lanka further added Our focus for 2018 will be to continue to build upon this growth trajectory, reflecting our long-term commitment to the Sri Lankan market in making the cars more accessible to customers across the country.

The Seeds of Japanese Soft Power
He goes by Peter though its not the name on his identity card, and he has no left arm. He lost it seven years ago while Chena farming near a swamp, when a crocodile took a bite. He also lost his job as a Chena farmer.
Chena farmingthe practice of clearing virgin forest area, setting it on fire, and cultivating it immediately afteris arduous, back-breaking labour which pays a menial wage. Still, until his fateful encounter with the crocodile, Peter went to work every day for over thirty years with no complaints.
I was so poor. My life was not good. But I have a family to feed, he says. Not working was not an option.
After he lost his arm, though, there were no options left. Peter could no longer Chena farm. And so he spent the next few years unemployed, hungry and desolate, each day wondering where hed get his next few rupees.
Now, in a twist of fate, Peter is gainfully self-employed as a passion fruit farmer in the Hambantota district. And to the surprise of many, he says losing his arm was the best thing that could have happened to him.
You think Im crazy. I see your face. But if I didnt lose my arm, I might have never met the Japanese. And the Japanese, well, they saved my life.
Upon recovering from his accidentas much as someone accustomed to life with two arms can recover with only onePeter sought out the Department of Agriculture, hoping someone there could help him get back on his feet. Representatives from the department put him in touch with JICA, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, which hosts an array of aid programmes in the region.
After a thorough screening process, JICA determined that Peter was a good candidate for its agricultural subsidy programme, and through the Department of Agriculture provided him not just with seedlings but with technical training. Now, in the backyard of his home, he has an entire field of passion fruit growing, which he sells to markets and retailers across the country. And rather than wonder where his next rupee or meal will come from, he feels, for the first time in his life, comfortable.
I am self-sufficient, Peter says. I have free time to play with my grandchildren and to be engaged in volunteer work. I always had a liking to help people, but before, the only person I could worry about helping was me.
I'm so happy now. Not just with JICA, but with myself and what I am doing at the moment. My life is good.
Two East Asian countries in search of regional influence
In the international forum, much media space has been dedicated to the complex and reliant relationship between Sri Lanka and China. A recent New York Times article published last month, titled, What the Worlds Emptiest International Airport Says About Chinas Influence, by Brook Larmer, explored this relationship by focusing on the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport in Hambantota, built and financed by the Chinese.
And yet, while that bilateral relationship is interesting  and, with the development of the Colombo Port City by the Chinese, ever more consequential  theres another east Asian country seeking its own foothold in the Indian Ocean with whom Sri Lankas bilateral relationship is often overlooked: Japan.
On the surface, the manners in which China and Japan have sought to widen their spheres of influence here have been vastly different. China has invested heavily in infrastructure in Sri Lanka  partially or fully funding the construction of not just the Mattala Airport and Colombo Port City, but the extension of the Southern Expressway to Hambantota and the citys deepwater port.
These developments are for the most part what Larmer of the New York Times calls white elephants, or possessions that are useless or troublesome, especially those that are expensive to maintain or difficult to dispose of. He draws upon the Mattala Airport, which was designed to handle a million passengers per year but currently receives only a dozen passengers per day, to argue that such white elephant projects are not driven by local economic needs, but by remote stratagems.
According to Larmer, these infrastructural investments by China in Sri Lanka are all part of the countrys ambitious goal to create a modern-day Silk Road... with all paths leading to China. The infrastructure is built, of course, with the expectation that China would be paid back  and if the debt could not be paid back, then, that it would be written off by giving China equity, often a majority stake, in the infrastructure project. This is precisely what has happened with the deep water Port in Hambantota  which China now controls 70% of for the next 99 years.
A different kind of power
Japan, on the other hand, has taken a, well, softer route. Investing heavily in cooperation and aid programmes, Japans influence in Sri Lanka is not as bound by financial obligations as it is by emotional appeal.
Japan, through JICA, provides six main types of assistance to Sri Lanka: technical cooperation, ODA (official development assistance) loans, grant aid, disaster relief, research, and cooperation through citizen participation.
Only loan aid is required to be paid back. These six forms of assistance supposedly all work toward the three priority areas for cooperation which Japan has outlined for the country: infrastructure for development and economic growth, social and economic improvement in rural areas, and social infrastructure to mitigate vulnerabilities.
The seedling subsidy programme through the Department of Agriculture, which Peter was a beneficiary of and says saved his life, falls under the umbrella of social and economic improvement in rural areas. Its a form of both grant aid and technical cooperation  as, since the year 2012, three Japanese agricultural experts have been living in Sri Lanka, visiting remote villages every day and working closely with communities to improve livelihoods through agricultural production.
Other programmes the Japanese have either funded or coordinated include demining efforts in the North, which the HALO Trust has said allowed for the demining of nearly 2,000 mines and other explosives in 2017 alone; the statistical eradication of child labour in Ratnapura, according to the International Labour Organization; and the provision of a long-awaited Doppler Weather Radar Network to Sri Lanka, which will allow the country to more accurately anticipate and prepare for deadly monsoons or droughts.
Like China, Japan too has invested in Sri Lankan infrastructure with loans that must be paid back. And yet the infrastructure projects it has chosen to fund are anything but white elephants.
Through the Sri Lankan Port Authority, Japan financed the construction of the Jaya Container Terminals 1, 2, 3, and 4, allowing the terminals to modernize their potential, an improvement that catalysed the rapid development and expansion of the port services.
Through the Road Development Authority, Japan financed the construction of 65 kilometres of the Southern Expressway, the sections between Kurundugahahetekma and Kokmaduwa.
Finally, also through the Road Development Authority, the Japanese are in the midst of financing the new bridge construction project over the Kelani River.
Which brings us to the present situation: two east Asian countries asserting their power here in very different waysone by constraining Sri Lanka monetarily and the other by currying favour, through aid programmes and necessary infrastructure, in the eyes of everyday Sri Lankans.
Geeth Sameera, an agricultural instructor with the Department of Agriculture in Hambantotaa region that has seen so much Chinese influence but has barely benefited from itput it this way.
Right now, China has our wallets, OK But thanks to agricultural programmes JICA has funded, Japan has our hearts.
Perhaps Japan, in this, is playing a long gamehoping that aid and assistance, rather than debts owed and infrastructure owned, will allow them to benefit from Sri Lankas all-important location in the end. That soft power will get the country further than hard power. As with most things, only time will tell.
