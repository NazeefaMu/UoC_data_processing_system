Medamulana Tax to settle previous regimes loans
The government has had to impose a Rs 0.20 Medamulana Tax on each Rs.1,000 transaction taken place in banks to create a fund to settle the loans obtained during the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday in response to Joint Opposition member Udaya Prabath Gammanpila during the round of questions for oral answers who queried if the government had obtained loans at high interest rates while charging that the previous government had taken loans at high interest rates.
Deputy Minister Silva further said the previous government had obtained loans at a very high interest rate of 9.9 in 2011 when the interest rates were comparatively low.
He added that the loan rates had increased recently all over the world. But, we have not taken loans at such high rates, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said.

2,500 Uda Gammanas by 2020: Minister Sajith
Two thousand five hundred Uda Gammanas will be set up by 2020, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
He was addressing the gathering at the opening of the Siythuru Gama Uda Gammana at Lunugamvehera, recently.
The minister opened the 46th Uda Gammana in Lunugamwehera which consists of all basic facilities including water, electricity and other infrastructure facilities.
The minister added that he was glad that former Suriyawewa Pradeshiya Sabha Deputy Chairman, who is a close associate of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, joined to strengthen the government and support it at the forthcoming elections.
More UPFA members have joined us recently, because they hail the services rendered by us to the people, Minister Premadasa said.
The minister said there was an era when farmers in the district took to the streets and launched protests demanding a fair price for their paddy. But today, the farmers are getting a fair price of Rs. 48 per kilo. The farmers have been benefitted greatly as a result of the farsighted policies of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He said his father, former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, launched the Sucharitha programme and commenced his political journey. He received bouquets and bricks both when he commenced his political career from the village. The minister said still there are 2.5 million families in the country who are suffering as a result of problems regarding housing. There are 80,000 families in the Hambantota district who have such problems. The Hambantota district will be converted to a better district within the forthcoming two years, the minister said.

Animal-friendly elements
Animal Rights Activist, Attorney Lalani Perera says the Budget 2018 include animal-friendly elements, which are laudable, Legal Counsel Lalani Perera said.
The Budget 2018 is not just people-friendly, but it also has animal-friendly elements. The proposal to move away from the caged zoo concept to an open cage concept at the Dehiwala Zoo might initiate more animal welfare plans, especially space-wise.
We have been trying for more space for all caged animals for years. Globally, the trend is to close down zoos. We in Sri Lanka request to open animal sanctuaries instead of opening zoos, he said. We really hope this will not be merely a proposal. The fund allocations for the proposals should be correctly used, Perera said.

Army come from behind to beat CH 20-15
The Army Sportsc lub ruggerites came from behind 10-15 with a superb second half rally to beat a fighting CH and FC side by 20 points ( 2 tries, 2 conversions, 2 penalties) to 15 ( 2 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) in their Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby first round match played at Race Course grounds in Reid Avenue, Colombo yesterday. At half time the winners were trailing 15 points to 10.
Army lads showed better control of the ball in perfect conditions and turned the match in their favour with a rousing game carried out in the second half.
The soldiers were always sure of what to do, in contrast to the CH ruggerites who only knew to run straight often running into their opposite number, there by lost the grip and hopes of winning seemed thrust under a dark cloud due to the game they played
However the CH and FC outfit staged a spirited performance in the first half by scoring two quick tries to take lead and go in to the breather with the scores reading 15 points to 10.
But the Army SC boys gave a superb brand of running rugby in the second half under the instructions of their head coach Nilfer Ibrahim, where they enjoyed major share of possession from the scrums, line outs, set pieces and the break downs by by giving a fine display to topple the CH team and dared to run the ball and gained territory whenever a gap in the opponents defence was detected.
Finally Army sealed the game by scoring only two tries in the entire game through wing three quarter Sudaraka Dikkumbura (one) and prop forward Shehan Silva (one) while the two conversions and the two penalties were slotted in by their reliable place kicker full back Gayan Salinda.

## Title: THE BUDGET LOOKS AT FUTURE REALITIES

THE BUDGET LOOKS AT FUTURE REALITIES
The third Budget of the National Unity Government presented by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera looks much more to the future than any Budget in post-independence Sri Lanka. There was also the tactical gain in the pre-budget Gazette which moved away from the practice of announcing price hikes before the Budget itself is announced in Parliament, and instead told of price reductions in several consumer items having great demand. This was an interesting political strategy that would leave little room for attacks on the main Budget proposals on the issue of the Cost of Living, while leaving room for these prices to be increased later.
The forward looking aspect of the Budget certainly gives much more meaning to acceptance of the advantages of modern technological progress, as well as, giving due consideration to the need to fight environmental pollution through acceptance of scientific developments. This is certainly a move going beyond the often empty claims of fighting environmental pollution told so often by many in government, and a practical approach to the issue. This is more relevant, considering the huge pollution that India is facing in New Delhi and many areas in the North of India just now, with atmospheric pollution levels being dangerously over the WHO recommended PM 2.5 for particle pollution.
With an Economic Development target of 5%, inflation to be kept under 6%, and the Budget Deficit to be 4.5% of GDP, the Finance Minister has certainly moved to a tough position, which will require continued assessment of, and possible curtailing of government expenditure that is considered wasteful. The progress in this would certainly require more than Finance Ministry activity, but a much larger participation of the Government, in all its sectors, in seeking to achieve these goals.
With the goal of a Green Environment there is an interesting goal of all State vehicles to be hybrid or electric by 2025, which goes with the important proposal to target the end the use of all fossil fuel cars by 2040. There is also the reduction of import tax on electric vehicles by Rs. 1 million, and also the increase in the import tax on luxury vehicles by around Rs. 2.5 million. An interesting question is how this increased duty would impact of Duty Free luxury vehicles for MPs.
There are interesting proposals on handling the three-wheeler situation, which will also benefit by the stress on electric driven vehicles. The support of locally assembled vehicles is encouraging, while the proposal to give assistance to three-wheel owners to export vehicles to Bangladesh is looking at a new direction in dealing with the growing issues of three-wheel owners. Another useful proposal, with a good look at future needs, is the decision to introduce electric buses to the SLTB, for public transport, at an initial cost of Rs. 500 million.
Another aspect of the futuristic approach of this Budget is the proposal to introduce a Carbon Tax, and expanding island-wide facilities for the charging of electric vehicles.
Fuel crisis and after
The Budget proposals that look at unfolding realities on the availability and supply of power, was in sharp contrast the situation that prevailed for three days, even till after the Minister of Finance rose to make his speech. The drop in fuel supply leading to large crowds at petrol stations, sometimes confrontation and even violence, drew attraction to the very bad planning in the storage and supply of petroleum in the country. The attempts to put the blame on the Indian Company IOC, due to one of its stocks being rejected by the CPC, was certainly a cheap and crooked move, as much as the attempts by the JO and some trade unions to not blame the failure of the Petroleum Corporation on the task of proper and adequate stock and storage facilities. One cannot understand how a major institution that is engaged in the supply of fuel to the country could not think of a possible and unexpected shortfall of fuel stock for at least two weeks.
While the ministerial committee appointed to look into this will have to give its report soon, it is hoped the Ministry of Petroleum and its institutions look at better ways of ensuring adequate stocks in the country. Apologizing to the country by the Minister and even those higher in government, is hardly of any benefit. The increase of storage facilities would certainly be necessary, and for this purpose, there must be a more practical, and not political outlook on the handling and improvement of the Trincomalee Oil Talk Farm, that came to us from the British. It would be useful to look at how Sri Lanka could cooperate with India, our next door neighbour that has modern technology in these areas of activity, for the necessary progress, instead of being moved by the politics of tactical suspicion that is of little benefit to the country.
Looking at this crisis in the context of the Budget proposals for more use of electricity in transport, it is evident that we must look at moving from fossil fuels, with great speed. While Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) would certainly help against any further increase of coal power, Sri Lanka must certainly look at how it can best benefit from Solar Power and also Wind Power, making good studies of how these are fast expanding, and providing more power to many countries in the world.
It will also be useful to look at the possibility of China helping us with technology in this regard, in view of the large strides that Beijing is taking in expanding Solar Power in that country. Of course there are suspicions that China is moving faster on renewable energy sources within the country, but heaping coal power on African countries. But, Sri Lanka must be a in a position to have better dealings with China in this regard, considering he investments that China is expected to make in the near future. The abundance of sunshine in the country must be made use of through of modern technology to make a major leap forward in fuel for future growth, which calls for both political and economic activity that is truly national in concept and interest, and not wholly capitalist investment.
Sobhitha Thera remembered
The remembrance of the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera on the second anniversary of his passing away did raise important issues on the policies and practices of the Government. This was due to Ven. Sobhitha Theras key role in the thinking and political strategy to elect the Common Candidate in January 2015, and defeat the Rajapaksa Regime.
President Maithripala Sirisena, speaking at the memorial gathering at Ape Gama Battaramulla, repeated his commitment to the policies of the Ven. Sobhitha Thera, emphasizing his interest in fighting corruption, very high in the late Theras agenda. He stressed interest in seeing those involved in the Treasury Bond Scam brought to justice; the goal of the Presidential Commission appointed by him. He underscored the necessity to bring about the cleaning up of government. It was not to target anyone in government, or an MP or Minister. It was a response to a huge outcry by the people.
Moving to the broader area of criticism leveled at him on every issue, which he saw as unfair, as he believed in the sharing of government duties, he reminded the need to be dedicated to social justice, rule of law and good government.
He said, I am not a person who is greedy for positions. I will go back as I came. I am not a person who came to this position to staybut a man who came to go. But I need the support of all to do my job properly, a very significant comment in the context of rising criticism, which he saw directed at him.
The other important observations here came from Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya, Chair of the National Movement for a Just Society, the former position of Ven. Sobhitha Thera. He said todays need is to correct the political culture distorted by the Rajapaksa Regime, and it was important to reflect on why the country decided to defeat the Rajapaksa Regime. He emphasized it was the responsibility of government to build the world as Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera saw it.
The need was for the Rule of Law, and there was still time for the governments leaders to fulfill this aim.
He said it was not easy to voice these wishes the same way it was done earlier, but it still needed to be done, with a dedication to realize the political restructuring Ven. Sobhitha Thera wished for.
He said: Our struggle against the political culture as created by the Rajapaksas should not be misread as an attempt to rebel against the present government, but to reach the cherished goals  which included having a new Constitution and abolishing the Executive Presidency, and power devolution with true reconciliation among the communities of Sri Lanka.

CA fixed for order on Dr. Padeniyas preliminary objections
The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for December 6 to deliver its order regarding the preliminary objections raised by Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya in respect of a charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements.
The Court was informed that the partied have filed written submissions regarding the preliminary objections. The Court of Appeal bench comprised Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne.
On a previous occasion, a charge sheet in open Court was served on GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya by the Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017, which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
However, Dr. Padeniya, through his lawyer, had informed the Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the Court stenographer.
On a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal issued an Interim Order (IO) preventing the GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this Contempt of Court action.
Two civil society activists Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr. Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by the Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment demanding for annulment or setting aside of the said judgment.
The petitioners further stated that in this backdrop, the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against the SAITM following the Courts decision ordering the SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017, the GMOA had organised an island wide trade union action against the SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish the SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process, and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under topic of Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged with the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing the GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge to impose a sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya appeared for the petitioners. Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana appeared for the respondent.

Chris Gayle wants to sell defamation case story for $420,000
Chris Gayle is hoping to cash in on his defamation case with Fairfax Media after the West Indies cricketer announced bidding for his tell-all story will begin at $420,000.
Gayle is seeking to sell details of the recent court case to the highest bidder, with a promise to potential buyers that what went on behind the scenes was like a movie.
Gayle won his case against Fairfax, which published a series of articles in 2016 alleging he exposed his penis to a masseuse, at the supreme court in Sydney last month. In a series of posts on Twitter, the 38-year-old former Test captain suggested there was an agenda against him before and after the court appearance, and a move to get him banned from cricket.
I have a very interested successful story to tell, he wrote. It can be an exclusive 60mins interview or yall just have to wait on my next book!
Its about what transpired in court and behind the scenes in Australia, how they went to bigger heads to get me ban.
How they want to use me as a scapegoat over a interview  Ill tell you what I do every day after court, believe me, when I break this down to yall it will be like a movie.
Gayle added that there would be no holding back and that he had so much to say.
Gayle was accused by the masseuse, Leanne Russell, of pulling his towel down to expose himself in the change rooms at Drummoyne Oval in 2015.
The jury at the supreme court took less than two hours to find the articles published were untrue.
Gayle, who captained the West Indies Test team between 2007 and 2010 and is known for his big-hitting and aggressive style of batting, sued Fairfax for the articles which he said were untrue and had damaged his reputation.
Even what transpired in the mediation couple weeks before court ... they take me lightly but I never scared of the media! Gayle wrote on Friday. I was ready to fight until my last breath! Who ready for my story just let me know.
Gayle, one of the most explosive batsmen the game has seen, holds a number of records across all forms of the game, including being the only player in the world to have scored a triple hundred in Test cricket, a double hundred in an ODI and a century in a T20 international.
He has scored 15 Test centuries and is one of just four players to have hit two triple centuries at that level, but it is in limited overs cricket where he has forged a reputation as one of the best to have played the game.
He was the first player to reach 200 in a World Cup game and became the first player to score a T20 World Cup century. He also shares the record for the fastest half century in T20 cricket  achieved in just 12 balls.
In total he has hit 18 T20 centuries, marking him out as one of the most destructive batsmen in the business and making him one of the most sought-after players on the nomadic T20 circuit.
Gayle has plied his trade in a number of T20 competitions, including Australias Big Bash League, the T20 Blast in England and the Indian Premier League.

DEBT LEVY TO BE BORNE BY BANKS
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday cleared any doubts on the newly imposed Debt Repayment Levy.
He reiterated that the said levy must be borne by the banks and could not be passed on to the consumer.
While recapping on his budgetary proposals for 2018, Minister Samaraweera termed the Debt Repayment Levy of Rs. 2 per Rs 10,000 on all cash transactions for three years from April 1, 2018 as the Medamulana Tax.
Minister Samaraweera was addressing his first post-Budget press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
You are well aware of the massive debt repayments due in the next two years. The countrys debt was no different to the Meethotamulla garbage mound when we took office in 2015. Despite that, we have undertaken a lot of development activities in the country. We need some support to confront the debt burden. The banks will get an income tax waiver in return, he explained.
The Minister said the government introduced a price formula based on the alcohol percentage for liquor in the budget proposals for 2018 with the intention to discourage youth from hard liquor.
According to global trends, the majority of people in many countries are used to consume soft liquor such as beer and wine, instead of hard liquor. In Sri Lanka, only 13 percent of alcohol users consume soft liquor, while 84 percent are consuming hard liquor. A recent survey conducted by the Colombo University has found that 49 percent of alcohol consumers are addicted to moonshine. Therefore, we should rescue the al public, especially our youth from moonshine, the minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said tourist guesthouses will be allowed to sell soft liquor under a licence. Some have expressed fears that after introducing this procedure, everyone will sell liquor even at their homes. It will not be allowed. If a guest house owner wants to get the license he will have to register with the Divisional Secretariat in the area. He should also produce a tax file. Nobody will be able to sell liquor without obtaining a licence, he added.
Commenting on the Carbon Tax, the minister clarified that it would be higher for old vehicles. For motor cycles, three-wheelers, Maruti cars and Prado jeeps not older than five years, the carbon tax will be 17 cents, 27 cents, one rupee and Rs.4.10 per day respectively. If they are older than 10 years, the tax will be 51 cents per day for motor cycles, 82 cents per day for three wheelers and Rs.3.25 per day for Maruti cars, the minister explained.
Questioned by journalists as to why the Carbon tax is imposed on the engine capacity without applying it on the amount of fuel consumption, the Minister clarified that the Government had to choose a simple method to avoid practical difficulties.
The Minister, while agreeing to consider extending the duty reduction on brand new electric cars to include electric cars used for a short period, said the vehicle import duties have been simplified using a new formula.
Clarifying on the tax of Rs.2 per minute for a call per telecommunication tower, the Minster pointed out the reports saying that the call cost would rise by Rs.2 is totally false.
State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne explained that the aim of the said tax was to reduce the number of telecom towers and the Government expects the service providing companies to bear the cost without passing it to the consumers.
The minister also elucidated the proposals made in the Budget to regularise the three wheelers, adding that special concessions have been given to import electric three-wheelers.
Three-wheel drivers will be offered free training by the Tourism Authority and those who complete it will receive a sticker stating Tourist Board approved tuk-tuks and even giving a special colour to them is being considered, he added.
Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, Deputy Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalla, Economic Advisors to the Minister Deshal de Mel and Mano Thittawela also attended the media briefing.

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said school teachers need to organize school trips for schoolchildren to inspire and expand their horizons.
I request teachers to select places such as rehabilitation centres and cancer hospitals for students to really see the world, learn lessons and expand their understanding, President Sirisena also said.
He made these observations at the annual prize giving of Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa on Thursday.
President Sirisena pointed out that the present government has given priority to education. He said the most wonderful voice in the world is the voice of children. He also said children should succeed in both education and extra-curricular activities to realize their dreams.
The government has given the utmost priority for education as part of our governments policy. For a strong country, we need smart, skilled and educated people. We have taken several steps towards this goal. Providing education to all children is the most important endeavour, President Sirisena said.
There should be no defects in the education system. It is important to provide the education sector with all necessary facilities. We have allocated more for the education sector in the last two years; more than any other government ever did. According to my knowledge, the second most important place given in the Budget is the education sector. There are all sorts of educational institutes in the country but all of us should go for one objective, he said.
I am not just a father, but also a grandfather. When my granddaughter gets ready to go to school in the morning, she comes to our room and chats with her grandmother. We, as a government and as parents, should listen to the childrens heartbeat and understand what they want and what they expect from us, President Sirisena said. President Sirisena added that children in this era receive more information and knowledge unlike before. He observed that children are more exposed to digitization as well. At the same time, children are prone to fall prey to anti-social behaviours, he said.

FR against AG and Bond Commission fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by a senior manager of the Central Banks Public Debt Department who challenged the activities of several members of the Attorney Generals Department during interrogations pertaining to the Presidential Commission Inquiry into Treasury Bond issuance was yesterday fixed for support on November 21 by Supreme Court.
On October 27, two Supreme Court Judges among a three-judge-Bench declined to sit on the Bench regarding this fundamental rights petition, citing personal reasons.
When the matter came up before Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Vijith Malalgoda, Presidents Counsel M.A. Sumanthiran appearing on behalf of the petitioner informed that Court that he had filed a motion requesting Chief Justice to appoint a three-judge-Bench to hear this petition.
Petitioner S. Pathumanapan, a senior manager of Public Debt Department has cited eight officers of the Attorney Generals Department, Central Bank Governor, CB Monetary Board members, the Chairman and the members of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquiry into the issuance of Treasury Bonds and several others, as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the treatment he suffered at the Attorney Generals Department during interrogations at the hands of Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, ASG Yasantha Kodagoda and DSG Milinda Gunatilleke more specifically the threats, intimidation, duress, harassment, humiliating treatment and unlawful invasion of privacy to which the petitioner was subject amounted to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment.
The petitioner said that by failing to permit the petitioner to testify before the Commission and seeking to intimidate, threaten, harass and otherwise penalise the petitioner for taking a position inconsistent with that which they have suggested to him, members of the Attorney Generals Department have subverted the purposes of the COI Act, deliberately prevented the truth from emerging and sought to deprive commissioners and the country as a whole of access to the facts and evidence of the petitioner.
The petitioner stated that he has not been given the opportunity to testify before the Commission by the officers assisting the commission precisely because they are aware that he will be able to convince the Commissioners of his bona fides and because his testimony would be unfavourable to them.
The petitioner further stated that he is being punished and victimised for refusing to provide favourable testimony to the officers assisting the Commission.
He said he reached the Attorney Generals Department at 3.00 pm on July 29, 2017 and he was taken to the chambers of Dappula de Livera.
The petitioner sought an Interim Order officers assisting Bond Commission (Attorney General Department) from taking any steps to require summon, compel the presence of the petitioner at any interrogation, consultation or other such meeting until the final determination of the petition.
The petitioner stated that the actions of the respondents amount to an infringement and imminent infringement of the rights of the petitioner recognised under and in terms of Article 11, 129(1), 13(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel M.A.Sumanthiran under the instruction of Attorney-at-law Dinesh Vidanapathirana appeared for respondent.

## Title: A future-oriented Budget

## Section: Editorial

A future-oriented Budget
Our Governments and politicians have a reputation for usually not looking beyond the next year, nay, the next election. But this Government has departed from this trend with the presentation of Budget 2018 by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera. The Budget 2018 is certainly one of the most future-oriented ones presented in living memory, with a clear and comprehensive programme that stretches all the way to 2040. It might seem a long time away, but 22 years is not a very long period of time and many other countries have made plans that even go beyond 2040.
It has been said that exemplary Governments and leaders think of the next generation, while others think of the next election. Minister Samaraweeras maiden Budget clearly belongs to the former category, with its broad range of proposals that aim to revitalize the economy in line with the Governments Vision 2025 Concept and even beyond. Among the future-oriented highlights of the Budget are: Projected US$ 5,000 Per Capita Income; Economic Growth Rate of 6 per cent by 2020; Budget Deficit at 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2020; one million new jobs; target of US$ 20 billion exports and FDI inflows of US$ 5 billion per year.
Whilst not forgetting Cost of Living and social welfare  the prices of around 15 items were reduced on the eve of the Budget  the real focus of the Budget is medium and long term development and economic rejuvenation. Significantly, the Budget has addressed the vital issue of environmental conservation in a big way, instead of just paying lip service. To cite just one example, Budget 2018 decrees that all vehicles on our roads by 2040 should be powered by electricity, solar or hydrogen, a move that has already been announced by UK, France, China and India. This is a move in the right direction that brings Sri Lanka on par with the environmental aims of many advanced economies.
We often hear the refrain that youth are the future but when it comes to Government policies, they are often left behind. This Budget has changed that scenario with a firm commitment to children and youth, who will be the leaders by 2040. Having already politically empowered women and youth through a mandatory quota for the next Local Government and Provincial Council Elections, the Budget has aimed to empower them financially as well. The youth, especially young women, will be at the centre of the envisaged Enterprise Sri Lanka programme which expects to develop the SME, vocational training and employment sectors. The proposed expansion of universities and vocational training institutions will also benefit the youth.
A youth and future-oriented economy cannot afford to be constrained by archaic laws and systems introduced more than a century ago which are now clearly outdated. As Minister Samaraweera pointed out, reforming and restructuring revenue collecting institutions such as Customs, Excise and Inland Revenue Departments is vital to strengthen the economy. After all, it is the revenue collected through these institutions that is channelled for everything from education to health. Reinvigorating these organisations will spur the economy to reach greater heights.
The economy is naturally the focus of any Budget. In Sri Lankas case, the biggest challenge to the economy is debt repayment, which in 2018 will amount to Rs.1970 billion. To its credit, the Government has not compromised on development and welfare measures despite the huge debt repayment commitment. As an island nation very much entrenched in the world economic order, we cannot escape the occasional shocks that rattle the world economy. This is why the Government has aimed to build a more resilient economy through Budget 2018.
The Budget has not forgotten the other priority of the Government  peace and reconciliation. A number of proposals have been included in Budget 2018 to foster reconciliation including the construction of 50,000 houses in the North and the East and the introduction of low interest loans and provision of stable livelihoods for 12,600 ex-combatants. These and other reconciliation moves announced in the Budget will benefit every community and religious group.
No Budget can be perfect and this one too is not. But on the whole, it has addressed a gamut of burning issues confronting the country and offered viable solutions. It offers a positive outlook for the economy despite the severity of certain fiscal challenges. Peoples representatives will debate its pros and cons over the next month or so and give their verdict. In the meantime, the public too has a chance to go through the proposals and form their own opinions.
A Budget is not just a balance sheet as some people assume it to be. It does address the important issue of revenue and expenditure, but one cannot assess the impact of a transformative Budget document in monetary terms alone. A Budget should lay a course for a brighter future for all segments of society and for every aspect of the economy. This Budget triumphs on both counts and firmly lays the groundwork for a prosperous future based on a Blue-Green economy in more ways than one.

"It is a people friendly budget. This time, the prices of the essential items were reduced even before the budget was released and it was very different underprevious governments," he said.

This weekend's home match for defending league champions Kandy SC is against Police SC at Bambalaptiya. The Policemen at their home den will try to throw everything into this battle to cause an upset, but the champions know how to counter it.

The game was played at a terrific pace with no quarter asked or given. It spoke volumes for the fighting spirit of the KSC forwards and the backs who stalled the Cops maneuvers in the center and gave second phase attack so much so that the Policemen seemed to lose their tempers. Referee had to summon the two skippers and warn them after a player was spied throwing hands about. In this game KSC had players like D.H. Rajaguru, Sunil Munasinghe, Bola Gunaratne, Jadi Dissanayake, H.G.

Kidney patients denied dialysis treatment
It is learnt that 300 persons are suffering from Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKDu) in the Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura districts, being denied of vital dialysis treatment.
Dialysis treatment machines and relevant medical care are provided only in a few hospitals in the province.
There are around 19,000 kidney patients, including CKDu patients registered for medical treatment in the hospitals. Although there are nearly 300 CKDu patients who need to be provided dialysis treatment three times per month, they are denied the facilities under the present conditions.
Machines are available but trained staff, including doctors and nurses, is not sufficient to run the dialysis units. We need at least 50 trained nurses and 20 doctors to attend to patients, PHSD (NCP) Dr. Palitha Bandara said.
Higher authorities in the Health Ministry had been apprised of the requirements, Dr. Bandara said. During the recent official visit by the President in Kahatagasdigiliya, the President and the Cabinet ministers were presented with a document on the shortcomings, he added.

Liability Management Act before House next year
The governments much needed Liability Management Act is expected to be presented to Parliament by early 2018,Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media Mano Tittawella said yesterday, as he explained the governments strategy to deal with its immense debt burden.
We are discussing it with the Legal Draftsmans Department now and the Bill is at an advanced stage, he said addressing a post Budget Forum organised by Ernst and Young at the Hilton.
Budget 2018 brings the government closer to the precarious years of 2019-2021 where many of the borrowings are scheduled for repayment.
We have had many unusual borrowings for economically unviable projects. Thus, we are looking at a bunching problem between 2019-2021 where we will have to repay debt close to USD 8-9 billion, Tittawella said.
He added the new Bill will allow the government, Reconstruct this debt on a long term basis on much more viable terms.
Deputy Treasury Secretary S.R.Attygalle explained that whilst the Appropriation Bill only allowed the government to borrow for the present year, the new Bill will give them space to plan for the future.
We will be able to accommodate those who wish to switch or exit their bonds through payment. This will give the government flexibility to counter that problem, he added.

The specialty of this budget is that it lays the ground for long term economic development. We must go for new industrial economy and increase our export income. The budget aims that as well, Former Central Bank Director, Economist Vincent Mervin Fernando said.
We cannot even manage the recurrent expenditure of our country. We were at a dilemma as to where the funds would be for development projects because we cannot pay even for our salaries," he said.
"The Budget 2018 aims more to decrease the recurrent expenditure than it does to reduce the government revenue.
The government revenue is Rs. 2326 billion and the recurrent expenditure is Rs. 1250 billion. This means we can now pay for our recurrent expenditure with our revenue. This itself is a great achievement. This happened in 2017, he said.

Major programme to restructure SOEs
The Government has launched a major State Owned Enterprises (SOE) restructuring programme, Senior Advisor to the Finance and Mass Media Ministry Mano Tittawella yesterday said responding to questions posed by the business community on the ailing public sector.
Tittawella speaking at the post budget forum organised by Ernst and Young at the Hilton explained that they were looking at either listing non-strategic enterprises on the stock market or handing them over to private sector management.
The Government previously announced that they would sell the government owned stakes in the SOEs of Hilton and Hyatt. One of the main proposals for SOEs in the 2018 Budget was the proposal to allow state banks such as the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank to raise their own debt and equity capital,
We will not pump any more money into these state banks. The minority stakes here would be listed on the stock market and most of it would be offered to the customers and employees of the banks so that they can be stakeholders in their own institutions, Tittawella said. He said it would be a major point in capital market development in the country.
Thilan Wijesinghe, Chairman, of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Unit at the Finance Ministry envisioned PPPs to make up 40-50 percent of all FDIs into the country in future.
The PPP Units role is to assist the line ministries with the PPP and the SOE reform processes,

Mill Hill CC legend Ken York no more
Mill Hill Cricket Club legend Ken York passed away on September 22nd in his home town of Wisbech, far North-East Of. His wife Monica arranged a celebration of Kens life on November 4 at Elme Hall Hotel , Wisbech where Fazly Wahab, former Mill Hill CC stumper delivered the eulogy in celebrating Kens life.
I first met Ken back in 1983 when I came to England as a student and wanting to play cricket for a club in England.
Ken introduced me to Mill Hill CC. We became friends and played cricket together for Mill Hill CC from 1983-86 until my departure from UK. I introduced my good friend Roshan Mahanama in 1984 to the club and Roshan had a fantastic season with us.
We ended up winning the League Championship, Twilight Cricket (T20) and the One Day competition in 1984 and also champions in the Bahamas International Cricket Festival which was a purple year for Mill Hill CC.
Sri Lankan cricketers and Mill Hill CC had a close relationship back in the 70s and 80s. This connection was due to late Dusty Miller, who was Kens captain, boss at Richardson and Company.
Dusty was also the Sri Lankan representative at the ICC at the time when Sri Lanka became a full ICC Test member, and worked with Gamini Dissanayake, former Sri Lanka Cricket Board president and then a senior Minister in the Sri Lankan cabinet.
Kens family will celebrate his life and remember all the remarkable things that he established during his wonderful life. Ken was a brilliant friend, great cricketer, and like a father figure to all the young cricketers who played with him. He was a brilliant left arm spinner and a late order batsman. I had the privilege of playing with Ken through my time at Mill Hill in the Middlesex Cricketers League.
In 1957 as a 24 year old Ken scored 100 not out and took all 10 wickets for 54 runs against Cornhill. This is a Mill Hill and probably an all English club record as far as I can gather (since there is no Wisden Almanack for club cricket). This remarkable double has never been achieved before or if it has it must have been many years ago. Last time this double was achieved in first class cricket was in 1862 by E.M Grace, brother of legendary W.G. Ken took 100 wickets in a season between 1953 and 1976 and scored 1000 runs and 100 wickets between 1957-60 which is also a club record.
Ken also played for Middlesex County over 50s team with Fazly Wahab for almost 10 years. He was instrumental in us winning the Middlesex Cricketers Championship 5 times in 7 years from 1978, something we could not have done without his guidance and masterful sportsmanship.
His records you have read speaks volumes about how great a cricketer and a friend he was.
Ken, I would say, is an honorary Sri Lankan and followed our cricket passionately. He knew quite a lot of ex-Sri Lankan cricketers and played with them at Mill Hill. Former Sri Lankan captains Anura Tennakoon, Michael Tissera , Duleep Mendis (now Head Coach of Oman cricket), Arjuna Ranatunga (1996 World Cup winning captain and now a Minister in Sri Lanka cabinet), Roshan Mahanama (former Sri Lanka captain, 1996 World Cup winning team member and former ICC match referee), former Sri Lanka wicket keeper Ranjit Fernando, fast bowler Rumesh Ratnayake (Sri Lankas fast bowling coach), Fazly Wahab (Mill Hill CC wicket-keeper), Ranjit Samarasekara (former Colts CC & MCA), Travis Fernando (former CCC player), Asitha Jayaweera (former Royal and Sri Lanka Schools U19 captain) are a few of whom who played with Ken at Mill Hill and had close ties with him throughout his life.
In 1995, following the no-balling incident of Muthiah Muralitharan by Australian umpire Darryl Hair, Ken wrote a wonderful and moving article in his English local paper in support of Murali. His passion for cricket and loving personality was something not only felt by friends and family in the UK, but also something that reached across international borders and all the way over to Sri Lanka.
It takes a special person to affect so many lives in the way that Ken did, and for that I will always admire Ken the way he went about helping Sri Lankan cricketers at Mill Hill CC.
Ken was an accredited coach with England & Wales Cricket Board and coached Wisbech Town Cricket Club for years and schools in the Wisbech area.Ken shaped my time in the UK and as our friendship grew, I came to admire him as a great human being with qualities from the top bracket. You will always be in my thoughts Kenny, may you rest in peace.

National Sangha Council berates Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya
Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya has distorted the vision and mission of late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera to fulfill NGO requirements, National Sangha Council President Ven. Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera said.
Addressing a press conference held at International Vipassana Meditation Centre in Colombo yesterday he said that Prof. Wijesuriya tried his best to cover up the Central Bank Bond issue while delivering his speech at late Sobitha Theras second commemoration held recently.
The President never promised to abolish the Executive Presidency but he promised to cut down unnecessary powers. He did it as promised in his Maithree Paalanayak - Sthaawara Ratak policy (election manifesto) when the 19th Amendment was passed. Late Ven. Sobhitha Thera also endorsed the same stand after realizing the dangers of abolishing the Executive Presidency,the thera said.
The Chief Incumbent of International Vipassana Meditation Centre Ven.Ududumbara Kaashyapa Thera said Sri Lanka is heading towards destruction today because the truth cannot be told as it is. The truth should be truth even when it is told by the persons we hate. The right cannot be wrong when it is done by our opponents.Tamils do not get harassed because they are Tamils and Sinhalese do not get huge benefits because they are Sinhalese.Power should not be given to provinces and ethnicities.Power should be given to the people who do not have a house to live, water to drink, food to eat, he said.

No difference from 1977 economic policy
JVP Parliamentarians yesterday charged that the Budget 2018 presented to Parliament by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera under the theme of Blue-Green Budget; the Launch of Enterprise Sri Lanka is only a continuation of the economic policy introduced in 1977.
The Government has applied an environment friendly and animal friendly paint to the budget proposals and calling it as a Blue-Green Budget to mislead the ordinary people, they said..
Addressing the media yesterday at the JVP Headquarters, MP Vijitha Herath said the total expected income of the Government for 2018 is Rs 2,260 billion and the total expenditure is Rs 4,455 billion. "So there is a gap of Rs 1,895 billion. The Government is attempting to fill the gap by imposing taxes, borrowing more debts and cutting down the reliefs given to the people," he said.
"The budget proposals proved that the Government has no vision on production based economic development," he said.
He charged that no information about Hambantota Port Development Project or the Mattala Airport Development Project has mentioned in this budget. "All these development projects are going on outside the budget," he said.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said the budget proposals presented by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera were very similar to the proposals made by former Finance Minister, Matara District Parliamentarian Ronnie de Mel before 40 years.
He charged that the budget proposals for 2018 are completely contradictory and said a sugar tax on sweetened beverages was imposed claiming it as a solution for diabetes. "At the same time, they have given a tax relief for beer," he said.

Not so happily ever after
Few decades ago, divorce was considered as a social stigma. On and off we came across few cases and the main causes were adultery and desertion. In most cases, the couples continued with their shattered marriage for the sake of their children.
However, in the recent years, the scenario has dramatically changed. The divorce has become increasingly popular and much talked about in social forums. It is seen that couples are just walking away from their marriages quoting varied reasons but most of them by mutual consent. The rising trend is experienced not only in the metropolises but also in the urban and smaller cities, including the rural areas.
In Sri Lanka a divorce is given for three reasons  adultery, malicious desertion or incurable impotency. At present there is no room for a no-fault divorce, in which the dissolution of a marriage does not require a fault of either husband or wife to be shown. However, when one party does not contest the divorce, it is similar to a divorce by mutual consent, which happens quite often in our country.
According to a newspaper report, an average of 400 divorces take place in Sri Lanka every day and 54 percent of marriages end in divorce. Elderly people like us are shocked to see these statistics.
Earlier, matrimony in Sri Lanka was a sacred institution not just between two people but between two families. Traditional marriages were held keeping in mind all conservative and social customs and duties. Historically, we were great believers of the arranged marriage system. Though this type of arrangement is hard to acknowledge nowadays, but still, such marriages worked wonders for our parents, uncles and aunts.
Pressures
Surveys have revealed that most of those splitting up are members of Sri Lankas urban middle class whose lives have been transformed by the countrys open economy. Their aspirations are radically different to those of their parents and grandparents.
The pressures of the modern workplace also make a big adverse impact on marriages. Personally, I have noticed during my three-decade experience in management, that todays workers, particularly youth, are concentrating more on their careers and less on their family lives. I also noticed todays generation lack patience and tolerance. They don't want to put more efforts into a relationship to fix their interpersonal issues, and they feel that escapism is the best solution.
Experiences
Kamal, for example, was a 24-year old young man and married just for two years. When I met him, he had already made up his mind to proceed with divorce. I asked him what went wrong. His answer was prompt: I was too young to realise that being in love and being married are two different things. Today young males like me are a very complex entity. We want our wives to be really progressive, modern, in the first place, but at the same time, we still want our wives to cook food for us. We want them to be there when we get back home. It doesnt work.
He admitted that often he, too, found it hard to accept that his wife also had her own progressive career.
Nirupa, also had somewhat a same issue. Shefinalised her divorce last December.She too left her husband and took the child to her custody. She says divorce is only possible for women who are financially independent or who have the support of their parents. Nirupa believes that divorce has certainly become more socially acceptable in Sri Lanka, but there are still problems.
Personally, I don't feel scared to tell people that I am a divorced person but stigmas are still there and it comes out in very odd places, she said. For example, she added, I've been house-hunting, but found it is very difficult to get a house because people are very sceptical about giving it to a single woman with a child.
Independence
Women now are getting educated and independent. They do not need their husbands to sustain their living anymore. So, like Nirupa, they are able to stand up to slightest mental or physical mistreat and seek divorce, if required.
According to a lawyer known to me, it is mostly the love marriages that end in divorces. She didnt have the numbers to justify her point, but cited her experiences in dealing with such cases. She added, Love is blind, and marriage is the eye-opener for reality. Couples rush into marriages without knowing each other well. Very often, within months of their marriage they seek separation.
Reasons
After talking with a number of lawyers specialising divorce cases, counsellors of divorcees, I have extracted some pointers as to why divorce rates are increasing (not in order of importance) in Sri Lanka.
(1) Greater societal acceptance of divorces in urban areas and also a gradual acceptance of a divorced daughter by the family. Most parents have started to believe that their daughter can have a better life by either remarrying or, in the last resort, even without a husband. The anonymity of cities, and now even rural areas, helps divorced people avoid the glare of judgmental friends and relatives.
(2) Financial freedom to walk away from an abusive relationship.
(3) The sanctity of marriage has taken a beating. Peoples attitudes towards marriage itself are changing and as a result they do not work hard at it as before to be patient and solve issues.
(4) More DINK couples (double income no kids) who are not held back by the fear of how the divorce will impact children.
(5) Todays working environment has changed drastically. Due to fully open economy, most private organisations are facing intense competition and this leads to tremendous pressure on employees. Working late, 6 days a week, without holidays can create a lot of frustration and tension. This can destroy a marriage, whether its just one partner working, or both.
(6) Nuclear families have meant loneliness for the non-working partner, compounded by moving away from familiar environments. This can result in estrangement.
(7) If the wife is working, gender roles change. Conflicts arising from sharing the work load at home adds to the stress faced at work. Tensions often arise if the husband imagines that the womans career is temporary or the wife imagines that her husband will lend a hand at home.
(8) In a transforming country like Sri Lanka, men are still not comfortable with the strong independent modern woman. They might feel that they are ready for a working partner, and they can be, but not for a high-powered career woman. Its some sort of professional rivalry.
(9) In the last few years, incompatibility has been cited in a majority of the divorce cases. This happens particularly for younger couples who mostly complain of attitudinal problems. Such problems with attitude can arise because most men prefer being the bread-winners.
(10) Social Media - According to several research reports, social media proves to do more harm than good for married couples. A survey revealed that almost a quarter of those polled said they had at least one argument a week related to social media use, with 27 percent admitting they fought about it every day.
A marriage counsellor once told me that the foundation of a successful marriage is based on a mutually agreed labour specialization which might go haywire if both partners are in high pressure jobs and ignore the fact. All the more reason why husbands should contribute to parenting and house work and that will also give women a chance to do more important work.
Restoring the importance of marriage to society and welfare of the children will require politicians and civic leaders to make it one of their most important tasks. It will also require a modest commitment of resources to pro-marriage programmes. Unfortunately, presently we do not have any such programme.
Refocussing resources and funds to preserve marriage by reducing divorce not only will be good for children and society but, in long run, save money.

Pandya rested for first two Tests v Sri Lanka
Hardik Pandya has been pulled out of the squad for the first two Tests against Sri Lanka due to begin on November 16. A media release from the BCCI said the selection committee had taken the call in consultation with the team management so as to lessen the allrounder's chances of injury.
Considering Mr Pandya's heavy recent workload, the decision was made to negate any possibility of a major injury concern. Mr Pandya will undergo a period of strength at conditioning at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru.
There is a likelihood as well that Virat Kohli might be rested for the third Test against Sri Lanka, and perhaps even the limited-overs matches that follow, with an eye towards keeping the India captain fit and refreshed for the tour of South Africa at the start of 2018.
India Test squad for the first two Tests: Virat Kohli (captain), KL Rahul, M Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (vice-capt), Rohit Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma.

To implement Budget proposals:Budget Implementation Unit set up: Finance Minister
A Budget Implementation Unit has been set up within the Ministry of Finance to implement all Budget proposals within the course of next year, said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday, as he acknowledged that implementation was one of the biggest challenges faced by his Ministry.
The Unit will be headed by Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, Mano Tittawella and Economic Advisor to the Ministry, Deshal de Mel. They will produce monthly progress reports to the public.
Budgets are always impressive and attractive when presented, but the challenge is in implementation, Minister Samaraweera said, addressing the post Budget Forum organized by Ernst and Young at the Hilton.
Speaking on his maiden Budget, the Minister said his Budget in essence was that of Free enterprise, liberalization and globalization.
The whole thrust of the Budget is the Enterprise Sri Lanka concept, he added, as he explained, If Sri Lanka is to take off, we have to awaken and re-energize the dormant entrepreneurship in most Sri Lankans.
The Minister touching on the past, stressed that Sri Lankans historically, were merchants and traders and that the country always excelled when we had dealt with the outside world. This has motivated the current premise of opening up markets further through FTAs and the removal of up to 1,800 para tariffs next year.
Unfortunately, the socialist mindset introduced is still with us, so I thought it was time that Sri Lanka came forward and compete with the world. It should stop being a nanny state, but we are there as a government to give everyone a helping hand. The Budget is about helping the entrepreneurial spirit of our people, he said.
In the meantime, addressing a media briefing held at the Parliamentary Complex, Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, Mano Tittawella said Sri Lankan Airlines within the next three months would be converted into an entity which would no longer be a burden to the Government.
Tittawella explained that the Public Private Partnership Unit of the Finance Ministry had expedited the restructuring process of Sri Lankan Airlines and accordingly, advisors in this regard, are to be appointed shortly with Cabinet approval.
A final decision on Sri Lankan Airlines would be taken by the Cabinet after considering various proposals, he said.
The Government is not ready to shoulder the burden of Sri Lankan Airlines any longer, added Finance and Mass Media Minister Samaraweera who also attended the briefing.
He explained that all options would be considered by the Government and that discussions were underway with several parties which had expressed their interest to partner with the national carrier.
Govt. to change country heading towards abyss: Dy Minister Harsha de Silva
The government has taken measures to change the direction of the country which was heading into an abyss and transform it into a prosperous country, said Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Development Dr. Harsha de Silva.
He said so, during the committee stage debate on Budget proposals in Parliament yesterday.
During the past, there was talk about an electric chair and we were on the brink of having economic embargoes enforced against us and the international community was against us. Today, no one talks about an electric chair or International War Crimes tribunals. This was the situation when we took over the country and we have now changed that and we are in the process of taking measures to ensure peaceful existence between the people through a new Constitution, he said.
He said the two main parties have now come together to bring the country out of that bleak past and assisted by the TNA when required. The country is now moving towards a better future. The government headed by the President and Prime Minister, are working their way towards taking the country forward holistically. The governments mission is to enrich this country not just in terms of rupees, but through social, educational, environmental and cultural development.
De Silva said in the year 2000, if goods were manufactured for $100, of that $35 worth was exported. However, the export percentage that was at 35% had reduced to 15% - 13% during the previous regime. We are a small country and we cannot sustain ourselves without imports and we must find solutions to deal with this situation without restricting ourselves. The State income has been destroyed and today it is at 11%. Hence, we need to look at these issues intelligently in order to resolve them and we should not look at these issues through political angles.
Meanwhile, speaking on the National Pensions Policy, he asked why only government employees are entitled to a pension and why the private sector employees are excluded. Today there are 8.3 million employed persons in this country. Of them, 1.3 million are working in the government sector. Another 2.7 million are employed in private institutions that contribute to the EPF, ETF funds. The rest are employed in the private sector or their own small businesses. For those driving a three wheeler for an income or farming, what happens to them when they reach 60-65 years These are issues that every successive government has avoided dealing with and kicked the can down the road. We could also do the same, but we are not prepared to kick the can down the road and act irresponsibly, he added.
Minister Harsha de Silva further pointed out that there was no cadastral register in this country. The most number of legal cases in this country are related to land disputes.
Further political culprits are also owning lands through fake documents and they turn rich land owners. Hence, these land parcels in this country should be surveyed and mapped and kept safely and we need a transparent procedure. Our government has commenced a programme to map these lands properly and issue people with title deeds for the plots of land they own. Who are we to tell people what they can do with their lands Therefore, land amendment laws need to be brought in, he pointed out.
He pointed out that only around 35% of the labour market consists of women, while the rest of the 65% are men.
This is because of the restricting laws that prevent them to tailor their working hours according to their convenience.
These need to be changed in order to make the country more productive, which is what the finance minister has done in his Budget, he said, adding that this Budget is one that is not just caters to just the next year, but it is a exemplary Budget that looks far ahead into the next 50 years and how we need to make these changes today and try to connect Sri Lanka with the rest of the world.
Previous govt. had obtained loans at a very high rate: Dy. Minister Harsha de Silva
The government has had to impose a Rs. 0.20 Medamulana Tax on each Rs. 1,000 transaction taken place in banks to create a fund to settle the loans taken during the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, said National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva.
He made these observations yesterday in Parliament, in response to Joint Opposition member Udaya Prabath Gammanpila during the round of questions for oral answers who queried if the government had taken loans at high interest rates, while charging that the previous government had taken loans at high interest rates.
Deputy Minister de Silva further said that the previous government had taken loans at a very high interest rate of 9.9 in 2011, when interest rates were comparatively low. He added that the loan rates had increased recently throughout the world. But we have not taken loans at such high rates, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said.
Govt. not ready to shoulder Sri Lankan Airlines anymore:Finance Minister
The Government is not ready to shoulder the burden of Sri Lankan Airlines any longer, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He made this observation, while responding to a question raised by a journalist at a press conference held at the Parliament Complex yesterday.
Minister Samaraweeras Economic Advisor Mano Tittawella explained that the Public Private Partnership Unit of the Finance Ministry had expedited the restructuring process of the Sri Lankan Airlines.
Within the next three months, it would be converted to an entity which would no longer be a burden to the Government. Advisors in this regard would be appointed shortly with Cabinet approval. A final decision on Sri Lankan Airlines would be taken by the Cabinet after considering various proposals, he added.
Speaking further, Minister Samaraweera said that all options would be considered by the Government, adding that discussions are underway with several parties which have expressed interest to partner with the National Carrier. The Government is not ready to shoulder the burden of Sri Lankan Airlines anymore, the minister stressed.
Renovation of Ambatale dam a must to save Colombo city:Minister Ranawaka
The immediate renovation of the Ambatale reservoir dam is urgent, since there was a danger of the same being damaged during a heavy shower deluging the Colombo City, including the Parliament, said Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
The minister made this observation in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian S M Marikkar, during the round of questions for oral answers.
He further said that action should be taken immediately, since the dam could be damaged even during the next torrential rain, adding that it was the same danger emerging at the Nalagam Street Dam which could break open in a heavy shower inundating the Colombo city.
Colombo and Kelaniya are protected by these two dams built more than 100 years ago by the British during colonial era, Minister Ranawaka pointed out.
These two dams have to be renovated, Minister Ranawaka said. I have informed the Speaker of this danger to Parliament. We expect there would be heavy showers in future. So action should be taken immediately, the minister said.
No difference between countrys debts and Meethotamulla garbage mound
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday, cleared doubts on the newly imposed Debt Repayment Levy and tax revisions on vehicles, telecommunication towers, beer and hard liquor, while recapping on his Budgetary proposals for 2018.
Minister Samaraweera addressing his first post-Budget press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, termed the Debt Repayment Levy of Rs 2 per Rs 10,000 on all cash transactions for three years from April 1, 2018 as Medamulana Tax.
He reiterated that the said levy must be borne by the banks and could not be passed to the consumer. You are well aware of massive debt repayments due in the next two years. The countrys debt there was was no difference between Meethotamulla garbage mount when we took office in 2015. Despite that, we have undertaken a lot of development activities in the country. We need some support to confront the debt burden. The banks will get income tax waiver in return, he explained.
The minister said the government introduced a price formula based on the alcohol percentage for liquor in the Budget proposals for 2018 with the intension of discouraging youth from hard liquor.
According to global trends, the majority of people of many countries are used to consume soft liquor such as beer and wine, instead of hard liquor. In Sri Lanka, only 13 percent of alcohol users consume soft liquor, while 84 percent consume hard liquor. A recent survey conducted by the Colombo University, had found that 49 percent of alcohol consumers are addicted to moonshine. Therefore, we should rescue the general public, especially our youth from moonshine, the minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said tourist guesthouses would be allowed to sell soft liquor under a license. Some have expressed fears that after the introduction of this procedure, everyone would sell liquor even in their homes. It will not be allowed. If a guest house owner wishes to get a license, he would have to register with the Divisional Secretariat in the area. He should also produce a tax file. Nobody would be able to sell liquor without obtaining a license, he added.
Commenting on the Carbon Tax, the minister clarified that it would be higher for old vehicles.
Piyasena Gamage takes oaths as Galle district MP
The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) candidate former Minister Piyasena Gamage, was sworn in as the Galle district MP, before Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday.
Gamage was appointed to fill in the vacancy left due to Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe being disqualified by the Supreme Court for holding dual citizenship.
After taking of oaths, Piyasena Gamage took his seat with the Government.
The Supreme Court determined that Geetha Kumarasinghe could not hold the post of an MP, due to her holding dual citizenship, upholding a previous verdict confirming the earlier Court of Appeal Order. Therefore Piyasena Gamage was deemed eligible for the post as he was next in line on the UPFA list.
Some voters had filed a case against Geetha Kumarasinghe in the Court of Appeal, stating that she was not eligible to hold a parliamentary seat.
Geetha Meanwhile, challenged the Court of Appeal judgement before the Supreme Court.
Singaporean had placed his signature on SL currency notes: Bandula Gunawardena
The government has printed currency notes amounting to Rs 431 billion since 2015, said Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the Committee Stage debate on Budget proposals for the fiscal year 2018.
He also said that the Rs 5,000 note was not legally acceptable as it bears the signature of a Singaporean not a Sri Lankan national. If Geetha Kumarasinghe who was a dual citizen could not hold a seat in Parliament, how could former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran who is not a Sri Lankan national, placed his signature on the Rs 5,000 note queried MP Gunawardena. We would go before Court on this matter, he said.
At this stage Justice Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe queried if MP Gunawardena would not use the Rs 5,000 note as it was illegal according to the latters own criteria.
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne responding to MP Bandula Gunawardena, said that MP Gunawardena was misleading Parliament and the public. He added that Arjuna Mahendran had placed his signature on the note not as a Singaporean, but as the Central Bank Governor.
Buddhika Pathirana queries...
UNP Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana charged that one private members bill submitted by him in 2010 had not yet been taken up in Parliament, while the Tharunyata Hetak Private Members Bill which was submitted three months later, had been taken up and passed within another three months period.
MP Pathirana queried from Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, as to why double standards have been used in connection with him and the member who presented the Tharunyata Hetak Bill.
He made this query in Parliament yesterday, raising a point of order at the commencement of public business.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that he would look into the matter.
Countrys economy driven to labyrinth of chaos:Handunnetti
The countrys economy has been driven to the labyrinth of chaos by this Budgetary proposal, said Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the committee stage debate on the Budget proposals for the financial year 2018.
MP Handunnetti said that disparity between the haves and have nots had increased, while a considerable amount of the population earn only Rs. 350 per day. Even unborn children have been indebted more than before. The Budget has proposed a tax of Rs 0.20 on each Rs 1,000 transaction made at banks to collect funds to settle foreign loans, said Handuneeti. This is an opportunity created for the banks to collect money from their clients.
Finance and Mass Media Minister Samaraweera refuted statements by MP Handunnetti. The Banks were unable to collect that amount from their clients or neither could they reduce it from their income tax payments, Minister Samaraweera said.
MP Handunnetti during his speech, charged that Budget proposals were attempting to popularize beer by imposing tax on each gram of sugar, but not on beer.
Minister Samaraweera said that the Rs 0.50 is charged only on sugar which is added in sweet beverages.
He added that as whole, more than 49 percent of liquor consumers still consume illegal liquor, while 84 percent of the rest consume hard liquor. However, in developed countries, only a very little percentage consume hard liquor, Minister Samaraweera said. My view is that there was no issue in taking a can of beer than hard liquor or sweet beverages.
MP Handunnetti stated that there are more than 60,000 unemployed graduates.

But later Consultant surgeons were appointed to the Accident Service to cover the day and night. Accordingly, 24 hour in house coverage by a Consultant Surgeon and prompt availability of Consultants of other specialities on demand was assured, making this facility a Level 1 Trauma care centre. I always believed that the media had a very important role to play when a major incident occurs in the country. It is equally important that accurate, reliable and credible information is given to the general public through the media as quickly as possible before baseless mostly exaggerated rumours start spreading inside and outside the country.
..Continued from yesterday
What the First Deputy Director and the former Director  NHSL has to say
After taking over the responsibility of the Post of Director - NHSL, I made a proposal to install a liquid oxygen plant within the hospital premises itself. My proposal found the prompt approval of the Ministry of Health. All the Intensive Care Units, the Operating theatres and other Emergency Treatment Units of the hospital including Accident Service were connected to the liquid oxygen plant installed in the hospital premises. No more hassle of transporting cylinders now.
Although the wards no.72 and 73 of AOS were called observation wards, they never functioned as intended. The observation wards are meant to house the patients after emergency surgical management and observe for 24 hours until they are moved to another unit or discharged from the hospital depending on the nature and the severity of injuries.
Each of these wards is equipped with 46 beds. At any given time there were about 20 patients with spinal injuries in the male ward on skull traction. They remained in these wards for a long period. About 60-70 new patients were admitted to these wards daily. As a result these wards were heavily over-crowded. The female ward had a large number of patients with fracture neck of femur who occupied beds for a longer period.
We found out through a survey conducted that at any given time there are about 500 Orthopaedic patients in the hospital. The number of Orthopaedic beds in AOS was not sufficient to accommodate all of them. Therefore we continued to use wards 2, 3, 51, 52, 57 and 58. Before the AOS was commissioned the Orthopaedic patients were scattered in all general surgical wards. Opening of AOS solved this problem. The Accident Service, OPD (ASOPD) had only 16 medical officers who were formed into four teams. One team with four medical officers was on duty at a time. In addition to attending on the new patients at the ASOPD they had to attend to any emergencies in the observation wards while assisting the Consultant Surgeon in the theatre. There were four separate medical officers for the ICU. In total there were only 20 medical officers for the Accident Service. This number was far below the requirement.
After several rounds of negotiations we were able to recruit medical officers designated for male and female observation wards and operating theatres separately while the number of medical officers in ASOPD and ICU remained same.
At the beginning Retired Consultant Surgeons were re-employed as Consultant Surgeons to the Accident Service. They worked from 8 in the morning till 8 in the evening. The Senior Registrars in Surgical Units were compelled to work on night shifts while Consultants were on call.
But later Consultant surgeons were appointed to the Accident Service to cover the day and night. Accordingly, 24 hour in house coverage by a Consultant Surgeon and prompt availability of Consultants of other specialities on demand was assured, making this facility a Level 1 Trauma care centre.
I always believed that the media had a very important role to play when a major incident occurs in the country. It is equally important that accurate, reliable and credible information is given to the general public through the media as quickly as possible before baseless mostly exaggerated rumours start spreading inside and outside the country. Having this in mind I tried to share the information with media as and when inquiries came from them following a major incident. I have had a repeated number of stand ups before the television cameras to brief about the situation and explain how we have managed them.
It is a very responsible task as it is of paramount importance to use carefully selected words and tone in front of the camera not showing any emotions however much the situation is critical and sensitive. I was able to convey and convince the general public that we are in full control of the situation and rest assured all the patients have been looked after well. This was factually correct.
I have faced both national and international media during my tenure and the feedback was positive and encouraging. The confidence I had on my interaction with media was confirmed by such feedback. We had nothing to hide from media. We allowed them to enter the hospital when the emergency phase is over and they had the freedom to find out on their own how we managed the situation.
We had a great national responsibility on our shoulders to provide services to the members of the armed forces transported to Colombo from the war-front daily. The number varied between 50 to 150 a day. These patients were flown to Ratmalana Airport and from there by ambulances to Accident Service -NHSL, Colombo South Hospital, Colombo North Hospital, Army Hospital and Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital in rotation. The long convoy of ambulances leaving Ratmalana Airport carrying the injured soldiers with deafening sound of the sirens travelling towards Colombo was a common sight for the people at that time.
We used to receive these patients daily as they invariably had head injuries and vascular injuries along with other injuries. Most of the time these patients arrived in the evening and we had a system to distribute these patients among all surgical wards. Our dedicated medical teams were in all readiness to attend to all of them during the night itself enabling attending to the patients who arrive next day. Depending on the number of patients, we had to open additional theatres in the night and to summon additional staff who were on call. For this I had to intervene as a matter of routine.
The availability of doctors and nurses in large numbers in their living quarters in the hospital premises itself and their willing readiness was very helpful. All these tasks we had to perform while providing a satisfactory service to the patients who are brought to the Accident Service due to various types of accidents and other intentional injuries amounting to about 300 a day. It was a matter of crisis management on a daily basis.
We are very proud to note that the Accident Service, along with the rest of the entire National Hospital of Sri Lanka has been in the forefront in providing emergency medical care for the victims of bomb blasts and other terrorist attacks during the thirty long years of civil conflict. The entire staff of the hospital has risen to the occasion as one with utmost efficiency and dedication, at times when the hospital is overwhelmed with patients who turned out to be innocent victims of gruesome terrorist attacks.
We had a well defined, well documented Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) Plan assigning definite responsibilities and describing the ways of working for the entire staff, when there was a sudden influx of a large number of casualties within a very short period of time. This plan was tested almost on a daily basis with actual situations in the past. This Plan enabled us to grapple with any emergency situation at the quickest possible time.
Most of the time we heard a bang of an explosion here or there and we have even felt the vibration of glass windows as they occurred within a few miles from the hospital. Every time we heard a sound, we thought it was a bomb explosion and we were found to be right. I very well remember how the entire staff of the Hospital got ready to receive the patients on hearing a sound of explosion or getting to know through another source about an incident.
We had no pre-knowledge or alert as to how many patients would be brought and in what condition. But we were prepared to receive them. The highest number of patients we received in one single incident was a record 1500. This was following the bomb blast at the Central Bank. We worked hard and long hours as a fairly large dedicated team to provide emergency medical care for thousands of victims of these terror attacks and save lives.
No matter how horrified we felt at the sight of the victims of these gruesome attacks who were brought to us, we had no way of getting into emotions.
The first Mass Casualty Incident that was managed in the New AOS was the Bomb Blast at the J.O.C. on Flower Road. This happened after a few weeks from the opening. We managed it well.
We have witnessed many incidents involving topmost politicians and many other VIPs in the country. I recall an incident which I cannot put behind my memory, where a political leader was assassinated of a terrorist attack. One of his colleagues who was also a political leader, came to the hospital and was crying in front of his colleagues body. A few weeks later, that very person was brought to the Accident Service and was pronounced dead due to a bomb explosion.
When the people were getting ready for the May Day rally in the year 1993, a bomb exploded in Armour Street bringing an end to an illustrious career of a politician. That was President Ranasinghe Premadasa. His mutilated body was brought along with other dead bodies to the accident service. I was terrified to see what I saw and I remembered how I stood by his side just two years ago while he was cutting the ribbon tied across the entrance to the Accident Service to declare open the new facility.
Lalith Athulathmudali was shot by a gunman while he was addressing an election rally at Kirulapana and he was rushed to the Accident Service. He succumbed to his injuries in spite of all the efforts made by the Medical Teams to save his life. There was quite a commotion in the front compound of the hospital by thousands of his supporters. They demanded that they be allowed into the hospital to see their leader. Given the sensitivity of the situation, we had no option but to allow them to enter and pay respect to the leader while passing by the glass window of the ICU where his body was lying. Afterwards the people dispersed peacefully.
Later on I realised that our decision was a very wise one taken to manage a crisis situation disregarding the usual rules and regulations. Extraordinary situations call for extraordinary measures.
Very late in the night a female suicide bomber exploded herself during an election rally in Grandpass. Gamini Dissanayake, Weerasinghe Mallimarachchi, Dr. Gamini Wijesekere, Ossie Abeygunasekere and 54 others were killed as a result of that explosion. All the injured received prompt treatment in the hospital. A large number of doctors and nurses who were off-duty rushed to the hospital from their quarters to look after the victims of the explosion. Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar was shot by an LTTE sniper as he was getting out of the swimming pool at his private residence in Colombo. Unfortunately he succumbed to his injuries in spite of all the efforts made by the Medical Teams in the hospital to save his life.
A suicide bomber exploded herself at an election rally near Town Hall, Colombo. President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga sustained a serious eye injury and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by the LTTE. A large number of people (118) who were injured including Prof. G.L. Peiris and Alawi Moulana received emergency treatment in the hospital. Eighteen (18) innocent people lost their lives.
The Army Commander General Sarath Fonseka was critically injured due to a Bomb Blast inside the Army Headquarters and brought to the Accident Service. He had multiple life threatening injuries.
His life was saved by the intervention of a highly professional, skilful and experienced team of health care personnel. During his stay in the hospital for weeks after surgery, the Army took over his security. The security arrangements were extremely tight inside and outside the hospital. Transporting him from ASICU where he was undergoing treatment following surgery to other units for certain investigations was carried out with extremely high personal security operation by the Army. This was something alien to us.
There were a few instances when we had to provide our services to members or suspected members of the LTTE organization. We treated them in the same way we would have treated any injured brought to us. Any person who was seeking our services has been taken care of, ignoring the rank and file or the race. They were all equal before us.
I was available all the time in the hospital whenever there was a major incident without exception whether it is during the day or night.
I was very reluctant to leave Colombo thinking that some major incident might happen. Hence my movements were restricted due to my responsibilities for a very long time. I have no regrets rather I take the honour and the pride.
This institution has rendered a great service with utmost efficiency to the nation and has saved many lives and relieved the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people over the years.
This has been made possible by the able, willing, dedicated and committed staff of the hospital.
I am proud to have been a part of it and more importantly for having given the leadership.

State Owned Enterprise reforms in full steam
The government has launched a major restructuring programme for State Owned Enterprises (SOE), Finance and Mass Media Ministry Senior Advisor, Mano Tittawella said yesterday. Answering questions posed by the business community, on the ailing public sector, he explained that they were looking at either listing non-strategic enterprises on the stock market or handing them over to private sector management.
Tittawella was speaking at the post Budget Forum organised by Ernst and Young at the Colombo Hilton yesterday.
The government previously announced that they would sell the government owned stakes in the SOEs of Hilton and Hyatt.
One of the main proposals for SOEs in the 2018 Budget was the proposal to allow State Banks such as the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank to raise their own debt and equity capital, he said.
We will not pump any more money into these state banks.The minority stakes here will be listed on the stock market and most of it will be offered to customers and employees of the banks so that they can be stakeholders in their own institutions, Tittawella said. He added that it would be a major point in capital market development in the country.
Finance Ministry's Public Private Partnership (PPP) Unit Chairman Thilan Wijesinghe in the meantime envisioned PPPs to make up 40 to 50 percent of all FDIs into the country in future.
The PPP Units role is to assist the line ministries concerned with both the PPP process and the SOE reform process, Wijesinghe who is currently working on restructuring Sri Lankan Airlines and soliciting a strategic partner for the Airline said.
He however admitted that there were delays in implementing PPP projects due to lack of staff and sorting out confusions regarding the proper guidelines to be followed in these ventures. The Unit however has been supported by World Bank funding, with an initial grant of US$ 700,000 and they hope to soon recruit the necessary experts.
We need to hire financial advisors to support the line ministries.There has been an overall lack of skill rather than lack of will in the case of SOE reform.This is where PPP will step in, Wijesinghe said.
Tittawella said their focus was on creating an equal playing field for SOEs and the private sector, with the public sector being revenue generating and competitive with no added advantage compared to the private sector.

What the UNP is doing to help with the cost of living:
Strengthening our economy
As a government the economy is central to everything we do and it is only with the UNP that Sri Lankas economy will be made stronger to improve the lives of ordinary Sri Lankans. As a country we have truly come a long way from the dark days of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who governed only for himself, his family and cronies. The economy was in a mess and Sri Lankans lived in fear for their safety.
Our government is working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans. So far we have created more than 400,000 jobs and helped over 200,000 families secure a home. This investment in these houses is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough measures have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
The UNP is committed to ensuring that ordinary families, vulnerable people and poor communities in our society receive the necessary support. We have doubled Samurdhi payments to low income families so that they have more money in their pockets than under the previous regime, which only cared about its own pockets. These families are also benefitting from the actions the UNP has taken to reduce the cost of goods like fuel and medicine. For the first time, pregnant women and the elderly are receiving real support. As we continue to strengthen our economy, we will continue to increase support to people who were neglected and forgotten under the previous regime.
Price of goods reduction
Here are some of the practical steps we have taken to improve people receive support. The UNP led government continues to provide Rs 20,000 to pregnant women. We are giving 430,000 senior citizens special interest rates so that Sri Lankans of all ages can live a comfortable, dignified life. The UNP put an end to the pension shortcomings faced by hundreds of thousands of farmers and we have doubled the minimum and maximum Samurdhi allowance. Our government provided relief for 36,011 people who pawned jewellery to deal with the cost of living.
The government is lowering the cost of living for ordinary families by reducing the price of goods. We know the importance of everyday costs to your family and we are lowering the cost of vital items for your family. In government, the UNP led government has reduced prices of fuel by up to 22%, we have reduced the price of 48 essential medical drugs by up to 85%, and halved the price of heart stents. Under our government has the price of kekulu red rice is down by Rs 5.76 per kg, the price of sugar is down by Rs 1.02 per kg, the price of milk powder is down by Rs 54.13 per pack and the price of wheat ower is down by Rs 8.14 per kg.
Foreign investment
We know there is still more to do so that everyone can walk the streets safely, our children can get a good education, and basic food is affordable. We will not rest on our laurels and will continue our mission to transform Sri Lanka and deliver better lives for all our people. That is why the forthcoming budget is so important. The economy is central to everything we do. Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools or hospitals or jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
Only this government has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future.

UN to review Sri Lankas human rights record
Sri Lankas human rights record will be examined by the UN Human Rights Councils Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Working Group for the third time on Wednesday, November 15, 2017 in a meeting that will be webcast live.
The delegation of Sri Lanka will be headed by National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva.
Sri Lanka is one of the 14 States to be reviewed by the UPR Working Group during its upcoming session taking place from 6 to 17 November. Sri Lankas first and second UPR reviews took place in May 2008 and November 2012, respectively.
The documents on which the reviews are based are: 1) national report - information provided by the State under review; 2) information contained in the reports of independent human rights experts and groups, known as the Special Procedures, human rights treaty bodies, and other UN entities; 3) information provided by other stakeholders including national human rights institutions, regional organizations and civil society groups.
Among the issues raised in the above-mentioned documents are: investigations into all cases of enforced disappearances, reparations for victims and relatives, and bringing those responsible to justice; investigations into alleged war crimes; the Prevention of Terrorism Act; operationalising the Office of Missing Persons; steps to establish a truth and reconciliation commission; ensuring equal access to justice systems for all communities; reports of the use of torture and arbitrary arrest by security and law enforcement; addressing hate speech and incitement to violence; promoting and protecting the rights of the LGBTI community; steps taken to decriminalise same-sex relations between adults; steps to protect religious minorities; the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act; combatting gender-based and sexual violence; criminalizing all forms of violence against women, including marital rape; steps to eliminate child labour; and measures taken to improve the living conditions of the poor.
The UPR is a unique process which involves a periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN Member States. Since its first meeting was held in April 2008, all 193 UN member States have been reviewed twice within the first and second UPR cycles. During the third UPR cycle, States are again expected to spell out steps they have taken to implement recommendations posed during their previous reviews which they committed to follow-up on, as well as to highlight recent human rights developments in the country.

United march towards democracy
President is serious about the Steering Committee on constitution making, no doubt. However he has seen that discussions in public forums are not enough. TV and radio discussions are limited and selective. Hence various misunderstandings have crept in to the minds of various social and cultural sections; especially among Buddhist Sangha. That is why he has decided to call for meetings with all Chapters of Buddhist clergy; in addition an All Party Conference and special discussions among various sections led and influenced by Sangha. Its feared whether Parliament will go for a new Constitution under the pressure from those who are filled in their minds with grave misunderstandings about the positive role of the new constitution.
The foremost place for Buddhism is a unique feature of Lankan Constitution but Tamil and Muslim leaders are prepared to tolerate this. May be comparing Evangelical Lutheran Religion is the official religion of the state in Norway and Evangelical Lutheran Church is the established Church of Denmark; yet they are considered very liberal countries. However sadly, there is a history of pogroms against other religious groups by so called Theravada Buddhists in Lanka. Nobody here has prepared a constitution with open federal features. All Federal countries, barring a very few, are geographically vast countries; but India is considered a unitary state even though devolution in India is much stronger when police and land powers are considered.
Even now, before the new constitution comes to Lanka, sovereignty lies with the people. In the Republic of Sri Lanka, sovereignty is in the people, and is inalienable. It was duly elected peoples representatives that thought it fit to promulgate the 1978 Constitution, as an offshoot of the first Republican Constitution. That is where Lanka started as an independent sovereign nation. Before that from 1947 to 1972, technically Lankans were governed by British sovereign power. Every law was enacted in her name.
First home-grown constitution
The first home-grown constitution was promulgated only after 25 years of independence. One can argue that the provisions of the Soulbury Constitution can be used to make the new Constitution.
There were no provisions because, over the years, the Supreme Court as well as the then highest court of the country promulgated on a number of occasions that certain Articles of the Soulbury Constitution were unalterable. In other words, the British, when they gave independence, thought it fit to retain some unalterable provisions. So, at the 1970 General Elections, the United National Front gave a firm assurance in their election manifesto that if it were elected to power, all the elected representatives would sit separately as a Constituent Assembly. They did that. Now, Lanka is taking a giant leap with the new constituent assembly.
Mangala, Minister of Finance, in supporting the report submitted by the Steering Committee on constitutional reform, called for a constitution that will help our nation put its past behind for good and move forward with renewed hope. obviously he has meant that Lankans must forget the past where majoritist politics created clashes among nationalities within country.
Hence, this is a positive statement. Mangalas speech also alluded to the Sathara Brahma Viharana or the four humanist mental conditions that should be evoked when looking at another, meththa, karuna, muditha, and upekka. These are not divine but human attitudes developed within social communal living suppressing desire, hate and delusion. Of course those who believe in God the creator, can believe these mind sets arrive with god blessing, no problem. According to Buddhist teachings meththa means to defend the right of the other to live, karuna means to give the share of the other, muditha means the joy in others achievement, finally upekka means to pardon others mistake in equanimity.
There have been a lot of allusions to the Buddhas doctrine of late. M.A. Sumanthiran (TNA) has argued for the repealing of Article 9 of the constitution which states The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).
He has rightfully stated that he, not being a Buddhist, just for that cannot be told that he is second class in this country. He argues further that support for Article 9 is an indefensible position for the Buddhists to take. clearly he is pointing to the fact that Buddhists following a teaching which so strongly emphasized the equality of all humans are in an embarrassing situation. If 9 is deleted all religions will be treated equally under the Articles 10 and 14 (1) (e) whether Sumanthiran is silent or not about those Articles.
The inconsistency with Buddhist philosophy would be eliminated. With that message of dharma given in the speech of Mangala will be valid.
Sarcasm of Sumanthiran when he said that he will not oppose if Buddhists demand that article 9 should be included, could be neutralized. Thus Mangala started with the correct perspective and Sumanthiran made use of the avenue set by Mangala. All this of course is not innocent but is it progressive It is true that history whether one likes it or not, bears upon the present and future. Constitutions have not, do not and will not fall from the sky. Societies and cultures are changing and developing ever according to the rule of uthpatha thithi banga.
Hence, these are not cast in stone of course and are necessarily altered over time and space, with negation of the negation for better or worse. Negation or dumping history is serious occurrence inspite of the need to remember the past; seen violent and bloody persecution which cannot and should not be forgotten. One note that neither Samaraweera nor his political friends have clean histories; nobody has, and neither are they ready to do the forgive-and-forget of past wrongs perpetrated by political opponents. That does not mean that they are right in the middle of a revenge game, as were their predecessors.
British rule
Less seriously, Sumanthiran is known as a Christian, and his religious community may have it good for centuries at the expense of Buddhists and Hindus, before Panadura Vadaya and arrival of Cornel Oldcot. Buddhist revival changes the picture even under British rule. Asking Buddhists to act as rational enlighten community is a credit to the Buddhist revivalists.
Many believe that Lanka is the real centre of Theravada Buddhism and men such as Prof. Carlo Fonseka claim Buddhism is a source for rationalist thinking. Of course to assume they have achieved one of the four levels of enlightenment, at least Sovan, is bit much. However Sumanthiran, by his sober yet compelling appeal made the eyes open for so many, while surely injured the pride of several racists in the Sinhala Buddhist camp. But it has not violated the Christian teaching, for example, could read Matthew 5:39: You have heard that it was said, Eye for eye and tooth for tooth. But I tell you not to resist an evil person.
If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also; if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
Let us unitedly march towards democracy and modernism.

Young  at heart
He is an orthodox left-arm spinner who represented Maliyadeva College Kurunegala, and has taken over from Muthiah Muralitharan as Sri Lankas main wicket-taking bowler. In Test matches he has taken 405 wickets, thus becoming the first left-arm spinner in the history of Test cricket to achieve this feat.
