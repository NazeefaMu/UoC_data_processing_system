Akila Dananjaya celebrated honeymoon with career best spell
PALLEKELE: Spinner Akila Dananjaya who nearly fashioned out a win for Sri Lanka in the second one-day international against India at the Pallekele International Stadium on Thursday with career best figures of 6 for 54 hardly had time to spend his honeymoon with his newly married wife Nethali Tekshini.
The wedding was in the afternoon (Wednesday) at Moratuwa. It finished around 4 pm and when I got back to the team hotel it was around 11:30 in the night. I wanted to reach earlier than that but it took a little longer we were a bit late when we came, said Dananjaya at the post-match press conference.
Dananjaya said that he chose Sri Lanka spinners Rangana Herath and Ajantha Mendis as attesting witnesses to his wedding because I liked them so much.
I liked Herath from those days and Ajantha too. Rangana is our number one bowler. So I invited them to sign for my wedding.
Dananjaya who was named man of the match said that he was disappointed his bowling efforts failed to bring a win for his team but gave credit to India for their three-wicket victory.
We would have been happy had we won the game. But they really played well Bhuvi and Dhoni were superb. They batted really well against our bowlers. There was not much of a change in the wicket, said Dananjaya,
As Sri Lanka had only a small total to defend  231 in 47 overs Dananjaya said that he had try out various variations to fox the Indian batsmen.
I realized that my off-spin was not helping much. So I decided get back to my variations. The target we had to defend wasnt too much either. So we had to take wickets. I bowled a lot of variations and it went really well, Dananjaya said.
Asked to describe his variations Dananjaya replied, I am an off-spinner. My wicket taking balls are leg-spin and the googly.
Dananjaya was first discovered by former captain Mahela Jayawardene who impressed him as a net bowler at practice and wanted him fast tracked to the national squad so that he made his international debut at the age of 19 against New Zealand in a T20I at Pallekele in 2012. However after a year he disappeared from the international scene until he reappeared against Zimbabwe in June where he recorded his best ODI figures of 4/47 prior to Thursdays performance.
Akila was not around due to the fact that Sachithra (Senanayake) was performing well for us, said Sri Lankas spin bowling coach Piyal Wijetunga.
Sachitra had an issue with his bowling action and he had to remodel it. Once he did that his effectiveness was less. So we tried another off-spinner and Akila was able to bounce back to the side. He does skill training for three days a week and bowls for about 80 minutes a day, said Wijetunga.
Nic Pothas the coach said that it was frustrating not to win and when luck was not on your side.
When you are not winning games regularly it is quite hard to get the momentum back again. Its a classic isnt it, you are trying to win a game. You are on top of it and then the ball goes though someones leg and hits the stumps and the bails dont come off. That is going to happen. When you are trying to wrestle back the initiative and when things dont go your way it is very, very frustrating, said Pothas.
He was referring to the luck MS Dhoni had in the 35th over with India 59 runs away when a Vishwa Fernando produced a false shot from the former Indian captain and the ball trickled between his legs to hit the stumps but the heavy bails didnt fall.
These are the kind of games you want to win and you need to win. Had we got that one wicket we would have gained a lot of confidence and got a lot of momentum. But credit should go to India and it shows how much depth they have got in that squad.
Bhuvi played brilliantly and Dhoni did what he does best, one of the calmest characters under pressure. We are obviously disappointed. On the positive side, this young guy (Dananjaya) bowled really well and we were happy for him. Not the worst honeymoon pressure to have, said Pothas.

Catholic Bishops Conference opposes any attempts to legalise abortion
While vehemently condemning the governments efforts to legalise abortions on two counts, the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka (CBCSL)yesterday stressed that they do not condone any form of abortion in the country. The Catholic Bishop Conference in a released issued under the signatures of its President Rt. Rev. Dr. J. Winston S. Fernando and Secretary General Rt. Rev. Dr. Valance Mendis said that they oppose the governemnts decision to legalise two forms of abortion in the country.
No one has the right to tamper with human life even by way of an exception, a Catholic Bishops Conference said.
The statement: the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka, gathered in its plenary meeting is deeply concerned at the news that a Cabinet decision has been made to legalize abortion on two counts and is to be presented to the Parliament
The Conference strongly condemns any effort to legalise abortion in any form whatsoever. The Catholic Church believes that life begins at the very moment of conception and is sacred and no one has the right to tamper with human life even by way of an exception.
Jutice should not be compromised on any account especially when it is the question of safeguarding the right to life of the unborn child. One cannot safeguard ones rights at the expense of violating anothers right, the message said Earlier in the week, the Cabinet approved papers to be sent to Parliament which would legalise abortion if a woman was raped, and if a foetus was diagnosed with Lethal Congenital Malformation.
Once the law is enacted, the mothers will receive the opportunity to decide whether to abort the fetus or go ahead with the pregnancy, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said at the time.
The Catholic Church opposes abortion worldwide.

CID extracts data from Palisenas mobile phone
PTL CEO hands over his laptop to CID:
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake yesterday averred that several important telephone call recordings relating to certain deals entered between the Perpetual Treasuries Limited and the Employees Provident Fund are missing.
DSG Gunatilake said call recordings under serial number 6816, 6817, 6818 and 6819 are not found in the call recordings provided by the PTL to the PCoI.
The Perpetual Treasuries Limited handed over all the telephone call recordings of its company to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue prior to last week. All the telephone calls are recorded under consecutive running serial numbers.
Playing three call recordings in relation to a secondary market transaction which took place on June 5,2015, between the PTL and the EPF, DSG Gunatilake questioned PTL CEO as to why the investigators cannot find telephone call recordings relating to the conclusion of the deal.
Palisena agreed that in all three telephone calls played, the dealers from both sides do not come to any conclusion regarding the discussed transaction. He further said that he will have to check with his IT experts as to why call recordings under the said serial numbers are missing.
DSG Gunatilake questioned Palisena if the PTL has tampered with the call recordings, which Palisena denied.
Meanwhile, Kasun Palisena yesterday handed over his laptop device to the CID team attached to the PCoI for a digital forensic examination. Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa informed the PCoI that the CID will be extracting data from Palisenas mobile phone which was handed over to the PCoI in the beginning of August 2017. The data extraction was to take place yesterday at 2.30 p.m. in the presence of Palisenas legal representative. Indatissa further said that CID will extract data from Arjun Mahendrans mobile phone on next Wednesday (30).
The Attorney General yesterday began cross examining PTL CEO Kasun Palisena, following evidence being led by PTLs counsels through Palisena.
The PCoI informed that it will sit from 10 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. starting from next Monday, as it is pressed for time.

Construction industry needs to be internationally competitive : Sajith
The government has taken measures to make the construction industry internationally competitive by enhancing professionalism, raising skills levels, improving industry practices and technologies, and by promoting a new construction culture with an integrated approach to construction, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
He made this observation participating at the opening ceremony of Construct 2017 held yesterday at the BMICH.
Today, we are at certain cross-roads, a challenging point in the economic recovery and the modernization effort launched under the direction of the President and the Prime Minister, a mere two and half years ago, he said.
The minister said the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA), has now been made fully operational as the apex agency of the state for the regulation and the management of the industry. A new National Policy on Construction, prepared after exhaustive consultations with the stake-holders, has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on his recommendation.
Skills training in the construction industry has been strengthened and expanded under the Samata Saviya programme. But, the Government as well as the industry stake-holders have to do much more, he said.
The people as well as the Government expect much more from the construction industry than ever before. The industry has to help the national economy to recover and also has to contribute to the easing of the social problems in the country, he said.
He further said that the challenge for the industry today is to do well despite constraints in its working environment. Ways have to be found amongst us, between the government and the industry, to take advantage of the special features of construction which offer unique opportunities.
The construction industry needs to effectively play its role in the economy by realizing its potential to create jobs in all parts of the country.
New strategies are necessary to make this possible. Construction activities need to lay the infrastructure for development, he added.

Dayasiri's rallying call
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has called for the strict enforcement of collective Cabinet responsibility henceforth. This is in the wake of the Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe episode. Rajapakshe was forced to step down for violating collective Cabinet responsibility when he aired contrary views to a Cabinet decision to lease out the Hambantota port to a Chinese Company. It was not just Rajapaskhe, even minister Susil Premajayantha had gone public being critical of the agreement and in addition making statements that are diametrically opposed to government policy. So far he has escaped unscathed while Wijeyadasa's head rolled.
True, like the minister explained, one may have divergent views, which may be thrashed out inside Cabinet. But once a collective decision is taken the entire Cabinet is bound by it. It is also true that there is a clash in ideology and economic policy between the UNP and the SLFP, whose polices, one may even go onto describe as chalk is to cheese. Or is it Not any longer, by a long way. Chandrika changed this equation, with the result that both major parties are now on even keel in terms of economic policy and also social outlook. Hence, there is no reason for a head on collision of the type one witnessed down the decades. MR himself embraced the market economy of the UNP and even made the UNP blush with some of the changes he effected, in contrast to the SLFP's traditional way of thinking. Perhaps, the SLFP ministers, still clinging to the past, may baulk at some of the Cabinet decisions taken. It is also understandable why they take a different stance. They have a constituency which still clings to the Bandaranaike ideals.
But, it is obvious that there has to a bit of give and take in a coalition government comprised of the country's two major political parties. Old ways should give way to the new. Whatever differences, though, should be ironed out within Cabinet and the Ministers speak in a unified voice in public.
Speaking at the press briefing to announce Cabinet decisions, minister Jayasekara also expressed the view that ALL members of the Unity Government should speak in one voice. This is perhaps after the plethora of divergent views being expressed by both sides in the Yahapalanaya government, that obviously is sending the wrong signals to the public, suggesting disunity. Jayasekara is himself guilty of this, along with Cabinet colleague Champika Ranawaka. They both are vocal in their opposition to SAITM, placing the government in an embarrassing position. There are others like Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya who is even casting aspersions on the Prime Minister and deriding UNP policies.
Jayasekara also hinted that the Unity Government will continue till 2020 when he said that both parties should be united and speak in one voice. "This animosity is not healthy for the Yahapalanaya Government as we expect to govern the country until 2020". Therefore it is the responsibility of the UNP and SLFP to go forward with a mutual understanding, he emphasized. Even SLFP General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake had hinted, more than once, the certainty in continuing with the alliance, beyond the expiry of the agreement between the two parties although the President had asked his men to give him time till December 31, obviously to quell the rumblings of discontent within his camp.
Be that as it may, both sides should ensure to keep the alliance intact beyond the realms of a marriage of convenience. The Rajapaksas are sniffing around to pounce on any differences or discontent to claw their way back to power. The way Mahinda Rajapaksa seized on the Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe saga to make political capital is a good example of the
modus oprandi of the Joint Opposition. Today, they have made Wijeyadasa, a hero, nay, a martyr, who they single out to be a victim of those bent on sale of national assets, a refrain often heard from members of the JO. They are similarly on the lookout for others expressing similar sentiments, so that they could claim to the public that government members too were on the same wavelength as they.
UNP members too should stop baiting their SLFP colleagues in the government. Both sides should desist media conferences where dirty linen is being washed in public.
SLFP MPs should be prevailed upon not to attack or criticize the Prime Minister. Not a single UNP parliamentarian has so far spoken ill of the President. The PM, after all, is the leader of the government and head of the Cabinet. It would be unbecoming of any member, therefore, to target the Premier. It should be recalled that the UNP is in a majority in parliament and it could have formed a government of its own following the election by inducing crossovers. Thankfully, saner counsel prevailed and the protagonists opted for a Unity Government, as much as to keep the Rajapaksas at bay, as to develop the country and the economy jointly. Hence it is important that the alliance stays firm to achieve the country's long term objectives.

Deshapriya urges voters to register in Electoral Register 2017
The Electoral Commission urges all citizens eligible to vote to ensure that their and their family members' names are inserted in the Electoral Register of 2017 in response to the noticeable drop in voter registration this year.
In a press release issued by the Office of the Election Commission, Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said:
A noticeable drop in registering as electors in the Electoral Register for 2017 has been observed among the general public in the City of Colombo, District of Colombo, and mostly other urban and semi-urban areas and also in rural areas and in estates. Lack of interest among the citizens in registering as electors or failure to submit the enumeration forms in time or due to the floods or other reasons can be cited as reasons for the noticeable drop of names to be inserted in the Electoral Registrar of 2017.
Therefore, the Election Commission requests all the citizens who are eligible to be registered as electors to ensure that their names and the names of their families are inserted in the Electoral Registrar of 2017.
" Draft of the Electoral Registrar for 2017 is now displayed in the website of the Election Commission www.elections.gov.lk. The Electoral Register of 2016 and the list of names that have been omitted from the Register for 2017 and the list of names that have been added to the Register for 2017 are now available for inspection at all the District Secretariats, Divisional Secretariats, Offices of Local Authorities and all the Grama Niladhari Offices.
If a name of an eligible citizen has not yet been enumerated for the Electoral Register for 2017, requests for inclusion could be submitted to the relevant District Election Offices until September 6, 2017.

Government postpones tabling of IR draft bill
The proposed new Inland Revenue Act is consistent with the constitution and has been amended as per the determination of the Supreme Court said State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramarathne.
The new inland revenue draft bill that was due to be submitted to parliament today (25), but the government had decided to postpone tabling it until September 07.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department, Minister Wickramarathne said the main objective of the new Inland Revenue Bill was to simplify the tax system in the country in order to create an investor friendly environment that will attract more foreign direct investments in the near future.
The Bill aims to reduce the indirect taxes levied from the people from 80 percent to 60 percent and increase the direct taxes from 20 percent to 40 percent within three years, he said.
Minister Wickremarathne said the Inland Revenue Act will not affect the normal people and the professionals who earn more than Rs 100,000 would be subject to pay a tax.
He said that the new government inherited an unstable economy and now they have been able to stabilize the economy.
The government is in the process of reforming the system to create a strong foundation for the future. We have been able to successfully bring down the instability in the economy which was the budget deficit. As a part of that reform we have been able to raise government revenue from a low level of 11.5 percent of GDP to a 14.5 percent of GDP within this short period of time. In an attempt to increase our exports which has fallen drastically over the last decade and a half from 34 percent of GDP to 14-15 percent of GDP, we have taken a decision that the Sri Lankan exchange rate should reflect the market forces, he said.
Minister Wickramarathne said the reserves in the country have gone up from USD 5 Billion to USD 7 Billion and added that the government expects USD 400 Million and by next year another USD 600  700 Million from the Hambantota port.
He further said that new investments will come in the next 24 months and that would change the economic scenario of the country.
We have not had a new bill for a long period, there were amendments but never actually presented a comprehensive new bill. Simple language has been used and that would make it much easier to see how the tax system operates. We have done it in a very transparent manner and had discussions with all stake holders including the trade unions, he said. Minister Wickramarathne affirmed that they have incorporated the suggestions presented by the trade union and that will be presented as amendments in Parliament along with the bill.
He said the government has brought down the cost of single cab, double cab and demo vehicles by Rs 300,000 to strengthen the small and medium scale businessmen.
When asked whether the indirect tax which is around 82 percent would be reduced under the new bill, Minister Wickramarathne said that they expect it to be reduced and added that the motive of the government is to reduce the indirect tax that is being levied.
Responding to a question raised by a Journalist whether taxes would be introduced on statutory benefits such as EPF/ETF, he said that there will not be any changes to the earlier procedure and it will remain the same.

He made these remarks addressing a gathering yesterday at the Induction and Graduation ceremony 2017, of the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka at the BMICH.
He said that the Port deal was an opportunity that should grabbed.
"Some people debate that the deal was not framed appropriately. But it is not only concerning the deal, it would also develop the area in the years to come," he said.
He said the country was likely to have two trade agreements with China and India which could be a change maker as no other country in the South Asia has equal access to these countries.
Dr Coomaraswamy further said that over the last 30 - 40 years, the economic growth had slowed down and the underlying cause for this has consistently been the government budget, adding that the governments<U+200B> had not been able to manage public finances.
"Until we get the budget deficit in order, the economic stability is not going to be possible.
"There had been higher budget deficits in the past 30 - 40 years. On the contrary, all successful countries in the South East Asian region were able to have a disciplined budget," he said.
He said the government had put in place frameworks to stabilize the economy.
"The government is in the process of implementing a revenue based fiscal consolidation programme with the aim of bringing the budget deficit down to 3.5 percent GDP. Our target for this year is 4.6 percent and at present the government is on the right track," he said.
Dr Coomaraswamy said that in the past, government<U+200B>s had been spending their foreign reserves and to get away from that system we need a more flexible exchange rate policy.
He noted that the country would have a stronger macro economic policy, adding that a new export based economic growth strategy would be created in which the private sector would be involved for export and investment.
He said as the government does not have the money for development processes, the private sector has to be the main engine to drive the process.
"If we don't meet the economic aspirations of the people, we would have to face political and social instability. While taking initiatives to boost the domestic investment, equal priority has to be given to bring in Free Trade Agreements as well," he said.
Dr Coomaraswamy said that one of the most disappointing aspects of the post conflict era over the past 6 -7 years, was the performance of both domestic and foreign investments in the country.
He further said that the government had taken the necessary measures to achieve a stable economy by strengthening the investment climate, investment promotion, trade facilitation and trade policy.

How will history judge Rooneys England legacy
Wayne Rooneys retirement from international duty - announced after Englands all-time record goalscorer had been told he had won a recall at 31 - closes another chapter in his illustrious story.
Rooney, with 53 England goals in 119 appearances, left Manchester United to return to Everton this summer with his place in Old Traffords history books also assured after he overtook Sir Bobby Charltons club record with 253 goals.
He had been sidelined by Jose Mourinho at United, and also by Southgate with England, but such has been his early rejuvenation at Goodison Park that he was offered a place back in the fold for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia.
Rooney, who originally planned to end his England career after next summers World Cup in Russia, decided against a return and will now focus fully on Everton.
So how will history judge Wayne Rooneys England career
THE RISE OF ROOMANIA
Those of us fortunate to be in Portugal for the long, hot summer of Euro 2004 will remember the rise of this phenomenon and how Evertons 18-year-old became the most talked-about player at a tournament eventually won by rank outsiders Greece.
Rooney had made his debut, and become Englands youngest player at 17 years and 111 days, in a defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003.
But it was his deeds in Lisbon against France, where he gave an experienced defence a harrowing night in a 2-1 loss at the iconic Stadium of Light, as well as scoring twice against Switzerland and Croatia, that thrust him into the global spotlight. Suddenly, the quiet youngster who played football from the streets was the name on everyones lips. Calls to hotels and mobile phones were being fielded from around the world, seeking the story of the Croxteth boy who played in an untamed style that had suddenly transformed him into a superstar.
As someone who attended the same De La Salle School in Liverpool, it was easier for me to paint a picture of his working-class background and the environment that had shaped his development - on the school playground in Carr Lane East and in junior sides before joining Everton.
Rooney himself was largely protected from the mounting media attention, but his football did the talking.
Phil Neville, a fellow England squad member at Euro 2004, recalls: I remember when he first got into the squad - the youthfulness, the bravery, the courage he showed, particularly at his first major tournament in Portugal.
He was a breath of fresh air. No-one enjoyed playing for England more than Wayne Rooney. This Euro 2004 episode ended in misery when Rooney broke his foot early in the quarter-final against Portugal, which England lost on penalties. Many felt England would have won that tournament had Rooney stayed fit, but he had made an indelible mark - life would never be the same as he embarked on an international career lived under intense personal and sporting scrutiny.
ROONEYS REGRETS
Rooneys stratospheric rise in Portugal sent expectation through the roof, his unstoppable blend of power, awareness and potency in front of goal leaving England fans hoping they had finally found the talisman to end the years of frustration since the World Cup win of 1966.
Sadly, this proved beyond not just him but a generation of world-class players such as Liverpools Steven Gerrard, Chelseas Frank Lampard and the likes of Paul Scholes and David Beckham from Manchester United. The golden generation could not reproduce their consistent success at club level with once in England colours. Rooneys legacy will be coloured by his failure to make a mark on another major tournament. Not fully fit, he was sent off in another quarter-final defeat to Portugal at the 2006 World Cup, and was then the most obvious symbol of the frustrations felt inside the infamous Camp Capello in South Africa in 2010.
Manager Fabio Capellos decision to keep Englands players miles off the beaten track - when they threw open their bedroom windows there would not have been the slightest clue they were in Africa - seemed to particularly affect Rooney, someone who did not apparently need or enjoy downtime.
He described a typical day as breakfast, training, lunch, dinner, bed, adding for good measure there are only so many games of darts and snooker you can play.
Rooneys dark mood surfaced as he shouted criticism of Englands supporters into a television camera following a horrific goalless draw with Algeria in Cape Town before England were thrashed by Germany in the last 16.
For all his effort - and you only had to listen to Rooney at close quarters to sense his desire and commitment - it simply never happened for him at another tournament. Rooney missed the start of Euro 2012 through suspension after being sent off in a qualifier in Montenegro and while he was actually one of Englands better performers at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and at last summers Euro 2016 in France, the abiding memory will be of abject humiliation on both occasions - failure to reach the knockout stage then a last-16 exit to Iceland. Rooney scored just one goal in 11 appearances at World Cup finals from 21 attempted shots. It is a telling statistic for him, and for England.
The counterpoint to this is that only Gary Lineker (10) and Alan Shearer (nine) scored more than Rooneys seven goals for England at major tournaments.
But it seemed the harder Rooney tried the more this success eluded him, and when his England career is examined, it will be through the prism of these let-downs - something that still hurts enough to warrant a mention in his retirement statement. And yet Sven-Goran Eriksson, the man who gave him his England debut, believes Rooney could have stayed on to make an impact at next summers World Cup. In giving a glowing tribute to BBC World Service, the Swede said: If he goes on playing like he is now, scoring goals for Everton, then he could still have been an important player. If I was England manager I would do everything to convince Rooney to play at the World Cup then make a decision. And he recalled the player he worked with as he said: I remember when training was finished Rooney didnt want to leave the training ground. He wanted to stay doing free-kicks, shooting etc.
Hes tough, a great player, hard worker, has everything as a football player. He was mature at 17. I remember I told him the day before his debut for England that he was going to start he just said OK like it was normal. It was not normal at 17.
HOW WILL ROONEY BE REMEMBERED
Rooneys England record is in the books and cannot be erased - but he may just fall short of the status of great afforded to Sir Bobby Charlton, whose goals record he broke for Manchester United and his country. Charlton has an accolade shared by only 11 Englishmen, a World Cup winners medal, while Rooney was perhaps a victim of his own stunning early success.
But he will be recalled, certainly by those who have followed the England camp closely throughout his international career, as someone who was endlessly committed to his country.
He was always the consummate team player, always willing to sacrifice his own needs and personal preferences if he thought it would achieve the desired result. As an example, he willingly shifted to the left-flank, unfamiliar territory, to accommodate the shock inclusion of Raheem Sterling against Italy in Manaus at the 2014 World Cup. Whenever the case was made for his exclusion, as it occasionally was, the counter-argument posed was whether England would be a better team without him. The answer was rarely yes. England team-mates spoke with almost unanimous respect for his presence inside the dressing room and on the field. He was, in dressing room parlance, a players player. Rooneys work-rate was prodigious, often leading to him appearing in areas of the pitch where he was not at his most effective, but it was always done with the best of intentions, fuelled by an unquenchable desire to win - something that often caused his volatile temperament to boil over.
Throughout all the years and managerial changes, as well as starting alongside 86 different players, Rooney was always regarded by Sven-Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren, Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson as the key member of their team. Time ran out under Gareth Southgate as Rooney struggled at Manchester United, but even he was ready to bring him back after his early excellence for Everton.
And if respect among opposing players and managers is a measure of Rooneys stature, then it was also a running theme throughout his career that he was invariably the man they feared most in Englands team. It is perhaps a sign of his selflessness that he has decided to bow out now rather than take the opportunity to close in on the seven more England caps he needed to pass goalkeeper Peter Shiltons record tally of 125 but it appears he has listened to his body and called it a day.
Hes definitely the greatest goalscorer weve ever had, said Neville. I think hes made the right call for his career and probably made the right call for Gareth Southgate as well. Hes gone out at the top and as Englands greatest ever goalscorer - what a classy way to bow out from whats been a fabulous international career.
Of course, it is impossible to paint a glorious unblemished canvas of his England career, with two red cards and his role in squads that failed at major tournaments, but Rooney has a record that he can be justly proud of and can take his place in the Football Associations Hall Of Fame.  BBC

'Huge blow' for Wallabies as Coleman ruled out
DUNEDIN Friday: The Wallabies hopes of closing the gap on the world champion All Blacks suffered a huge blow on the eve of Saturday's Rugby Championship clash in Dunedin with senior lock Adam Coleman ruled out.
Throughout the week the Australians have claimed they were not as bad as they appeared when thrashed 54-34 by New Zealand in Sydney last week and would prove in Saturday's rematch they can be competitive.
But the recurrence of a shoulder injury to Coleman on Friday cost the Wallabies their pack enforcer and lineout caller.
It's a huge blow, captain Michael Hooper said. We literally just found out this morning. We know he was pushing to the last minute to get it right, even did the lineouts that we did this morning, but just couldn't there.
Coach Michael Chieka was forced to recall Rory Arnold who was dropped to the bench after last week's performance, add 21-year-old novice Izack Rodda to the bench and ponder who would set the physical tone in Coleman's absence.
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said earlier in the week he expected the Wallabies to be much more physical in response to their hiding in Australia and Cheika responded by saying he would be asking the whole team to step up.
Whether there's physicality of the game and all of the contact part of the game, it has to come down to every member of the team, he said.
Yes, Adam likes to be involved in that but we'll see who's prepared to step up and maybe take the lead there now. But he'll need everyone following him in.
Despite the Wallabies scoring four late tries and dominating the final quarter of the first Test, Cheika accepts that his Wallabies have been written off ahead of the rematch.
No one does (rate us) to be honest, he said. It's up to us to write our own chapters if you want to change that attitude around... We do lots of good stuff away from the field but what counts is on the field for everybody.
We're playing for Australia so I don't think we should be driven by what happened the week before. We can't dwell on the past too much because that's not where we're living. We're living in the now and tomorrow's going to be a huge game for us.
The Wallabies also confirmed Lopeti Timani will take his place on the bench after earlier being bracketed with Jack Dempsey.

I am no one-day batsman but the situation was perfect  Bhuvi
PALLEKELE: Indias number nine batsman Bhuvneshwar Kumar had the situation ideally tailor made for him when he came to bat with his team tottering on the brink of defeat at 131-7 in the second ODI against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Stadium chasing a revised target of 231 in 47 overs.
India at that stage required to score exactly 100 off 25 overs at four runs an over and it only needed a cool head to get to that target.
With no pressure at all on the run rate Kumar had only to play his normal game and assist his former captain MS Dhoni to see his team through.
I never thought in my dreams that I would score a fifty in one dayers not a fifty but a match winning knock because one dayers is the kind of format which doesnt suit my batting because I am not kind of batsman who can hit big sixes, said Kumar the spearhead of the bowling department at the post-match press conference.
But that kind of situation was perfect for me because it was totally a Test match situation. When I went in MS told me to play my natural game like I play in Test cricket. Dont take any pressure as we had a lot of overs at that time and we knew if we played them out we would chase easily.
So when I went in there wasnt any pressure really because I knew there is nothing to lose in this situation as we were already seven down. I was just thinking that I had to support MS as much as I can. Thats what I tried to do, he said.
Kumar eventually ended up outscoring his senior partner in the partnership moving to his maiden ODI fifty (53 n.o.) while Dhoni finished on 45 not out.
Having him (Dhoni) at the other end was a feeling of calmness I knew that even in the last 5 overs we will need 7-8 runs per over or close to that, he was there to score the runs. So I didnt want to worry about scoring runs. I just wanted to play all those overs.
Kumar said that initially he had difficulty in picking up the googlies and wrong un that Akila Dananjaya bowled because they always thought that he was an off-spinner.
But Dananjaya brought about a variety of deliveries to flummox Indias top order taking six wickets before Dhoni and Kumar frustrated him and his team from winning.
I had a plan against him. Basically he is an off spinner but he was also bowling leg spinners and googlies so it was a surprise for us. When I went in I just wanted to play him as a wrong un or the googlies which he was bringing in to me. Whatever was going away from me I wasnt really worried. Whatever wickets he took was on the googly, the incoming delivery, so my plan was to counter his incoming deliveries, said Kumar. Initially it was a bit difficult to read him from the hand but later on when I played him for 10-15 balls I could read his variations from the hand.
Kumar thanked the team batting coach Sanjay Bangar for helping him improve his batting.
Thanks to Sanjay Bangar he was working really hard on me. Test cricket is different, one day cricket is different but this situation was as good as test cricket because you have to go through a session, said Kumar.
When I went in that was what went through my mind. The good thing was that the situation was totally familiar. Whenever I go into the nets Bangar helps me to counter those things like I have to go through the last session of a Test so it was the same kind of situation and it was a bit familiar for me.

JO making a joke out of NCM: Ravi
A group of UNP backbenchers yesterday criticised the Joint Opposition (JO) for making a joke out of the No-Confidence Motion(NCM) and alleged that the so-called Opposition in Parliament was merely using such measures to disrupt the work of government.
Former Foreign Minister and UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake addressing a media briefing at the Government Information Department said the ruling coalition is certain of defeating the recent motion of no-confidence submitted against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne with a two thirds majority.
It will be a historic occasion and we will show them that we have all the confidence in Rajitha who helped bring about this regime change, Karunanayake said.
The JO submitted the motion to the Speaker on Thursday with 39 signatures in favour.
Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman pointed out that not even the real leader of the JO, MP Mahinda Rajapaksa had signed any of the motions and that the passing of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill on Friday with 122 in favour and 44 abstaining, showed that the numbers were very much on their side.
He added that the JO through their antics was trying to disrupt Parliamentary proceedings and hinder democratic governance.
Galle District MP Bandulal Bandarigoda in the meantime quipped that the multiple motions of no-confidence put forward by the JO was a ploy to signal to the world that the government was in chaos,
They are trying to discourage foreign investors coming into the country,he said.
Bandarigoda added that MP Dinesh Gunawardenas request to allow public servants to contest in elections during the recent debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill was a farce and that it challenged the independence of the public service,
If public servants were allowed to contest, they would use their position to gain votes. That is not democratic. A public official cannot be political, pointed out Bandarigoda.
Puttlam District MP Hector Appuhamy said the JO were wasting public funds through the frequent suspension of Parliamentary sessions and No-Confidence Motions, They wasted and stole public money when in government and now they are doing the same in opposition,he said.
Prof.Ashu Marasinghe commenting on Minister Senaratnes No-Confidence Motion observed that it had nothing to do with the latters ministry or current activities and it was simply a tactic employed to stop Minister Senaratne from speaking out against the allegedly corrupt MPs of the JO. UNP MP Ananda Aluthgamage agreeing with Marasinghe added that the JO members need to be clean before they pointed fingers at others. UNP MPs J.C. Alawathugoda, Shantha Abeysekara, Sydney Jayarathna, Vijayakala Maheswaran and Lucky Jayawardena also participated at the media briefing.

JO ready to field spouses of government servants as candidates for upcoming LG polls: Vasu
The Joint Opposition will field spouses of government servants as candidates for the upcoming Local Government elections, as the government had deprived the rights of government servants to contest LG election, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara, said.
Addressing a press conference at the Dr. N. M. Perera Memorial Centre in Borella yesterday, he said spouses of Government officers would vie for LG Elections as the Government had deprived the rights of Government officers by prohibiting them from contesting LG Elections.
"We will take every possible effort to ensure that government servants are eligible to contest any upcoming election," he said.
Nanayakkara added that all political parties in Parliament except the Joint Opposition, agreed to deprive the rights of youths in the country by prohibiting government servants to contest LG elections. He said the government brought this amendment targetting the hundreds of dynamic youths who are expected to contest the upcoming Local Government election. "We call upon all those who would not be able to contest the upcoming Local Government elections because of this piece of law, should join us to ensure their right," he said.

A lot of rugby is expected from CPRFU at provincial level
The CPRFU makes excuses of having no proper grounds, ground fee at Nittawela is sky high and also no place to have meetings. Today they do nothing but distribute a few balls which they get from the SLRFU, and watch tournaments conducted by other associations. At its peak in 2002 under the presidency of late Maurice Perera and Iswan Omar as secretary the CPRFU was very active and included top clubs like Kandy SC, Dimbulla C & AC, Dickoya Maskeliya CC, Peradeniya University, Old Trinitians SC and Kandy Youth SC all of whom have at one time or another competed in the SLRFU A division competition. At the time Dr. Sarath Kapuwatte was the president of the Nittawela club, that the earned a name through rugby and gave a big hand. Today his influence is missed. The CPRFU also embarked in forming B division clubs, which included Katugastota RFC, Polgolla RFC, Mawilmada RFC, Matale RFC, Nuwara Eliya RFC and Pilimatalawa RFC and by 2008 had 18 clubs playing in the up-country rugby league.

LG elections bill passed
With a majority of 120 votes :
44 members abstained, No member voted against the bill :
UNP and SLFP Govt. members, JVP and TNA voted in favour:
Joint Opposition abstained:
The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament yesterday with a majority of 120 votes providing for holding the long overdue Local Government elections under a new electoral system.
Following a division called by the Joint Opposition, 120 members voted for the Bill, while 44 members abstained. No member voted against the Bill. The UNP and SLFP members in the Government, JVP and TNA voted in favour. The Joint Opposition led by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena abstained from voting.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha moved further amendments to the Bill at the Committee Stage of the Bill. Several last minute amendments proposed by the JVP and Joint Opposition were also accommodated.
The Bill was to give effect to necessary legal amendments to hold the LG elections under a mixed system, a hybrid of the First-Past-the-Post (FPP) and the Proportional Representation (PR).
Sixty percent has been allocated to the FPP representation while 40 percent has been allocated to PR representation.
After experimenting the new electoral system at the LG elections, it would thereafter be extended to the Provincial Council elections and national level elections.
The legislation assures 25 percent quota to female representatives. It abolishes the preferential voting system. Both moves received admiration of law makers as progressive proposals that would usher in a new political culture.
The Bill amended the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance (Chapter 262) and provided identification for each electoral ward by giving a name and a number among other requirements. It was done following the lengthy process of delimitation.
The Government facilitated a full day debate on the Bill on Thursday and took up the Third Reading yesterday. The Amendments at the third reading took about one and half hours.
The members voted using the newly introduced electronic voting system.
The Parliamentary staff led by Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake helped the members to sort out the mini technical issues cropped up when the vote was in progress.
WDJ abstains from voting against amendment
Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne abstained from voting against an amendment sponsored by the Joint Opposition seeking to permit public servants to contest elections while all government ministers and MPs voted against.
According to the provisions of the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill the public servants are required to resign one year prior to contesting the elections for the Local Government bodies.
The Joint Opposition proposed an amendment to remove that clause from the draft bill.
The government rejected the amendment and the House was moved to a vote. In that vote, Minister Seneviratne abstained. But he voted in favour during the vote on the Bill. The minister told media that depriving the field officers of their democratic right to contest elections amounted to violating their fundamental rights, and his conscience did not permit him to vote with government members.
As the party had not taken any prior standpoint over the issue, it would not cause any problem from the party to him, Minister Seneviratne said.

North Korea fires three missiles into sea

North Korea has fired three short-range ballistic missiles, the US military says.
They were launched from a site in the North Korean province of Gangwon and flew for about 250km (150 miles), officials in South Korea said.
Since firing an intercontinental ballistic weapon last month, Pyongyang has threatened to aim missiles at the US Pacific territory of Guam.
But this latest test did not threaten the US or Guam, the US military said.
North Korean missile tests often come in response to South Korean military exercises involving the US.
Thousands of US and South Korean troops are currently taking part in joint military drills, which are mainly largely computer-simulated exercises.
The projectiles were first launched at 06:49 on Saturday (21:49 GMT Friday), South Korea's Defence Ministry said.
The US military said three missiles were fired.
"The first and third missiles... failed in flight. The second missile launch... appears to have blown up almost immediately," said Commander Dave Benham of the US Pacific Command.
The launches were spread over a period of 30 minutes, he added.
"The military is keeping a tight surveillance over the North to cope with further provocations", the South Korean defence ministry said.

Parliament
Only field officers will be deprived from contesting LG polls: Musthapa
The government decided that only field officers from the public service would be prevented from contesting Local Authorities Elections, despite the proposal made by the Election Commission to prevent all public servants contesting, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, when the Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena proposed that the same section of preventing field officers contesting polls be removed.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella responding to the joint opposition, said only field officers such as Samurdhi Officers, Development Officers and Grama Seva Niladaris from the public service are restricted from contesting. He said others such as teachers could contest.
During the confusion, MP Wimal Weerawansa asked for a vote on the same section which the government side won with a majority of 76 votes. 120 members voted against MP Dinesh Gunawardena's amendment, while 44 voted for. However, Minister John Seneviratne abstained from voting.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena came up with the suggestion that public servants should be allowed to contest polls. "Not allowing public servants to contest elections is a violation of their rights," MP Gunawardena said. "That is a right of the public servants."
However, Leader of the Opposition R Sampanthan also stated that there was no issue in allowing public servants to contest, as they would obviously resign from their posts if elected to office.
Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the concept of Public Servant came up during the late Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike's period and it could not be affected under a government which the SLFP is a part of.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella responding, said only field officers in the public service are restricted from contesting. He said others such as teachers could contest. However, 120 members voted against the proposal, while 44 voted for it.
Minister Faizer Mustapha said that government officers who are prohibited from contesting, had been defined in the draft as field officers such as Samurdhi officials, Grama Niladhari officials and Development officials. The Chairman of the Elections Commission had proposed to prohibit all government officers, but the government decide to confine only field officers.
When MP Gunawardena said that the Election Commission should be summoned before Parliament, Minister Musthapa further said that the government would not agree with the amendment forwarded by MP Gunawardena. The government had reached a decision on the instructions of the Election Commission.

Amendment seeking public servants to contest elections: Labour Minister abstains
Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne, abstained from voting against an amendment sponsored by the Joint Opposition seeking to permit public servants to contest elections, while all government ministers and MPs voted against. According to the provisions of the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill, public servants were required to resign from government service, one year prior to contesting elections for local government bodies.
The Joint Opposition proposed an amendment that the clause be removed from the Draft Bill. The government rejected the amendment, while the House was moved to a vote. In that vote Minister Seneviratne abstained, but voted for at the vote on the Bill.
The minister told the media that depriving field officers of their democratic rights to contest elections amounted to violating their fundamental rights and his conscience did not permit him to vote with the government members. "As the party had not taken any prior standpoint over the issue, it would not create any problem from the party to him," Minister Seneviratne said.
Inland Revenue Bill put off for next date of sitting
The debate on the Inland Revenue Bill, which was scheduled to be taken up yesterday, was put off till the next Parliamentary sitting date.
Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella informed Parliament that the Bill would not be moved for debate as scheduled as the third reading of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill had consumed more time than expected.
The Government presented the Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament for first reading on July 5. The Bill is to provide for the imposition of Income Tax for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2017.
The Bill, among others, introduces a new income tax structure, aimed at closing existing loopholes in revenue collection.
The Inland Revenue Bill is also to undergo a large number of amendments at its Committee stage.

Political storm in the Persian Gulf
A political storm which began with the cutting off of all ties with Qatar by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrein and the ultimatum they gave to the former to fulfill 13 conditions is still ranging menacingly.
Qatar has been able to withstand the sanctions and isolation thanks to generous assistance from Turkey and Iran as well as due to its own economic strength. The four countries that cut off ties and closed air and sea traffic to Qatar in an attempt to seek Qatars submission have failed and are caught in a dilemma. Though they expected support from the United States later it has quietly retreated after first expressing solidarity with them. It should be recalled here that Saudi Arabia was much emboldened by the open support extended to it by President Trump a few days before the rupture took place. After all the regional operational headquarters of the United States army is in Qatar and it would not risk losing it under any circumstances.
Permutations and combinations of political forces in the region even beyond the Persian Gulf and spreading as far as the Mediterranean are ever changing with world powers too being drawn in willingly or unwillingly. Turkey has already decidedly to strengthen military cooperation with Qatar while its relations with Russia have become warmer and closer. The attempt to have a referendum in Iraq to carve out an independent Kurdistan has brought Iran, the United States and Syria to a common opposition to the move. Meanwhile the United States keeps threatening to revoke the Iran- US Agreement on the nuclear development programme of the latter.

A thaw in the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two regional powers competing for regional dominance in the Arab world is evident by their recent conduct when Iranian pilgrims will visit Macca in pilgrimage after a long time. Both have officially expressed their decision to improve ties.
The Gulf countries would not let Qatar running to Iran for aid as it would weaken their political influence. On the other hand, they too would not like to see Iran nuclear deal cancelled for that would place their countries at peril in case of a future war with nuclear capabilities in the region.
In the meantime Russia has agreed to deliver military equipment to the United Arab Emirates whose principal arms supplier still is the United States.
These relations are still volatile and would take some time to solidify. However, the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean region would not be the same as before. And there is one more player who would also intervene at least in the sphere of economy. It is China.
EU to probe Monsanto  Bayer deal
German pesticide monopoly Bayer is scheduled to acquire United States seed giant Monsanto in a deal worth US $ 66 billion. Both firms are the largest in the world in their business. The European Union has started an in-depth probe of the deal prior to granting approval. This follows an international petition received by it on behalf of farmers, consumers and environmentalists that the deal will affect them adversely.
A statement issued by the EU last Tuesday said: The Commission has preliminary concerns that the proposed acquisition could reduce competition in a number of different markets resulting in higher prices, lower growth, less choice and less innovation. The final decision of the Commission is due by January 8, 2018. In its investigation the Commission is also collaborating with United States, Canadian and South African regulatory bodies too.
One principal market to be affected is the pesticide market. Glyphosate sold under the name Round Up by Monsanto faces competition with glyfosinate produced by Bayers under the name Liberty. If the merger takes place the Company would become the worlds largest seeds and pesticides business.
Macrons beauty
Emanuel Macron, the French President who effected drastic budget cuts across the board which caused the head of the French armed forces to resign has used spent 26,000 euros, or nearly $31,000, on makeup in his first three months in office. The magazine Le Pen in a dramatic revelation said that His makeup artist, a woman named in reports as Natacha M., has billed the executive branch once for 10,000 euros and again for 16,000 euros since Macrons inauguration. The presidents office responded to the revelation giving an excuse that said it had called in a contractor as a matter of urgency, forcing the president to pay more than usual. Macron will spend a significantly reduced sum in the future, the spokesman promised.
Macrons approval rating had in the meantime deteriorated just as rapidly as it went up at the election time. It now stands at some 30 points.

PTL ordered to provide back up of call logger data base, voice recordings
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating and inquiring into the Treasury bond issue yesterday made an order to Perpetual Treasuries to supply the back up of the call logger data base and voice recordings of the telephone call recording system installed in their company.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake requested the order be made permitting an engineer from the Metropolitan Technologies, from whom the PTL purchased the telephone call recording system, to conduct the data extraction on behalf of the PCoI, lest PTL fail to comply with the above order.
The PCoI further ordered PTL to provide with its call logger server windows log in accounts username and the password along with the voice supported applications user name and the password. It also ordered the support application to be connected to the internet when and if the said engineer is extracting the backup data from the call recording system.
The order was made in the backdrop where DSG Milinda Gunatilake questioned the credibility of PTL CEO Kasun Palisenas affidavit submitted to the PCoI answering to a series of questions on his companys telephone call recording system. According to Palisena, he has learnt that PTLs call recording system does not record the incoming, outgoing caller IDs, the call times and durations only after checking the call recording system in August 2017.
DSG Gunatilake, contradicted to what the witness has said, played a voice recording of a telephone call made by Palisena to his Head of the IT expert Sachith Devatantri on 02 December 2015. The call which lasted for about 30 seconds, if loosely translated from Sinhala to English, Palisena informs Sachith that Sometimes, our call recordings do not indicate the outgoing number.
Based on the calls content, DSG Gunatilake argued against Palisenas previous remark that he checked the telephone call recording system of his own company only on 16 August 2017. He pointed out the word sometimes denotes that in other times, the outgoing caller IDs were in fact recorded by the PTLs call recording system. DSG Gunatilake pointed out that Palisena has checked his companys telephone call recording system in 2015 and identified certain shortfalls in the system as well.
Gunatilake suggested that PTLs call recording system recorded the outgoing telephone numbers contrary to what Palisena said. Palisena said he was not checking the call recording system, but going through certain voice recordings when he informed his IT expert of the outgoing call number not being recorded by the system. He also said he will have to check with his IT expert again regarding the matter.
Are you saying incoming and outgoing calls would have been there in the system before and later on there werent Gunatilake asked when Palisena said he wanted to refer to his IT expert again. Can you affirmatively say yes or no Gunatilake added.
Yes. I am telling it was not tampered with, replied Palisena.
Do you want to hear the voice recording again Gunatilake followed and the call recording was replayed for the third time. After the recording ended, Gunatilake asked from Palisena are you still maintaining the position that outgoing call numbers were not recorded by your system to which Palisena said Yes, I stick to my statement.
In support of his argument, DSG Gunatilake marked a letter issued by the Metropolitan Technologies stating that PTL made a complaint over the call recording system for not indicating dial and incoming call details. Copy of an email, sent by PTL IT Department complaining that the call recording system does not provide the outgoing call numbers was also marked.
[No water bottles for counsel at PCOI]

The Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday informed private counsel that they will not be provided with sealed water bottles at proceedings in future. Chairman Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chithrasiri said the Presidential Secretariat has queried about the PCoIs expenses. So we have to cut down the supply of water.

Radwanska, Cibulkova reach New Haven semis
NEW YORK Friday: Top seeds Agnieszka Radwanska and Dominika Cibulkova booked their semi-final berths Thursday at the WTA hardcourt tournament in New Haven, the final tuneup for the US Open.
Poland's Radwanska, the defending champion, defeated eighth-seeded Peng Shuai of China 7-5, 6-3 to advance to the final four.
Second-seeded Cibulkova, of Slovakia, beat sixth-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia 7-5, 6-4.
Peng and Radwanska had split six prior encounters, with Peng taking their most recent meeting at Indian Wells in March.
But Radwanska, still seeking her first title of the year, emerged with a victory in just under two hours to set up a semi-final meeting with Australian Daria Gavrilova.
Gavrilova defeated Belgian qualifier Kirsten Flipkens 6-2, 6-4. It was the third meeting of the year between Cibulkova and Pavlyuchenkova, who had split two prior contests in 2017.
Having narrowly won the opening set, Cibulkova powered to a 5-0 lead in the second, then turned back a furious rally from the Russian to win in just over two hours. She made it extremely tough for me in the end, Cibulkova said. I was playing very well in the whole second set, but then she started playing even better. I had four match points, and she hit an ace every time so I couldn't do much about it. But I just kept fighting and I said to myself, 'OK, this one's going to be yours.' Cibulkova next faces Belgian qualifier Elise Mertens, who reached the semi-finals on a walkover when China's Zhang Shuai withdrew with a right arm injury.

Railway accumulates record income through fines on errant commuters
The Department of Railways has earned a record income (Rs. 8,705,242) as fines from errant commuters through inspections and raids on trains during the past six months.
The Superintendent of the Department said 6,129 fraudulent commuters were fined and they were caught through raids on trains travelled in three regional railway zones of Colombo, Nawalapitiya and Anuradhapura.
Travelling in class 1 and 2 compartments with class 3 tickets, travelling without tickets and passing destinations specified in tickets were offences they have committed.
The fine was increased to Rs. 2,500 to mitigate the number of offenders, the sources said. Railway authorities have intensified their inspections and raids to curtail the number of fraudulent commuters.

Rajapaksa day dreaming that he is SLFP President: SB
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said yesterday, that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who previously appeared at the SLFP Annual Convention held in Polonnaruwa as a Party Patron, while President Maithripala Sirisena chaired the Convention is now singing a different tune saying that he is still the SLFP President.
So, we have a doubt weather the former President has filed a Court case through someone who is against President Maithripala Sirisena for holding the Party leadership and now making various statements to prove and support the case.
The amendments former President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought to remove former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from the Chairmanship of the SLFP, has resulted in himself being removed. He now pretends to have forgotten all these.
According to Section 12 (2) of the Party Constitution, the Chairmanship of the party goes to President Sirisena without contest.
According to this section, a member of the party, when elected as President, automatically inherits the post of Chairman of the Party, he said.
However, we wish to unify all factions of the SLFP for the 66th SLFP Anniversary scheduled to be held at the Campbell Park on the September 02 under the theme of 'Party Unity in the Right Direction.'
It was the former President himself who informed us after meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena in January 2005, that he hag given over the Party Presidency to President Maithripala Sirisena. Then the Central Committee of the SLFP unanimously decided to appoint President
Sirisena as its leader, while former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga have been appointed as patrons of the SLFP.
Though he had agreed to hand over the leadership of the SLFP to President Maithripala Sirisena bowing to the demands of Party members after his defeat, he had now forgotten all such happenings.
He said both the UNP and the SLFP could not have a consensual agreement for a very long period. However, the strong unity in two parties was a great help to avert the big disaster and threats levelled from the International Community.
At present, there is a division within the party. The launch of a new political party by certain factions of the SLFP ahead of the next Local Government election, would weaken the SLFP further. Several factions with many powerful characters in the SLFP left the party on several occasions.
But they came back empty handed. If we wish to create a UPFA led government in 2020, we should all get-together to bring about unity in the party, especially in the context of the next local bodies elections. We want all factions to eschew petty politics and join hands to strengthen the SLFP.
Commenting on the removal of the Ministerial post of former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, he said that President Sirisena tried his best to resolve the problem associated with the former Minster. The President had a discussion with the UNP leadership as well as the former Minster on several occasions. The former Minster was also dragged into the Hambantota issue for his escape.
The government has lost the confidence of the people due to its failure to nab corrupt people. The government had already lost public trust largely due to the bond scam. There are over 80 special cases being heard in Courts. We believe that some invisible hand was manipulating to prevent the speedy progress of these cases. Obstacles have now been removed, helping to speed up the Court process.

Remarkable journey towards democracy
All media accepted the importance of the Sathyagraha launched by the Sixty two movement and gave the due publicity. Most emphasized the speech made by Rajitha, the radical minister for health, in defending the ability of the government to break away from forces that want to bargain with fascism and secretly plan to deal with the crimes committed by the previous regime. He emphasized that a special Court will be set up to investigate corruption that occurred during the previous regime.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne speaking further said that people who oppose and want to protect Mahinda clan will be dealt with. He was welcomed by the Movement for the Protection of Convention among the 6.2 million people" or shortly Sixty two movement. To the cheering crowd he said that the Cabinet had initiated discussions on setting up of a Special Court, immediately to conclude the corruption cases against politicians and officials of the previous regime. He further said, that the President had agreed to conduct a Referendum to pass the proposed Constitution.
Speaking on former Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayakes resignation he said that, Mr. Karunanayake had resigned with pride and it was the beginning of a change in the country. He admitted The period starting with this month would be a crucial time for the government and there will be certain important changes in the country.
Yahapalana leaders
Yahapalana Government completed a period of two and half years. But as the Government passed its two-year mark a question of credibility has raised in the mind of the general public against the Government. Present Yahapalana leaders had overthrown the previous regime by making certain election promises to the people. As the election manifesto of the Government had promised, they were to enforce the law strictly and follow policies of good governance. Those found to be corrupt in the previous regime were to be punished. The present Government leaders earlier stated that they wouldnt allow anyone to corrupt law and order by using political powers. Also they promised to solve the national problem by devolving power; Executive Presidency will be eliminated.
Though its third year, people pose the question whether the promises mentioned in their election manifesto, were only a rhetoric, or not
During recent sathyagraha titled Heta Delakshaya Seeruwen staged in front of the Viharamahadevi Park, several political leaders from the Yahapalana Government, activists and civil society organisations voiced their views influencing the authorities to fulfill the election manifesto which they had provided during the last presidential election. The sathyagraha was organised by the Movement for the Protection of Convention among 6.2 million people in collaboration with many civil society organisations who had assisted the Yahapalana concept to form a Government. The sathyagraha was able to break the view that Yahapalanaya is following the path of Mahinda regime. Such desperate people pointed the finger at finger at Wijeyadasa and his followers and said, The reason that they have come to that open action, relatively recently and did not proceed down that track shortly after assuming their seats of power was probably because they had to establish themselves in the various positions that gave them the opportunity to conduct matters of governance as they saw fit with the single constraint of ensuring that they maximized the pecuniary benefits from whatever they did. That six important ministers were attracted by the peoples action shows that the social political content of the Yahapalanaya is different from the fascistic politics of Mahinda regime.
Sixty two group
The Rajapaksa regime displayed an absolute disregard with regard to the rule of law, fairness, basic justice and the rest of the cornerstones of a democratic society. One could, literally, get away with murder if she had the right connections. Sometimes it was by the devious expedient of being packed off to Singapore with a bullet in the brain allegedly leaving the victim a human vegetable only to return, miraculously recovered and ready for battle, literally and figuratively. That era is gone, forever.
Sixty two group organised the sathyagraha while people were suspiciously looking at clouds of corruption that appeared again. People assumed two years back, those dark clouds of corruption and brutal crimes have drifted with the defeat of the Rajapaksa fascistic government. Now they are suspicious. Are they descending again and are any successors of Mahinda regime fill the vacancy. They were wondering with not only a sense of disgust but one of bitter dejection.
Sixty two group with a successful sathyagraha could challenge the resignation and pessimisms. Obviously, resorting to the old fall-back of resignation is hardly a response deserving of acceptance given the plight of Lankan nation and what it can and will mean to all of us in all communities; Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim. One could go further, Buddhist Christians, Hindus, Muslims and other religious groups too should be devoted to make use of the opportunity given by January 8 democratic uprising.
If one takes a step back and try to project a perspective on the current plight of Lanka, the sense of quiet euphoria that seemed to sweep across the nation with the defeat of the most corrupt and violent fascistic government is only a beginning; there was a massive table of barbarians that left behind that should have been cleared. It has been a very misfortune to see that huge but temporary uprising have lulled many of us into a false sense of complacency in the matter of the return of fascism; more correctly reorganised Mahinda group behind the power of Yahapalanaya. But now there is no excuse for any of us who participated in the Laksa sixty two uprising and perhaps experienced that optimism to pretend that it was a simple matter of false pretences. No, it was real and precisely because of that we can and must do all we could to turn back that garbage-bearing rising tide of Mahinda group.
Western democracies
This kind of situation is not without history. The current predicament is not without precedent even in many of the western democracies, the difference being that there were proletarian political alternatives as in the Russian revolution. Liberal capitalist leaders deluded into believing that they could practice this liberal philosophy as they wish, without let or hindrance. But they were soon brought down to earth by the democratic proletarian power groups who organised mass campaigns. It is wrong to assume that a similar option does not exist for us now, because the current alternative consists of the very lot that we thought we were rid of a couple of years ago, the Mahinda group!
What makes it an absolute necessity that we change the present status quo is the fact that certain set of racist thieves and political bandits hidden behind Ranil and Maithri are beginning to form the illusion that if they combine that sense of absolute right to whatever they wish for, with the impunity of them and their cohorts being above the law; nothing and nobody can touch them or stop them.
The sathyagraha was a success and showed everybody that social and political awareness of the people who brought this government to power is high and they are prepared to fight back to put the Yahapalanaya on to the correct track. It also proved that the power of democracy is not over or receding. On the other hand it sent the message to fascistic Mahinda group and the Polpot SAITM camp that with a short and simple notice near three thousand people tuned up to face any kind of challenge. These were wise women/men or militants from town and country, each representing at least one hundred, in the respective town or the village. Among them many were trade union leaders. Also the female participation was very prominent. It was a very conscious participation, make no mistake.

Sri Lanka recall Chandimal, Thirimanne
Gunathilaka (injury) and Tharanga (suspension) ruled out :
PALLEKELE: Friday - Sri Lanka who put up a gallant fight back in the second one-day international against India here on Thursday will be without opening batman Danushka Gunathilaka for ten days and captain Upul Tharanga who has been suspended by the ICC for slow over rate for two matches.
Dinesh Chandimal and Lahiru Thirimanne have been recalled to the team to replace them for the rest of the series. The third ODI is scheduled to be played at Pallekele on Sunday.
Gunathilaka left the field in the 33rd over after landing heavily on his elbow in a dive to stop a shot from MS Dhoni at cover point and has been ruled out for a period of 10 days with an injury to his right shoulder. Gunathilakas injury is another addition to the spate of injuries Sri Lanka has suffered during the Indian series with Suranga Lakmal, Asela Gunaratne and Nuwan Pradeep all being sidelined.
Tharanga has been handed a two-match suspension by the ICC for Sri Lankas slow over rate where they were found to be three overs short.
This will be Tharangas second suspension for slow over rate in three months. He was penalised for the offence during the Champions trophy in early June and sat out two matches.
Chandimal and Thirimanne were both not part of Sri Lankas ODI squad in their last series against Zimbabwe because of poor form.
While Chandimal is expected to fill Tharangas position in the batting at number four, Thirimanne who has been out of contention since January last year is likely to fill Gunathilakas place as an opener. It is a position that Thirimanne is accustomed to and has had success in the past having scoring three of his four ODI centuries.
Meanwhile Chamara Kapugedera who appeared in his 100th ODI on Thursday will take over the reins from Tharanga and lead Sri Lanka in the third and fourth ODIs. He has been Tharangas deputy for the series.
Kapugedera made a valuable 40 in a 91-run stand with Milinda Siriwardana to help Sri Lanka recover from 121-5 to 236-8. He has not led his country before.
Sri Lanka trail India 0-2 in the five-match series.

Strong private sector vital to build vibrant economy: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday stressed the necessity of having a strong private sector, strong manufacturing sector and a strong construction sector to build a strong economy.
He was participating as the Chief Guest at the opening ceremony of Construct 2017 exhibition held at the BMICH.
Addressing the occasion, the Prime Minister said that the notational unity government is committed to building a strong economy.
We want to build a strong economy for Sri Lanka where people have more money and a better future, he said.
He added that the infrastructure development must be followed with economic productivity.
The present government is developing the countrys infrastructure which is helping create employment opportunities.
As a result of that we have been able to create jobs manly in the private sector. We have increased foreign investments and provided assistance to start small businesses.
We have reduced the price of fuel and we have also been able to build 20,000 houses within this period, the PM said.
We have provided a pack of nutritious items worth Rs. 20,000 for pregnant mothers and also increased the salaries of public sector employees, the Prime Minister said.
These are some of the things that we have done in the last two years. More than that, we have stabilised the economy, the Prime Minister added.

When we took over we didnt have sufficient revenue to service the loans. We were in debt. By 2016, 17 we at least have sufficient revenue to pay loan installments. But we still need more revenue to pay for our recurrent and capital expenditure. That is what we are engaged in.
We have to stabilize economy by increasing revenue and controlling expenditure. In this scenario how we can pay for jobs. That is why we are encouraging large scale private investments. We also want Sri Lankan manufactures to be competitive internationally. We will help you. We are coming up with pay rate adjustment packages.
The new Inland Revenue Bill which is likely to be passed in Parliament by September 6 or 7 will be a good incentive for the next three four years. Because we want make all the investment to create jobs within a short period. We are now looking for at least two to three billion US dollars investments.
We are now signed an agreement and formed a joint venture company for Hambantota. We will do similar to Mattala airport. We have got GSP plus and anyone can go in to the European market. We are looking at free trade agreements with China, India, and Singapore. We are now looking for large scale tourism development projects, establishment of industrial zones. We are signing an agreement with one of the biggest Thai industrial estate company to start an industrial estate in Millaniya. We will be announcing a big tourist resorts in Galle, Matara, etc.
We have enough construction works not only public but private. Within this framework the construction sector has to grow up. We want constructors go out and compete internationally.
We are reducing the government expenditure on buildings because we find that lot of money has been spent for ministry buildings.
The construction sector has become very large because numerous infrastructure projects which were undertaken after the war. The construction sector stakeholders should enhance knowledge and capacities to go out of the country and compete with global competitors.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, Home Affairs Minister Wajira Abeywardane and Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody also participated to the occasion.

Terror at the hands of West Indies
The scariest Test England ever played:
PART 2 (continued from last week)
Marshall, Holding and Garner were three all-time greats, yet it was Patterson who stood out. If anyone has ever bowled quicker than that, well ... said Gooch. He was rapid, and I mean really rapid. That view is supported by Dujon, the wicket keeper who was chief witness to the West Indies reign of terror. He kept to all the greats from 1981 to 1991, and did so with such feline excellence that 95mph deliveries became much of a muchness. Every time he is interviewed, he patiently answers the inevitable question. Who was the fastest Dujon cites two spells, both by Patterson: Sabina Park 1986 and the last day of the Boxing Day Test in 1988, when Australia unwisely provoked him and he threatened to kill them all the next day. He settled for the compromise of a match-winning five-for. In the first over of that spell, Dujon took a short delivery and heard a scrunch. A split-second later, the pain of a broken finger reached his brain.
The strange thing about Sabina Park is that the only person who retired hurt was a West Indian batsman. Late on the first day, Gordon Greenidge hooked Botham into his own face and needed three stitches. West Indies finished the day on 85 for nought, though that particular score flattered them. Thomas could have dismissed Desmond Haynes with his first two balls in Test cricket. The first flew off the edge between first and second slip; the second was put down by Willey in the gully. He completed a spectacular over by ripping one straight past Hayness face.
In Thomass next over, Greenidge gave him what Garner called a fathers correction, bashing three fours. Thomass performance in the match led Christopher Martin-Jenkins to write in the Cricketer that he is the real thing at last, and though his series figures of eight wickets at 46 were modest, the sheer heat and quality of his bowling had most predicting that Englands hunt for a truly fast bowler was over  including the greatest of them all. I could see that here was an outstanding young talent, said Marshall in his autobiography, Marshall Arts. He earned the respect of all our batsmen. This being the 1980s, he played only one more Test in his career. Thomas only realised he had earned the oppositions respect when, as the series progressed, they started to administer a few more fathers corrections. Being targeted by the West Indies batsmen was a strange kind of compliment.
Thomas and particularly Botham hit the green bit of the pitch with similar frequency to the West Indies bowlers. There were overs in which Botham bowled six attempted bouncers, wrote Woodcock in the Times. All that did was stir up further trouble for Englands batsmen, especially with umpires who pay not the slightest attention to the law as it relates to short-pitched bowling.
One mans bouncer is another mans shortish delivery. I dont remember anyone bowling many bouncers, says Thomas. It was more back-of-a-length stuff on both sides. You didnt need to bowl bouncers on that wicket, it was flying. One short ball from Botham was hooked for six by the debutant Carlisle Best, his first scoring stroke in Test cricket. Best famously commentated on his own innings  You cant bowl there to Carlisle Best  and doubtless had plenty to say as he launched Beefy into the crowd. Amid the virility, Richard Ellisons crafty swing bowling yielded a third five-for in as many Tests. This being the 1980s, he played only three more Tests in his career. Ellison concentrated on a different part of the body; four of his wickets were LBW, part of a then-record-equalling six in the innings. West Indies were dismissed for 307, a lead of 148.
There was also a row between Greenidge and Edmonds, who was standing intrusively close at short leg. It was an unusual occurrence in the series, despite the punishing nature of the cricket. Most were already friends from county cricket. We all got on exceptionally well; it was excellent that way, says Thomas. There was no animosity, nothing whatsoever. Both teams knew that it was nothing personal, just business. And that West Indies had an unchallengeable monopoly.
I FELT AS IF MY CHEST HAD CAVED IN
On the third morning, before play, Robinson practised with the bowling machine, Fred, on a concrete wicket. Fred could do almost anything. He could give you a 94mph bouncer or a 66mph inswinger. What he couldnt replicate was a length delivery from the 6ft 8ins Garner that would shoot along the floor. Robinson was bowled for a duck, and Gooch followed for nought in the next over from Marshall. Robinson went to the West Indies averaging 62 per innings, thinking Test cricket was a piece of piss. He barely made that many in the series: 72 runs, an average of nine, and his Test career never truly recovered.
Soon it was time for Pattersons second crack at England, a six-over spell of unprecedented menace. There are no greater compliments from no greater authorities than those he received for his speed in the second innings. In the Times, Woodcock deemed it on a par with Frank Tyson in the 1954-55, one or two of his short ones being just about as fast as man can bowl, while Wisden said his pace was comparable to that of Jeff Thomson of Australia in his prime.
One delivery cleared everyone and bounced just inside the boundary. Gower was caught at third man, placed there deliberately as a catcher two balls earlier. It was his seventh failure out of seven on the tour: his scores were 5, 9, 2, 11, 0, 16, 9. Lamb then received what Engel described as the most extraordinary cannonade of bouncers. His innings had more incident that most seven-hour centuries. He was at the crease for 15 balls. Lamb was hit on the helmet and the body, slapped three boundaries and was caught top-edging a hook.
He was one of three men out hooking in the innings. Botham, who had fallen that way in the first innings, landed a few haymakers in a 28-ball 29 that included two hooked sixes: one top-edged off Patterson, one off the meat from the first ball of Marshalls spell. Marshall went straight around the wicket and bowled four more consecutive bouncers, two of which Botham walloped for four to make it 14 from the over. Marshall was stirred first by the unspoken speed contest with Patterson and then by Bothams chutzpah. In Marshalls next over Botham was bowled while hooking, another victim of the uneven bounce. It was the start of another difficult tour, particularly with the bat; he averaged 16.8 with a top score of 38.
The West Indies were the one team Botham could never conquer. Willey was almost the opposite, a West Indies specialist who played 15 of his 26 Tests against them, facing the bowlers head on with his extraordinary open stance. When he went out to bat in the second innings in Jamaica, having been pushed up from No7 to No4, Willey was not exactly high on life. I had a bit of a humour on, he says. It was horrible. One ball was going past your throat, one was going past your ankles. So I decided to have a swing at anything that was in the slot. He crashed 71 from 104 balls, including nine fours and a six off Patterson. When he reached his half-century, the press box tossed impartiality out the window and stood to applaud.
Willey does not recall the low or Pattersons studs-up action. I didnt see the foot and I didnt care what was going on behind him, he says. Youre just looking for that thing coming down at you. He was in a higher state of concentration. Sometimes, its not you batting. Youre in the zone. You dont think about what youre going to do; it just happens. Theres no time to think.
You never thought about getting hit. It never entered your head, not even on a day like that. I put the grill on in the first innings and I got out for nought; I couldnt see the ball. The second innings I put the side flaps on and just watched the ball. Its like a boxer; you watch the fist. If you watch the ball, 99.9% of the time youll find a way to get your head out of the way. Doesnt matter if it hits you anywhere else.
When he was dismissed, Willey walked back to the dressing-room and was greeted by Thomas.
Are you OKYeah, fine, whyYou look about 150!
Thomas remembers it well. He looked like death. Honestly, he was gaunt and pale. And hes a bloody tough character.
The same was true of Smith. He was picked because of his ability against fast bowling, but his debut was not a good one. He made one in the first innings and nought in the second, when he batted at No7 because of sunstroke and was caught on the boundary hooking Marshall. I dont think Ive ever seen anybody so angry in the changing-rooms, laughs Thomas. He was absolutely fuming because Marshall bounced him out, and he threw his helmet on the floor. I never thought a helmet could break into so many pieces! Nobody went anywhere near him for quite some time. Honestly, he was in a foul mood! It was quite frightening.
When he was recalled for the fourth Test in Trinidad, Smith top-scored in both innings with 47 and 32. This being the 80s ... well, you know the rest. He missed the last match through injury and didnt play another Test. It gives me a lot of pride to have top-scored in both innings, he says. Talking about it makes me go cold because its the most exciting thing you can ever do on a cricket field. The thrill was in the challenge, knowing that it was the pinnacle  that you couldnt go any higher. Not just in 1986, but ever. Test batting will certainly never be as tough again.
I was never scared; that never came into it. You know youll get hit, but you wipe that out of your head. To me it was a battle. It was like walking around in certain parts of London. I wont start anything, but if somebody wants to have a row 
Smith had been picked at the age of 30 after a barnstorming performance against an otherwise rampant Marshall in the County Championship the previous summer. In Trinidad he took on the West Indies to such an extent that his partner Lamb kept trying to shut him up for fear of reprisals. Patterson hit me and he was standing next to me, says Smith. I told him to eff off. Leave me alone! Theyre trying to kill you anyway, so whatever. You cant wind them up anymore! Im not a thug but I would take people on. Viv was having a few words with me so I pointed my bat at him and said, If you want it as well, you can have it! I wouldnt back down.
It was just part of the battle. I had a huge amount of respect for the West Indian players. It was awesome to play against them.
With the match approaching its conclusion, Edmonds was hit over the heart by an accidental beamer from Patterson. I felt, he said, as if my chest had caved in. And that was with the kind of chest protector used by jockeys to protect them from a horses kick. As he staggered around like a confused zombie, Edmonds dislodged the bails, and should technically have been given out. Both umpires left the decision to the other, and he was given another life.
In Another Bloody Tour, her famous book of the tour, Edmonds wife Frances wrote: There is a protective bodice, a lot of very thick skin, quite a bit of excess adipose tissue and a wodge of cheque books to penetrate before anyone gets anywhere near Phil Edmonds heart.
The next ball was short, straight into the hip. The longer the match went on, the less like a civilised game of cricket it became, wrote Woodcock. Except on that evening of ill fame at Old Trafford in 1976, when Close and John Edrich were subjected to such a disgraceful barrage by the West Indian fast bowlers, I think I have never felt it more likely that we should see someone killed.
Edmonds was soon the last man to fall, to give Patterson his seventh wicket of the match. I wouldnt say it was shit batting, we just got bowled out, says Willey. When you talk to some modern cricketers about the West Indies they say, Ah, they werent that quick. Id like to see them face Patterson on those wickets.
West Indies needed five runs to complete a 10-wicket victory. England lasted 88.2 overs in the match  not eye-catching these days, but almost without precedent in 1986. It was 79 years since they had been bowled out so quickly in both innings of a Test. Perhaps no team in history would have coped any better, wrote Engel. I cant recall a Test when it was so impossible to foresee any result other than a win for one side.
There are photos of Edmonds on a beach a few days later, with a grotesque crater just below his left nipple. The mental bruising took even longer to subside. In most mismatches there is a quick finish, a knockout blow or a couple of hours of misery. England had to stand there and take it for the best part of three months. They were getting it from their own, too, with increasingly vituperative criticism of everything from the decision to make some net sessions optional to the inability to repel the greatest bowling attack in history.
It has been very easy to abuse England on this trip, wrote Engel. One or two people in the press box have sounded a bit like Lord Haig, demanding from the comfort of HQ that soldiers hurl themselves against the enemy guns.
After Jamaica, England looked like a team with a touch of PTSD. The team talks got shorter and shorter, laughs Thomas. There was nothing much to talk about. A 5-0 defeat was inevitable, and confirmed at Antigua after Richards blasted an astonishing 56-ball century. After the first Test, the bouncers were never overdone, said Engel. There was no need  the batsmen had seen enough. It was still the toughest assignment in cricket history, especially as at least three of the pitches were dodgy, and England exceeded 200 only twice in 10 innings. There was only one hundred on the entire tour, Goochs epic to win the second ODI. In the fourth Test at spin-friendly Trinidad, the West Indies included the off-spinner Roger Harper. He didnt bowl a single ball. This was the end of the West Indies most dominant period, one last series when they postponed the slow, decade-long transition that began when the core of their greatest team started to go over the hill. They drew their next four series, three of them away from home, and although they stuffed England 4-0 in 1988, they had gone from the greatest to merely great. The 1985-86 series was the conclusion of a four-year spell in which they won seven series in a row and had a record of 23 wins and one defeat. And the defeat was in a dead rubber.
LIFE GOES ON
On the first morning of the second Test in Trinidad, Pattersons first six overs went for 54 as Gower and Lamb launched a breathless counterattack. (Scorecard aficionados will love Englands first innings.) There were 10 no-balls in that, a recurring problem in his career and an indication of how he could struggle if his rhythm was not right. He did not have a classical action to fall back on. The locals said he was never the same away from Sabina Park, too, and eventually he ended his career with 93 wickets at 30.90 from 28 Tests. He did produce some more chilling spells, particularly overseas.There was that day in Melbourne, and in 1987-88 he took five-fours in consecutive Tests in India. The dashing opener Kris Srikkanth recalled one evening in Kolkata. I knew if I got hit by any of his deliveries, I could die on the spot, he said in 2009. He walked down the pitch and gave me cold stares and I felt the chill running down the spine. I survived only because of my reflexes.
Pattersons international career ended at the age of 31 when he was sent home from a tour of Australia for disciplinary reasons. He became a paranoid recluse, prompting wild speculation about what had happened to him. Some said he was a destitute drug addict; others that he was in an asylum. He was found last month by the Indian journalist Bharat Sundaresan, the culmination of a six-year search. The result was one of the more poignant features of the year.

The U.S. Department of States Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) Programme trained 33 Customs officials from Sri Lanka in risk management of cargo from August 21, 2017 to August 25, 2017. The training was conducted in Colombo and coordinated by EXBS.
Participants learned how to identify high-risk shipments and improve cargo targeting capabilities through the use of document analysis. Customs organizations utilize finite resources to screen cargo entering, transiting and exiting their borders and the workshop provided the participants with concrete ways to assess the potential risk cargo may pose to national security and public safety. They can now better screen shipments by identifying those that require a physical inspection.
EXBS aims to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the transfer of conventional weapons that threaten regional peace and stability. The EXBS programme comprises a wide range of non-proliferation strategic trade control assistance programmes, from licensing and legal/regulatory technical assistance, to provision of equipment and training for seaport, border control and law enforcement officials.

Why are West Indies so poor - and can problems be fixed
We thought they might struggle. But this badly
West Indies were beaten by an innings and 209 runs by England at Edgbaston, losing a record 19 wickets in a day.
The entire team, in two attempts, batted for a total of six and a half hours. England opener Alastair Cook managed almost 10 on his own.
To the casual observer, it might have been a surprising margin of defeat.
But, in the words of Test Match Special commentator Fazeer Mohammed: It was just another day. West Indies are being decimated in a Test in England, like they have been for the past 17 years.
It is natural to compare the current side, who have not won a Test in England since 2000, with great West Indies teams of the past.
The 1980s side that terrified batsmen and bowlers alike was one of a kind. You cannot will a team to be better just because you remember their history fondly.
There are undoubtedly problems in West Indies cricket. But what are they And how can they be fixed
JUST HOW POOR ARE WEST INDIES
In a word, very.
Former England opener Geoffrey Boycott described them as the worst Test team he has seen in half a century, while ex-England captain Michael Vaughan believes we may be watching one of the saddest series for Test cricket.
West Indies are World Twenty20 champions, but their recent Test record leaves plenty to be desired.
Their most recent series victory away from home, against a team other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe, was in 1995.
At Edgbaston, they scored 305 runs in the match. Cook made 243 in Englands only innings.
Although West Indies drew with England at home in 2015, their most recent Test victory away came in 2012 against Bangladesh. They have lost seven of their past 14 Tests on the road by an innings and are eighth in the world rankings.
West Indies used to do to England what England are doing to them now, Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special.
Earlier this year, West Indies lost a home series to Pakistan when last man Shannon Gabriel, needing to bat out two overs, was bowled via an inside edge as he tried to slog the last ball of the penultimate over. Im so accustomed to this sort of performance now that its not even funny, said legendary fast bowler Sir Curtly Ambrose, who took 405 wickets in 98 Tests between 1988 and 2000.
WHY ARE THEY STRUGGLING SO BADLY
The England side at Edgbaston was vastly more experienced, with Cook and bowlers James
Anderson and Stuart Broad all having made than 100 Test appearances. West Indies most-capped player is Kemar Roach, with 38.
If you are going to produce a Test team, you have four or five senior players to gel junior players, said Vaughan. This is generally just a load of junior players and its very, very difficult.
The names that may be more familiar to an English audience - Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo and Marlon Samuels - are playing in the Caribbean Premier League, one of the many numerous lucrative Twenty20 competitions that have made Test cricket less appealing in recent years.
The leading players have been involved in a seemingly endless dispute with Cricket West Indies. A tour of India in 2014 was cut short because of a pay dispute, while Bravo last year described the board as the most unprofessional in the world.
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, West Indies most experienced player with 164 Test caps, retired from international cricket in 2016 and is playing for Lancashire, only 90 miles from the scene of the first-Test hammering.
I still believe that if we had all of our big-name players, our cricket would be better, said Ambrose.
But Mohammed said: For those saying West Indies wouldnt be in this position with the experienced Gayle and Bravo, or even in the days of Brian Lara, youre conveniently forgetting that West Indies in those days were also being dismissed cheaply against England.
ARE THERE OTHER REASONS
Conditions may have played their part - the famously quick pitches of yesteryear have become lifeless surfaces offering bowlers minimal assistance and batsmen few challenges.
Mohammed, who has covered West Indies cricket since 1987, told BBC Sport: The West Indies players may be getting a false sense of security from the flat, dead pitches in their home country.
Facilities have also been criticised.
I went to see the Barbados Under-19s train in April. The conditions and net facilities they were training under were disgraceful, said Vaughan.
But Mohammed said: If you are going to base the state of West Indies cricket on the facilities, it ignores the fact that when we were the most dominant force in the game, the facilities were even worse.
Asked for the main reason behind West Indies decline, Mohammed said: It has to be the management.
What you have is an administrative structure that seems more aligned to confrontation with the players and a top-down style of management than reaching some sort of compromise.
Because of the size of our economies, we cant match the numbers being afforded in the Indian Premier League or anywhere else.
IS THERE STILL PASSION FOR CRICKET IN THE CARIBBEAN
Test cricket worldwide faces a battle to attract fans who are being drawn towards limited-overs cricket. The Caribbean is no exception.
Jamaican sprinters Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake have both spoken of the impact cricket had on them growing up.
Bolt was linked with an appearance in Australias Big Bash competition in 2012, while Blake claimed cricket was his first love and that he would consider switching sports.
West Indian cricket has long since had to compete for the attention of youngsters with sports such as football and basketball, and Test cricket was described as dead as far back as 2008.
But Mohammed said: One of the other misconceptions is that we are losing a lot of our talent to football or American sports.
Theres certainly a pull towards football because players see lucrative opportunities, but theres still a lot of young people - boys and girls - playing cricket in the West Indies.
While supporters remain passionate, Mohammed said they simply prefer not to turn up to see their team lose again.
He added: People will watch the Caribbean Premier League and will look occasionally at Test cricket or follow it on the radio, but fans have become so disillusioned.
Losing in three days is nothing new. People are almost switched off from Test cricket, but they will argue all through the night about why things are going wrong.
WHY SHOULD ANYONE ELSE CARE ABOUT WEST INDIES
Vaughan is among those saddened by the decline of West Indies, but England coach Trevor Bayliss said: West Indies are going through a rough time but 20, 40, 60 years ago there were other teams that were going through rough periods.
Why do West Indies struggles elicit arguably more sympathy than the plight of Zimbabwe or Bangladesh, for example
West Indies cricket is deeply admired and respected in England because of the impact of those great players, said Mohammed. You can understand why there would be that depth of feeling and that nostalgia.
But you find yourself repeating the same explanations. Sometimes you step back and ask yourself if youre living in a time warp where youre saying the same thing every three, four, five years.
This isnt something that has happened last week, last month or two years ago. Its been desperately bad for a long time.
IS THERE ANY HOPE
The future might not be all bleak.
West Indies won the Under-19 World Cup last year and beat Zimbabwe and South Africa in recent limited-overs series.
The average age of the side beaten at Edgbaston was only 25 - Roach, at 29, was the oldest - and West Indies were missing Gabriel, arguably their quickest bowler, through injury.
All-rounder Roston Chase, who took 4-113 with his off-spin, has scored three centuries and three fifties in his first 11 Tests, while debutant Kyle Hope has impressed for West Indies A and made a century in the warm-up game against Derbyshire.
There is talent and there continues to be talent emerging in the game, said Mohammed.
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew added: It has to be the long-term goal of coach Stuart Law - and everyone connected with West Indian cricket - for that young talent to be nurtured to a place where they can once again be competitive in Test cricket.
Vaughan said: They dont really have a coaching programme or any structure to develop coaches. Someone, maybe the International Cricket Council, needs to invest money in facilities and structure.
This will not be a quick fix but it has to start soon. Lets not let the West Indies drift.
But Mohammed warned: Our problems will not be solved by an English intervention, or by an International Cricket Council intervention, or from the well-meaning comments of so many others.
It has to be solved by Caribbean people. We have to be the architects of our own resurrection, in the same way we have been the architects of our own demise. BBC

Wijeyadasa Exit: Corruption fight gets closer
The change in political culture announced with the resignation of Minister Ravi Karunanayake has moved to a faster pace with the sacking from Cabinet of the Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. The two ministers gone out so far held two very important portfolios  Foreign Affairs, and Justice and Buddhasasana. This shows a major shift in the politics of government, where a position held by a minister was unable to stand in the way of discipline, and in fact has been the key factor in the removal process.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes removal shows a rise in the organisational strength of the UNP, especially among its MPs, where unity of purpose in seeking removal of a Cabinet minister gained near unanimous support, even among his ministerial colleagues; showing a new trend in the organisational realities within the UNP. The call for a more determined fight against corruption in government has made the UNP attempt to take a lead in this fight, as the coalition of national unity completes two years, and the rivalry between UNP and SLFP deepens.
The former Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana was never a green personality in politics. His beginnings were with the SLFP, in the days of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, and a close association with the late Sripathi Sooriyarachchi, at a time of much tainted political manoeuvring, who had a portfolio in the first Mahinda Rajapaksa Cabinet, falling out over allegations of President Rajapaksa having an accord with the LTTE.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe also did not last very long in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, after being an MP from 2004. After the 2005 Presidential Poll Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed him as Minister of State Banking Development. But he resigned on issues of policy in April 2006, and has been with the opposition UNP benches since then. When he was Chairman of COPE the parliamentary organisation in 2006, it did produce two good reports, the recommendations of which did not move to implementation. As the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, he did make a strong protest against the efforts to impeach former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake.
That apart, his record as Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, after the election of President Maithripala Sirisena to office, and the UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister, has certainly raised many questions about his commitment to fight corruption and fraud by the Rajapaksa Regime.
Hambantota Port deal
The immediate call for his removal was public criticism of the Hambantota Port lease to a Chinese company, in an interview with the Lankadeepa newspaper, considered a violation of the collective responsibility in the Cabinet. His later position he was only expressing his personal view did not impress the UNP MPs and Ministers who called for his removal. There were also signs he was playing sully politics with the Hambantota Port deal, with the knowledge of the strong public opposition to this by the Joint Opposition led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, and his call for the Maha Sangha to call for change of this major transaction in the field of economic and foreign relations.
His argument of not interfering with the judicial system or with the state legal process through the Attorney General did not hold any water, considering the long delays in bringing the members of the Rajapaksa Regime, the family and politicians, to justice through the courts.
There were many reports about lack of sufficient staff in the Attorney Generals Department, which was his duty to remedy. There was need for new thinking on the judicial processes to fight corruption with speed. The silence and inaction of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on these issues, and later statements these would need constitutional changes, were also not in any way convincing to his open critics and organisations of civil society calling for speedy action against corruption.
The situation became worse when President Sirisena made his angry statement, nearly two months back, that key UNP members in government were delaying action against the Rajapaksas on charges of corruption during the last regime.
All of this certainly made it easy for President Sirisena to readily give in to the UNP request for the removal of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from the Cabinet. Yet, this does raise other issues on how fast the government could in fact move with any measure of success against the corruption and fraud of the last regime, and fight corruption that has grown within its own ranks today.
The Media now has much more of the fight against corruption, with more emphasis on the Mahinda Rajapaksa family. But would this be like the beginning of Yahapalanaya or Good Governance, and move away once the fight becomes tougher Or would the focus shift to cases of little importance, when members of the present government, from the SLFP, may have to be brought in once a serious judicial process begins These are issues the government, both UNP and SLFP, will have to give serious consideration to, if the fight against corruption is to move forward strongly, with Ravi Karunanayake and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe out of the way.
It is now the task of UNP MPs who displayed eagerness to get back the image of Good Governance rapidly leaving this government, to move with more determination in the major fight that remains, end ensure it is not confined to catchy media headlines.
Political memory slip
The battle for control of the SLFP between President Sirisena and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) has taken many forms, from rival May Day rallies to membership drives, and the powers of office against oppositional thrusts. As the rivalry gets stronger with the UNP-SLFP coalition moving to its third year and the dual full-moon power capture promise of MR losing belief, there is a new move to push unreality to the political fight of the Blue Flag wavers.
As the SLFPs 66th anniversary celebrations approach, MR is using a new strategy to steady his leadership claims. The declaration he remains the SLFP leader, and there was no change in the position since he assumed leadership after winning the 2005 presidential poll. He is pushing aside all talk of his having invited Maithripala Sirisena (MS) to take over the party leadership, after the latters winning in the January 2015 as the Common Candidate, when he challenged and defeated the then SLFP leader.
An attempt is made to push all the news and reports on how this change took place into the dustbin of recent political history, with the claim that MR never gave up the leadership and never invited MS to the position of SLFP leader.
Memory slips are not strange in politics, but when it involves such serious issues, and in a matter that has both legal and official recordings, such a slip can mean much more. It is either proof of complete forgetfulness, more than a question of a memory lapse, or strategic forgetfulness that can be crookedly political. It is interesting that this memory slip comes from the politician who manipulated parliament to pass the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, to virtually make him a lifelong president of this country. What he is now trying is to push a lifelong SLFP leadership claim, without any amendment to the party rules, but wholly dependent on his memory.
MR could well have forgotten the invitation he extended to MS to take over the party leadership amidst the turbulent politics following his defeat in January 2015. Such a memory lapse is not strange in a politician who would like to wish away memories of the bad and corrupt government that he presided over for many years. But, he cannot or should not expect the SLFP members and the public with political interests to forget he change in the rules of the SLFP that was proposed by him after the 2005 presidential victory.
Just for the record, the party president at the time was Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga, who had ended her two terms as the countrys president. It was MR who proposed a change to the leadership rules, to ensure his leadership of the party. It was thus decided that any member of the SLFP who is elected president of the country, shall be the president of the party, as long as one holds that national office. The party politics was thus linked to national politics. This enabled MR to remain the unchallenged leader of the SLFP till the victory of MS on January 08, 2015.
But the January 8 decision by the people to defeat MR and elect MS to the Office of President, gave the full benefit of that amendment of party leadership rules to his rival in that election. The people of the country, the voters, decided who the new leader of the SLFP would be, on the very rule adopted to serve the politics of Mahinda Rajapaksa; a political slip much bigger than any memory slips of today.
