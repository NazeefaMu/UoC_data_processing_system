Swift trademarks cats names for new projects
Taylor Swift has moved to trademark the names of her beloved pet cats for a variety of potential new ventures, including musical recordings and a live show.
The Shake It Off hitmaker often features her furry friends Olivia Benson and Dr. Meredith Grey on her social media pages, and has even started to use their images on various merchandise sold on her website.
However, Taylor has now applied to register "Meredith and Olivia Swift" at the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, with the documents seeking to reserve the rights to the phrase for use on clothing, handbags, and jewellery, among other items.
According to TMZ.com, the paperwork also indicates the possibility of using the names on musical recordings and a Meredith and Olivia Swift series.
The news emerges months after Taylor's famous felines scored cameos in the Deadpool 2 movie, where their images were used on a T-shirt worn by celebrity pal Ryan Reynolds as his anti-hero character Deadpool, alongside the words, "Olivia & Meredith Best Friends Purrrrr-Ever". Music News

Thirty kgs. heroin seized during last six months
Sri Lankas crackdown on narcotics has intensified, with law enforcement agencies seizing over 30 kilogrammes of heroin during the last six months alone.
Officials told the Daily News that heightened intelligence on the drug supply chain has led to widespread detections which would see a spike in the heroin haul compared to last year.
Based on figures compiled by the Special Task Forces (STF), the agency has seized over two kilogrammes of heroin and 900 kilogrammes of CSL Ganja.
We expect the quantity seized to increase this year, because we are cracking down on the whole drug supply chain rather than arresting only addicts or intermediaries, Senior DIG and Commandant of the STF M.R. Latiff said.
In the past when we arrested one individual, the rest fled the country, he said.
He added that restrictions in the supply chain has caused an increase in demand which has led to more arrests this year. It also boils down to political will, he said.
Previously when the Police was under the purview of the Ministry of Defense, the then Monitoring MP was Duminda Silva whose alleged links to the drug trade was known. In such times, there were fewer raids and a misconception that there were no drugs, Senior DIG Latiff added.
The STF alone has arrested nearly 800 individuals for the possession and trade of both heroin and ganja this year. Severing international links by nabbing drug traffickers from overseas remains problematic, due to the failure of those governments to apprehend suspects.
Drug trafficking operatives who controlled the trade from UAE in the past, still continue to do so because they have not been arrested or deported, he said. Similarly, there has been an increase in detection and demand for CSL Ganja due to the drop in supplies of heroin.
On Sunday night, three individuals were arrested following a raid in Welewatta in Wellampitiya for the possession of Kerala Ganja amounting to 24 kilogrammes. The three individuals who are said to be residents of Welewatta were produced before the Wellampitiya Police yesterday. One of the suspects, also had 173 grams of ICE (crystal meth).
We arrested one individual and tapped into his contacts which eventually led to the arrest of the main supplier, he said.

Isner is having one of the best seasons of his career. Earlier this month he reached his maiden Grand Slam semi-final with a run to the final four of Wimbledon. He will be ranked number nine in the world when the new rankings come out on Monday.
Isner blasted 21 aces and won 75 percent of his first-serve points in the two-hour match.
The eighth-seeded Harrison, who was aiming for his second career ATP title, finished with 10 aces but made three double faults and had his serve broken twice.
Harrison won the first set against Isner after a week of come-from-behind victories. In order to make the final he had to rally from a set down in each of his previous matches.

Two former Navy Intelligence Officers held in remand custody on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 were yesterday ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by Colombo High Court.
Each suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.100,000 with two sureties of Rs.500,000.
They were severely warned not to interfere with witnesses in case further ordered to appear before CID on every Saturday.
Colombo High Judge Champa Janaki Rajaratne made this order after taking into consideration a revision application filed by two suspects Kahawalage Gamini and Thushara Mendis challenging Colombo Fort Magistrates decision to reject bail on the suspects on several occasions.
The Magistrates Court had earlier refused to grant bail on the suspects citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release the suspects on bail.
The persons were abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009.

Unbelievable 350ft waterfall on a skyscraper
People travel far and wide to view one of natures most spectacular sights, the waterfall. Somebody at Chinese construction company Guizhou Ludiya Property Management recognized this and thought, Hey, why dont we build a waterfall on the side of our skyscraper
And so they created the worlds tallest man-made waterfall, and people cant quite decide if its a good idea or not.
Theres no denying that it does indeed look spectacular, creating a glorious rainbow in front of the building when the sun is out. But the artificial waterfall, located in the city of Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou province in Southwest China, requires 4 large pumps to lift the recycled water 350ft up before it cascades down the side of the huge building. It faced huge engineering challenges during constuction and because of electricity costs, believed to be over $100 an hour, the waterfall is only in use for special occasions.
Bored Panda spoke to one resident of Guiyang, Tengyu Zhang, to get his take on the unusual new attraction in his city. Personally I think its nice, he told us. I think its more for showing the tourism of Guizhou province. Since Huangguoshu waterfall is the most famous waterfall in China and its located in Guizhou, this one can be like a small ad for that.
Many people have reacted negatively to what they perceive as an extremely wasteful vanity project, but Tengyu doesnt agree. Well, its not always on. Only if there are some international and important events and then it will be open. Moreover, there are fountains in the park, and light decorations in the modern city. If you really consider the aspect of environment, I guess all those should be closed as well.
Guiyang is experiencing rapid growth as people flock from the other parts of the province to take advantage of the building boom. Five years ago it was still one of the poorest provinces in China, Tengyu told us. But now the government wants to build a big data center in Guiyang. So the economy is developing rapidly. For example the bases for Apple, Google, and Amazon will be located in Guiyang.
Seems like therell be plenty more creative and crazy skyscrapers to come in Guiyang! Bored Panda

Uni telescopes open for public today
Telescopes at the Colombo University will be open to the public today, to observe Mars and Saturn till 10.00 p.m. The public could visit the Colombo University playground from 7.00 to 10.00 pm.
The Colombo University Astronomical Society will conduct another two astronomical night sky observations camps jointly with the committee for the popularisation of science of the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science, on August 1 at the Vijitha Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Pollonnaruwa and on August 2 at the Sinhala Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Trincomalee, which will be open form 7.00 to 9.00 pm.
Mars, the only planet whose surface we can see using ground-based telescopes (except for Mercury), will near the Earth on July 31 after 15 years.
This was last seen closer in 2003, with the next closest to be in 2020, and even closer in 2035.
At the close approach, the red planet will be brighter than all other stars in the night sky.
Look to the eastern skies late these evenings and if the sky is clear, you could see Mars above the horizon between the star constellation Capricornus, Colombo University Physics Department Astronomy and Space Science Unit Director Professor Chandana Jayaratne said.
This is the nearest that Mars has come (57.6 million kilometers to earth) since its record-breaking close approach on August 28, 2003. At that time, it passed by at a distance of only 55.8 million kilometers, the closest it had come in 59,619 years.
There are observational camps conducted by astronomers all over the world to observe this rare event.
The planet will remain bright for several weeks, and you could also view Saturn, Jupiter and Venus in a long arc across the sky from east to west, shortly after sunset.

Why Trump is getting away with foreign-policy insanity
If U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to provoke most of the foreign-policy establishment into a feeding frenzy, then his bizarre, baffling, and in many ways pathetic performance at the Helsinki meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday was a success. But his behaviour is still hard to fathom: A guy who is trying to convince us that he isnt Putins puppet and likes to portray himself as tough, strong, and like, really smart ended up exposing himself (again) as inarticulate, ill-prepared, gullible, and seemingly incapable of standing up to his Russian counterpart. If this were any other presidency, hed be toast.
It was never entirely clear why he was so eager to meet with Putin anyway. The administration had deliberately lowered expectations before the meeting, aware that the two leaders were not in a position to reach important agreements about anything. Most observers expected a typical Trumpian photo-op and a bland communique like the one issued after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un last month, followed by a bunch of boastful tweets about how the president had singlehandedly gotten U.S.-Russian relations back on track.
Trumps performance
Instead, what the world saw was a U.S. president rejecting the findings of his own intelligence servicesnow headed by his own appointees, by the wayand accepting at face value Putins entirely predictable denials. Trump also tossed in a word salad of discredited conspiracy theories about former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons email server and other irrelevant nonsense, and he said that the legitimate investigation into possible Russian interference was utterly baseless and bad for the country. (That very last claim might be truei.e., the suspicion that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia is bad for the countrybut whether it is without foundation remains to be seen.)
The response to Trumps performance was immediate, overwhelming, and almost entirely negative. Thomas Friedman of the New York Times accused Trump of treasonous behavior and concluded, Donald Trump is either an asset of Russian intelligence or really enjoys playing one on TV. Former CIA head John Brennan agreed that Trumps performance was nothing short of treasonous, a charged echoed at length by former Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck and repeated by many others. Even normally discreet officials such as former Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and my colleague Ash Carter, a former secretary of defense, were visibly appalled, with Burns calling the press conference the single most embarrassing performance by an American president on the world stage that Ive ever seen, and Carter saying, it was like watching the destruction of a cathedral.
U.S.- Russian relations
Prominent Republicans also found Trumps actions hard to defend or excuse. Despite the lamentable lack of backbone in todays GOP, a number of Republican VIPs distanced themselves from Trumps comments, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called it one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.
Even well-known GOP grandee Newt Gingrich, normally a Trump defender, joined the chorus of critics, calling it the most serious mistake of his presidency. When youve lost Gingrich, you really are in trouble, which is why Trump returned home and tried to walk it all back, saying that he had gotten confused by a double negative in one sentence of his statement. His account was ostensibly enough to mollify Gingrich, of course, but nobody with a scintilla of integrity was likely to be convinced. - Foreign Policy

Youthful rebound on the kiddy-go-round!
A childs world is often the envy of unimaginative adults, although Im willing to wager my nappies that they wont be too quick to admit it. I, for one, have found kids a decidedly ingenious passport to places where my solitary presence would have been perceived as preposterous.
Believe me, in my quest to relax I have been driven into some very embarrassing indiscretions. But no matter: if asinine adventures are to bring a bit of zap into my uneventful life, I am stoically prepared to pay the price. Hopping aboard a transport of delight, such as a push-and-leap merry-go-round on your own would make one of my mature years look like a retarded anthropoid. I may even discover I am even as the character in the old doggerel: See the happy moron He doesnt give a damn. I wish I were a moron: My God, I think I am!
But if having fun and giving into a chance to unwind seem to be my predestined condition, what the hell! I wouldnt really mind being classified a moron.
I once had the temerity to take along a three-year-old on a sight-seeing tour of Bangkoks red-light district. Stupid move Guess again, buddy. The advantages in such a ploy outweigh the loopholes by more than a boxful of G-strings. For one, hordes of skimpily clad bar girls left their doorways to tousle my little companions hair and pat his cheeks.
So, nonchalantly, I thrust my hands deep into the pockets of my slacks while my young partners cheeks glowed at the attention they were getting amid a host of equally glowing but nose-less other cheeks revealed deliciously to my delight.
In Hong Kong, I used to saunter over sometimes to a childrens amusement park with a couple of kids for company, or rather as the cover for me to indulge in my child-like fantasies.
For me, the park was charged with excitement. I love the myriad coloured lights that give cheer and enliven the place. Besides, theres no telling what might happen.
On one occasion, I noticed an obese male waddling along with a girl on either arm. I did all I could to keep my three-year-old female companion from calling him Georgie Porgy. However, the girls obviously didnt spurn the guy, who seemed so engaged making so much whoopee that he fortunately didnt hear the taunt.
I had decided not to take her anywhere near the bumper cars. That is after a recent incident where a four-year-old maniac named Joy I had taken along had the other participant kids swerving out of his way. Some of them lost their nerve completely and high-tailed it out of the circuit with our kamikaze brat hot on their heels.
But this time around it was not long before my little spitfire led me to the most addictive game of skill known to every man with a penchant for throwing, meaning the Tin Can Alley stall.
The objective of the game is to knock down the tower of stacked tin cans off the shelf with six tennis balls. The trick is to hit the bottom tins, ballasted with sand, that form the base of the pyramid.
I knocked all ten tins down like ninepins! It seemed all too easy and in the next round I did it with a ball to spare. The attendants closed the stall after my throwing arm had won two adorable cuddly toys for my companion!
Gallons of ice cream and soft drinks later, I find the family cherub involved in a vigorous argument with the attendant at the shooting gallery who maintains she is too small to handle a gun. Shoot him! she orders me in the strident tones of a Calamity Jane defending her honour. Despite my attempts to play peace broker she snaps at him, Bugger off!
A while later I am sitting in the ferris wheel and pretending to enjoy every moment of it, while all the time feeling like an astral idiot canned in a cosmic convertible.
Being spun around in dizzying circles is bad enough even for seasoned astronauts - thats what they are paid for anyway. But hung upside down every now and again, with a nippers squeals of delight turning rapidly into screeching demands to wee wee, calls for superior ingenuity.
I am grateful for small mercies. Inexorably, the wheel ground to a halt and I cajoled my charge to hold on.
I duly thanked Heaven for little girls, and The Maker for their amazingly retentive bladders as we located the Ladies in the nick of time. I managed to convince the little fury that I simply could not go in with her as I helped her out of her extremely sophisticated undies.
Okay, but promise not to move, she ordered, before leaving me holding on to her diminutive lace underwear. The wait seemed interminably long as I stood around those feminine preserves expecting every moment to be accused of being a voyeur.
I hurriedly pocketed the frilly unmentionable at the sight of an old lady who attends the same church as I do, approaching. Waiting for your wife she asked politely. I said she hadnt come, but old ladies being old ladies dont usually give you a chance to elaborate.
Its terribly hot, she said. So it is, I answered truthfully fishing for my handkerchief and ending up wiping my brow with the frilly lace panty. I have never seen a fossilized female move as fast as that old dame did.
Life can be so unfair, particularly with geriatric gadabouts and their trigger-happy judgemental dispositions. Her withering, contemptuous look indicated that I had been tried and convicted in the whisper of an instant.
Home again with a sleeping child smiling seraphically in my arms, I am confronted by my wife who says: See, you must have tired the little angel out. I cant imagine how she can wake up for church tomorrow.
I am willing to wager that Someone up there has a great sense of humour. I shall try forever to retain mine in this crazy world.
But you do understand, dont you, why I dont go to church any more

As such, youth training centres were being further developed, and they should be launched on a village-basis, Minister Ratnayake said, adding that arrangements had been made to establish a youth centre at Dankotuwa in Pitabeddara.
The minister said youths' ideas were vital in formulating their development programmes and at present, youth development activities were being conducted by various organisations.
All of them should be brought under a uniform system to make them more fruitful, he said; the government would take keen interest in ensuring a better future for the country's youth.
The minister also distributed sports equipment among youth clubs during the event.

Those flocking round Gotabhaya sowing seeds of communalism
The dictatorial group including the Joint Opposition flocking round Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is trying to sow the seeds of communalism and religious discord throughout the country, said Puravesi Balaya joint convenor Gamini Viyangoda yesterday.
He said there is a social discussion to transform Gotabhaya Rajapaksa into another Hitler with the patronage of a certain section of bhikkhus. Viyangoda was speaking at a press conference at the Centre for Society and Religion yesterday.
He said a certain group of retired high-ranking Army officials were now going round the country saying that Sri Lanka needed a Hitler-type ruler like Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
This has created a serious situation in the country.
History revealed that countries ruled by dictators had ended up in turmoil and destruction. Germany which was a united nation when Hitler assumed power, disintegrated into two nations after his rule and it took 70 years for the two German nations to unite once again.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (31-07-2018)]
SUFFERING OF CANCER PATIENTS
The following thoughts are in reference to the letter of Joe Perera which appeared in the Daily News Citizens mail on May 3. He writes about the suffering of cancer patients at the Cancer Hospital. As someone said, If you want to know what hell looks like, go and visit the Cancer Hospital at Maharagama. He ends the letter with a plea, for someone to cure those unfortunate and helpless Cancer patients. It is most unlikely such a person exists though there are isolated incidents of such things happening. Even the Buddha and Jesus did not do so, except in isolated incidents. Whether they could but for some reason they didnt is a matter of conjecture.
As such, I feel that the only consolation is to see whether one can at least be able to be in a state free of the suffering of the pain of having Terminal Cancer. In this context, D. Weeratungas article in the Citizens mail on How to cultivate human goodness gives a point. He starts with the statement We believe suffering is caused by ignorance. It is not clear whether he has confirmed this statement experientially in himself. If the answer is Yes, he should be free from all the suffering from pain as he has presumably eliminated ignorance which he says is the cause. If this is so, he could tell us how he came to this state.
In this context, Ramana Maharishi who lived in India about 80 years ago confirmed in His amazing life that indeed such a state is possible. One can hardly believe the incidents that happened in His life except for the fact that His life was recorded on a day to day basis and is available for anyone to see at His Ashram in Arunachala, Tiruvannamalai, South India.
In His later life, He contracted Sarcoma, and excruciatingly painful form of cancer and an external growth appeared on His right arm. Not only was He immune to the pain but He was unaware of the growth on His arm!!
Over the years, I myself have followed His advice on the path of Self Inquiry (Atma Vichara) in my meditation. I have had and I am having amazing experiences which makes me feel that not only such a state is possible but how such a state can come about. Of course, as the saying goes The proof of the pudding is in the eating until I verify such a state as an experiential fact, it will remain a theoretical possibility only.
If one is prepared to go through the suffering of physical pain (without complaining!!), that is inevitable for all of us, it is only a matter of time before when the uncompromising viciousness (Cancer Hospital, Maharagama) of Karmic Retribution  cause-effect - will act, then there is no problem. But if one does not want to do so, then one should attempt to reach such a state before the inevitable suffering descends on us. Of course, we have no control over the pain that will surely come to us one day, sooner or later but our only option is (if at all!!) to be in a state immune to the suffering from that pain.

1st Under 19 one-day international
Comfortable six-wicket win for India
Anuj Rawat hit a solid half-century to guide India to a six-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the first Under 19 one-day international played at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
Chasing 144 for victory, the visitors rode on a 62-run fourth wicket partnership between Rawat (50) and Sameer Choudhary (12) which gave them the victory in 37.1 overs to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.
Sri Lanka off spinner Lakshitha Manasinghe took two wickets for 32 runs and Avishka Lakshan and Sandun Mendis claimed one wicket each but the total was too small to defend against a strong Indian batting line-up.
Batting first Sri Lanka were bowled out for 143 with the main contributions coming from Nipun Dananjaya 33 off 45 balls and Nipun Malinga 38 with three fours and two sixes. They lifted Sri Lanka from an uncertain 84-7 to their final total of 143 in 38.4 overs.
The Sri Lankan top order started to crumble when Mohit Jangra pushed the Lankan batsmen onto the back foot with Navod Paranavithana and Nishan Madushkas early departure off his first four overs. Yatin Mangwani and Ayush Badoni claimed two wickets each to help dismiss the middle order.
Ajay Dev Goud picked up three Sri Lankan wickets for 18 runs including that of Malinga who was last out running short of partners.
With not much pressure on the run rate India Under 19 team, began their reply steadily with Pavan Shah and Anuj Rawat scoring 24 in four overs before lunch. Lakshitha Manasinghe raised some hopes in the Lankan camp by sending back Shah in the fifth over after lunch and Yashasvi Jaiswal.
But India were never under any discomfort against the Lankan bowlers as Anuj Rawat made certain of victory with 50 off 82 balls (five fours) before losing his wicket to Mendis. The second ODI will take place at the SSC grounds on Thursday (August 5).

Daya Sahabandu
I bumped into Daya Sahabandu at the Sri Lanka Cricket headquarters at Maitland Place, and when I requested from him for an interview he casually mentioned that I interviewed only the Anandians and Nalandians, therefore just to put the record straight I have asked a few Royalists and one Thomian ex-cricketer for interviews earlier and the reply I got was not favourable, under such circumstances my interest in approaching them were nipped in the bud, However when I met Daya I found him to be a down to earth guy and was he a Royalist with a difference
Daya mentioned that he was not comfortable with the SSC set up who literally cold shouldered him and he went on and stated that on an occasion when Stanley Jayasinghe visited the SSC he wondered why Daya was not playing for Ceylon leave alone Sara Trophy.
Daya said that he went to Royal College from his younger days. I found him to be a humble human being who was not willing to go against the grain when dodgy questions confronted him. It is the authors view that his humbleness did not go down well with the pompous crowd at the SSC. Fortunately for our budding cricketers, cricket had spread its tentacles far and wide which
enabled the outstation cricketers to be welcomed by the elitists clubs like the SSC and one would have to thank Minister Arjuna Ranatunga for breaking the shackles.
Daya showed his bowling talents in no uncertain terms. He played under four captains for Royal, they were Michael Wille, E.L. Pereira, Sarath Samarasinghe and Michael Dias. Daya of course was not a Colin Bland or a Jonty Rhodes and as a result Wille did not have a high regard of him and he was deprived of his colours that year lamented Daya. Out of the lot Sarath Samrasinghe was the most successful and Daya noted that this was not because of Samarasinghes capabilities as a captain but because that team was studded with coloursmen.
He played for Royal with distinction from 1956-60 and during a practice session before the big match in 1956 Gamini Goonesena saw Daya bowl a couple of balls and said that he would play for Ceylon one day. He played three seasons at the SSC after school but was never given the opportunity to play Sara cricket.
Daya was more at home when he joined Nomads in 1963. He was more at ease with the set up there and under the able guidance of D.H. de Silva he blossomed into brilliant left arm bowler.
Daya mentioned that he played under 3 captains namely D.H. who also was his boss at the Municipality, Michael Tissera and Dhanasiri Weerasinghe. D.H. was a fatherly figure to him and a good shrewd captain. Tissera was a brilliant tactician he noted and he would set Dayas field and instructed him just to bowl middle and leg or middle and off as the case maybe.
Dhanasiri was the more attacking of the lot and Daya stated that although he was the captain he was at machang level with him and used to tell Daya dapang eyage meda pollata. I read between the lines and realized what Daya intended to say and at times a bowler is relaxed when the skipper cracks a joke.
Daya recollects how he went by bus no. 154 from Wellawatte to Borella and had to walk all the way to Wanathamulla Oval to participate in his very first international match and to make matters worse he had to carry his kit as well.
Reports stated that one young cricketer took a moon light walk and lost his way and appeared in the wee hours of the morning and another brimming with talent has broken the curfew and gone night clubbing and was severely punished.
In this day and age when dog eats dog I found Daya Sahabandu to be a modest cricketer who had no false airs about him. It must be mentioned that Daya has a son named Janaka Sahabandu also a Royalist who is a banker at Hatton National Bank Ratnapura and his dear wife Swarna Sahabandu who has been a tower of strength to them.

Deadly Innocence
Soon to be well-lit, the abode is ready for the battle. The guru steps into the ground and lights the brass lamp and burns the incense sticks to pay reverence to the Buddha statue. In the well-lit abode, the disciples prepare for the battle with meditation. Following meditation, the disciples take a few vows. The game they are about to practise is deadly, but the disciples vow never to use it for ungainly needs. The game is an art studied only for self-defence  and yes, self-defence alone!
Mere interest in this art would not qualify you to enter this abode. With the brass lamp well lit, Master Karunapala will penetrate into your mind and body to assess your eligibility. Tougher than any written or oral examination, you cannot afford to cheat here. Utter falsehood, and you will no longer be eligible to unearth this ancient art, angampora, which trains you to handle your own body with amazing dexterity.
G Karunapala is the eldest surviving angampora guru in Sri Lanka. Although the art comes under the martial art category, Guru Karunapala does not quite agree with it. It is a deadly art, yet you do not kill people.
We take a vow not to engage in any misdeed before the training. You train yourself to kill someone in one blow, yet you cannot do it unless your life is in grave danger, Guru Karunapala insists.
Angampora is a vanishing art simply because the masters have chosen not to pass it down. The disciple must earn trust in addition to dedication. No disciple is privy to the subject in its entirety, though they will be entitled to the nitty-gritty.
Most artists are familiar with all kinds of martial arts. They learn bits and pieces of everything and claim to be angampora veterans. But none of them knows the real subject in entirety. It is easy to differentiate the genuine ones from the fake ones, Master Karunapala warns.
One basic question on how many elements that the subject has is enough to drive the so-called angampora veterans crazy. The number of elements remains a secret confined to the angampora caucus. Anyone can dance. Anyone can play with the clubs. The angampora is an admixture of all this, yet remains unique as every weapon used serves a specific purpose.
The run-of-the-mill artiste chooses the easiest path of raking in money. What they engage in for the sake of a few rupees does not offer anything worth in return to the country, Master Karunapala emphasizes.
Guru Karunapala is the only academic at the Sri Jayewardenepura University who teaches angampora as a subject.
I ask my students not to engage in the malpractices. Learn the right kind of art. If you dont know the art, learn it somewhere. But dont do anything bad. People teach karate and wushu in the guise of Angampora, Karunapala laments.
His journey to protect the much-hallowed subject is filled with challenges and dare beyond the physical dexterity. On principle, Guru Karunapala never gets along with the swathe of so-called angampora artistes.
I had to face a few angampora fighters at the request of the Cultural Affairs ministry. Before dealing with them, I invited them for a getapoottuwa (an angampora element) challenge. None of them accepted the challenge. I realized that I had nothing to do with such a crowd. It was a government-mediated event, but I backed off. I told them I deal only with the genuine angampora veterans who can accept any challenge, Guru Karunapala recalls.
The art runs in the family. Masters father was a veteran. His grandfather paid reverence to the sun and the moon and got certain work done. Guru Karunapala follows their footsteps and continues to pay reverence to the sun.
This is the best art form in the world. You witness the best civilisation here. You see the unique costumes here. The royalty dwells in this art. If someone seeks to distort the art, they would not do well, Master Karunapala insists.
He likens the subject of angampora studied today to a Malay pickle, a mixture of everything. The angampora that most artistes claim to be well versed in is not the genuine subject, as the master clarifies. The art form is used as a defence mechanism to fight any death threat. The art is pure in three kinds. First, it could be followed only in a Buddhist background. Second, it should be studied in Sri Lanka. Third, the disciples should be the Sinhalese. It is not studied to fight against each other. The foreigners approaching Grand Guru Karunapala would not get the complete training.
The collapse of the most civilized art form began with the British intervention. Following the Kandyan convention, the colonial rulers imposed a ban on the angampora practice. They used physical arms to ensnare the mental strength of the Sinhalese. The angampora training centres were polished off. Anyone caught in the angampora practice was shot under the knees. The art faded into oblivion, yet did not perish. A few families preserved the art form in secrecy until the country finally gained Independence.
The tradition was preserved. But the British act took a heavy toll on the authenticity. Like any other subject, the angampora began to resurface albeit with dilutions and distortions.
78-year old grand guru never utters filth. Nor is he into falsehood and other vices. He firmly believes that the art has to be passed down to the next generation before he breathes his last. Yet, he is very much careful and meticulous in choosing the disciples. Only a handful of disciples have been privy to the art form in its entirety.
Meditation is an essential ingredient of the Angampora. Your mind needs to remain in the centre. That ensures firmness. When the mind is focused on one point, then you will be able to grasp the art.
Yet, master warns, you cannot master the art with temper issues.
A genuine Angampora artiste never steals. Plus they can control their temper. If you have temper issues, it will be your weakest point. When you speak to each other, you should be mindful not to hurt the other party.
Angampora exists everywhere, Master Karunapala declares, but in many fake forms. Even the street drama artistes claim knowledge on angampora. The snake-charmers are no exception either. Anyone familiar with karate and wushu easily steps into the angampora territory and claims proficiency.
Angampora is also deemed as a human gym with no liabilities. You are prone to no injuries. Even if there is an injury, the art form has the healing therapies within itself. This well-fed art form must be practised slowly. The slowness ensures the steady mastery.

Drawn to rhythm
To believe in music you need to hear it! And who has not heard music Words cant describe this amazing force of nature that can lift you up and transform your day and your life. However it is the healing power of music that interests Shalini Wickramasuriya the Founder of an initiative called The Music Project that aims at touching, healing and transforming the lives of children from the North and Kurunegala who have been affected by the civil war in Sri Lanka. However the healing power of music can be applied to any individual who is experiencing a difficult time in his/her life. Daily News met up with Wickramasuriya to discuss this initiative of hers called Music Project.
I have worked in the field of education for several years primarily at the University of Edinburgh and subsequently for INGOs where we worked in Post Conflict Education Reconstruction. And in relevance to the Music Unites Project, we saw that these children who are suffering from Trauma needed psycho social counselling. They needed to be able to get on track and get on part with their peers. This meant that we needed an additional initiative other than accelerated learning programs and catch up educational classes, said Wickramasuriya.
That is basically how this Music Unites Project came into being. While living in Edinburgh, Wickramasuriya had seen a similar initiative called The Big Noise Project that involved working with disadvantaged children of Stirling Scotland. Here children were experiencing difficulties when it came to education because of personal challenges.
I saw a music program set up to empower the youth through music, giving them opportunity, exposure, motivation and a sense of pride in their own personal achievements. Music is a great equalizer, so we decided to replicate a similar project in post conflict Sri Lanka. Initially it took us a while to get permission from the North because many NGOs had not been given permission. So because of these stringent rules we started working in Kurunegala where we got funding very easily. So till we got the ability to work in the North, we started in Kurunegala, stated Wickramasuriya.
So the idea came to her that music can be used as a link language. So they started with three schools in Mullaitivu and three schools in Kurunegala. The children were taught how to play musical instruments. And the response was phenomenal! It was wonderful to see these little children opening up and feeling the warmth and transformative power of music.
The children were starting to respond to something that was holistic, therapeutic, fulfilling and beautiful. It was something so sweet in former war torn territories. We were privileged to have many specialists and volunteers coming and supporting us. What we have seen and done after the conflict has completely changed us, pointed out Wickramasuriya.
Wickramasuriya and her companions work with children in the North and Kurunegala who are from farming communities all affected by the Civil War. You can see the devastation in those regions when it comes to physical infrastructure. These children have all lost loved ones in these regions. In Thunukkai Mullaitivu 400 families were displaced. For these children, music was taught to provide a holistic form of recovery.
Learning music makes these children feel included. And at such as small age having experienced such trauma it makes them a feeling of normalcy. It makes them feel a part of society. It makes them a part of humanity.
The main reason I took up this project was because I felt Post Conflict Sri Lanka was at an all- time low. I felt that if we could touch some of these children with the gift and joy of music, it would be worthwhile, explained Wickramasuriya.
The Music Project Unite Program will showcase the talents of 200 children from schools in Mullaitivu and Kurunegala who will perform in Pollonnaruwa. It will be a sponsored free concert. It will take place on the August 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. This will be the 10th Unite Program of the Music Project. It is the flagship program of the Music Project. The children have been working very hard to put on a stellar performance. They have come a long way in this journey of theirs.
In our Orchestra program there are over 450 children, learning Orchestra instruments. The Orchestra program is the core project. The methodology we use is the Suzuki Method  the mother tongue approach to language learning that has been applied to music. We apply the Suzuki method in teaching music, which is totally different to the normal way you learn music. We have seen progress with learning. The children learn very quickly and successfully with good intonation. Music is a global language and a lot of these communities have become isolated due to the war. We have specialists from all around the world, who have converged on Sri Lanka, from countries like Australia, Japan, UK, USA and France. This means a lot because it make these children feel loved and cared for. It makes them feel like global citizens when they get this exposure and opportunity, said Wickramsuriya.

Financial sector should promote sustainable development
The financial sector can unlock value in promoting sustainable development and elaborated on the Banks approach in striving to ensure better quality of life said Theja Silva, the Company Secretary and General Counsel of Nations Trust Bank.
Nations Trust Bank PLC is one of Sri Lankas fastest growing licensed commercial banks, offering a wide, comprehensive range of solutions to Individuals, SMEs, Corporates and Institutions. The Bank strongly believes that change is needed within the organization and the financial services sector as a whole for it to survive and thrive in the future.
Following is an interview with Theja Silva, Company Secretary and General Counsel of Nations Trust Bank.
How has your bank understood the role of the financial sector in sustainable development and what has been your banks approach
As a bank, we are expected to safeguard and enhance the value of wealth of our stakeholders, so they could enjoy a better quality of life. However, while we continue to provide better financial solutions and returns to our stakeholders, we have come to realize that because of larger environmental, social and economic impacts and vulnerabilities at play, such as the increasing climate variability with intense droughts and floods, the value of this wealth is at risk of being eroded and quality of life of our stakeholders affected.
We want to support our customers to adopt more environmentally friendly and socially inclusive options, while we do the same in our business. For example, over the past three years, we have been measuring the carbon footprint of our hub operations and taking action to reduce our emissions including in installing a 40kW solar PV system in our largest owned office complex. We want to promote such economical options such as Climate Smart Agriculture, Smart Mobility and Green Buildings through our financing that helps our customers to improve their productivity and resilience.
We are also innovating in the digital sphere and understand that the technologies and new economic models arising in the fourth industrial revolution have significant potential to deliver sustainable outcomes. Our digital bank, FriMi, is already helping our customers to go paperless and avoid unnecessary commute and as we continue to evolve, we plan to make sustainable choices more convenient for our customers through these digital channels.
We also will pursue greater financial inclusion through digital mediums and we have already opened our infrastructure for open innovation through Nations Open API Banking.
Could you explain more on your CSR initiatives and outcomes that you are pursuing
Our Board of Directors have set aside 1% of our Profit After Tax to undertake community development programs that have strong development impact. We have decided that we will focus these funds in to two broad areas: education and environmental stewardship.
In terms of education, we have identified that digital divide will be a major impediment as the country looks to seize opportunities in fourth industrial revolution. Therefore, one of the key outcomes that we are seeking is to improve digital literacy and digital intelligence, so no one is left behind as the country progresses in this direction.
Since last year, we have been partnering with ShilpaSayura Foundation to promote e-learning and develop programming logic in schools. Earlier in the year, we supported Akuressa Godapitiya Kanitu Viduhala in providing a computer lab and conducted a three full day program on e-learning, visual programming and introduced students to IoT using Micro:bit units.
We are also making investments to improve STEM education and last year handed over a full-fledged science lab to Galgamuwa Nithalawa School.
Other outcomes on education related initiatives are to enhance emotional intelligence and build awareness on sustainability. We have a long-term partnership with University of Colombo Alumni Association, where we are conducting workshops and offering mentoring sessionsfor a period of 3 months for students to develop their socio-emotional skills and prepare them for future of work.
We have also supported the BEEZ Society and the Roteract Club of Faculty of Science of University of Colombo to raise awareness amongst youth on the importance of sustainable development in Colombo and Jaffna. We are also currently setting up a research endowment that the local university system could draw upon to conduct meaningful research.
In terms of our environmental stewardship, we work with leading environmental societies in the country such as the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) and the Wildlife Conservation Society of Galle (WCS-G). We support research, awareness and policy advocacy and direct conservation efforts by these societies.
Monthly public lectures and the magazines Loris and Warana/Vaaranam of WNPS are sponsored by us. We fund the animal rescue service and animal hospital operated by WCS-G at Hiyare. Our conservation efforts also include hog deer conservation in Honduwa and also leopard conservation.
What do you see as Critical Success Factors for your efforts in sustainable value creation
We are fortunate that we have a Board that is long-term oriented and with respect to our community, development efforts are genuinely interested in the impact we make. We are also fortunate to have employees who are passionate and willing to contribute their time in furtherance of our sustainability initiatives. This organization ethos and culture is a critical factor for our success.
We believe that the strength of our partnerships and collaboration will be key to further our sustainability agenda. We have been fortunate to have long-term partners that have shared values and common objectives and we will remain open to collaborate with like-minded organizations.
As an industry too, the banking sector has been collaborating to promote sustainability through Sri Lanka Banks Associations Sustainable Banking Initiative, where 18 banks have come together on a common agenda. With our CEO, Renuka Fernando, as the current Chairperson of Sri Lanka Banks Association, we have been playing an active role in supporting this initiative as a member and providing leadership.
We have higher expectations for the 2030 vision and will seek to provide strategic leadership in the industry through innovation and collaboration in continuing to improve quality of life.

Fintech Meetup of the Asia-Pacific Executives Forum held
Fintech Meetup of the Asia-Pacific Executives Forum was recently held at Hilton Colombo; the forum is jointly organized by Colorado, USA-based American Academy of Project Management (AAPM) and Global Academy of Finance and Management (GAFM), in collaboration with Interstellar Strategic Partners and a number of other institutions.
At the forum, it is initiated the forming of the Fintech Association of Sri Lanka.
Andrew Holmes, an Australia based Fintech Consultant in his keynote speech come out with a number issues on Cryptocurrency and blockchain related issues.
Ananda Jayalath, Assistant Governor of the Central Bank explained regulatory role of Central Bank on Fintech.
Sri Lanka based German hotelier Dr. Dietmar Doering, former Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) and American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Sri Lanka President and TJ Associates Managing Partner Dr. Tissa Jayaweera, filmmaker and Asian Aviation Centre (AAC) Chairman Chandran Rutnam and Public Finance Specialist Rifas Raseek also participated in the panel discussion.
AAPM/GAFM Representative in Sri Lanka and Maldives Rajkumar Kanagasingam moderated the forum session. Andrew Holmes in his keynote speech explained the concept of the blockchain and its underlying technology.
He highlighted the importance to distinguish between cryptocurrency digital assets and the blockchain, clearing the common misconceptions held by the public that the two were the same. Holmes said the technologys revolutionary aspect lies in its ability to enable two parties to transact with each other directly. In current systems a third party is required to mediate transactions, this third party, in most cases, maintains the record keeping and performs activity in relation to verification and facilitation. The blockchain does these automatically without the need for the third party.
He further said to exemplify its potential, one can think of PickMe or AirBnb operating without the organization. The blockchain could connect both the service provider and requestor directly. This would reduce costs to both parties significantly by bypassing high middlemen fees and promote true free market demand and supply.
Holmes highlighted since the blockchains debut with its application for Bitcoin, there has been some upgrades to its features. One of the most significant advances has been the ability to program the blockchain. This ability to specify conditions and produce desired outcomes when certain criteria has been met is termed as Smart Contracts. Ethereum is the worlds first smart contract platform; if Bitcoin is a calculator you can think of Ethereum as a personal computer. Smart contracts are going to be used heavily in the future to automate activity and governance.
He said, Imagine the ability to program money and how it should behave or create your own will that is governed by a program that will execute exactly as you specified. Even a world where you can rent your mobile phone or computers processing power to earn some passive income.
Holmes said these are some of the possibilities the blockchain is going to facilitate without the need of centralized bodies governing them. And he concluded all of these activities will be occurring by our collective contributions with the help of our own devices.

## Title: Franchise, the Right to Vote
## Supertitle:

Franchise, the Right to Vote
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights by Article 21(1) proclaims that everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. The Declaration adds that the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government, and states that the will of people shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by Article 25 declares that every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives. The Covenant recognizes the right of every citizen to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors. Sri Lanka is fortunate as it won universal suffrage ahead of many other countries. Our Courts had traditionally adopted the view that the right to vote or stand as a candidate for election is not a civil right but is a creature of statute or special law and must be subject to the limitations imposed by it. Franchise, or the right to vote, did not receive express recognition as a fundamental right in the 1972 Constitution.
Although the franchise is not expressly included among the fundamental rights enshrined in Chapter III of the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka, it is clearly recognized in Article 3 of the Constitution which deals with the Sovereignty of the People: In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise.
Article 4(e) of the Constitution provides that 
The franchise shall be exercisable at the election of the Presidency of the Republic and of the Members of Parliament, and at every Referendum by every citizen who has attained the age of eighteen years, and who, being qualified to be an elector as hereinafter provided, has his name entered in the register of electors.
Chapter XIV (the Franchise and Elections) of the 1978 Constitution then goes on to make detailed provisions regarding franchise and elections. These provisions of the 1978 Constitution came for interpretation in the context of a challenge to a Bill for the amendment of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No.15 of 1987 as amended. In Atukorale v Attorney General, it was strenuously argued that Article 4(e) is not exhaustive of the manner in which the franchise is exercisable and included Pradeshiya Sabha elections even though not expressly mentioned in that Article. The Supreme Court took a narrow view of Article 4(e) and rejected this argument.
Karunathilake and Another v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others
In the landmark decision of Karunathilake and Another v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others, the question surfaced once again, this time in the context of Provincial Council elections. Upon the five year terms of the Central, Uva North  Central, Western and Sabaragamua Provincial Councils coming to an end in June, 1998 the date of the poll for the new elections had been fixed for August 28, 1998. Notice had also been given by all the returning officers that the postal ballot papers would be issued on August 4, 1998. However, by telegram dated August 3, the respective retuning officers under the direction of the Commissioner of Elections suspended the postal voting which had been fixed for August 4 and the very next day the President issued a proclamation under the Public Security Ordinance making an emergency regulation that rendered the notice relating to the date of the poll to no effect.
The Proclamation was challenged on several grounds. The Supreme Court held that even assuming that the impugned Emergency Regulation was valid the Commissioner of Elections had duty against the background of the Constitutional provisions contained in Articles 103 and 114 of the Constitution and in the exercise of his powers under Section 22(6) of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, to fix a new date for the polls and further that his conduct in suspending the issue of postal ballot papers even before the impugned regulation was made is a further indication that he was not acting independently.
His Lordship Justice M.D.H. Fernando (with their Lordships G.P.S. de Silva, C.J. and Gunasekera, J. agreeing) observed that 
The right to freedom of speech and expression includes the right to vote. This silent and secret expression is no less an exercise of the freedom of speech and expression, than the most eloquent speech from a political platform. To hold otherwise is to undermine the very foundation of the Constitution.
His Lordship took the view that as much as the Commissioners conduct was unauthorized by law the matter under consideration had no relevance to the Presidential immunity enshrined in Article 35 of the Constitution. For the same reason Article 15(2) and (7) which impose restrictions on the exercise of fundamental rights if they are prescribed by law or by emergency regulations were held to be inapplicable. Consequently, the ouster clause contained in Section 8 of the Public Security Ordinance concerning emergency regulations was held not to prohibit the Court from reviewing the validity of any impugned regulation since it cannot have the effect of overriding, amending or suspending provisions of the Constitution.
Sarath Jayasinghe and Others v the Attorney General
In Sarath Jayasinghe and Others v the Attorney General Articles 3 and 4 (e) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka were considered once again in the context of the Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill, which sought to nullify, with a view of calling for fresh nominations, all nomination papers submitted under Section 28 of the Local Authorities Ordinance in respect of the various local authorities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Significantly, expanding the canvas of franchise, and making what may be called a U-turn from the path taken by it Atukorale v Attorney General, the Supreme Court observed as follows:-
The mere fact that in Article 4(e) there is no reference to elections to Local Authorities does not mean that franchise as contemplated in Article 3 would not extend to elections to local authorities. Local Authorities have acquired constitutional status, in particular after the enactment of the 13th Amendment, which specifically deals with Local Government as item 4 in list 1 of the 9th Schedule ..
Therefore we cannot agree with the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the franchise in relation to Local Authorities does not come within the purview of Article 3 of the Constitution.
The franchise as contemplated in the Constitution includes the rights of persons qualified under the law to present themselves as candidates. It is not limited to a right to vote. Chapter XIV of the Constitution which deals with The Franchise and Elections also include the provisions with regard to persons qualified to be elected to office by means of the exercise of the franchise.
Mediwake and Others v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others
In Mediwake and Others v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others, which arose from the Provincial Council elections for the Central Province, the Petitioners alleged that various incidents had occurred on election day at twenty five named polling stations in the Kandy District, including the premature closure of one polling station as well as ballot stuffing, driving away polling agents and intimidation at several others. The evidence established that ballot stuffing took place at twelve polling stations, that at eleven other polling there were incidents of harassment and chasing away of polling agents of one leading political party means of violence or threatening of violence, and that the 12th to 15th respondents were actively involved in four incidents.
The Commissioner of Elections had annulled the poll at one of the polling stations and had removed some of the stuffed ballots from counting, but did not order a re-poll in any of the polling stations. The Petitioners alleged that their sovereign right of franchise under Article 4(e) of the Constitution had been denied and / or violated in respect of the conduct of the poll. They also contended that the Commissioner of Elections, by this failure to declare the poll at such polling stations void (except at one polling station) under Section 46A (2) of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, and by his failure to order a re-poll under Section 46A (7) (a) of the Act, infringed their fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1) and 14(1) (a) of the Constitution. The decision of this case turned largely on the interpretation and implementation of section 46A of the Provincial Councils Act.
It was argued by the respondents that the legislature had advisedly left the qualitative assessment of the poll to the Election Court which will hear election petitions. Rejecting these arguments, M.D.H. Fernando, J. observed -
Section 46A (1) appears in Part III of the Act, dealing with The Poll, Many of the provisions of Part III manifest a legislative intention that the poll must be free (e.g. sections 33(2) and 38 (1), equal (e.g. sections 35, 36 and 40) and secret (e.g. section 37). The objective fact to which paragraph (b) refers is not the conclusion of the poll, but rather the continuation of the poll until the scheduled time of conclusion. What that requires is that, having duly commenced at the scheduled time, the poll must continue until closing time.
What is a poll In my view, a poll is a process of voting that enables a genuine choice between rival contenders: necessarily, one that is free of any improper influence or pressure; equal, where all those entitled to vote (and no others) are allowed to express their choice as between parties and candidates who compete on level terms; and where the secrecy of the ballot respected.
I therefore conclude that section 46A (1) (b) requires a genuine poll, continuing uninterrupted from beginning to end, and compels the Commissioner to make a qualitative assessment as to whether the poll was free, equal and secret.
The Supreme Court had no difficulty in this case in coming to the conclusion that the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1) (a) have been violated. M.D.H. Fernando J. further stated:
The right to a free, equal and secret ballot is an integral part of the citizens freedom of expression, when he exercises that freedom through his right whether constitutional or statutory makes no differences  to vote.
Further, the constitutional duty of the Commissioner of Elections (under Article 104) extends to all elections conducted under any statute, including Provincial Council elections. The duty imposes by Article 4(d) on all organs of government to respect, secure and advance fundamental rights applies to him too, and it is therefore his obligation to conduct each and every election in such a manner as to safeguard the fundamental rights of every registered vote.
Thavaneethan and Others v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections (2003)
The Petitioners in Thavaneethan and Others v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections (2003) were voters from the uncleared area in the Batticalo and Vanni districts who were prevented from voting at the General Elections held on December 5, 2001 for the election of Members of Parliament. The Petitioners complained that on arrival at the check- points on the day of the poll, they were informed by the army officers present that they had received orders from their superior officers not to permit any one to enter the cleared areas that day. Most of them had remained there for sometimes hoping for a change of heart, but as that decision was not changed, they returned home disappointed.
The Petitioners further claimed that although votes in the uncleared areas in the Batticaloa and Vanni districts were prevented from voting in this manner, those in the Trincomalee district in which the ruling party had won at the previous Parliamentary General Election in 2000, had been allowed to cross to the cleared areas to vote.
They alleged that the decision to close the check-points in question was motivated by political factors and not by a genuine security need.
They pleaded that they were treated differently to registered voters in the rest of the country, in violation of the equality provisions enshrined in Articles12.
According the Court a mere subjective or speculative fear was not enough to justify closure: there had to be an objective and reasonable basis for such fear. Concluding that the fundamental right to speech and expression guaranteed to the Petitioners by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution has in fact been violated in the circumstances of the case, the Court awarded the Petitioners compensation, and costs payable personally by some of the Respondents.
The above analysis indicates the expansion, the subject of franchise has undergone as a result of the judicial activism and true concern for human rights shown by the Supreme Court, being the Sri Lankan last Court in the judicial hierarchy to aggrieved parties.

French World Cup glory costs China firm $9 mn and counting
Shanghai, Monday: A Chinese kitchen appliance maker said Monday it has so far made refunds worth nine million dollars, fulfilling a costly pledge to reimburse customers if France won the World Cup.
Vatti, one of the French team's sponsors, is coughing up after Didier Deschamps' side beat Croatia 4-2 in the final in Moscow a fortnight ago.
According to Vatti's latest figures, the Chinese firm has made refunds -- either in cash or gift cards -- of more than 62 million yuan.
And the cost to Vatti of the success of "Les Bleus" does not stop there, with a portion of refunds still outstanding. The total payout over the marketing stunt will amount to nearly $12 million. Vatti, founded in 1992, promised before the World Cup to refund customers who bought their "Championship Package" of selected products if France lifted the trophy. Vatti stock dived as France made their way through the tournament, but the firm is publicly sanguine.
"The amount to repay could be very significant, but it was included in our annual budget. It will not have huge consequences on the company," Wang Zhaozhao, a Vatti representative, previously told the China Securities Journal. AFP

Gayle equals Afridis sixes record in international cricket
Chris Gayles exploits in International cricket might look small given his dominance in the overseas T20 league in the last 7-8 years where he emerged as the best batsman in the shortest format.
Gayle, known for his big hitting and effortlessly clearing the ropes, has a few records for hitting sixes in International cricket. The left-hander hasnt been a regular feature in the Windies team since the completion of the 2011 World Cup.
Gayle has featured in only 104 matches across all formats in the last seven years for his country and smashed 198 maximums in this span in only 111 innings. From his debut in 1999 to 2011, Gayle hit 278 sixes in 412 innings he played in 339 international games.
This six-hitting rate helped him equal Shahid Afridis record for most number of sixes by a player in International cricket. Afridis 476 sixes looked like an unbreakable record as no one among the current players was even close.
Gayles International career seemed to have just cut short when he featured in only six international matches that too in the 2016 WT20 between April 2015 and June 2017.
However, his return in Windies colours will help him bag another record on his name. The Jamaican hit as many as five sixes during his 66-ball 73 in the final game of the 3-match ODI series against Bangladesh at home. His innings couldnt help his teams cause as they ended 18 runs short of Bangladeshs total and lost yet another ODI series.
Gayle can become the proud holder of the record for hitting the most sixes in International cricket as early as August 1, as he is part of the 3-match T20I series against Bangladesh.
Among the current players, Rohit Sharma and Martin Guptill have the best chance to finish their International careers with 500 sixes, a barrier yet to be broken.
Rohit is the genuine contender among the lot as he has hit 248 out of his 291 sixes thus far in the last five years. Rohit smacked those 248 sixes in just 188 innings wacross 171 matches since the start of 2013. - CT

Selena Gomez has stolen Beyonce's crown as the Instagram user to reach one million photo 'likes' in record time.
The Come and Get It hitmaker took to the image-sharing app on July 23 to thank fans for their abundance of birthday wishes, after celebrating turning 26 on Sunday with a party onboard a yacht.
"Another year down," she captioned a series of photos of herself and her gal pals. "Thank you for all the bday (sic) love. I couldn't be more appreciative of you and my best friends for celebrating with me. I love you guys like crazy! God bless!"
Followers were quick to react to the post, and helped her reached the one million milestone in just 13 minutes, earning her the new social media title.
Beyonce had previously snagged the record last summer, after debuting her newborn twins Rumi and Sir Carter in an elaborate photoshoot, which racked up eight million 'likes' in 12 hours.
Selena was already an Instagram queen as she boasts the largest fan presence on the platform with 139 million followers. The singer/actress has plenty of reason to keep the celebrations going, as she has also just been named the second richest Instagram star of 2018.
Officials at Hopper HQ unveiled its annual Instagram Rich List on Tuesday (24Jul18), when they revealed which celebrities earn the most money from sponsored posts online. Kylie Jenner topped the poll amid claims suggesting she can charge up to $1 million (760,000) per social media post, while Selena is just behind, netting $800,000 (608,000) for each ad. Music News

Hamilton in holiday mood after Hungarian victory
BUDAPEST, Sunday: Lewis Hamilton was living a dream on Sunday after winning the Hungarian Grand Prix from pole position to take a 24-point lead into Formula Ones August break.
The four-times world champions fifth win of the season for Mercedes left him on 213 points to 189 for Ferraris Sebastian Vettel, who finished second, and relishing the prospect of a stress-free family holiday. I really could only have dreamed that we would be in the position that we
are in right now, he told reporters. Im really happy, going into the break, particularly with back-to-back wins. I think that boost will last a long time for our team and its encouraging for everyone so Im excited for the break, added the Briton.
Vettel took the chequered flag 17.1 seconds behind, after surviving a late collision with Hamiltons team mate Valtteri Bottas who also banged bodywork with Red Bulls Australian Daniel Ricciardo. Ferrari, mourning the death of former chairman Sergio Marchionne, had Kimi
Raikkonen finish third to complete a podium of champions on a dry and sweltering afternoon at the Hungaroring outside Budapest. The victory was Hamiltons record sixth in Hungary and 67th of his career. In a race effectively decided by Saturdays wet qualifying, when Mercedes locked out the front row of the grid against expectation, Hamilton was never challenged.
We came here knowing Ferrari would be really quick this weekend so to come out with these points, well definitely take it as a bonus, said Hamilton in a pitlane interview after embracing team members.
Im really happy with how strong its come in the last couple of races. Weve got to come strong in the next half, added the 33-year-old, who won in Germany from 14th place on the grid a weekend earlier. Tyre strategies were also crucial at a relatively slow and twisty circuit where overtaking is always difficult, with track temperatures hovering around 50 degrees Celsius. Vettel started on the softs and went for a longer first stint than Mercedes, worried by Ferraris quick getaways, who opted for ultrasofts that were quicker at the start but faded more rapidly. Lining up in fourth place on the grid, Vettel grabbed third from Raikkonen immediately but could not find a way past Bottas who slotted in behind Hamilton as a defence against the red threat.
We were out of position. I think we could have gone with Lewis today with the race pace, said Vettel. P2 is not really what we wanted this weekend but I think it was the maximum today.  Agencies

Harin says jamming not practical
A discussion should be held with the Examinations Department and other relevant parties with reference to installing signal jammers at examination centres, Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said yesterday.
The technical difficulties should be reviewed at the discussion, Minister Fernando also said. Minister Fernando was commenting on the recent claim made by the Examinations Department that a project will be launched to disable mobile phone signals within the examination centers during the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination which is to be held next month.
Fernando also said that he is not aware if discussions have already being held with regards to the matter with Sri Lanka Telecom.
Pointing out the practical difficulties of installing jammers at each and every examination center island wide, Minister Fernando said that it would not be possible to jam signals from telecommunication towers since it may disturb the communication of the public.
How many examinations centers are there island wide If we are to do this, we have to install jammers at all these locations. At how many areas should we do this signal jamming This seems rather impractical, Minister Fernando said.
If we jam the signals from telecommunication towers, it will affect everyone in those areas. It will definitely have a negative impact on business interactions and similar other communications. Therefore, it does not seem practical either, Minister Fernando pointed out.
The Minister said a discussion should be held if they are to proceed with this idea.
Minister Fernando was speaking at a press brief at the UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha yesterday morning.

INDONESIA: Groups of hikers began to pick their way down the slopes of a Lombok volcano Monday after a deadly earthquake triggered landslides that trapped more than 500 tourists and guides on the mountain.
Tonnes of rock and mud were dislodged on Mount Rinjani in the 6.4-magnitude quake, which struck early Sunday and was followed by scores of aftershocks, blocking the hiking routes that crisscross the mountain.
Around 560 people were estimated to be trapped on Rinjani overnight, including citizens from the United States, France, the Netherlands, Thailand and Germany, as well as many other countries, search and rescue officials said.
Search and rescue officials said tourists had now started to descend the active volcano but were unlikely to arrive at its base before nightfall.
Hundreds of other hikers managed to get off the mountain on Sunday, according to officials.
At least 16 people were killed in the earthquake across affected areas of Lombok, while hundreds of buildings were destroyed including a health clinic. The quake created panic on the holiday island and sent locals and tourists running outside their homes and hotels.
Helicopters and search teams were deployed to scour the volcanos slopes and drop food supplies for those stranded on the mountain.
The search will be halted at sunset, search and rescue officials said.
For supplies, they can still survive for another one to two days, Agus Hendra Sanjaya, spokesman for Matarams search and rescue agency, told AFP.
Rising some 3,726 metres (12,224 feet) above sea level, Rinjani is the second-tallest volcano in Indonesia and a favourite among sightseers keen to take in its expansive views.
Hiking trails on the mountain were closed following the quake due to fear of further landslides.
Thailands embassy in Jakarta said 239 of its citizens were stuck in the area surrounding the mountain.
Thai national Thanapon Worawutchainan, who was at the summit when the earthquake occurred, posted a video on Facebook showing people stumbling down the slopes in the aftermath. - AFP

The victims, an Army soldier and another youth, were admitted to the Horana Hospital on July 29 by the Horana Police.

The people wanted the Horana Police headquarters inspector (HQI) to conduct an inquiry.
Police investigations reveal that the victims were waiting at the Ingiriya bus stand on the night of July 28. A police SI, a sergeant and a constable came to the bus stand and questioned the two youths and assaulted them with the butt of a firearm and took them to the police station.
The policemen forced them to kneel down and ordered them to remove their clothes, according to the investigations. The youth denied that they had committed any offence, but said were waiting for the bus to go home.
The Horana Police HQI rushed to the Ingiriya Police Station with a team of officers after the public protest and conducted an investigation. Police rushed the injured youths to the Horana Hospital.
The three policemen were also examined by the Horana Hospital DMO from whom a medical report was obtained.

Impairment provisions affect DFCCs Bottom Line
DFCC Bank PLC, the banking arm of the DFCC Group reported a drop in profit for the second quarter amidst a challenging business environment. The drop in profit was due to higher impairment provisions, as well as a one-off gain from the disposal of shares of Commercial Bank during the previous period.
Overall, the DFCC Group, whose business covers commercial banking, investment banking, wealth management, information technology, industrial park management and consultancy recorded a profit before tax of R 2,596 million and profit after tax of Rs 1,861 million for the period ended June 2018 as compared to Rs 3,616 million and Rs 2,944 million respectively, in the comparative period in 2017.
Meanwhile, the Bank posted a profit before tax of Rs 2,402 million and a profit after tax of Rs 1,710 million which reflects a decline of 30% and 39% respectively compared to the same period in 2017. When adjusted for the exceptional gain from sale of Commercial Bank Shares reported in the previous period, the declines in profit before tax and profit after tax were 5% and 10% respectively.
The impairment provision during the current period was Rs 1,407 million compared to Rs 487 million in the comparable period. However, recovery processes are being rigorously pursued to minimize any actual losses that may arise from such exposures. The decline of 11% in Net Operating Income was due to the higher charge for impairment.
On a positive note, with increased customer interest in the Banks commercial banking products, the Bank recorded a healthy growth of 24% in Net Interest Income to Rs 6,556 million from Rs 5,303 million mainly as a result of the portfolio growth of Rs 38,229 million in loans and receivables year-on-year and prudent management of asset and liability re-pricing. To page iv
In addition, total Operating Income increased to LKR 7,662 million compared to Rs 7,533 million in the comparative period. Various initiatives adopted in order to grow non-interest income paid dividends as a growth of 30% was recorded in fees and commission income to Rs 906 million from Rs 699 million in June 2017. Trading gains increased by 14% to 172 million in June 2018. However, the reason for the overall moderate growth was due to the adverse impact from revaluation of funding swap contracts and the previous years one off gain reported from sale of Commercial Bank equity shares.
The Bank also continued to focus on expanding its branch network and delivery channels in order to reach out to the unbanked and under-banked consumers across the country. In doing so, the Bank added nine fully-fledged branches to its branch network during the period July 2017 to June 2018. This largely contributed to the increase in Operating Expenses to Rs 3,178 million from Rs 2,784 million (14%) in the comparable period. The Bank will continue this expansion drive as well as focus on developing alternate channels backed by the latest technology, with customers interests taking precedence.
Other Comprehensive Income
In terms of Other Comprehensive Income, the available for sale equity securities recorded a fair value loss of Rs 1,907 million due to the declining trend in the equity market. Furthermore, the Fixed Income securities recorded a fair value loss of Rs 413 million. The regulatory change in implementation of tax with effect from April 1,2018 for Treasury Bills and Bonds adversely affected the market prices of Treasury Bills and Bonds.
Financial Position
Fortifying its position as a strong business entity, DFCC Banks Total Assets grew by Rs 56,346 million year-on-year to Rs 361,272 million which reflects a 18.5% growth compared to June 2017, while the Banks Loans portfolio grew by Rs 38,229 million to Rs 236,666 million compared to Rs 198,437 million as at 30 June 2017, reflecting a growth of 19.3% year-on-year.
The Banks deposit base reported an increase to Rs 207,862 up 23.5% from Rs 168,357 million in June 2017, further displaying customer confidence. The growth in customer deposits during the first half year 2018 was Rs 14,555 million (8%). The Banks CASA ratio, which represents low cost deposits over the total deposits of the Bank improved to 20.2% from 19.8% in March 2018.
DFCC Banks CEO, Lakshman Silva said that despite profits being adversely impacted due to impairment, he is encouraged by the growth seen during the period in terms of expansion of island-wide footprint and continued focus on launching technologically advanced products and services such as the recently launched DFCCiConnect, which is a fully integrated Payments and Cash Management (PCM) System for businesses of any scale.

India to send turtles back to SL
The Forest Department in Tamil Nadu plans to send back a consignment of exotic turtles, mostly red-eared sliders, which was seized from a passenger at the airport recently, The New Indian Express said in a Trichy-datelined report.
According to sources, officials are planning to send the turtles back to Sri Lanka from where they came.
Sources added that SriLankan Airlines also failed to notice the consignment carrying the turtles during security check with the reptiles kept in different boxes inside a stroller bag. Last year, Customs nabbed another Sri Lankan passenger with 3,000 red-eared sliders at Chennai International Airport. In many cases, the Forest Department was helpless in taking tough action against such illegal acts as these non-native species are not listed under the scheduled lists of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
These turtles are popularly known as Singapore turtles or American turtles in the pet market in India, and are widely imported without proper documents as many people believe that they bring luck.
The growing demand for these exotic species has encouraged many people to illegally import these reptiles from illegally operating breeding units in several Asian countries. These baby turtles would be brought from a captive breeding facility as most of them are of the same size. Otherwise, it is impossible to get this many turtles of similar size, said Muralidharan M, an eminent turtle biologist and marine researcher.
Even in this case, experts confirmed that the Forest Department will be able to take action against the passenger only for importing it without proper documents.

Johnson bounces back to win first Canadian Open crown
TORONTO:World number one Dustin Johnson rebounded from a shock early exit at the British Open to capture the Canadian Open title on Sunday for his third victory of 2018.
Johnson fired a six-under 66 for a three-stroke win after starting the final round of the USPGA Tour event at the Glen Abbey course in a four-way tie for the lead.
I really, really hit the ball well all four days, the 34-year-old American said.
The win was the 19th title of his career and comes just over a week after he failed to make the cut at Carnoustie.
I just did not score very well at Carnoustie at all, he said. I didnt putt good. I felt like I hit the ball plenty good enough to be under par after two days, and I was five-over or something. It was just bad scoring. Johnson finished at 23-under 265 on Sunday, finally breaking through in an event he finished runner-up in 2013 and 2016.
South Koreans Kim Whee and An Byeong-hun finished second after they each shot 69. They and Kevin Tway were tied for the 54-hole lead with Johnson.
Keegan Bradley had a 64 to finish fourth at 19 under. He shot 63 on Friday, but had a 73 in the third round.
Johnson has a strong connection to Canada because of his engagement to Paulina Gretzky, daughter of hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and mother of his two sons.
Obviously having a lot of ties to Canada with Paulina, her dad, Wayne, who, thanks to him, I get a lot of fans out here.
So it makes it a lot more fun playing out here in front of a big crowd. It takes a lot of work and a lot of support from my family to help me get to where I am.
- Consistent winner -
Johnson also becomes the first player since Tiger Woods (2005-09) with at least three wins in three consecutive seasons on the US Tour.
He said the most important aspect of his game that needed improvement, after the British Open disappointment, was his putting.
I needed to work on the putter, which I did. I started rolling the putter a lot better this week, he said. Johnson got off to a strong start Sunday with back-to-back birdies on the first two holes. He added another on the par-four eighth to make the turn at three under for the round.
He hit his 103 yard approach on the par-four 11th to nine feet and then sank the putt for another birdie.
He made birdie on 16 and then capped his round with a birdie on 18 as he finished just two strokes shy of the tournament scoring record of 263 first achieved by Johnny Palmer in 1952. An, who was making his Canadian Open debut, improves to 36th in the world rankings after his tie for second. He birdied three of his final six holes.
Coming down the stretch on those par-fives, I made nice up-and-downs for birdie. So that definitely boosted my confidence, he said.
Kim earned his third top ten finish of the season after holding a 54-hole co-lead for the first time in his USPGA Tour career.
Tway closed with a disappointing 76 to drop into a tie for 17th at 13 under. He was trying to win his first PGA title in the event where father Bob Tway won the last of his tour titles in 2003.

Kalisz completes medley double as US swimming championships close
IRVINE: Double world champion Chase Kalisz won the mens 200m individual medley in a blistering 1min 55.73sec on Sunday to cap the US swimming championships with a second IM title.
Kalisz put himself atop the world rankings for 2018 heading into the Pan Pacific Championships starting in Tokyo on August 9.
That one was definitely my best race of the meet, said Kalisz, who was disappointed with his winning time in the 400m IM two days earlier. I honestly didnt think I was going to go 1:55. Abrahm DeVine was second in 1:57.41 while Gunnar Bentz and Andrew Seliskar tied for third in 1:58.23.
Kalisz, the 2016 Olympic silver medalist in the 400m IM, swept the medleys at the World Championships in Budapest last year.
He said he was looking forward to the Pan Pacs, where his 200m competition could include Japans Kosuke Hagino and Daiya Seto and Chinas Wang Shun.
The Pan Pacs are the biggest international meet for US swimmers this year, and also another qualifier for next years World Championships in South Korea.
Olympic 100m free gold medalist Simone Manuel completed a freestyle sprint sweep with a victory in the 50m in 24.10sec, breaking the US Open record wet by Australias Cate Campbell in 2008.
Im happy with that, said Manuel, who led all the way.
Abbey Weitzeil was second in 24.63 and Margo Geer third in 24.79.
Michael Andrew, 19, sprinted to his fourth title of the week in the mens 50m free, besting a field stacked with world and Olympic champions with a time of 21.49sec.
Caeleb Dressel, who won the 50m free at Budapest as part of a seven-gold World Championships haul, was second in 21.67 and Nathan Adrian, the 2012 Olympics 100m free gold medalist, was third in 21.85.
Last one, fast one, Andrew, a former age group phenomenon who turned pro at 14, said after a meet that saw him qualify for his first senior international championships.
He had already won the 50m butterfly and breaststroke and the 100m breaststroke.
Being on the team, there was no pressure, he said of the 50 free. I could race completely free. I wanted to see what I was capable of. Kathleen Baker, still riding high on the excitement of breaking the 100m backstroke world record on Thursday, went out hard and held on to win the 200m individual medley in a world-leading time of 2min 08.32.
It was a US Open record for the 21-year-old, who sliced three seconds off her previous best in an event that has taken a back seat to backstroke in her international competition.
I only slept like four and a half hours last night because I was so excited, Baker said. When youre having such a great meet it really just carries into your other races and gives you a lot of confidence. Melanie Margalis was a distant second in 2:09.43 and Ella Eastin was third in 2:10.84.
With world record-holder Katie Ledecky taking the night off, Ashley Twichell won the womens 1,500m freestyle in 15:55.68. Ally McHugh was second in 16:02.56 and Erica Sullivan third in 16:02.88.
Zane Grothe won the mens 800m free in a US Open record of 7:44.57 -- the first time hes swum under 7:50 in the event.
Jordan Wilimovsky was second in 7:47.51 and Robert Finke third in 7:51.45.

Look like an Egyptian!
Having seen an abundance of the black eyeliner in the form of winged and sexy, smudged, greasy, matte and shiny, this season, it is time for a Cleopatra inspired eyeliner that is super graphic, pointy dramatic, and heavier along the bottom lashes!
We associate this magical style of applying eyeliner with Cleopatra, a woman of such legendary sex appeal and who is still very much present in popular culture today who wasnt just a beauty, but her presence and charm made her irresistible.
The Egyptian queen still reigns supreme this spring on runway shows, although makeup artists have taken the Cleopatras signature look further and made it thicker, bolder and more dramatic than usual.
The key to nailing the Cleopatra liner is bringing the black lines down into sharp points at the inner corners of the eyes to mirror the winged liner on the outer corners.
Wanting more drama
Draw a straight line along your upper and lower eyelashes. Continue drawing the line on the upper eyelid without stopping at the outer corner of the eye. Give a finishing touch by making the line into a tail accompanied by accentuated eyebrows to acquire the dramatic iconic look.

Mattala monthly income Rs. 1.2 m, expenditure Rs. 250 m - Patali
If one takes the Mattala Airport into account, its monthly income is around Rs. 1.2 million whereas the monthly expenditure was Rs. 250 million, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Despite gullible talk made by certain sections which had no proper economic or political knowledge or background, the Mattala Airport can never be made economically viable by the Airport Authority single handed, Minister Ranawaka said.
He was speaking to the media after opening a new library building put up at the Mathugama Salalankaratissa Kanishta Vidyalaya with his Ministry funds recently.
Every citizen of this country had to pocket out Rs.800 each to maintain the Mattala Airport built without any proper feasibility study. It was evident that the second airport which should have been built at Katunayake had been taken to Mattala for the sole purpose of adding ones name tag for personal glory.
Today, the government had initiated talks between the Sri Lanka Aviation Authorities and the AAI (Airport Authority of India) to find out the possibility of handing over the operations to AAI while maintaining ownership by Sri Lanka, Minister Ranawaka said.
However, discussions had still not reached any finality. Once a decision was taken it would be submitted for Cabinet approval and thereafter announcement to the public for open discussion.
The people had the final option to decide whether this Airport should be maintained for a single persons glorification or made economically viable for the interest of the nation, the Minister said.

Mother-child communication in plants
Turns out, there is mother-child communication in plants.
An international team led by the Freiburg plant biologist Prof. Dr. Thomas Laux has shown that mother plants guide the development of their embryos using the hormone auxin. When embryos develop inside their mother, their well-being depends on the nurture provided by the maternal tissue. Mutations in the maternal tissue may result in defective embryo development.
In seed-bearing plants such as grains, the embryos develop in unison with the surrounding tissue of the mother plant. Laux and colleagues, therefore, put forward that there must be a form of communication between the mother plant and the embryo that guides the early stages of development after fertilization.
Auxin is used by plants to control a variety of processes ranging from organ development to defense against pathogenic microbes. The Freiburg biologists have shown that embryo development is disturbed when the production of auxin by the maternal cells is blocked.
However, artificial activation of auxin biosynthesis in the embryo cells, which are normally unable to produce this hormone in early stages of development, allowed the embryos to develop normally without a maternal auxin supply.
Since they made similar observations in maize, the researchers speculate that the mechanism they discovered may be widespread in plant species. This finding could also contribute to the optimization of biotechnological plant propagation. In the future, this result might help breeders grow plants that are more resilient in the face of environmental challenges.
The full findings are present in the journal- Nature Plants.

Munchee holds environmental drive to curb polythene use in Kataragama
Munchee, one of Sri Lankas leading FMCG brands, recently commenced a five-day environmental drive in Kataragama.
In line with the Central Environmental Authoritys directive prohibiting the use of polythene in the hallowed precinct of Kataragama during the pilgrimage season, Ceylon Biscuits Limiteds flagship brand Munchee has taken steps to set up booths in three key locations to distribute 15,000 eco-friendly bags sponsored by Munchee Ginger to the pilgrims.
According to recent media reports, sacred sites such as Kataragama faces garbage crisis every year during pilgrimage season due to polythene waste left by hundreds of thousands of visitors.
Government authorities led by the Central Environmental Authority have not only raised awareness regarding the matter, but also have taken stringent measures to curb polythene use during this period.
In conjunction with these drives, Munchee has time and again steered a number of environmental campaigns with the aim of ensuring cleanliness and beauty of the sacred cities, while proactively contributing to the conservation of environment. With the aim of addressing the rapidly growing issue of polythene menace, Munchee implemented the environmental initiative from July 23-27 in Kataragama.
Booths were set up at three strategic locations namely, near the entrance of Kataragama Devalaya, Gam Uda Junction as well as the entrance of Kataragama Kirivehera Temple. At these special booths, pilgrims can obtain an attractive and durable eco-friendly bags provided by Munchee Ginger in exchange of five shopping bags and join the cause to protect the environment.
In addition to the eco-friendly bags, arrangements have been made for serving delicious Munchee Ginger biscuits to the pilgrims arriving from all parts of the country, as well as from across the world.

National Policy on Natural Gas initial draft ready
The Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS) has prepared an initial draft of the National Policy on Natural Gas as the Government moves to commercialize already discovered gas deposits in the Mannar basin through International Competitive Bidding.
This was indicated in the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry Performance Report for the year 2017 tabled in Parliament on July 19.
Sri Lanka has already discovered its own gas depositories in the Mannar basin. It has been revealed that the smaller Dorado reservoir has 300 Billion Cubic Feet of Natural Gas that can fire a 630 MW power plant for about 10 years.
The more complex larger Barracuda discovery exceeds 1.8 Trillion Cubic Feet of Natural Gas that can fire a 2,000 MW power plant for 30 years, the report stated.
It stated the Draft National Policy on Natural Gas prepared by the PRDS in collaboration with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is currently being reviewed by the Ministry together with other stakeholders.
Once it is finished, stakeholder consultation workshops will be organised for further development of the said draft policy.
There is potential for Natural Gas to be used in power, industrial, transportation, household and commerce sectors in Sri Lanka as a fuel or a feedstock, the report observed.
In addition, oil and gas exploration activities are being carried out through foreign investors on multi-client basis.
The PRDS is also in the process of drafting new petroleum regulations and amending the Petroleum Resources Act following the Mannar basin natural gas discoveries.
Such reforms have been initiated to accomplish the primary task of establishing a robust regulatory framework, designed to govern and protect the fiscal and environmental interests of the associated parties while ensuring the continuous maintenance of efficiency and transparency of petroleum operations being carried out, the report added.

NO MERCY FOR RAGGERS
All Police Stations have been informed to take legal action against university students involved in ragging new entrants under the Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act No. 20 of 1998, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.
He said that the law is firm against those who engage in ragging in universities and even the bailing out of a ragging suspect does not come within the jurisdiction of a Magistrate. He added that if convicted, such a criminal would be sentenced to 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment.
Minister Rajapakshe further said that the Anti-Ragging Act which was not fully implemented right along will now be fully brought into force.
The Minister added that the University Grants Commission (UGC), Vice Chancellors of the Universities and other relevant officials have already been instructed to take action against the students who go against the law. Minister Rajapakshe made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the University Grants Commission Auditorium.
Ragging practiced in the universities in Sri Lanka is not found even among the tribal communities in Africa, Minister Rajapakshe said. There are a large number of students leaving the universities due to ragging and there are instances of suicide attempts.
Minister Rajapakshe also said that in some universities, students maintain safe houses outside the universities to torture the new entrants.
The authorities have been instructed to direct those students to psychiatrists for treatment. The UGC has introduced a separate phone number to the under graduates to make complaints on ragging, the Minister revealed.
An Emergency Unit has been set up in the Uva Wellassa University as a pilot project and similar ones would be set up soon in other universities as well.
The Minister pointed out that a bankrupt political party was behind these raggings and they engage in these activities to achieve petty political gains.
University Grants Commission Chairman Professor Mohan de Silva, Deputy Chairman P.S.N.Gunaratne, Peradeniya University Vice Chancellor Professor Upul Dissanayake and Eastern University Competent Authority, Senior Professor Uma Kumaraswamy also participated in the media conference.

President calls for accelerating North, East development
President Maithripala Sirisena while hailing the success of the governments programme to promote reconciliation and co-existence yesterday stressed the importance of expediting development activities in the North and East with an objective of providing dividends to the people.
The President added that the governments drive aiming at promoting reconciliation and coexistence among the people in the North and East has proved successful.
President Sirisena lamented that the people were not well informed about the massive projects launched by the government over the past three and half years for the development of livelihood and infrastructure in the North and East.
The President said that development in the North and East had suffered a setback due to the protracted terrorist conflict and the government is determined to give priority to bring development to these provinces, while uplifting the livelihood of the people.
President Sirisena was speaking at the first meeting of Special Presidential Task Force to direct, expedite and monitor development activities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
This Special Presidential Task Force was appointed by the President in an extraordinary Gazzette Notification published on June 5, 2018. The Task Force chaired by the President consists of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, 15 Cabinet Ministers, Governors, the Chief Ministers of the two provinces together with the Tri Forces Commanders.
The Task Force will review also review the development projects so far launched in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and accelerate the development process. It will also initiate and formulate new plans, programmes and subjects targeting sectors and groups that need priority attention.
A number of projects to be launched in the North and East on priority basis have been identified and they would be implemented soon.
It has been planned to commence the construction of 25,000 out of 50,000 houses for the people in the North and East in August. Construction of another 10,000 houses is to begin in January 2019.
The road network programme covering a length of 1847 kms in these two provinces will get underway soon. The Myliaddy fishing harbour which would greatly benefit the fishing community in the Jaffna Peninsula is also to be developed soon.
The Northern and Eastern Provinces are to be brought under a massive infrastructure development drive with special emphasis on the development of agri, irrigation, economic education and health sectors.
Over 20 projects would be implemented which would help uplift the peoples livelihood in the two provinces. The sugar factory in Ampara, National Paper Mill in Batticaloa, Rice Mill in Batticaloa are also to be revived under this programme thus boosting the economy of these areas.

PUCSL asked to make submission in rights
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has been directed to make its submission before the Supreme Court concerning the fundamental rights petition over the awarding of the Liquified Natural Gas tender to GCL Windforce in Kerawalapitiya.
Authoritative sources told the Daily News that the PUCSL is in receipt of a letter from the Attorney Generals department asking for the regulator to make its submissions before courts on September 19.
The petitioner in his application has declared that the respondent in this case had sought approval of the Cabinet of Ministers without obtaining the approval of PUCSL to grant the impugned tender which is a violation of the Electricity Act.
When the case was taken up before courts last week, the FR petition sought an interim order to prevent the respondents from all further proceedings on the construction of the 300 MW heavy fuel oil/natural gas fired plant at Kerawalapitiya.
It has also come to light that President Maithripala Sirisena had directed the Cabinet during a meeting to delay the final decision of awarding the controversial tender until the Supreme Court verdict was out. He had reportedly made this pronouncement upon considering the recommendations submitted by the National Procurement Commission.

Rajapaksas eluding New York Times debate a sign of guilt: Kiriella
The Rajapaksas did not attend the New York Times debate because they did not have answers, Leader of the House and Public Enterprises and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said. He added medical unions that have no knowledge about trade, were protesting the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA).
The minister expressed those views at a function organised by the Regional Development Bank, to hand over loan certificates to selected entrepreneurs under the Lak Diriya enterprise loan scheme programme. Approximately 324 people were awarded such certificates during the event.
The Lak Diriya programme was designed to bring government banking services closer to the people. According to the concept, small and medium-scale loans coming under the programme, would encourage small and medium-scale entrepreneurs to acquire loans within short periods of time under minimum bail conditions. During the function, which was held in Kandy, beneficiaries were provided with a total sum of Rs. 200 million.
Speaking further, Minister Kiriella said that last week, there was a discussion at Parliament regarding the article that was published in the New York Times, which directly accused the Rajapaksa regime.
No member of the Rajapaksa family attended the debate, he said, adding that if there were any such accusation, they should be able to provide answerswhich they did not.
When I worked as the Highways and Road Development Minister, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) requseted a debate with regard to the ministry, and I replied then and there as we had nothing to hide, Minister Kiriella said, But at 1.00 pm, no one from the Opposition was available at Parliament.
However, the Rajapaksa family did not attend the debate, he said, Why Because if they say said they did not obtain money, those who provided the money would be aggravatedand if they admitted to acquiring the money, they would be proven guilty.
The minister said that certain individuals were attempting to sabotage the countrys progress. Today, people would riot for the smallest of issues. Future investments and the tourism industry would be affected by such actions, he added.
For the longest time, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) had protested against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), and we resolved that issue, the minister said.
Now the association is attempting to debate matters with regard to the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA. What do doctors know about trade Would a Singapore-based doctor who earns around Rs. 4 million a month come to Sri Lanka he questioned; A Singaporean government employee earns approximately Rs. 2 million per year, so why would they come to Sri Lanka They only forward baseless arguments.
Certain parties said that the current government would be toppled by next year. The total number of votes acquired by the Good Governance Government during the last local government elections, were higher than those obtained by other parties. Therefore, toppling the government would be but a dream, he said.

Rationalising education
A confrontation over appointments of Principals and other Grade appointments have become a subject of contention between the Teachers Unions and the Ministry of Education. Fortunately, a strike was averted by the intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena, which however is a temporary stop-gap solution. This is not the only issue in education management.
There are many more and even far more basic problems such as school admissions, shortage of physical and social infrastructure etc. Hence, it is time opportune for a public dialogue on what ails our education system. The trade union dispute is only a symptom of a much more basic problem.
Education is a multi-stakeholder function in the society. A human beings education starts with birth and ends only with death. It is a life-long pursuit. The family, school and society all play significant roles in education. As such it is much more than formal schooling, which is limited to a relatively shorter period of a mans life - 10 to 13 years at the most. This means that the society has a wider responsibility for education and a greater role to play in its development.
Quality education
While it is the task of educationists to decide on content and mode of delivery of education, ordinary citizens could and should be concerned about them. The present writer is no exception. He is also a layman and has only his personal experience as a student, teacher and parent in presenting these comments. However, everybody has an idea what education is and what it should be. Hence, paraphrasing Anatolio Gramsci we could say every man is an educationist while those who call themselves as such are those who specialize in it. Whether an educationist or not, everyone has a role to play in improving education, says Irina Bokova, Director General of UNESCO.
According to UNESCO, a good quality education is one that provides all learners with capabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being.
Democracy contributes to ensuring equity in providing education opportunities to everybody irrespective of social, ethnic or religious differences. On the other hand, education equips citizens with the civic knowledge to manage modern societies with equity and well-being.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other international human rights instruments recognize education as a fundamental human right. They declare that it is the duty of the State to provide education to all. According to the United Nations, governments should spend at least 4 percent of the GDP or 15 percent of its expenditure on education.
Though the private sector has entered the field of education in a big way the responsibility of the state regarding education does not diminish or gets reduced. It is responsible for its content and standards. UNESCO notes that the private sector would be very vital supplementing what the government is doing but they are too expensive for the common man. However, it also notes that since education is incompatible with market competition private education increases inequality.
There have also been various conceptions of the content of education too. From early days education was considered to be the acquisition of knowledge about the three Rs  Reading, (W) riting and (A) rithmetic. Later it was found to be inadequate to produce productive citizens and a wide range of functions was added. Even this limited the scope of education to acquiring knowledge with no emphasis on personality development or the need to produce persons who would be capable of making rational decisions in managing their personal and social lives.
Nowadays too there is a school of thought that education should be oriented towards jobs or employment. This leaves out the valuable aspect of knowledge for knowledges sake. Such an approach often tends to neglect humanities with resultant drawbacks in culture.
It has also been found that such knowledge alone tends to produce conformists rather than creative individuals who could face new challenges in life. Hence creativity has been added to knowledge as a content of education. For example, a strategy report for primary schools in the United Kingdom says: As well as giving them essential tools for learning, primary education is about children experiencing the joy of discovery, solving problems, being creative in writing, art, music, developing self-confidence as learners and maturing socially and emotionally.
Creative and innovative human capital
Swedens national education development plan states that schools shall provide conditions for developing creative schools. In Germany developing creative abilities in children is emphasized. Educational reform in Japan has identified creativity as the most important objective of education for the 21st Century.
Thus developed nations have already taken a step forward in realizing futuristic economic development for it requires a more creative and innovative human capital. However, most developing nations are yet to appreciate the value and necessity of creativity and innovation. It is evident from the paltry sums they spend on Research and Development. As one commentator has noted Asians are consumers of Western products and as a result, they have lost self-identity and self-independence. Therefore, he prescribes creativity and productivity in education as an essential requirement for Asia.
It has to be seen how far distant Sri Lankan education system is from these modern objectives. The latter is an objective necessity in the socio-economic and political context of our time. Hence, those calls that demand a retreat to ancient educational practices are reactionary in nature though some of their positive traits could be assimilated.
Our education system needs change. The present emphasis on rote learning should be replaced by a student-centric system where the emphasis should be to promote original thinking, creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation among learners. Similarly, the present torturous examination system where students are surprised with riddles instead of verifying their knowledge and abilities should be replaced with a student-friendly system. Students as the main stakeholders should also receive democratic representation in taking decision affecting their lives.

Revisiting nuclear weaponfree zones in South Asia
Policy discussion on nuclear issues in South Asia is usually dominated by recommendations relating to nuclear risk reduction and crisis management between India and Pakistan. By contrast, there is inadequate attention to what non-nuclear weapon states in the region could accomplish on nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, and nuclear risk reduction.
This article will argue that as the naval nuclear dynamics in South Asia become increasingly unstable, Sri Lanka should develop a framework to establish a limited NWFZ (nuclear weaponfree zone) based on a combination of political realism, the principle of nonalignment, and participation in regional and global efforts to strengthen international peace and security.
What is a NWFZ
An NWFZ is a regional arrangement in which countries at least partially quarantine themselves from the threat of nuclear weapons, usually by prohibiting the development, stockpiling, and stationing of nuclear weapons. The development of NWFZs has been one of the most significant and successful avenues in global efforts towards nuclear disarmament. The zones are not meant to serve as arms control regimes (like the Non-Proliferation Treaty). Instead, they represent a gradual approach to de-legitimise nuclear weapons at the regional level. Indeed, the first proposal for an NWFZ, known as the Rapaki Plan (after a former Polish foreign minister) was back in 1957, before the emergence of the non-proliferation regime.
Today, there are 114 countries in the world that belong to five major regional NEFZs, including in Latin America and the Caribbean, the South Pacific, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central Asia. A key feature of most NWFZs is that they have been implemented primarily by countries of the Global South. The first regional NWFZ, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, was established in 1969 by states of Latin America and the Caribbean. Establishment of NWFZs has also been a method of self-preservation by non-nuclear weapons states, which lack the protection of nuclear umbrella arrangements like NATO. Consequently, these states seek security assurances from nuclear weapon states (NWS) that nuclear weapons will not be used against or near them.
Challenges to a regional NWFZ
The concept of an NWFZ in South Asia is not a new idea. Countries have proposed such a zone at various times; most notably, Pakistan in 1974, when it supported Resolution 3265B at the United Nations General Assembly. Pakistans support for an NWFZ was based on its apprehension of a further widening of military capabilities vis--vis India, following Indias nuclear testing in 1974.
Given that India and Pakistan have now both joined the group of NWS, however, prospects for a regional agreement on a NWFZ have diminished significantly. An additional challenge is that South Asia lacks a strong regional organisation. In Latin America and South East Asia, the push for NWFZs came from such regional multilateral negotiations at fora such as the Organisation for American States (OAS), and the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN). The subsequent creation of organisations like the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (OPANAL) has further strengthened their regional efforts towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.
Limited and single-state NWFZ options for SL
Sri Lanka was one of the early supporters of NWFZs, arguing as far as back as 1964 that NWFZs should be extended to cover not only land masses but oceans as well. However, given the current impasse on a South Asian NWFZ, Sri Lanka could look to formulate a single-state NWFZ. One obvious starting point would be to study the Mongolian single-state NWFZ, including how Mongolia was able to negotiate the relevant treaty with its NWS neighbours, Russia and China.
Sri Lanka would have to make a number of decisions on the scope of such a treatyincluding whether it would cover areas beyond Sri Lankas territorial watersand the list of prohibitions. In addition, Sri Lanka should consider whether to include strict definitions of terms such as nuclear weapon and delivery systems (the technology and systems used to place a nuclear weapon at the position of detonation, such as ballistic missiles or cruise missiles) or to leave such details open for further negotiation, in view of a potentially broader and more ambitious disarmament agenda.
In order to establish a preliminary, unilateral, and single-state NWFZ that is effective, the terms must be acceptable to China, India and Pakistan, including with respect to their agendas in the Indian Ocean. It is plausible that Delhi would welcome the initiative, albeit with some initial caution, as it would help to alleviate perceived risks stemming from Sri Lankas location on Chinas string of pearls and its associated naval nuclear strategy in the region.
Generating International Support
In addition to minimising the risks of a nuclear accident, a single-state NWFZ could revive Sri Lankas international credibility in upholding its non-aligned and related disarmament principles. It is also an opportunity to strengthen relations with member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by linking the single-state NWFZ with the Southeast Asia NWFZ (Bangkok Treaty). Such an outcome would depend on negotiating a treaty that is tied to the existing verification regimes of the Bangkok Treaty, and which receives broad international recognition, especially from NWS.
Depending on the progress and type of the single-state NWFZ, Sri Lanka could also seek to expand the zone to a broader Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone that includes chemical, biological, and radiological weapons. The most concrete proposal for a WMD Free Zone remains the Middle East WMD Free Zone, which has enjoyed broad support from a number of Arab States.
Finally, it should be noted that efforts towards a single-state NWFZ should be approached with caution, as a single-state initiative could discourage countries from joining regional NWFZs. However, given the absence of any regional framework in the offing, this may be the ideal time for Sri Lanka to step up and lead the conversation on regional nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, by pursuing a single-state NWFZ.

Rift between Rajapaksa brothers leads to Pohottuwa split - Prasanna
Former Southern Provincial Councilor Attorney-at-Law Ajith Prasanna, a staunch supporter of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has withdrawn from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or Pohottuwa complaining that the rift between the Rajapaksa brothers has led to an internal split in the party.
Posting a video on his Facebook page, he said that he would function as an independent member and would expose rogues of the pro-Mahinda camp as well as the Government with evidence through a new platform called Peoples Movement against Corruption. Prasanna said that he faced many insults from within the party after he publicly supported the candidacy of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the next President.
He complained that he was cut off from all the SLPP rallies and meetings, and that he was asked to withdraw his statement where he put forward the name of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
We witnessed the campaign opposed to the election of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the President being carried out from within the party itself. This is a deliberate and organised effort. MPs Kumara Welgama, Dinesh Gunawardena and Wimalaweera Dissanayake have already spoken against Gotabhaya Rajapaksas candidacy, he commented.
He said there are attempts to first nominate former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksas name as the prospective candidate and later switch to former Minister Basil Rajapaksa.
Prasanna alleged that the SLPP is being controlled according to the whims and fancies of Basil Rajapaksa even though Prof.G.L. Peiris is its nominal leader.
Prasanna however said that he would not join with any other political party in the future, but would continue to speak out on behalf of the War Heroes grievances and entitlements.

The Bank had also undertaken a landscaping project at the National Hospital with the aim of increasing the mental wellbeing of patients.
Trees and flora were planted over an acre of land thus revamping the look and feel of the hospital.
This is expected to provide patients with a sense of calm during their time at the hospital.

Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara yesterday pledged to take all possible measures to combat human trafficking.
The deputy minister was speaking before the walk organised by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) to commemorate World Day against Trafficking in Persons. According to the US State Department and the United Nations, Sri Lanka has come to the forefront of countries taking stiff measures to combat human trafficking and strong measures have been taken by the SLBFE to combat human trafficking.
ILO Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Simrin Singh said that trafficking in persons is a big illegal business which generates about US$ 150 billion in profit annually. We want to make sure those who are going out as migrant workers are not exploited because they do not need to be a part of this illegal business, she said.
She said that trafficking is not the same thing as moving from one country to another to look for work. ILO has done a lot of research into how many people are in enforced labour and are trafficked around the world. At least 25 million people and 70 percent of them are girls and women and 25 percent are children under the age of 18. Its a very ugly business, she said.

SLPP has three dragon head theory - Harin
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has no future other than relying upon the Rajapaksas, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said yesterday. Fernando expressed his disappointment over the political sycophancy displayed by the Pohottuwa party towards the Rajapaksa family.
Minister Fernando also criticised former Minister Basil Rajapaksa for saying that they will abolish the anti-corruption special high court when they regain power. How irresponsible are they to say this They are saying that when they come to power, they will abolish these establishments. These high courts have not been established to take revenge.
Minister Fernando said, They have the three dragon head theory when talking about the 2020 Presidential Election. They talk about Basil Rajapaksa, who is one of these dragons. Another dragon is Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and the third is Chamal Rajapaksa. The biggest dragon is hiding behind these three dragon heads. Then there is a talk of another dragon head. But most people do not understand that the real dragon will come out after five years in the form of Namal Rajapaksa.
Minister Fernando was speaking at a press briefing at the UNP headquarters yesterday morning.
These Rajapaksas are scattered everywhere. They are not ready to give up on power. Father, sons, brothers and all possible relatives are in for power, he added.
In contrast, Minister Fernando said the United National Party has always allowed a variety of leaders to head the party and the country according to the need of the hour. This is a party that allowed Premadasa, who represented the common man, to become a President. We let Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to be our Presidential candidate. Then we made Maithripala Sirisena, our political opponent, the President of this country. Our party can make leaders out of ordinary people.
The minister also spoke of the recent trade union actions, which according to him, are political in nature. The public should not have to go through hardships due to these politicised trade union actions, Minister Fernando said.
Voicing his criticism against Government Medical Officers Association President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya, he said that he does not represent the majority of medical professionals. They are not interested in the lack of facilities in their hospitals. They are not interested in the difficulties that doctors who work in rural areas have. They are worried about the Sri Lanka - Singapore trade agreement. It is not as if we are bringing medical practitioners from Singapore, for them to worry about this agreement. In Singapore, the doctors are paid five times more than in Sri Lanka. It is ridiculous to think that Singaporean doctors would want to work here, Minister Fernando said.
The minister also recalled how the GMOA acted when the Suwaseriya ambulance service was introduced to the country. We recently launched the Suwaseriya service in Badulla district. Twenty-six police stations received fully equipped ambulances. When this project was initially introduced, the GMOA said all sorts of things about it. See how successful the project is now.
He urged the trade unions to protest against the government without letting people suffer from their actions. Look at how the Japanese bus drivers recently took to trade union action. They did not hinder the daily life of the public because of their trade union action. They provided their service without charging passengers. This is how one protests if they really want a change and do not want to use the public for a political endgame. I am not saying that it is a good example, but it is better than people suffering.
This is why we need a new political system. I, as a young politician, urge everybody to form a new political system where the public is not manipulated for political agendas. I dont mind leaving my political career if we can achieve a better political culture in this country, the minister said.

South Africas strength is in their first 8-10 overs - Samaraweera
DAMBULLA, Monday  Sri Lankas batting coach and acting head coach Thilan Samaraweera said that South Africas strength lay in their first 8-10 overs of pace which Sri Lanka failed to negotiate and contributed to a five-wicket defeat in the first ODI played at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium on Sunday.
Sri Lanka winning the toss and batting first crashed to 36-5 by the ninth over and although they recovered somewhat to post a total of 193 it was insufficient to stop South Africa from overhauling it in the 32nd over and going one-up in the five-match series.
Sri Lanka coach Thilan Samaraweera disappointed with the batting.
Honestly, I think, it's very poor batting because there was nothing was wrong with the pitch. The wicket looked dry. We lost wickets due to poor batting and poor execution. The first wicket fell to a full toss, but still we recovered well.
We got a partnership close to 100 runs. But in the first 10 overs, we were five down for 36 and it's very hard to win games from there, said Samaraweera at the post match press conference.
Weve talked about the strengths of South Africa and its obvious their strength is in the first 8 to 10 overs. We had to get through that period and after that they have a very inexperienced bowling attack, explained Samaraweera.
But unfortunately they got five wickets. We were thinking of a total of 275 or 280 because we had three spinners to defend that total. But after scoring only 193, we had to attack and we had to get ten wickets to win.
Samaraweera stated that it was the responsibility of the first four batters that if they remain at the wicket till the 30th over to go for a big innings.
The only bright spark of the Sri Lankan batting was the 95-run stand between Kusal Perera and Thisara Perera that saw them reach their final total which at one time didnt seem possible.
It was not until the arrival of Thisara at the crease that the Lankan batting was able to put pressure back on the South African bowlers who until that time had been on top.
Thisara took the bowling by the scruff of its neck to bludgeon his way to 49 off 30 balls before being dismissed.
The good thing is that after his dismissal, he showed a lot of disappointment in the dressing room. He felt that it was the best time for him to get a one-day hundred, said Samaraweera.
In the last six months, Thisara has improved a lot as a batsman. I gave a lot of space to him and he is getting there. We showed him how much he is important to us in the 2019 World Cup. We had a lot of discussions and disagreements as well. Not only me, a lot of credit should be given to Rumesh (Ratnayake) and Chandi (Hathurusingha) who gave him a lot of confidence.
Rumesh changed his approach to the bowling crease. He was very slow in his bowling approach. We can see how fast he is in his bowling run up in the last seven months. He is in the right direction at the moment, he said.
DAMBULLA WAS MORE OF A SOUTH AFRICAN TYPE WICKET - SHAMSI
Left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi who won the man of the match award in the first ODI against Sri Lanka with four wickets for 33 described the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium pitch as one similar to that in South Africa.
To be honest I felt it was more of a South African type wicket, there wasnt much spin because you bowled first. Weve bowled a lot on pitches like this back home. In these conditions on normal Sri Lankan pitches it does help a bit but this was more like a Pretoria or Wanderers wicket, wasnt much spin, said Shamsi.
Shamsi among whose victims included the two main run-getters for Sri Lanka Kusal Perera (81) and Thisara Perera (49) gave credit to his fast bowlers for making the job easy for him.
Our fast bowlers were exceptional upfront Sri Lanka were 36-5. They ran in hard and did the damage earlier. I managed to get the guys that made runs because the fast bowlers made our job a lot easier. Any team thats five down for 36 makes the job easier. Credit to the Sri Lankans to almost get to nearly 200 after a start like that, said Shamsi.
Everytime I play, I try and do my best. Ive been given the freedom by the coach and captain to try and express myself. I am glad that I was able to produce it today (Sunday). Cricket is a funny game you can have a good day, sometimes things might go wrong. On another day my job maybe to contain and hold up one end it depends on whats required of me. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt, thats how the game goes, he said.
The win was South Africas first on the tour after being white-washed 2-0 in the Test series and Shamsi said that it brought a lot of happiness into the change room.
Ever since we landed in Sri Lanka the guys have worked extremely hard yesterday (Saturday) was not different.
We were told to have an easy session because we had a day game but the practice lasted till about 3 or 4 hours, that shows that the guys are really pumped up to try and do well, said Shamsi.
There was no lack of preparation from any side Sri Lanka is also a good team they love to win too. Some days you win, some days you lose. We just keep on doing our work behind the scenes nothing changes whether we win or not. We dont take it easy.

Spare the patients
The GMOA has bared its fangs again. Its members are all set to down their stethoscopes on Friday if the government fails to meet 10 demands put forward by the government doctors. One of the demands relates to the school admission for 89 children of GMOA members. Another relates to failure by the authorities to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance paid to doctors while yet another reason for the planned strike action is the new amendment to the Inland Revenue Act that seeks to increase the taxes on doctors and other professionals. The piece de resistance however is the demand by the doctors that the government scraps the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore as this would gravely impact on the local job market.
From a casual observation of some of the demands, it is clear that none of these are centered on patients welfare. This, from the very members of the GMOA who claimed that the chief reason for their agitation against SAITM was the concern for the patients, who, according to the good doctors, ran the risk of being treated by unqualified personnel passing out from SAITM which adopted below par recruiting standards. The demand for the withdrawal of the amendment to the Inland Revenue Act, which allegedly seeks to levy higher taxes on doctors and other professionals, too, fall into this category.
It is all too well known that most of the GMOA big guns are into lucrative private practice, and thus deserve to be taxed, like all other professionals, if for no other reason than to offset the burden on the ordinary public who are strangulated by disproportionate indirect taxes, an anomaly which the Finance Minister has now rectified, by getting the high-end earners to cough up more of their earnings. After all, weren't not this disproportionate indirect taxes on the public that paid for the free education of the members of the GMOA
One could be inclined to view sympathetically the demand of the government doctors for drawing up a proper policy with regard to the admission of their children to government schools. This is on the basis that government doctors are subject to transfers and this would entail a disruption of the education of their offspring. However, there are practical problems that make this demand untenable. The GMOA has a membership of 18,000 doctors and it is next to impossible to accommodate all their children in government schools even if half this number are yet bachelors. Besides, this could also open the floodgates for other professionals to demand the same facility.
To even a casual observer, it is plain that the GMOA is launched on a political agenda and in a not so subtle way either. The GMOA President, no less, was seen some time ago occupying the front row at a Eliya gathering which was addressed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The selfsame GMOA President was also seen addressing a trade union agitation opposite the Fort Railway Station where he railed against two government ministers and also attacked the courts, for which a contempt case is pending against him.
The demand for the abolishing of the FTA with Singapore, no doubt, is part of this political project. This is more so since the matter has already been thrashed out in parliament and Minister Malik Samarawickrema debunking all the doomsday theories, with telling effect. Earlier, the government doctors raised similar fears over the arrival of the Indian ambulance service and even threatened not to treat patients transported in these ambulances. The Indian ambulance service has today become extremely popular with the public and has spread its wings far and wide in the country. The doctors too have apparently accepted this and there are no reports of any doctor turning away any patient ferried in these ambulances.
The government is not obliged to discuss its trade policies with trade unions who are mere laymen. This description fits the bill even where the doctors are concerned. They are medical professionals and not economists. The GMOA ought not to meddle in matters that are beyond their remit. The government, certainly, will not be in a position to meet all 10 demands put forward by the doctors, before next Friday. The medicos complain that their letter to the President setting out their demands has not received a response.
It appears that the poor patients are in for yet another ordeal, come Friday. The pro-Rajapaksa TV channels, certainly, must be gearing up to bring to their audiences footage of empty, forlorn government hospitals and patients in different poses of agony, with a view to highlight the inefficiency of the government and voice cuts uncomplimentary of the rulers.
Other trade unions too are flexing their muscles, with a 48 hour Railway strike set to commence from midnight yesterday. The tempo is bound to rise, leading up to the Joint Opposition's planned invasion of the Colombo City on September 05.
The government must devise measures to ensure that patients are spared hardship on Friday, when the doctors strike gets underway. No government should allow itself to be held to ransom, be it by doctors or the ordinary riffraff. That should be the bottom line.
