Arahant Sanghamitta Theri and Bhikkuni order
Arahant Sanghamitta Theri, who established the Bhikkuni Order in Sri Lanka has a very special recognition in Sri Lankan history and she has been highly respected for more than 2300 years in our country. Therefore, this poya day is unique to Sri Lanka as it commemorates the arrival of Bhikkuni Sanghamitta, daughter of one of the greatest sons of India, Emperor Asoka.
Her arrival is also of significance to Buddhists all over the world as Bhikkuni Sanghamitta brought a sapling of the Bodhi Tree from Buddha Gaya, where Buddha attained enlightenment after meditating for forty days under this holy tree. The sapling was planted in Mahamevnawa Park in Anuradhapura and today this Bodhi Tree is regarded today as the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world. Thousands of devotees come to Anuradhapura on Unduvap Poya day to pay homage to the sacred Bo tree and observe the five precepts in order to lead exemplary lives.
With Sanghamitta Theri came a contingent which included artisans from 18 trades. They were people skilled in architecture, masonry, jewellery making, irrigation, engineering and other sophisticated arts. They would transform Sri Lanka completely.
Her arrival was well received and Princess Anula was ordained as the 1st Bhikkhuni in Sri Lanka, followed by a thousand women from different ranks of society. Since then, Bhikkhuni Order continued to flourish for many centuries bringing about the wellbeing, status and contribution of women as well as the people in the country.
Disappearance
However, the Community of Bhikkunis eventually disappeared from the soil where it had originated as a result of many factors.
As for the Bhikkunis of the Theravada school, their most important centre was in Sri Lanka. Many details of the early days of the Bhikkuni community are given in our Chronicles. The Bhikkunis benefited from the Royal patronage for many centuries, and also from the material support of women of the aristocracy.
In 5th century AD, Sinhala Bhikkhunis are said to have gone to Nanking in China to start the Bhikkuni order. Bhikkhuni Tisara was the leader and conferred higher ordination upon over 300 Chinese nuns in 434 AD. The bhikkhunis living in Chendu in Sichuan province are convinced that they belong to the same Bhikkhuni order introduced to SL in the 3rd century BC by Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta. Inscriptions also indicate that the Bhikkuni order existed in Sri Lanka as late as the tenth century. There is no evidence that Bhikkunis of the Theravada tradition existed after the 10th Century.
Why did the Community of Bhikkunis disappear by end of 10th century while the Bhikkhu community continued existing To answer the question, we need to consider little deeper some of the reasons for the disappearance of the Bhikkunis community from Sri Lanka.
First of all, we should understand that, even before 10th century, at several stages in the history of Buddhism in this country, the Community of Bhikkunis was weakened because of dissension among the monks.
Garudhammas
Due to the controversies among themselves, Bhikkus began to be divided into different schools (or nikaya) from the first century onwards. Each of these schools had its own Community of Bhikkus and its Community of Bhikkunis. When a school lost its influence or disappeared, the Bhikkunis of that school disappeared too. The eight Garudhammas were said to have been added to allow more acceptance of a monastic order for women, during the Buddha's time. They are controversial because they clearly put women in an inferior position and also because many Buddhists, especially those from the Modern Theravada view, have found evidence that the eight Garudhammas are not really from the teachings of Buddha. The Garudhammas made Bhikkunis dependent on the Community of Bhikkus. The Bhikkus could continue without any Bhikkunis, but the reverse was not possible. Going through the history, it seems that early Buddhism did not programme for an independent existence for the Community of Bhikkunis.
In some periods of history, there were nuns who received higher ordination only from the Community of Bhikkunis and did not receive the second ordination from the Community of Monks. This second ordination, of course, was part of the Garudhammas laid down for Bhikkunis at the very beginning of their Community.
Enthusiasm
Moreover, the Bhikkus who lived in forests (vanavasi) did not seem to manifest any enthusiasm when it came to helping the nuns. It is possible that from the very beginning, they would have thought nuns as an unnecessary element or even a hindrance to an ardent ascetic life.
In periods where the forest dwelling Bhikkus became very influential in the country sometimes even with royal admiration, they would not have recommended or encouraged the existence of the Community of Bhikkunis, nor did they would have advised Kings to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of that Community.
Invasions
But the most important factor for the disappearance of the Community of Bhikkunis, was the political warfare that the country had to face from time to time. Especially detrimental to Buddhism in Sri Lanka were the invasions that frequently came from South India.
At the end of the 10th century CE, the rulers of Sri Lanka were too weak to protect Anuradhapura, which was not only the capital city but also the religious centre of the country. Around 1014, there were serious defeats at the hands of Chola invaders who came from South India. They were anti-Buddhist and destroyed monasteries and other Buddhist sites.
During the period of these foreign occupation, chronicle records make no mention of a community of Bhikkunis.
This situation lasted until King Sanghabodhi Vijayabahu (1056 -1111) freed the country. He re-instituted Buddhist temples and brought back ordained monks from Burma together with some Sinhalese Bhikkus who had gone there during the time of occupation returned and re-established higher ordination in order to revive the Community of Monks.
However, the Chronicles do not say whether he or his successor, Parakramabahu I (11531186), tried to bring Bhikkunis from other countries like Burma in order to re- establish the Community of Bhikkunis. Even if those kings wanted to re-establish the Bhikkuni Community, that they could have done it, as there were no more credible Theravadin Bhikkunis in Burma or anywhere else.

DARK DAYS OF DESPAIR ARE OVER
The presentation of the Vote on Account is an important step in restoring democracy in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Starting the debate on the Vote on Account, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out that the political coup which lasted for fifty days has proven that the power to control public finance fully lies with Parliament and nowhere else.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said that the Vote on Account had to be presented due to the 50 day Constitutional coup.
Everything was in place to present Budget 2019 last November. But, the October 26 Constitutional crisis obstructed it, he said
It was clearly proven by the circumstances that occurred, the management of public finance is with Parliament. One needs a majority in Parliament to form a government, and that Parliament controls public finance. Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas actions and the Supreme Court decision also proved the power reigned by the House.
When someone gets defeated at a No Confidence Motion vote, they should walk away, Wickremesinghe said.
PM Wickremesinghe said that he has instructed the Home Affairs Ministry and Finance Minister to encourage the District and Divisional Secretaries to resume the Gamperaliya programme, which was suspended during the political crisis by next week.
The Prime Minister also pointed out that if political stability was not restored, the government servants would have been deprived of their salaries by January 1, 2019.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe condemned the conduct of some press and media stations which he referred to as Black Media.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that a debate on these Black Media will be held in January in the House. The names of these Black Media will be listed out from top to bottom. I hope the media will give us a live coverage for this debate. Remember, two can play this game, the Prime Minister said.
Wickremesinghe also said that legal action could be taken against some of the press and media stations that have carried wrong details on the proposed names by the Prime Minister for the Cabinet.
Some press reports said that I proposed MP Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysas name for the Cabinet. But, I did not. These media stations better get their cheque books ready to pay penalties for such irresponsible reporting. Are you going to correct this story Are you going to broadcast my speech today he questioned.

Today is Unduvap Poya:
Gender Equality in Buddhism: Institution of Bikkhuni Order
Arrival of Sangamitta Theri
In the 2562nd year since the passing away of the Buddha, the Full Moon Poya of Unduvap falls today, the 22nd of December as the day for observance of traditional eight or ten precepts.
Unduvap Poya is of special significance because Sangamitta Theris arrival in the island bringing with her a Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi sapling. The daughter of Emperor Dharmasoka, instituted Bhikkhuni Sasana in the island. She was accompanied by Brahmins, Arahat Bhikkhunis, Kshatriya family members and ministers in King Dharmasoka. The two kings Devanampiyatissa and Dharmasoka, were long time friends though they had never met each other.
On Poson Full Moon Day, the Arahat Mahinda Thera brother of Sangamitta arrived in the island of Sri Lanka and established the Buddhism and founded the Sangha Sasana. This prompted an urge from the women-folk to enter the order. Queen Anula was foremost in this regard, with a large number of followers she gained intellectual attainments and pleaded Arahant to grant them ordination. As Mahinda Thera was not supposed to offer ordination to females in accordance with the Vinaya rules, hence, Mahinda thera appealed to the Emperor to request his daughter Sangamitta to come over accepting the assignment.
Sri Maha Bodhi sapling
Sangamitta Theri and her entourage left from the port of Tamralipti, the ship arriving at the port of Jambukola patuna in seven days for The King Devanampiyatissa to receive the party and the sapling with great honour. The Bo sapling which was in a golden casket and rituals were performed before it was brought to Anuradhapura.The sapling was planted with a magnificent ceremony in the Maha Megha Garden where it lasts for over 23 centuries receiving the adoration of millions of followers. Arahat Sangamitta their passed away while residing at an Upasikaramaya in Anuradhapura at the age of 79, for King Utthiya to perform last rites in close proximity to Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi.
Buddha treated women with kindness and civility and pointed out to them too, the path to harmony, purity and blessedness. Buddhism makes no distinction on gender in all matters. Women from all walks of life accepted the teachings and joined the order, Sangamitta theri did all in her power to raise female followers to higher levels of life. She worked with untiring devotion and fearless bravery for the moral, rational and pious upliftment of the womenfolk. The Chola invasion of Sri Lanka in the 11th century caused severe damage and destruction to monasteries which resulted in the disappearance of both the Sasanas from the island. some Sinhala monks took refuge in Burma and brought back assisted by King Vijayabahu and restored the Bhikkhu order. The Bikkhuni sasana was revived on 8th December, 1996 at the Mulagandhakuti premises, in Uttar Predesh, India when seven Dasa Sil Mathas from Sri Lanka were ordained as bikkunis, following the Cholian invaders destroyed it from the islands soils. Bhikkhuni order that was established by Sangamitta lasted for over a 10 centuries.
Discrimination of Women
In ancient India women were treated as being inferior to men. There had been times they were measured on the same level as the so-called lowest of the four castes. Their liberty was extremely restricted under the view that they had to be below and under the guard of husbands. Therefore, it was thought that they do not deserve any freedom. The main role of women was considered to be that of housewives, attending to house chores as per the wishes of the husband.
Buddhism does not believe women as being inferior to men, but consider men and women to be equally useful to the society. The Buddha emphasised the productive role the women can occupy and should play as a wife. Buddhism encourage both husbands and wives to share equal responsibility and discharge their obligations with equal commitment. The husband is always cautioned to consider the wife a companion, a friend, and an equal in partnership, wife was anticipated to acquaint herself with the business or industries owned by the family, so that she could manage such affairs in husbands absence. In a Buddhist society the wife occupied an equal place with the husband.
The liberal approach towards women in Sri Lanka is due a movement that has sustained from the distant past under Buddhist authority. The place of women in many countries like Myanmar and Thailand has been as favourable as here in Sri Lanka. The life of a woman was so miserable; had the disaster of being a co-wife which invariably led to conflicts and jealousies, which were a frequent feature in Indian society. A widow was not allowed to remarry, but had to commit suicide [sathi puuja] by leaping into dead husbands funeral pyre. In some primitive territories in Africa, India, and America wives were looked upon as the private property of their husbands, encouraged the custom of sacrificing, slaying or even burying women alive to go with their departed husbands taking their belongings too. They did not have educational choice; even religious freedom was restricted. So much so the birth of a female baby was considered as a sign of bad luck in a family, it happened that when King Pasenadi of Kosala was informed that his queen gave birth to a daughter he came to the Buddha and lamented. The Buddha had to pacify him saying that good daughters are as good as good sons. Buddha said:
A female child, O Lord of men, may prove even a better offspring than a male. ,'  Buddha in Samyutta Nikaya
For she may grow up wise and virtuous her husband's mother reverencing, true wife, the boy that she may bear may do great deeds, and rule great realms, yes, such a son of noble wife becomes his country's guide
Buddha permitted women to demonstrate themselves and to prove that they too had the capability like men to attain the uppermost position in the spiritual way of life by attaining Arahanthood.
Women must be grateful to the Buddha for allowing them to practice the real religious way, and for giving such freedom for the first time in planets history.
Buddha Recognised Womens Capabilities
Today it is common for many religious institutions to claim that they give equal rights to women. Look at the world around to see the place of women in societies. It seems that they are discriminated in various fields, they have no property rights and generally undergo abuse in many subtle forms. Even in the western world, women seeking the right to vote through organized protest had to fight very hard for their rights. According to Buddhism, it is not permissible to regard women as inferior. Buddha recognised their capabilities and capacities, and gave them responsible places in the Bhikkhuni Sangha. The Buddhist texts are full of eminent Bhikkhunis, who were very erudite and who were authorities in sermonising the Dhamma like in Khema, Dhammadinna and Uppalavanna to mention a few.
Those interested could refer to Theri-gatha which contains so many stanzas that clearly articulate the feelings of happiness experienced by pious bhikkhunis at their skill to realize the Truth. The Buddha was born as a woman on many of his previous births in Samsara and even as a woman he developed the noble character and wisdom in his path gaining enlightenment. Buddhism created a conflict against superstitions and Brahmin doctrine rejecting the caste formation, and all forms of animal and human sacrifice. The fundamental theory of Dhamma is realisation by ones own effort. Gender difference has no place in it. Dhamma emphasizes the spiritual equality both male and women.
May all beings be happy!

Hakeem seeks young rapport
Town Planning Water Supply and Higher Education Minister Rauff Hakeem said he will build a rapport with the youth to address the issues of the higher education sector.
The Minister was addressing the gathering at the Higher Education Ministry yesterday after he assumed duties.
Minister Hakeem said the outcome of the recent political turmoil can be considered as a victory for democracy.
He said everyone should keep in mind that political posts are temporary. He said a few elections will be held next year.
But it is doubtful which election comes first. A few persons decide which election to be held first.
These persons should not exercise political agendas when calling an election. They should think of the future of the country when they decide to hold an election, he said.
He said he believed that all these political issues could be resolved if the President called for a Presidential Election after January 8. A general election will be held next September. Struggles for power may arise after the next general election also, it is sad, he said.
He said he will intervene to resolve those political struggles after the next election.
The Minister said that the country has an educated younger generation and it is a credit. The higher Education sector should be reformed. We have to design our university system to make our degrees livelihood oriented, he said.
He said he cannot do much in a short period but he would take every possible measure to set up a hassle free environment for higher education. We do not have high expectations but we will do our best, the Minister said.

Hettipola waste water contaminates Minipe Yoda Ela
The release of waste water from the Hettipola town and several other areas to the Minipe Yoda Ela would have serious repercussions in near future, Matale District Agriculture Committee Officers said.
They revealed the situation at the Matale District Agriculture Committee meeting. Thousands of families from Hettipola to Polonnaruwa and Mahiyanganaya use Yoda Ela for their daily activities. They use water from the Oya to drink and cultivate.
Residents in the areas pointed out that many hotels were set up in these areas and they release contaminated water. Tourist hotels were built up in Laggala, Bakamuna, and Elahera among others and many of them do not release waste water properly.
The Yoda Ela runs over 35 km from Hettipola to Polonnaruwa. Ancient kings had built it to provide pure water of the Knuckles Mountain range to the villages in the dry zones.
They said that if the issue was unattended, it would pose a serious health hazards before long.
They urge the authorities to direct those errant businesspersons to fix waste management systems to their business locations rather than polluting the environment.

The incident that forced ICC to implement fielding restrictions
The game of cricket has changed drastically in the last three decades or so, all the three aspects of the game batting, bowling and fielding have gone through various changes and advancements.
The shorter versions of cricket have however gained massive popularity since the advent of ODIs in the early 1970s. As the game progressed, the rules were ought to be altered and revised in order to make the contest between the bat and the ball fair and equal.
The limited overs formats have been more batsmen friendly due to a variety of reasons, the fielding restrictions being one of the most important factors in this context. As per the current rules, only two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle in the initial 10 overs of the innings, which gives the batsmen an extra advantage to score freely in this course of the game.
However, when the one-day format of the game was devised in the year 1971, there were no fielding restrictions which would be implemented during the match, a team could field with all the 10 fielders outside the 30-yard circle, which was highly unlikely though.
The rules demanded a change when the cricketing world witnessed a weird incident which gained slender praise and huge criticism for the English cricket team.
The strange incident took place during the second match of the Benson & Hedges World series in the year 1979, the triangular series featured the three superpowers of the cricketing world namely West Indies, Australia and England.
England suffered a defeat in the first game of the series against the host Australia and had to win the second game against the West Indies to stay alive in the series.
The West Indies skipper Clive Lloyd won the toss and elected to field first in the Day night game. The English openers stitched a beautiful partnership of 79 runs for the first wicket and gave a solid platform to the star-studded batting line-up to put up a decent total on the scoreboard. However, the phenomenal bowling efforts of Garner and Parry restricted the English side to a total of merely 211 in the allotted quota of 50 overs.
As a result of a rain-break in the game, West Indies were given a revised target of 199 runs in 47 overs. After a decent start, the Caribbean team lost quick wickets and the game shifted towards England. West Indies needed 10 runs to win the game in the last over which was to be bowled by the legendary all-rounder Sir Ian Botham.
The chasing team scored 7 runs off the first 5 balls of Bothams over and needed 3 more runs on the final ball to win the game.
The English skipper Mike Brearley sent all his fielders to guard the boundary including the wicket-keeper David Bairstow for the last ball. The tail-ender Colin Croft was left with no choice other than to clear the boundary, in the attempt to accomplish the same he was bowled by Botham.
This act by the English skipper gained immense criticism from every corner of the world and after this incident, the Australian domestic cricket introduced fielding restrictions in the limited overs format which was later adopted in the ODIs in 1992.- sk

With Kirsten unavailable, Raman named Indian womens coach
New Delhi, Friday: Former India batsman W.V. Raman has been appointed head coach of the womens cricket team, days after an acrimonious row over a star players omission from the Twenty20 World Cup.
Former South African cricketer Gary Kirsten was the top choice but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said he was ineligible due to an ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) contract.
Raman, who played 11 Tests, replaces Ramesh Powar whose term ended abruptly last month after Indian star Mithali Raj accused him of bias and trying to destroy her career.
Powar in turn accused Raj of trying to blackmail officials.
The row erupted after Raj, the highest run scorer in the womens international game, was left out of the team for the semi-final against England in the recent Twenty20 World Cup. The Indians lost the game by eight wickets.
India are currently third in the womens world ODI rankings and fifth in the T20s.
The 53-year-old Raman, who will be the fourth coach of the womens team in 20 months, welcomed his appointment.
Thanks you all folks, for the wishes and your kind words. Means a lot, he tweeted.
Kirsten, who led the India mens team to success at the 2011 World Cup, is head coach of IPL side Royal Challengers Bangalore.AFP

The mastery of pride
Few of us are free from Pride in one form or another. We know that in the interests of spiritual development it must be killed out. We are taught as much, and accept the teaching without question. But the method by which Pride may be eliminated is a problem not easy to solve, and the indirect, sweeping precepts of the sages are of little practical help to us. It is all very well saying: "Kill out this, and kill out that," but what we want to know is, how may we go about it
In the first place: what is Pride
Let us call analogy to our aid. Regard pride as a weed, propagating itself with alarming fecundity in the garden of the mind. Its root is not visible, but the flowering shoots are in plain view. Cut down these shoots and either they grow again or the roots puts out new ones. The only way to destroy it is to dig it up altogether. That root is Self-Esteem. From it grow the roots of Conceit, Boastfulness, Ambition, Jealousy, Envy and Intolerance.
Equally developed
There are others, but let us take these six manifestations for the sake of discussions. Unbiased, detached self-scrutiny will disclose what others may exist in one's own character, and it is unlikely that all will be found equally developed. There is cause for alarm when we discover them in ourselves. Pride is invariably despised when observed in others, yet we sometimes boast of possessing it. "I have my pride, you know," is a common assertion.
Beneath every manifestation of Pride, lies Self-Esteem. It is the conviction of superiority over others  the feeling that we are what they are not, or that we can do what they cannot do. Successes in early childhood may sow the seeds of it. The praise of relatives fosters it. Once planted, it grows, and not even the flattening criticism by one's own contemporaries in adolescence can stop it. By and by it becomes a habit to compare oneself with the people one meets or passes in the street, generally to their disadvantage.
What we know of our own accomplishments is measured by what we presume they lack. We think we know our friends inside and out, and our judgments are based on a firm belief in the infallibility of our perception. There is a tendency to group those who are not obviously outstanding under the heading of "Ordinary People," and sometimes to place them in the inferior category for no more reason than that they look as if they belong there.
How often we hear the remark: "He seems so ordinary, but when you get to know him there's a lot in him!" We are surprised to see our spot judgment wrong  that there really is something in that very ordinary-looking person. Can we honestly claim to be free of this habit of automatically comparing others with our own ideas of ourselves If so, then Self-Esteem is not present.
Self-Esteem
It would be bad enough if Pride flourished in no more then Self-Esteem, but it must manifest itself in every way it can. It strives to show on the surface, which is perhaps just as well, for then it becomes obvious. Conceit, first shoot of the weed Pride, is Self-Esteem manifesting in visible form. Not content with merely feeling superior to the people around us, we show it in our bearing.- The Sangha, The Journal of the English Sangha Association, V.1

Wants to ensure contesting officials are free of corruption :
New Sports Minister seeks postponement of SLC elections
Newly appointed Sports Minister Harin Fernando is seeking a postponement of the election of office-bearers to Sri Lanka Cricket and seek more time from the International Cricket Council which has already given Sri Lanka a deadline of February 9.
The SLC elections are scheduled to be held on February 7. The Minister wants the elections to be held after the ICC has set up the proposed Anti-Corruption Unit in Sri Lanka. He said that he wants to ensure that the officials coming forward to contest the elections are clean.
The Minister further said that he will meet with ICC officials in the coming weeks to discuss the matter further.
Speaking further at a media conference held at the Duncan White Foundation Sports Ministry hall yesterday, Minister Fernando said that in future athletes will not have to pay for using the ground owned by his ministry for training.
I have to take a few decisions to promote sports and from today onwards athletes will not have to pay for using the ministry owned ground while students and forces personnel are free to watch any National level tournaments in Sri Lanka in their uniforms, the Minister stated.
He said that athletes should also be free to discuss their problems with sports officials who will be held responsible.
I have to look after more than 60 sports. I think that during the recent past several sports ministers assumed duties only for a short period and that made it difficult for everyone. Next year we have the cricket World Cup, netball World Cup and Asia Athletic championships, he noted.
An old boy of St. Josephs College, Maradana, Minister Fernando is an avid follower of rugby, having represented the college 1st XV. He has been instrumental in uplifting the quality of sport at Darley Road.
He has a fresh challenge ahead of him in his capacity as the Minister of Sports having already served as the Minister of Telecommunications, Digital Infrastructure & Foreign Employment in his previous tenure. Meanwhile Manusha Nanayakkara is tipped to become the deputy sports minister.

Alleged assassination plot:
No evidence to link Fonseka -IGP informs Speaker
Based on a request made by United National Party (UNP) MP Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka on November 9, requesting Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to inquire from IGP Pujith Jayasundara if there is any evidence to prove that he was involved in the plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena, the IGP had informed the Speaker that there is no evidence to link Fonseka to the alleged plot to assassinate the President,Fonseka said in Parliament yesterday.
Fonseka making a statement said he had requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to inquire from the IGP as a matter of his privileges.
Subsequent to my request, the Speaker had taken prompt action to inquire from the IGP if there was any evidence to link me with the alleged assassination plot. In response, the IGP had responded to the Speakers request. In his response, he has also attached a report obtained from the Senior DIG of the CID Ravi Seneviratne, Fonseka noted.
He also read out the letter from the IGP along with the report received from the CID to the House and tabled them.
Senior DIG Seneviratne had notified the IGP that there is no complaint against me and they havent found any evidence during their investigations to suggest that I had an involvement with the assassination plot.
Therefore, he said that it is very clear that he had no involvement with the alleged assassination attempt. However, there is this mad man called Namal Kumara and he is continuously issuing statements implicating me. Certain media stations give publicity to such statements. I request the Speaker to advice such media institutions to refrain from publicity to such false news as it is a violation of our privileges, Fonseka added.

Opening the door of wisdom
That the Bo tree sapling was brought to Sri Lanka from India by Arahant nun Sanghamitta is common knowledge. Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, as famously known, is a sacred fig tree in Anuradhapura said to be a sapling from the historical Bodhi tree under which the Buddha achieved enlightenment. The sapling belongs to the southern branch of the original Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya. Planted in 288 BC, the Bo tree is the most ancient human-planted tree with a traceable date. King Devanampiyatissa planted the sapling in Mahameghavana Park, Anuradhapura, in 249 BC.
The bo tree is planted on 6.5m (21.3ft) high terrace on the ground and is surrounded by railings. Much revered by the Buddhists both Sri Lankan and across the globe, the tree was surrounded by a wall built during King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghes period. It was a barrier for wild elephants.
Sanghamitta links two important personalities: Emperor Asoka being her father and Arahant Mahinda being her brother. Emperor Ashoka was hesitant a little at first to send his daughter on this overseas mission, yet finally gave in as the intention was bona fide. Arahant Sanghamitta was accompanied by a number of Buddhist nuns as a result of Sinhala royal ladies requested Buddhist nun order be set up in Sri Lanka.
Reproduced below is the Mahawamsa account on the arrival of the Bo Tree.
When the lord of chariots had appointed to watch over the Bodhi-tree eighteen persons from royal families and eight from families of ministers, and moreover eight persons from brahman families and eight from families of traders and persons from the cowherds likewise, and from the hyena and sparrowhawk-clans, (from each one man), and also from the weavers and potters and from all the handicrafts, from the nagas and the yakkhas; when then the most exalted prince had given them eight vessels of gold and eight of silver, and had brought the great Bodhi-tree to a ship on the Ganges, and likewise the theri Samghamitta with eleven bhikkhunis, and when he had caused those among whom Arittha was first to embark on that same ship, he fared forth from the city, and passing over the Vijh-mountains the prince arrived, in just one week, at Tamalitti.
The gods also and the nagas and men who were worshipping the great Bodhi-tree with the most splendid offerings, arrived in just one week. The ruler of the earth, who had caused the great Bodhi-tree to be placed on the shore of the great ocean, worshipped it once more by (bestowing upon it) the great kingship.
When the wish-fulfiller had consecrated the great Bodhi tree as a great monarch, he then, on the first day of the bright half of the month Maggasira, commanded that the same noble persons, eight of each (of the families) appointed at the foot of the great sla-tree to escort the great Bodhi-tree, should raise up the great Bodhi tree; and, descending there into the water till it reached his neck, he caused it to be set down in seemly wise on the ship. When he had brought the great theri with the (other) theris on to the ship he spoke these words to the chief minister Maharittha: Three times have I worshipped the great Bodhi-tree by (bestowing) kingship (upon it). Even so shall the king my friend also worship it by (bestowing) kingship (upon it). When the great king had spoken thus he stood with folded hands on the shore, and as he gazed after the vanishing great Bodhi-tree he shed tears. Sending forth a net like rays of sunshine the great Bodhi-tree of the (Buddha) gifted with the ten powers departs, alas! from hence!
Filled with sorrow at parting from the great Bodhi-tree Dhammasoka returned weeping and lamenting to his capital. The ship, laden with the great Bodhi-tree, fared forth into the sea. A yojana around the waves of the great ocean were stilled. Lotus-flowers of the five colours blossomed all around and manifold instruments of music resounded in the air. By many devatas many offerings were provided, and the nagas practised their magic to win the great Bodhi-tree. The great theri Samghamitta, who had reached the last goal of supernormal powers, taking the form of a griffin terrified the great snakes. Terrified, the great snakes betook them to the great theri with entreaties, and when they had escorted the great Bodhi-tree from thence to the realm of the serpents and had worshipped it for a week by (bestowing on it) the kingship of the nagas and by manifold offerings they brought it again and set it upon the ship. And on that same day the great Bodhi-tree arrived here at Jambukola.
King Devanampiyatissa, thoughtful for the welfare of the world, having heard before from the samanera Sumana of its arrival, did, from the first day of the month Maggasira onwards, being always full of zeal, cause the whole of the highroad from the north gate even to Jambukola to be made ready, awaiting the arrival of the great Bodhi-tree, and abiding on the sea-shore, in the place where the Samuddapannasl (afterwards) was, he, by the wondrous power of the theri, saw the great Bodhi-tree coming. The hall that was built upon that spot to make known this miracle was known here by the name Samuddapannasala.
By the power of the great thera and together with the (other) theras the king came, with his retinue, on that same day to Jambukola. Then, uttering an exulting cry moved by joyous agitation at the coming of the great Bodhi-tree, he, the splendid (king), descended even neck-deep into the water; and when together with sixteen persons (of noble families) he had taken the great Bodhi-tree upon his head, had lifted it down upon the shore and caused it to be set in a beautiful pavilion, the king of Lanka worshipped it by (bestowing on it) the kingship of Lanka. When he had then entrusted his own government to the sixteen persons and he himself had taken the duties of a doorkeeper, the lord of men forthwith commanded solemn ceremonies of many kinds to be carried out for three days. On the tenth day he placed the great Bodhi-tree upon a beautiful car and he, the king of men, accompanying this, the king of trees, he who had knowledge of the (right) places caused it to be placed on the spot where the Eastern Monastery (afterwards) was and commanded a morning meal for the people together with the brotherhood. Here the great thera Mahinda related fully to the king the subduing of the ngas which had been achieved by the (Buddha) gifted with the ten powers. When the monarch heard this from the thera he caused monuments to be raised here and there in such places as had been frequented by the Master by resting there or in other ways. And, moreover, when he had caused the great Bodhi-tree to be set down at the entrance to the village of the brahman Tivakka and in this and that place besides, he, (escorting it) on the road, sprinkled with white sand, bestrewn with various flowers, and adorned with planted pennons and festoons of blossoms, bringing thereto offerings unweariedly, day and night, brought the great Bodhi-tree on the fourteenth day to the neighbourhood of the city of Anurdhapura, and after, at the time when the shadows increase, he had entered the city worthily adorned by the north gate amid offerings, and (when he then), leaving the city again by the south gate, had entered the Mahmeghavanrma consecrated by four Buddhas, and here had brought (the tree) to the spot worthily prepared by Sumanas command, to the lovely place where the former Bodhi-trees had stood, he, with those sixteen noble persons, who were wearing royal ornaments, lifted down the great Bodhi-tree and loosed his hold to set it down.
Hardly had he let it leave his hands but it rose up eighty cubits into the air, and floating thus it sent forth glorious rays of six colours. Spreading over the island, reaching to the Brahma-world, these lovely rays lasted till sunset. Ten thousand persons, who were filled with faith by reason of this miracle, gaining the spiritual insight and attaining to arahantship, received here the pabbajja.
When the great Bodhi-tree at sunset was come down from (its place in the air) it stood firm on the earth under the constellation Rohini. Then did the earth quake. The roots growing over the brim of the vase struck down into the earth, closing in the vase. When the great Bodhi-tree had taken its place all the people who had come together from (the country) round, worshipped it with offerings of perfumes, flowers and so forth. A tremendous cloud poured forth rain, and cool and dense mists from the snow-region surrounded the great Bodhi-tree on every side. Seven days did the great Bodhi-tree abide there, awaking faith among the people invisible in the region of the snow. At the end of the week all the clouds vanished and the great Bodhi-tree became visible and the rays of six colours. The great thera Mahinda and the bhikkhuni Samghamitta went thither with their following and the king also with his following. The nobles of Kajaragama and the nobles of Candanagama and the Brabman Tivakka and the people too who dwelt in the island came thither also by the power of the gods, (with minds) eagerly set upon a festival of the great Bodhi-tree. Amid this great assembly, plunged into amazement by this miracle, there grew out of the east branch, even as they gazed, a faultless fruit.
This having fallen off the thera took it up and gave it to the king to plant. In a golden vase filled with earth mingled with perfumes, placed on the spot where the Mahsana (afterwards) was, the ruler planted it. And while they all yet gazed, there grew, springing from it, eight shoots; and they stood there, young Bodhi-trees four cubits high.
The great theri Samghamitta, who longed for a quiet dwelling-place, because of the too great crowding of the vihara where she dwelt, she who was mindful for the progress of the doctrine and the good of the bhikkhunis, the wise one who desired another abode for the bhikkhunis went (once) to the fair cetiya-house, pleasant by its remoteness, and there she the skilled (in choice) of dwelling-places, the blameless, stayed the day through. When the king came to the convent for bhikkhunis to salute the theri, he, hearing that she had gone thither, went also and when he had greeted her there and talked with her and had heard the wish that was the cause of her going thither, then did he, who was skilled in (perceiving) the desires (of others), the wise, the great monarch Devnampiya-tissa, order to be erected a pleasing convent for the bhikkhunis round about the thpa-house. Since the convent for the bhikkhunis was built near to the elephant-post therefore was it known by the name Hatthlhaka-vihra.
The well-beloved, the great theri Samghamitta of lofty wisdom now took up her abode in this pleasing convent for bhikkhunis. Bringing about in such wise the good of the dwellers in Lak, the progress of the doctrine, the king of trees, the great Bodhi-tree, lasted long time on the island of Lanka, in the pleasant Mahamegha-grove, endowed with many wondrous powers. Here ends the nineteenth chapter, called The Coming of the Bodhi-tree, in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion of the pious.

Parliament
Supreme Court competent to look into war crimes:Bimal
The Supreme Court, with the recent ruling against the decision to dissolve Parliament, has proven that there is no necessity for establishing an International Court to look into alleged war crimes committed by the Armed Forces during the war time in Sri Lanka, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake yesterday said. By staying firm against a decision by the Executive Presidency in the country, the Supreme Court has proven that it is perfectly capable of probing into the alleged war crimes and do justice for people, Rathnayake pointed out.
By the recent ruling given by the Supreme Court, we have got out of an international trap. The SC has proven that it has the capacity, independence and moral right to probe these alleged war crimes without the intervention of an International Court, Rathnayake further said.
Rathnayake also requested the Speaker to see that the Supreme Court decision against the dissolution of Parliament made available in Sinhala and Tamil languages. People are now interested in knowing about the Constitution. They would wish to read the SC ruling as well. The decision is only available in English. Rathnayake said.
Rathnayake observed that economic experts should accurately calculate the losses incurred by the country due to the recent political coup. Just like Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying to justify whatever he does with the victory in the war, now the UNP is trying to justify everything using the political coup. We should not allow that, he added.
Meanwhile, Rathnayake said that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna refrained from supporting in favour of the Vote on Account presented by the government, as it had taken the form of a mini-budget that contains financial allocations for all projects supported by the UNP. If the Vote on Account only includes salary payments and other such necessities, we would have supported it, but it is not the case anymore, he observed.
The JVP does not approve of the restarting of the same old projects initiated by the UNP, Rathnayake pointed out. We have never voted in favour of any of the Budgets presented by the UNP, but Mahinda Rajapaksa did so, he pointed out.
Rathnayake said that the Vote on Account is a result of the recent political coup initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena, together with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said that the country had to undergo an economic crisis due to this move.
Rathnayake also criticized Rajapaksa, his supporters and some media stations who were supportive of Rajapaksa for developing false theories on the suspension of Standing Orders. When they were unable to get their personal political aspirations, they make up false views on suspending the Standing Orders. Even today, we have suspended the SO. Mahinda Rajapaksa and his henchmen were here. Did they question him about suspending the SO Rathnayake questioned.
Rathnayake also said that both the UNP and the UPFA governments should be responsible for the poor living conditions of the people. Referring to a recent report, Rathnayake said the level of indebtedness among the people have increased. In Urban areas, indebtedness is around 41.7%, in the rural areas it is 61% and among theplantation community it is 73%. All former governments should be responsible for this predicament, Rathnayake pointed out.
MR warns government not to be 100% certain of being in power
We as politicians have no excuse if we are unable to reduce the cost of living, Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said. While pointing out that there are families who take only one meal per day, Rajapaksa urged that prices of essential items be decreased.
Rajapaksa also pointed out that a government does not need to follow every instruction issued by the International Monetary Fund. He said that it is important for the present government to maintain a people-friendly economic policy. Rajapaksa accused that fuel prices were not reduced until he, as the then Prime Minister, took a decision to decrease fuel prices and remove the VAT.
Meanwhile, speaking of the recent tense political situation, Rajapaksa denied that there was a Constitutional coup in the country. Rajapaksa also told the government not to be 100% certain about being in power, as the people would rise against its economic policy which is not a people-friendly one.
Rajapaksa also said that he will analyze the presented Vote on Account and express his point of view soon.
JVP criticises attempt to form National Government
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament criticized the attempt to form a National Government between the UNF and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) in order to increase the number of ministries to 35.
He also questioned under what Constitutional provisions Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sent a list of 35 ministers to the President when the 19th Amendment clearly restricts the number of ministries to 30.
The SLMC has only one member. Other SLMC MPs represent the UNF. Premier Wickremesinghe is trying to interpret the Constitution in a way advantageous to him by using its loopholes. This is what President Maithripala Sirisena also did. Premier Wickremesinghe, who appeared as the guardian of democracy over the past two months, has also violated the Constitution, he remarked.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that legal advice of the Attorney General has been sought in that regard. MP Dissanayake replied that it was the same AG who argued in the Court a few days ago that the Presidents dissolution of Parliament was legal.
Countrys problem due to national leaders trying to ensure political future: Hakeem
Commending the Finance Minister for coming up with a vote on account within a very short span of time to cover the Governments expenses for the next few months, MP Rauf Hakeem said having endured 50 days of unnecessary crisis created by the unconstitutional actions of the important officer bearers of the institutions of this country, the Government has been pushed into a situation of having to come up with a vote on account to cover all such follies.
In this situation, we need to position ourselves in order to move away from foreign borrowings as far as possible in the long term, by attracting non-debt creating foreign exchange inflows through exporting of goods and services and foreign direct investments by adopting a national policy which would be conducive in achieving a sustainable current account deficit or a current account surplus in the balance of payments of this country. This challenge is not easy challenge for the Finance Minister, he said, adding that the Finance Minister has ample political experience to present a challenging budget for the next year, as it is an election year.
He noted that everyone expects a sunshine budget, but he is sure the Finance Minister will pull out a few rabbits out of his hat. He can be a magician and we are all awaiting to see how many rabbits he could pull out of his hat.
Hakeem added that the problem facing the country today is that all three national leaders are all trying to ensure their own political future. Mahinda Rajapaksa wants the Executive Presidency abolished, because he cannot contest again. Ranil Wickremesinghe is not a national leader who would engage in an irrational political campaign. He is a very rational leader and wont go on this sentimental, emotional nationalistic bandwagons and then get into power. Due to that reason, he has paid a heavy price and at the national elections he had pushed others to the fore and had been in the driving seat getting them to win elections. First, he failed with Sarath Fonseka and then though he succeeded in bringing the President to power, due to the recent happenings, that too had turned into a failure. He too has this problem and perhaps he too has this desire to abolish the presidential system. President Maithripala Sirisena is in another dilemma. He started off saying that he will not contest for the second term, but halfway through he entertained ideas of contesting again. First he thought the UNP will accommodate him again and subsequently, he fell onto the lap of Mahinda Rajapaksa and perhaps expected him to nominate him for Presidential candidacy.
The Constitution could not be considered in order to ensure the future of single politicians, however nationalistic they may be, said Hakeem. We need to have a broad look at it.
This is a sacred document and you need to have an overall constitutional reform. Thats the challenge we have. Amidst this, Minister Mangala Samaraweera has this problem of having to balance everything and present a proper budget next year.
He pointed out that following the countrys graduation from a lower middle income economy in 2010, the availability of concessional financing began to decline rapidly as a percentage of total foreign debt. Concessional debt declined to 48.8 % in 2015 from over 90% in 2007.
The lower availability of concessional financing prompted the country to access international markets by issuing international sovereign bonds and since 2007, Sri Lanka has been active in the international capital markets to meet its financial needs which had made the country more open to international investors. This has also increased the attention towards sovereign ratings. We become subject to fluctuating sovereign ratings due to our political instability.
The people who created instability and are now seated as honourable members in the Opposition, should realize that the folly that they engaged in has resulted in a serious situation for the economy.
UNP should not opt for a national government: Harsha
It is my personal point of view that we should not opt for a coalition government as we did earlier, UNP MP Dr. Harsha de Silva said yesterday.
He pointed out that the Cabinet should not exceed 30 and the Government should never go for a large Cabinet as it is not the will of the people.
Dr. De Silva also said that it is alright to allow MPs of the Opposition to support the present government and those who join should not be looking for advantages.
We saw how some of those people who held ministerial portfolios in our Coalition Government acted when they crossed over. They did not respect Parliament or the Constitution. They were not interested in the country, but in their own agendas, De Silva pointed out.
Dr. De Silva urged that the policy clash between the Government and the President should be resolved through discussion.
He pointed out that while the capital expenditure and the recurrent expenditure amounted to Rs. 79,000 million, Rs. 97,000 million should be allocated to service debts.
He pointed out that it is important to expand the foreign market in order to get out of this humongous debt trap the country is in.

Professor Oliver Abeynayakes contribution to Buddhist literature
The cultural revolution of 1956 caused many a lasting result in the education field of the island. Implementing the Swabasha medium in higher education and upgrading two pirivenas to the standard of universities are two of them. The rural children were privileged to enter the universities while the traditional subjects including Pali received due recognition consequently.
Oliver, a brilliant student of Madampagama Maha Vidyalaya sat for Vidyalankara Entrance, offering Pali as a subject and having entered the university he outshone others, mostly who were the Buddhist monks. Finally, he got first-class honours at the special degree examination and was selected for a lecturer post. His next step forward was to go abroad for PhD winning a Common Wealth scholarship meant for youngest graduates. This was a great opportunity for him to gain modern knowledge keeping abreast with the world famous scholars and carry on his research on Pali based on more scientific methodology. Thus, he laid the foundation to be an international figure in the academic arena of Indology.
Instead of being qualified as a PhD holder by submitting something easy just to pass the barrier of examination, he selected a topic covering a vast area Development of latest addition to the Sutta Pitaka  Khuddaka Nikaya, It must be mentioned here that the subject is so broad that handling a such a topic usually unthinkable by a young academic who does not possess the experience of monastic life. He promised by presenting the thesis future of an erudite personality, thus, and publishing the book itself elevated him to the standard of an international scholar.
Having returned to the motherland he established family life with the lifelong scholastic partner laying the foundation to enjoy the present happy and contented living, continuing the academic carrier. In the meantime, the country saw a leap forward in the higher education of Pali and Buddhist studies when Buddhist and Pali University was established in 1982. Prof. Abeynayakas services were demanded by the farsighted authorities for the institute where he became the Director of Research, Prof. of Buddhist Philosophy and Dean of Faculty of Buddhist Studies.
As the rulers agreed to take another praiseworthy step by introducing a Post Graduate Institute for Pali and Buddhist Studies, scholars of the subject area got due recognition and were employed as lecturers there. The courses were in both Sinhala and English media. Many foreign students were attracted. It is noteworthy that the courses were open to any first-degree holder irrespective of the subjects. As a result LLB, MBBS and BSc graduates were following the courses and gradually even some professors of other subjects joined the classes as students. Prof. Abeynayaka was an indispensable lecturer there and his presentations were so applicable to the needs of the modern scholarship that he was considered to be the ideal one to explain the aspects of Buddhist theories of economics, sociology, the evolution of human society and politics. The learned student gathered knowledge through him with the necessary subject integration.
The students found his greatness in every sentence uttered by him and they noted down them. He did not want to waste time by distributing notes. The discussions were based on surfaced topics of the subject, occasionally.
The following incident will explain the peculiar ways of his approach to the subject. After the retirement, he was invited to undertake the post of visiting professor at the Buddha Dharma Centre of Hong Kong for one year. His students were preparing for Masters Degree in Buddhism. As usual, he did not want to distribute printed notes. But the authorities needed to accompany the lectures with notes and he complied. Later on, he published the lecture notes as a book, titled The Social and Economic Dimensions of Early Buddhism.
There he says in the preface I have been teaching up to now in the universities for 51 years. During that period I never lectured on a prepared note, nor did I give lecture notes to students
His Sinhalese lectures have been so appreciated by his students that they have published some of them as books. Some others have been interested in publishing a felicitation for him. He has been honoured by Buddhist and Pali University by conferring a D.Litt. Meanwhile, he has been an Academic Fellow of CommonWealth and a UNESCO Fellow of Thesaurus constructions in Japan also. A few days ago, a large crowd of his students and well-wishers gathered at Luxman Kadiragamar hall, Colombo to wish him a happy birthday. The occasion was marked by the launching of his two books. With all that he is simple, humble and rich with human qualities. But mother Sri Lanka can be proud of him for producing a great son of scholarship of international recognition.

Reviving tourism
One of the biggest casualties of the 51-day political crisis was tourism, which was booming on a series of high-profile recommendations including the coveted top spot in the hot destinations of 2019 by Lonely Planet. The Australia-based Lonely Planet cited better transport links, new hotels and a growing number of activities as the reason the South Asian Island was chosen for the top spot in its annual Best in Travel Awards.
But the political crisis erupted just a couple of days after Sri Lanka gained this ultimate recognition, leaving the tourism sector in the lurch. The crisis also coincided, rather unfortunately, with the launch of Sri Lanka Tourisms new slogan So Sri Lanka. As Sri Lankas political developments hogged the headlines in a manner unseen since the days of the conflict, many countries officially asked their nationals to stay away from Sri Lanka, unless travel was essential. This was a huge blow, as tourists cancelled their trips in droves since no one likes to visit countries that are politically unstable.
The loss to the tourism industry per se is not known yet, but the total loss to the economy has been roughly calculated at Rs.220 billion. Even if the tourism sector accounted for just one tenth of this sum, it is still a big amount for an emerging economy such as Sri Lanka. Now we must lose no time in assuring our tourism source markets that Sri Lanka is once again stable politically. There were rumblings that some of our missions were not more proactive in informing Western capitals that the political developments would not have a very big impact on the tourism sector. But now is not the time for crying over spilled milk.
The onus is now on Sri Lanka Tourism, our envoys and embassies/High Commissions and travel/hotel operators to drive home the message that Sri Lanka has regained the status quo and tourists should have absolutely no reason to keep away from Sri Lanka. They must capitalize on the Lonely Planet recognition and other similar accolades that we have gained recently. Yes, this must be a relentless global campaign because we are not the only pebble on the tourism beach. Several other countries have already filled in the vacuum created by Sri Lanka during the last 51 days  now our tourism pundits must try to win back those tourists at least in the next year. There is continuity from the ministerial side of things as well, with John Amaratunga once again donning the tourism hat.
With travel booming in the Asia-Pacific sector, we must look to Asia to give us more tourists. There clearly are gaps in this regard. For example, more Sri Lankans travel to Singapore than the other way around. There is almost a total lack of promotions for Sri Lanka in Singapore and many Asian countries. There are such lacunae in many regions. These must be rectified. Moreover, our tourism authorities must look for more direct air links to key Asian capitals.
Wirth the withdrawal of SriLankan flights from key markets such as Frankfurt and Paris, there is a dearth of direct connections to Colombo from Western Europe. We have to woo more airlines such as KLM, SWISS and Aeroflot, which recently resumed their services to Colombo after a decade or so. That still leaves legacy carriers such as Air France, Lufthansa/Condor, British Airways, Iberia, Air Italy and SAS which have still not resumed or started flights to Colombo. In fact, BIA officials must actively promote the airport at World Route Fairs. The only silver lining here is that many more Asian airlines are literally waiting in the wings to start flying to Colombo including Biman (Bangladesh), US-Bangla (Bangladesh), Thai Lion Air, Indonesia Lion Air, Vistara (India) and Tibet Airlines (China). There are some airlines such as Go Air, Hong Kong Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Scoot, Lufthansa and Air France that bypass Colombo and fly to Male. Our authorities must negotiate with these airlines to do a Colombo-Male rotation like many other airlines do.
Along with the planned expansion of the BIA, we can easily target four million tourists in the next few years. Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka have increased dramatically since the end of the 30-year conflict, from 447,890 in 2009 to an all time high of 2.1 million last year, a figure the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority hopes to double by 2020.
This will naturally call for more hotel rooms. There has been a huge investment in new visitor accommodation. Major international hotel chains, including Shangri-La, Mvenpick, Sheraton, Next, Radisson SAS, Grand Hyatt, Ritz Carlton, Hilton, The Address, JW Marriott, Inter-Continental and ITC have either opened or are opening brand new properties. However, Sri Lanka must also be on guard against over-tourism of certain religious and cultural sites.
At a time when the Sri Lanka Rupee is under pressure, the tourism industry which is a huge foreign exchange earner can be a major economic lifeline. The industry should be given all necessary incentives and concessions to bounce back from the recent upheaval and realise its long-term goals.

Sajith pledges to resolve construction sectors issues
Housing Construction and Cultural Affairs Minister Sajith Premadasa said the government will resolve the issues of the construction sector.
The Minister was addressing the gathering at a ceremony held to present National Awards for Construction on Thursday at BMICH. The best performed local and foreign construction companies were selected for the awards.
The construction and industrial sectors have huge potential to be major income generation fields, he said.
Minister Premadasa said the proposed Construction Development Fund (CDF) will be set up promptly. The CDF will provide social security, status and acceptance for the sector, he said.
The Minister said the government has taken measures to increase the skilled work force for the construction sector.
Under this move, 12,000 youths were trained for the construction sector. We do not need foreign labour now. It is our duty to produce nhuman resource for the sector, he said.
With enough human capital, the construction and industrial sectors can be developed as key income generation sources. Producing human capital is rather important to achieve economic development, he said.
The Minister said the government will protect entrepreneurs and pledged that he will take every possible measure with the assistance of the government to strengthen the local construction sector.
Strengthening and safeguarding the construction sector is a main duty of the government, the Minister noted. Fifty two per cent of the GDP is used by the 20 per cent of the richest persons of the country while the 20 per cent of the poorest persons use only 4 per cent.
The rulers must bridge the gap. They are responsible for the gap, he added.
The countrys economy should enhance social justice, the Minister said.

The history of female athletes goes back to the 6th century BC, where the women in Ancient Greece stood up for themselves to organise their own event  the Heraean Games  alongside the Ancient Olympics for men, which was contested from 776 BC.
Pausanias was a Greek traveller who documented everything he discovered about Ancient Greece in his book, the Description of Greece. Going by the records from the Greek author, the equal participation of women in sporting events can be traced back to more than 25 centuries.
However, even as we gallop into the new-age world, female athletes continue to be treated with a pinch of sexism even today  at times blatant, at times not.
Lyon FC striker Ada Hegerberg, who already has 284 goals to her name at the age of 23, scripted history by becoming the first female footballer to be awarded the prestigious Ballon dOr on Monday, 3 December.
However, an occasion as momentous as this was marred by an abhorrently sexist comment by host Martin Solveig, a French DJ, who asked Hegerberg if she could twerk on stage to celebrate her award. Let us take a look at previous instances when international female athletes faced blatant sexism.
THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES (1973)
In an attempt to garner fame and fortune, Bobby Riggs  a retired tennis player  challenged one of the worlds best female tennis players of the time, saying that womens tennis was so inferior that none of the top players could beat him even at 55. He first challenged Billie-Jean King to a match against him, but after she declined the offer, he went up against Margaret Court and defeated her in straight sets.
King decided to take Riggs up on the offer thereafter, so as to stop the toxic wave of sexism that spread through his comments and victory. King, at 29, took on the former six-time Grand Slam champion, and in a display of ferociousness and resilience, clinched the contest in straight sets (64, 63, 63).
MITHALI RAJ, ICC WOMENS WORLD CUP 2017
Participating in a World Cup is something every aspiring cricketer dreams of. Donning that prestigious jersey, walking out on the field before thousands, representing your nation at one of the biggest sporting events in the world  it doesnt get better than this. However, when Mithali Raj addressed her very first press conference ahead of the 2017 Womens World Cup, she was asked to name her favourite male cricketer.
Rajs team went on to put up a fight which would silence all doubters of Indian womens cricket, finishing runners-up at the tournament.
FIFA WOMENS WORLD CUP 2015
Can you imagine France winning the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but on an artificial turf
Thats exactly what happened with the participants of the 2015 Womens World Cup, who were not even given the opportunities of competing on regular football surfaces. The entire tournament  hosted in Canada  was played on artificial turfs, which have more traction, thus leading to more injuries than grass turfs.
CHLOE KIM, WINTER OLYMPICS 2018
Chloe Kim, at 17, became the youngest woman to win a medal in the womens snowboard at the Winter Olympics earlier this year. However, her gold medal wasnt enough to prevent a radio-host from ogling her on live radio.
Here is a conversation that unfolded on Barstool Radio, between former baseball player Dallas Braden, comedian Brody Stevens and host Patrick Connor  who was later fired by the media house. Stevens: Me, personally, Im on Twitter, I see Chloe Kim, Im thinking Khloe Kardashian, Kim [Kardashian], I dont want to deal with that. So I missed out on the whole Chloe Kim thing. But its a good story. Shes into it, a little kid  Im inspired by it. Braden: Chloe Kim, famous for riding a very different board than Kim Kardashian.
Connor: No doubt, and in fact just to keep it on that tip, her 18th birthday is April 23, and the countdown is on baby, cause I got my Wooderson going. Thats what I like about them high school girls. Stevens: I love it P-Con, Im right there with you.
Connor: Shes fine as hell! If she was 18, you wouldnt be ashamed to say that shes a little hot piece of a**. And she is. She is adorable. Im a huge Chloe Kim fan.
As female athletes across the world continue to face sexism in this day and age, they must look out for inspiration from extraordinary figures like Hegerberg. In her acceptance speech, the Lyon FC forward said, I would like to end this speech with some words to young girls all over the world. Please, believe in yourself.  thequint

Speaker wants more time to decide on Opposition Leaders post
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya requested more time to give his final ruling on the post of Opposition Leader of Parliament.
The Speakers ruling is due as both former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and TNA Leader R.Sampanthan are claiming the the Opposition Leader post.
The Speaker making a special announcement in Parliament yesterday said that he requires more time to study the matter in depth.
I received a motion signed by several MPs asking to appoint a Parliament Select Committee on this matter. I also received a letter signed by UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera on the party membership of the former President.
Then I also got another letter by TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran. I will study all these letters and communicate my decision as soon as possible, the Speaker said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and TNA MP Sumanthiran contended that former President Rajapaksa and his fellow MPs ceased to be Members of Parliament as one month has lapsed since having left the SLFP and obtained Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) membership. Sumanthiran also questioned as to whether it is correct to give the Opposition Leader post to a Member of Parliament belonging to the same party of the President, who is the Head of Government, Head of Executive and Head of Cabinet and currently holding three Cabinet portfolios. The UPFA MPs supporting Rajapaksa denied having SLPP membership.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed the seat allocated to the Opposition Leader in Parliament yesterday while Sampanthan assumed a front row seat near the main entrance.

Sport faces serious integrity problem: review panel
Scrapping official live scoring data at the lowest level of professional tennis and taking a harder line on tanking are among the recommendations made by an International Review Panel in a report published on Wednesday.
The panel was formed in 2016 by the sports four main professional governing bodies to address betting-related and other integrity issues.
Today, tennis faces a serious integrity problem, the panel said. There are several reasons for this: The nature of the game lends itself to manipulati on for betting purposes.
There are many contingencies. There is only one player who must act. Detection is difficult, not least because at many lower level matches there are no spectators and inadequate facilities to protect players from potential corrupters.
Moreover, under-performance is often attributed to tanking, which too often has been tolerated.
The panel said there was no simple solution to the problem with a package of measures required, including banning tournaments from accepting sponsorship by the betting industry and reorganising the Tennis Integrity Unit with independent oversight.
The panel said players in the lowest tiers were susceptible to being corrupted because of the difficulty of making a living, with only 250-350 players earning enough money to break even.
The player incentive structure creates a fertile breeding ground for breaches of integrity, the panel said.
The sports major bodies released a joint statement saying they would work jointly to implement the panels recommendations.

Three reasons why T10 cricket has a viable future
The 2018 T10 Cricket league has wrapped up the second season with a bang, as the Northern Warriors beat out Pakhtoon to claim victory in the final.
All the squads this season were filled with exciting players from all over the world, despite the fact that most countries were involved in international series in between the domestic cricket seasons. Hosted out of Sharjahs Cricket Stadium, the league has produced a spectacle full of entertainment and fast-paced cricket.
While T10 was derided in the past, like T20, as being too batsman-friendly. This wasnt necessarily the case as bowlers used intelligent bowling and variety to bamboozle batsman, leading to figures like Chris Jordans 4/6 against Maratha Arabians or Pravin Tambes 5/15 against the Kerala Knights.
The other advantage of T10 is the knock-on effect it will have on T20 leagues around the world, similarly to the effect T20 has had on One Day domestic and international matches. Once again, the shorter format of the game will force both batters and bowlers to adapt to the harder conditions or perish in the increasingly competitive world of International cricket, both for countries and at a franchise level.
The inaugural tournament, held back in 2017, was held over the course of 4 days with most teams playing 2 games a day, including all the finals which took place on 17th of December. This years tournament took place between the 21st of November and wrapped up with the final on the 2nd of December, with 10 days full of action-packed cricket.
Given the success of this tournament, it is highly likely that it will be renewed once again for a third straight year and given its growth it will probably come back stronger, hopefully with a bigger budget to attract more big names to the tournament from countries like India, Australia, and South Africa, whose main stars were unavailable due to international cricket schedule clashes.
Here are three reasons why T10 has a viable future as crickets fourth format.
#3 BOWLERS HAVE AN EQUAL SAY
One of the biggest criticisms of the T20 format, and by extension the shorter T10, is that the game is skewed too much in favor of the big-hitting batsman and makes it harder for bowlers to develop and play well.
Anyone that watched the bowling performances at this years T10 tournament could clearly show how good bowling and variation is still a key part of the game, ever at T10, and while Batsmen are expected to hit big, it gives a greater opportunity for bowlers to take wickets at the same time.
From Aamer Yamins 4 wicket maiden against the Northern Warriors to Pravin Tambes 5 wicket haul against Kerala Knights, the bowling has improved wildly in as little as a season for the T10 league.
During the 2017 T10 season, the leading wicket-takers, Sohail Tanvir, Rayad Emrit, and Hasan Ali all finished on 5 wickets each over the course of the tournament. This season it was Hardus Viljoen who finished with the most wickets, taking 18 wickets in his 9 games, followed by Dwayne Bravo and Mohammed Irfan who both finished on 10 wickets.
This increase in the wickets shows that bowlers arent out of the game at all in T10 matches and, just like in the other forms, play a crucial part in the outcome of the match.
#2 POTENTIAL TO SPREAD CRICKET ALL AROUND THE WORLD
The 2018 season of the T10 league had players representing countries from India, Pakistan, the West Indies, England, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, as well as representation from smaller cricketing nations, like Nepal, Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, the USA, the UAE, Ireland, and the Netherlands. In total, the squads represented players from 16 different countries around the world.
With cricket growing as a game around the world, with suggestions of its submission to become an Olympic sport being taken into consideration, T10 could be the format that gets cricket there.
T10 would be the ideal format to take to new fans in North American audiences like the United States and Canada. While T20 has become the biggest format in the game, ahead of the One Day format or test series, the T10 format can be used to introduce new fans to the game of cricket, much like how Rugby Sevens has worked wonderfully in bringing in American audiences to the game of Rugby.
#1 ITS JUST THE BEGINNING
The T10 league has just finished its second tournament and the names that it has attracted are amongst the best players in the world, from West Indians like Darren Sammy, Chris Gayle, Sunil Narine to England stars like Sam Billings, Jonny Bairstow, Eoin Morgan, and Alex Hales.
Great players from Pakistan, New Zealand, Bangladesh and the top talent from smaller cricketing countries like Zimbabwe, Ireland, and Afghanistan also participated in the tournament.
While the first tournament was played over the course of 4 days, this year the tournament was played over 10 days, giving players the more of a chance to rest between games and get the best of their abilities during the tournament without overtaxing them.
The tournament is the first of its kind, and no other countries have thought about introducing T10 into their domestic season, or even an international game between two sides has not even been suggested. This leaves large amounts of room for this new shortest format of the game to grow into, potentially expanding into areas like North and South America, as well as continental Europe, were traditional cricket doesnt have as strong a grip. nr

## Title: Toulouse head to Clermont for primetime Sunday night drama

Toulouse head to Clermont for primetime Sunday night drama
Paris, Friday: Forget the mushy Christmas movies and reality shows, if you cannot get to the Stade Marcel-Michelin on Sunday night then find a comfy sofa, commandeer the tv remote and tune in to what promises to be one of the great rugby matches of the season: Clermont against Toulouse.
This is Le Grand Choc as Top 14 leaders Clermont, the immoveable object, play host to second-placed Toulouse, the seemingly unstoppable force.
Toulouse, after a few years in the doldrums, are back to their bristling best, a threat in Europe where they top their Champions Cup pool with four wins from four, and a growing force at home where they have won their last five Top 14 matches.
Its a run of nine games over three months without defeat which leaves them just three points behind Clermont going into round 12 with the Christmas number one spot at stake in Sundays game.
We are not surprised, it was always a team in waiting, said Clermont coach Franck Azema.
They changed things around a few seasons back, it has taken some time but they believe in the way they play and in their spirit which is unique to them. They have rediscovered their style.
Toulouse have the best away form in the Top 14 with wins at Grenoble, Perpignan and Pau as well as a draw at Lyon.
Clermont, though, are made of different stuff. Like Toulouse they have been invincible in Europe this season, albeit in the lesser Challenge Cup, and they are on an eight-match unbeaten run.
Azemas team are also unbeaten at home in the Top 14 and that could be Toulouses great stumbling block.
Their last win at Clermont was back in 2002 since when numerous Toulouse sides, some of them among the greatest the club has produced, have returned home without a win.
For the viewer in the comfy sofa, it promises to be a treat as they are the two best attacking sides in France, each of them averaging more than three tries per game.
Stade need win
It is an important weekend as well for Stade Francais as they struggle to come to terms with the death of their young player Nicolas Chauvin, a tragedy which has launched a nationwide debate about safety in rugby.
After a strong start to the season, the Parisians have faltered of late, losing their last three Top 14 matches.
They are now down in eighth place and need a win at struggling Agen to reboot their season.
One place behind them lie Montpellier who have lost three of their last four but who showed signs of a return to form with a convincing 34-13 win over Toulon in the Champions Cup last weekend.
On Saturday they travel to Grenoble who have won just one of their last six and are now focussed on survival rather than play-offs.
Its true that we are badly-placed and we need to pick up some points, flanker Yacouba Camara told Midi-Olympique. But we know that to play in Grenoble is not easy. We will see where we really are.
Bordeaux-Begles travel to Castres on Sunday without their South African lock Jandre Marais who has been ruled out for the rest of the season after tearing knee ligaments in the 17-14 win at Sale last weekend.
Its a real blow, another hole in our season, said Bordeaux-Begles president Laurent Marti.
Castres scrum-half Rory Kockott will miss this game as it is the first of a three-match suspension imposed after he gouged the eyes of Chris Cloete during the European win over Munster.
Bottom side Perpignan, still looking for their first win of the season, will be without Adrea Cocagi for their trip to Paris to face Racing 92 on Saturday.
The Fijian centre was suspended for nine weeks after being sent off for a dangerous shoulder charge on Connachts Matt Healy.

From two Premiers to two Opposition Leaders
Battered by the high-handed decisions of the Executive for 50 turbulent days from October 26, which made inroads into Parliamentary democracy, a loud and renewed call came from the Legislature this week to abolish the Executive Presidency.
The first thing Parliament took up following the historical defeat of what one may call a coup, which shook up the entire political establishment of the country, was an adjournment debate calling for the abolition of the Executive Presidency, an unkept pre-election promise of all successive leaders since 1994.
The JVP in moving the adjournment motion saw that the ambience and timing were so much in favour to push the 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A) spearheaded by them. The 20A mainly proposes to abolish the Executive Presidency and end crossover of MPs.
Unkept promise
The UNP, TNA and even MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera, who represents left-wing politics, joined in the call to dispense with excessive presidential powers, sending a strong message to the masses. The JVP used the debate to create a vibrant discussion on the topic to educate the masses and bust some common myths with regard to the system of Executive Presidency.
UNP senior member Malik Samarawickrama pointed out that the recent events in the country showed that the concentration of power in one office is a recipe for disaster.
Abolishing the Executive Presidency was a cornerstone of the Yahapalana Governments plan guided by the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera and it is now time to re-commit to that goal. After having seen the ill-effects of the system, we cannot turn a blind eye. We have to act now, he said.
TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran recalled that the three main promises of the President, on the day he declared to be the Common Candidate back in November 2014, were that he would abolish the Executive Presidency, reform Parliamentary Election system and appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.
A rejection of crossover political culture was also loud and clear in the aftermath of the political crisis. The MPs were said to be offered bribes up to Rs 500 million to switch the sides as the President himself openly claimed.
The somersaults of MPs like Wasantha Senanayake and Vadivel Suresh, and the telephone recording exposed by MP Palitha Range Bandara intensified the public detest on the sell-out political culture. Despite that, the spate of somersaults continued even this week with MPs Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, Lakshman Seneviratne and Indika Bandaranaike crossing the floor of the Chamber to join the Government.
Political debacle
The Presidents recent ill-advised actions that eroded parliamentary democracy came under scathing criticism by many speakers who took the floor. JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake in a blistering speech said the public perception on the President is at all-time low.
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauff Hakeem summed up that President Maithripala Sirisenas actions in the last 50 days could be best explained with the Sinhala idiom Natapu netumakuth ne, bere paluwakuth ne (there has been no dance but half of the drum is torn).
He also pointed out that the ill-advice of some MPs has pushed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa into a serious political debacle. The man who was riding the high wave of popularity has compromised his popularity unnecessarily, trying to grab power through the backdoor to satisfy a few of his fellow MPs who had misled him. That is his fate. I hope he will see some saner counsel soon, he commented.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath, expressing similar thoughts, said that former President Rajapaksa suffered a severe blow from President Sirisenas actions. You would not get hurt much if you fell while seated. If you were standing, you could get hurt more and perhaps could get injured too, but if somebody pulled you up and suddenly banged you on the floor then it could be fatal. Thats exactly what President Sirisena did to Rajapaksa, MP Herath remarked.
The predicament faced by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from being at the helm of power to risk losing his Parliamentary seat also came up during the sittings. This was as a result of a fresh tussle broke out between Rajapaksa and TNA Leader R Sampanthan for the post of Opposition Leader.
Flower bud or Hand
No sooner the Speaker announced that the Opposition Leader post would be given to former President Rajapaksa going by the Parliamentary tradition as the UPFA MPs have taken Opposition seats, objections were raised by Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella and TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran.
The objections were mainly twofold. The first and most serious allegation was that former President Rajapaksas Parliamentary seat has fallen vacant after he obtained the membership of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) on November 11. Kiriella quoted Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution which said, Where a Member of Parliament ceases, by resignation, expulsion or otherwise, to be a member of a recognised political party or independent group on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of his becoming such Member of Parliament, his seat shall become vacant upon the expiration of a period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such member, in support of his argument.
MP Sumanthiran tabled newspaper reports of this event, which took place merely two days after the Presidents purported dissolution of Parliament, as proof.
In a historic judgement the countrys judiciary reversed the dissolution after establishing that it was unconstitutional. This was not anticipated by the former President or any of his fellow MPs who ceremonially received membership cards and posted them on their social media accounts. As the controversy brews, one by one denied having obtained the SLPP membership and started removing such photos from their respective social media accounts. The other objection was that giving the Opposition Leader post to a Member of Parliament belonging to the same party of the President, who is the Head of Government, Head of Executive and Head of Cabinet and currently holding three Cabinet portfolios, was not correct. The TNA requested the Speaker to appoint a Parliament Select Committee to ascertain the suitability of Rajapaksa to hold the Opposition Leader position. TNA Leader R. Sampanthan, being an old-timer who had experienced many political storms, refused to back down without a fight and claimed that there are two Opposition Leaders in Parliament now.
Double-tongued MPs
It is worthwhile reminding that the person holding the Opposition Leader post becomes an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council. The 10-member CC is the apex decision making body that recommends the appointments to the Independent Commissions and high ranking positions such as the Attorney General, Auditor General, Parliament Secretary General, IGP, Chief Justice and superior court judges among others.It is ironic that the UPFA MPs supporting Rajapaksa, who spewed venom against the Speaker over the past two months, were quick to remind the House that the Speakers announcement on Tuesday was final. JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake exposed those double-standards of the JO MPs in the first turn he got. Pro-Rajapaksa camp is a shameless group who abused the Speaker in the most despicable language. It is amusing to see how they are now praising the Speaker. They should kneel down before the Speakers Chair and plead for forgiveness, he noted.
Speaker Jayasuriya, who emerged the champion of democracy for fearlessly standing up for democratic principles under trying circumstances, is faced with another fresh puzzle in choosing the rightful owner of the Opposition Leader post. The Speaker yesterday requested further time to give a final ruling.
Severe blow to economy
As the dust settles on the political coup, the Government presented a Vote on Account to provide for the public expenditure of the first quarter of next year till a full-budget is ready. The tourism sector, investments and foreign exchange took a severe blow due to the unnecessarily prolonged political crisis and as a result, the countrys feeble economy has had to pay dearly. Former Central Bank Deputy Governor W. A. Wijewardena analysed in a post on his Twitter on December 19, Sri Lankans embroiled in power game arent aware of economic volcano they are sitting on. Growth in the third quarter of the year has fallen to 2.9 percent of the GDP making economic growth so far this year just 3.3 percent of the GDP, annually, at most 3.4 percent. Rupee is kept at this level by selling USD by Central Bank, so far near USD 1billion. Bad period ahead.
The Government will no doubt face more and far bitter struggles in the coming months as it strain to ease the economic impact of the political power game without compromising on its new found political capital.

Upholding Democracy
Continued from yesterday
When hearings commenced on 04th December 2018, several learned counsel appearing for intervenient Petitioners who had filed applications seeking to be added as Respondent but had not been added as Respondents since their applications were not before the Court on 12th November 2018, sought permission to, nevertheless, make submissions.
In view of the importance of the issue before the Court, these requests were permitted on an exceptional basis, in terms of Article 134 (3) of the Constitution. Accordingly, we heard submissions made by Mr. Gomin Dayasiri, Mr. Samantha Ratwatte PC, Mr. V.K. Choksy, Mr. Chrishmal Warnasuriya, Mr. K. Deekiriwewa, and Mr. Darshan Weerasekera.
All counsel made exhaustive submissions before us, stretching over 4 days. The Petitioners in all 10 applications, the Attorney General and the added Respondents have submitted written submissions on 30th November 2018, and some of them have submitted further written submissions after the cases were taken up for hearing. Mr. Samantha Ratwatte PC, Mr. V.K. Choksy and Mr. Chrishmal Warnasuriya, have also filed written submissions. I have endeavoured to carefully consider both oral and written submissions made by all counsel when examining the issues before us.
Having set out the cases of the parties before us in some detail, I proceed to consider and determine the issues before us in these applications.
Jurisdiction
When, on 12th and 13th November 2018, the Petitioners application in the present case [i.e: SC FR 351/2018] and the other eight applications were supported by counsel for the Petitioners and were opposed by the Attorney General and counsel for the five added Respondents in the course of submissions spanning two days, neither the Attorney General nor counsel for the added Respondents disputed the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear and determine any of the issues that arise in these applications challenging the validity of the Proclamation marked -P1.
However, when Mr. Udaya Ranjith Seneviratne, in his capacity as the Secretary to His Excellency, the President filed his affidavit dated 19th November 2018 he has pleaded that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine these applications but did not explain the basis on which he makes that claim.
Further, the 2nd added Respondent has stated that the Petitioner cannot invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court since the Petitioner, as a Member of Parliament, had the specific remedy provided by Article 38 (2) (a) (i) of the Constitution of giving the Hon. Speaker notice of resolution moving for the removal of His Excellency, the President from office under the provisions of Article 38 (2) (a) (i) of the Constitution.
It is to be noted that none of the other added Respondents  i.e: the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents - have, in their affidavits, disputed the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear and determine these applications. In fact, in their affidavits the 1st and 5th Respondents expressly state that the power vested in the President by Article 33 (2) (c) of the Constitution is subject to Article 35 of the Constitution while the 3rd and 4th added Respondents expressly state that the power vested in the President by Article 33 (2) (c) of the Constitution is subject to Article 35 Proviso I of the Constitution.
Further, in their written submissions tendered on 30th November 2018 before the hearing was taken up on 04th December 2018  Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC on behalf of the 1st added Respondent, Mr. Manohara De Silva, PC on behalf of the 2nd added Respondent, Mr. Ali Sabry, PC on behalf of the 3rd added Respondent, Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC on behalf of the 4th added Respondent and Mr. Canishka Witharana on behalf of the 5th added Respondent do notdispute the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear and determine these applications.
However, the written submissions tendered on behalf of the Attorney General urge that the Supreme Court is precluded from exercising its fundamental rights jurisdiction in respect of these applications. That contention is made on the following two fold basis:
(a) A submission that the Petitioners in all nine applications rely on their claim that His Excellency, the President intentionally and/or wilfully and/or unlawfully violated the Constitution and/or committed an abuse of the powers of his office and that, therefore, the only remedy available to the Petitioners is under the specific mechanism provided by Article 38 (2) of the Constitution;
(b) A submission that the dissolution of Parliament does not constitute executive or administrative action falling within the purview of Article 126 of the Constitution.
At the hearing which commenced on 04th December 2018, the Hon. Attorney General made exhaustive submissions in support of these two preliminary objections. Learned Counsel for the five added Respondents stated that they associate themselves with the aforesaid two preliminary objections raised by the Attorney General but did not press these issues.
The submission set out in (a) above will be considered first.
In this regard, the Hon. Attorney General submits that since, as specified by Article 118 (b) of the Constitution, the Supreme Court can exercise its jurisdiction for the protection of fundamental rights under and in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution only subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Supreme Court is precluded or fettered from exercising that fundamental rights jurisdiction in the present applications because Article 38 (2) of the Constitution provides a specific mechanism or a specific procedure or mechanism setting out the manner in which the Supreme Court can exercise jurisdiction with regard to the Petitioners complaints of alleged intentional violation of the Constitution and/or alleged abuse of the powers of his office by His Excellency, the President. It is submitted that, therefore, the Petitioners complaints are not justiciable under Article 126.
Article 38 (2) of the Constitution deals with the procedure to be followed where any Member of Parliament wishes to move for the removal of the President then in office oras is more usually said in common parlancewishes to move for the impeachment of the President then in office.
This submission fails on several counts.
Firstly, the submission is logically flawed in the case of these particular applications. To put in another way, the submission is a glaring non sequitur in the specific circumstances of these applications. The simple reason for that observation is that these applications challenge a dissolution of Parliament and a Member of a Parliament which is dissolved by the President without notice and literally overnight, cannot have recourse to Article 38 (2) because, at the time the applications are filed, no Parliament would exist in which a motion for impeachment can be brought.
Secondly, Article 38 (2) of the Constitution need even be considered only where proceedings for the impeachment of His Excellency, the President have commenced and the Hon. Speaker has referred a resolution to the Supreme Court for inquiry and report or, at the least, when such proceedings are impending. However, no such circumstances have arisen. In fact, there is absolutely no suggestion before us that the Petitioner [or any of the Petitioners in the other applications] has any intention of giving notice of a resolution under Article 38 (2) for the impeachment of His Excellency, the President. The complaint in these applications that the impugned act of His Excellency, the President has allegedly violated the Constitution and/or abused the powers of his office and, thereby, violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioners does not mean that the Petitioner [or any of the other Petitioners] intends to take the extreme step of attempting to impeach His Excellency, the President. Thus, the submission made on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General is founded on hypothesis and is without factual basis or merit.
Thirdly, the inalienable right of every citizen of our country to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is a cornerstone of the sovereignty of the people which is the Grundnorm of our Constitution. Thus, Article 4 (d) declares the fundamental rights which are by the Constitution declared and recognized shall be respected, secured and advanced by all the organs of government and shall not be abridged, restricted or denied, save in the manner and extent hereinafter provided..
It has been emphasised time and again by this Court that it is a foremost duty of the Supreme Court to protect, give full meaning to and enforce the fundamental rights which are listed in Chapter III of the Constitution. Thus, Sharvananda CJ observed in MUTUWEERAN vs. THE STATE [5 Sri Skanthas Law Reports 126 at p. 130]; Because the remedy under Article 126 is thus guaranteed by the Constitution, a duty is imposed upon the Supreme Court to protect fundamental rights and ensure their vindication..
In honouring this duty, the Supreme Court is giving tangible and effective life and meaning to the sovereignty of the people. The single and only instance specified in the Constitution where the exercise of these fundamental rights may be restricted is in circumstances falling within the ambit of Article 15 of the Constitution. The present applications do not fall with the ambit of Article 15 in the absence of any laws which have been passed prescribing restricting the operation of Article 12 (1) in the interests of national security, public order or any other of the specific grounds referred to in Article 15 (7) of the Constitution. Further, it hardly needs to be said that, the mere fact the procedure described in Article 38 (2) of the Constitution provides for the Supreme Court to inquire into a resolution and report to Parliament, cannot deprive this Court of its jurisdiction under Article 118 (b) read with Article 126 for the protection of fundamental rights. In the absence of a specific and express provision in the Constitution which strips the Supreme Court of jurisdiction under Article 118 (b) read with Article 126 and Article 17 for the protection of fundamental rights, the provisions of Article 118 (b) read with Article 126 and Article 17 will prevail. Therefore, this Court has the jurisdiction and, in fact, a solemn duty to hear and determine these applications according to the law.
Fourthly, the procedure specified in Article 38 (2) refers solely to the exercise of the power of the Legislature. It has to be understood that the role of the Supreme Court under Article 38 (2) is limited to inquiring into the allegation or allegations contained in a resolution which has been referred to the Court by the Hon. Speaker and making a report thereon to Parliament. The Supreme Court is, essentially, performing a fact-finding function upon the direction of Parliament. It is Parliament which determines what is to be done with the report submitted by the Supreme Court to Parliament. Thus, the limited fact-finding role of the Supreme Court under Article 38 (2) cannot be equated with the exercise of judicial power by the Supreme Court in the protection of fundamental rights.
Fifthly, it is patently clear that these applications are solely by way of personal applications which are restricted to an invocation of the jurisdiction of this Court for the protection of the Petitioners fundamental rights. This is also manifested by the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners which are limited to declarations that the Proclamation marked P1 violate their fundamental rights under Article 12 (1) and/or Article 14 (1) (a) of the Constitution and Orders quashing P1 and related interim reliefs. The Petitioners do not pray for a declaration that His Excellency, the President has intentionally violated the Constitution or committed an abuse of the powers of his office. Thus, the Petitioners applications before us cannot be logically connected with the entirely different nature of proceedings under and in terms of Article 38 (2) which set in motion the power of the legislature to impeach a President who is then in office and, in the exercise of that power of the Legislature, provide for the Legislature to request the Supreme Court to inquire into and report on the allegation or allegations contained in a resolution.
The mere existence of the procedure described in Article 38 (2) cannot deprive those Petitioners who are Members of Parliament of the inalienable right of every citizen of our country to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. To emphasise the point, the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be immediately invoked by any Member of Parliament in his capacity as a citizen of Sri Lanka and he can obtain a determination by this Court. His right to do so is not dependent on cobbling together the required majority of Members of Parliament. Thus, there is no valid comparison between the procedure specified in Article 38 (2) of the Constitution for the impeachment of a President then in office and the inalienable right of a Member of Parliament, as a citizen of Sri Lanka, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court for the protection of fundamental rights.
Petitioners in SC FR 353/2018, SC FR 354/2018, SC FR 355/2018 and SC FR 361/2018 who were and/or are not Members of the Eighth Parliament and, therefore, have no opportunity of bringing a motion for the impeachment of the President. The contention that these Petitioners must be deemed to have an opportunity to bring a motion for the impeachment of the President through their elected Members of Parliament is divorced from reality and is without merit.
For the aforesaid reasons, the submission made by the Hon. Attorney General and set out in (a) above  i.e: that the only remedy available to the Petitioner is under the mechanism provided by Article 38 (2) of the Constitutionis rejected.
Executive and administrative action of President
It has been submitted on behalf of the Attorney General that the dissolution of Parliament by the President does not constitute executive or administrative action falling within the purview of Article 126 of the Constitution and, therefore, is covered by the immunity granted by Article 35 (1) of the Constitution.
Article 35 (1) of the 1978 Constitution stipulated that during the period when a President holds office, no proceedings can be instituted or continued against him in any court or tribunal in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him in his official or private capacity. Thus, prior to the 19th Amendment, Article 35 (1) conferred a blanket immunity upon a President [so long as he holds office] from being sued in respect of any act or omission done by him in his official capacity qua President or in his private capacity.
However, as is well known, the proviso to Article 35 (1) introduced by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution introduced a very significant change. It states Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be read and construed as restricting the right of any person to make an application under Article 126 against the Attorney-General, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President, in his official capacity..
Thus, the proviso to Article 35 (1) entitles any person who complains that an act or omission by the President in his official capacity has violated a fundamental right of that person to institute a fundamental rights application under and in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution against the Hon. Attorney General and seek a determination by the Supreme Court with regard to his complaint. In other words, the proviso to Article 35 (1) makes acts or omissions by the President in his official capacity justiciable within the limited sphere of an invocation of the jurisdiction for the protection of fundamental rights conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 118 (b) read with Article 126 of the Constitution and subject to the stipulation that the Hon. Attorney General [and not the President] is to be made the Respondent to the fundamental rights application filed by that person. It hardly needs to be said that the Hon. Attorney General is to be named as the Respondent in the place of the President and as his representative.
Since the proviso to Article 35 (1) grants the right to challenge acts or omission by the President in his official capacity only by way of the specific procedure of making a fundamental rights application under Article 126 of the Constitution, it follows that executive or administrative action by the President in his official capacity may be challenged in terms of the proviso to Article 35 (1). That is because Article 126 (1) stipulates The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared and recognised by Chapter III or Chapter IV.
The Court must now examine the merits of that submission.
In this regard, the Hon. Attorney General submits that Article 30 (1) of the Constitution describes the President as being the Head of State, the Head of the Executive and of the Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. He goes on to seek to draw a distinction between acts done by the President as the Head of State and as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces on the one hand and acts done by the President as the Head of the Executive and of the Government on the other hand.
The Court cannot accept the submission made on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General that there are some powers which are vested in the President which are not limited by the provisions of the Constitution and which are, therefore, not subject to review in appropriate circumstances.
Next it is necessary to examine whether the act of dissolution of Parliament by the President amounts to - executive or administrative action within the meaning of Article 126 of the Constitution.
The Constitution does not define or describe what is meant by the term executive or administrative action. It appears to assume that the words are adequately descriptive and speak for themselves. As far as I am aware, this Court has, advisedly, not ventured an attempt at defining the term. Instead, the question of whether an act or omission can be regarded as constituting executive or administrative action must be decided on the nature of the powers that are exercised, the nature of the act and the facts of each case.
To determine whether the act of dissolving Parliament falls within the ambit of executive or administrative action it is necessary to examine whether the power and nature of the act were executive or administrative. In this regard, it is to be noted that CHAPTER VII of the Constitution which is titled THE EXECUTIVE - The President of the Republic is where the office of President is described, the manner of election and term of office of the President is specified, the duties and powers of the President are listed, the accountability of the President to Parliament is stipulated, the immunity of the President from suit is formulated and several other provisions relevant to the office of President are set out. This shows that the office of the President and the powers he holds are of an executive character. That conclusion is solidified by Article 4 (b) of the Constitution which specifies that the President exercises the executive power of the people. This fact has been recognised in several decisions of this Court.
Therefore, it would appear that the exercise of the power of dissolution of Parliament which is listed as one of the powers of the President in Article 33 which is within CHAPTER VII titled THE EXECUTIVE The President of the Republic, is one manner in which the President exercises executive power. That, in turn, would suggest that the dissolution of Parliament by the President is an executive act which falls within the definition of executive or administrative action.

UPFA General Secretary MP Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday in Parliament pledged his unconditional support to the progressive moves of the Government by putting the country before the political party.
The senior MP said that they support the Vote on Account as the salaries and other payments of the public servants depend on it.
Taking the floor during the debate on the Vote on Account, he noted that it was the SLFP which suffered the most from the recent political crisis.
We do not expect portfolios. We will remain in the Opposition. Our support is to take this country forward. The UNPs Gamperaliya programme is a good move. Recent political issues created many problems in the country.The tourism sector and investments were badly affected.
The country suffered a huge loss during those few days. All condemn the misbehaviour of MPsin the House, he said.
Amaraweera also regretted the crossover of MP Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa, adding that they were seniors in the SLFP and the SLFP should have retained them in the party.
We have to correct our wrongs. We will support the good moves of the Government while objecting to what is bad for the country. Take our criticisms in good spirit, he told the UNP MPs.

WTA increases rankings protectionfor returning mothers
The Womens Tennis Association (WTA) will offer greater rankings protection to mothers returning to the tour after giving birth and introduce a modernised dress rule as part of new rules announced on Monday for next season.
The changes address issues that came up in 2018 when former world number one Serena Williams, who returned to action after giving birth, was unseeded for some events and caused an uproar with a black, skin-tight bodysuit she wore at the French Open.
But after gathering feedback from players, the WTA said its board of directors approved changes that will allow players out of competition for 52 weeks or longer to use their Special Ranking in 12 tournaments.
A player returning from pregnancy will have a three-year period to use her Special Ranking, which will now begin at the birth of the child.
For players who would qualify for a seeded position in the draw, the updated rule will ensure they will not face a seed in the opening rounds whether returning from pregnancy or injury.
Williamss world ranking had fallen to 451 when she was not seeded at the French Open. The American was, however, seeded 25th at this years Wimbledon despite being ranked outside the worlds top 32 players.
Former world number one Victoria Azarenka, who returned to tennis in mid-2017 following the birth of her son, welcomed the rule change.
Our players should feel comfortable and confident to take time away from the courts to have a family or recover from injury and I think these new rules support that, Azarenka, who is on the a WTA Players Council, said in a statement.
This is a really good first step and we are using it as a base to continue to look for ways to improve and highlight the importance of mothers working and being on Tour.
The board of directors also agreed that players at WTA tournaments would not be prohibited from wearing leggings or compression shorts without a skirt, dress or shorts over them.
The WTA had no rule explicitly banning a player from wearing such outfits but adjusted the language of its rule to be more clear.
The black catsuit worn by Williams at Roland Garros sparked plenty of debate and attracted the ire of the French Tennis Federation president Bernard Giudicelli.
While this has not been an issue to date, we wanted to make it clear that there is no prohibition on these items, WTA chief executive Steve Simon said in a statement.
We understand the importance of modernizing the dress code and ensuring that our players have flexibility in choosing the clothing they wear. Our rules should not prohibit that.
Among other rule changes is the rollout of a 25-second shot clock between points at premier events in 2019, with a full rollout for all WTA tournaments in 2020, in a bid to speed up the pace of play.
Players will also only be allowed one toilet/change of attire break per match, down from the previous two.

Yearender: Djokovic(tor) back on top as old guard refuse to let go
LONDON - Young German Alexander Zverevs breakthrough title at the ATP Finals in London last month brought the future into focus but the year ended with mens tennis in the grip of a block of 30 somethings led by a resurgent Novak Djokovic.
Serbian Djokovic, 31, needed elbow surgery in February to cure a problem that surfaced in 2017, but after some jarring defeats he returned to the kind of domination he achieved in 2015, winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
Roger Federer continued to hold back the clock as only he can by winning the Australian Open, aged 36 and a few weeks later became the ATPs oldest world number one.
Rafael Nadal, 32, had an injury-hit year but that did not stop the Spaniard winning an 11th French Open title.
By the time the long season wrapped up, Djokovic, Nadal and Federer were one, two and three in the ATP rankings with seven of the top 10 aged 30 or over.
The eagerly-awaited return of Serena Williams to the womens game after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia last September failed to deliver the American a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam singles title, although she was tantalisingly close.
It is not the majestic tennis she played en route to the Wimbledon and U.S. Open finals that will be remembered, however, but her controversial Flushing Meadows showdown against Japans Naomi Osaka and the ensuing fall-out and allegations of sexism.
In one of the most infamous matches played in the New York cauldron, Williams raged after being given a code violation for off-court coaching in the second set, got a point penalty for angrily smashing a racket and was docked a game for calling umpire Carlos Ramos a liar.
Osaka, who has since turned 21, somehow stayed calm in the bedlam to beat her childhood idol, but was reduced to tears as the crowd booed during the post-match presentations  angry at the perceived unfair treatment of the queen of womens tennis.
Patience paid off for two of the WTAs ultimate battlers.
Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki beat Simona Halep on an oven-like Rod Laver Arena to win the Australian Open and claim her first Grand Slam title, at the 43rd attempt.
A few months later Halep became the first Romanian to win a Grand Slam title for 40 years as she beat American Sloane Stephens at Roland Garros.
COULDNT BREATHE
She had lost her previous three finals, including the year before in Paris from a winning position, but after losing the first set against Stephens roared back to claim the most popular victory of the year.
In the last game I couldnt breathe, I just didnt want to repeat what happened the other years, Halep, who finished 2018 as world number one, said.
Germanys Angelique Kerber ripped up the script at Wimbledon. Serena Williams had looked unstoppable during a blazing fortnight on the All England Club lawns and was odds-on to claim an eighth singles title, equal Margaret Courts 24 slams and become the first mum to win Wimbledon for 38 years.
With support in the Royal Box from friend Meghan Markle, wife of Britains Prince Harry, the stage was set for Serena but an inspired Kerber dropped just six games to become the first German woman to win the title since Steffi Graf in 1996.
That final was controversially played after the conclusion of the mens semi between Djokovic and Nadal, itself delayed by South African Kevin Andersons epic, six-hour-36-minute defeat of American John Isner, 26-24 in the deciding set.
Djokovic took brutal advantage of a fatigued Anderson in the final and later in the year Wimbledon called time on never-ending matches as they announced that from 2019 onwards tiebreaks would be played at 12-12 in the decider.
Wimbledon lit the blue touch-paper for Djokovic who had entered the Championships seeded 12 after slipping to his lowest ranking since 2006. After ending a two-year Grand Slam drought he went 28-3 for the rest of the year, including winning 16 consecutive sets to march to the U.S. Open title where he beat Argentinas Juan Martin del Potro in the final.
