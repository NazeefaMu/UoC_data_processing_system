Colombo's favourite coffee house chain Barista Lavazza, extending their reach to other key areas in Sri Lanka, recently opened its latest outlet in Bentota. Targeting the inflow of tourists to the southern coastal belt, this outlet will feature many of Barista Lavazza's signature beverages and accompanying meals and desserts off the menu.
"Barista Lavazza has quite a unique expansion plan where we first identify locations within the island that our research shows to be viable spots for business.

We are indeed glad to bring Barista Lavazza to Bentota as well and look forward to great customer stories from both the locals and visitors", Brand Manager Lien Keerthisinghe said.

'Children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood fantasies'
A ceremony was held at the Old Galle Hotel to award 200 students who were successful at the Grade V Scholarship Examination, while Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilleke was the chief guest.
Addressing students and parents present at the ceremony, Minister Gayantha Karunathilleke said that children during their tender years are almost forced to compete unlike in the past decades through various examinations they face. They are in the game or the competition to go up the ladder because their parents are in fact in the race or the competition to see their children win the race. This is a tragedy for the children of today, who have lost their childhood, a period of time where they should live their lives in happy surroundings, play games and enjoy life. While it is true that they should concentrate on their studies, their education or studies should not prevent them from enjoying their childhood fantasies. The responsibility of the parents is to provide their children the opportunity to live as children, not barring their freedom, the Minister added. The Minister also went onto say that as a responsible Government, it has planned out a system of education that should be imparted to children.

Chrissy Teigen Shows Off Baby Bump In Cute Crop Top
Chrissy Teigen kept it casual while running errands in Los Angeles on Sunday.
The 29-year-old model and TV personality wore a cute gray crop top showing off her tiny baby bump and paired it with black leggings and black Nike trainers. Teigen announced that she was expecting a child with husband John Legend in early October.
Teigen recently had to defend her baby bump after Instagramming a picture of herself and her growing stomach. Commenters began speculating that Teigen was pregnant with twins and the model fought back against the comments on Twitter.
"I did IVF. One at a time. It isn't twins. I can see the damn thing. Get out of my uterus! - christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 18, 2015"
But it doesn't look like a little Internet controversy will stop Teigen from having more babies. The model told HuffPost Live in May 2014 that she wanted a big family, resembling an "Angelina-Brad-type brood."
"We want a lot of kids," said Teigen. "I would love to have three or four of my own, and then adopt a few. So basically I'll be pregnant the rest of my life."

Corals may be more resilient to climate change
US: Corals may have a greater capacity to survive climate change than previously thought, a new study suggests.
Some corals are more protective than others of their partner algae in harsh environmental conditions. This individual variation among corals could reflect a greater capacity than currently recognised to adapt to changing ocean conditions brought about by climate change, researchers said.
"Our study provides a glimmer of hope that corals can respond to and survive climate change, as long as it's not too fast," said Iliana Baums, associate professor of biology at Penn State University.
"The variation in response to extreme temperature that we observed is the raw material for evolutionary change and indicates that these corals may be more adaptable than previously thought," said Baums.
Reef-building corals depend on single-celled algae called Symbiodinium to provide energy through photosynthesis, while the algae benefit from the corals' nutrients.
"This delicate symbiosis can break down under extreme ocean temperatures associated with climate change," said John Parkinson, lead author of the study and a former graduate student at Penn State.

Not paying guaranteed price for tea
Dullas queries government
UPFA Matara District MP Dullas Alahapperuma has asked the government to explain as to why it has failed to implement the guaranteed price of Rs. 80 per kilo for raw tea buds as stated in the last election manifesto.
The question of MP is pasted on the order paper scheduled to be taken up on November 3 in Parliament.
"Tea smallholders have specially been faced with a severe economic crisis since the tea industry of Sri Lanka has moved towards a serious crisis due to rapid fall in prices of tea buds," the MP said.
MP Alahapperuma said the price paid at present for a kilogram of raw tea buds has dropped to Rs. 54 and all factories are facing risk of having to close down if the price paid per kilogram of raw buds decreases to Rs. 50. Yet it was stated in the last election manifesto that a guaranteed price of Rs.80 per kilo would be paid for raw tea buds.
Alahapperuma also questioned the Plantations Minister whether he could table a report on the tea factories that have been closed down during the past month due to this crisis.
He further inquired the factors that have caused and are even at the moment causing a danger to the tea industry in this manner.
The MP has also asked the measures intended to be adopted to protect tea estate owners, factory owners and millions of people who are engaged in the tea industry.
The government will respond to the query next Tuesday.

DSI 'Sithuvili' Sri Lanka 2015
Fine lines on canvass
The 25th annual awarding ceremony of the DSI Sithuvili' art competition was held at the BMICH recently under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. The President lauded the DSI Samson Group for coming forward and setting an example to the public via DSI 'Sithuvili' Sri Lanka by using its profits for the wellbeing of the country's future children of Sri Lanka. Students above Grade Two from across the country participated in the competition
The event was the climax of the three-day art exhibition held at the National Art Gallery where over a thousand entries that won merit awards and above were on show.
Welcoming the guests Managing Director, DSI Samson Group Kulatunga Rajapaksa, said that the project was intended as a service to the community by an indigenous corporate entity with an unblemished record for fifty three years. "Our firm was founded by D. Samson Rajapaksa and the achievements over the years are in keeping with his vision where we strive to serve the community as a truly Sri Lankan company," he stressed.
Pointing out that 'Sithuvili' project is held purely as a service to the upcoming generation by way of promoting their skills, he said that there is no financial or commercial gain at all from the competition.
He had a special word of thanks to President Sirisena for gracing the occasion in spite of the President's busy schedule to spend time with the children.
Chairman, D.Samson and Sons (Pvt) Ltd. Nandadasa Rajapaksa, reminded the audience that it was the 25th anniversary of 'Sithuvili', a project intended for the new generation to display their talent. "The mind of the child is like a heaven. By the time the child becomes an adult it becomes a jail. Who is responsible for this unfortunate situation Is it the children No - it's the adults," he said.
In addition to the prize-winning children, nine senior citizens received the 'Sithumina' Award for their contribution towards the promotion of arts in Sri Lanka. Among them were Ven. Egodamulle Amaramoli Thero who initiated the erection of the world's largest rock-cut seated Buddha statue in his temple off Kurunegala, Indian sculptor Sthapathi Muttiah, who, though a non-Buddhist, designed the statue and executed the entire operation and Devianayagampillai Easuwaran who contributed bulk of the funds and managed the project.
Other recipients included educationist Jezima Ismail, veteran media personality Dr Edwin Ariyadasa, longstanding songstress Latha Walpola, seasoned actress Irangani Serasinghe, the multi-talented, film director/script writer/lyricist Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and renowned musician Dr Victor Ratnayake.
The event was conceptualised and choreographed by Bandula Nanayakkarawasam.
The remarkably unique feature of the show was the promotion of local values especially through the memory of Professor Senerath Paranavitharena, whose life and service was celebrated by the composition of a song by Nanayakkarawasam. A key part of the entertainment of the ceremony was the total of 23 school children performing along with the expert orchestra with the objective of encouraging the development of skills among the new generation. The award-winning university students of the 'Kavitha' singing competition also performed.
This year's 'Sithuvili' attracted a record number of entries exceeding 100,000, most of which were of a high standard. The initial DSI Sithuvili Art Competition conducted in 1992 attracted 42,000 entries from schools around the island.
The total sum of gifts for participants this year was increased to Rs. 6,000,000/= with the best entries being awarded special certificates as well.
This is a major CSR project of the DSI Samson Group which is among the country's premier business conglomerates and is the leading manufacturer of footwear and bicycle tyres in Sri Lanka.

Govt to allocate six percent of GDP for education - Kiriella
The prsent government would increase the funding for education by four fold during the next year, University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The best gift that could be given to children is education. We will also increase university education funding by hundred percent next year. It is only through the knowledge of children that we could serve the country," he said.
"The government intends to provide special preference to education. We will allocate six percent of the GDP for education as already promised," he added.
Minister Kiriella said so addressing the parents and teachers at the annual prize giving of Buddhist Ladies College in Colombo.
He further said that there is more unity among Indians, because they have an understanding of the various languages used in the different states. We went backward because we failed to learn each others languages despite there being only two native languages. This led to mistrust among the communities, breaking down the friendship and finally to the war,' he added.
Out of 1400 million Indians, 500 millions have a very good knowledge of English. Even at this late stage, many schools have realized the need to teach English. Buddhist Ladies College render yeoman service in this regard to their students. We love our native languages, but we need a command of English to deal with the wider world," he added.

Top 10 green building tips
Green light on green living
To really change society, we all need to push green development forward. Here are some ways to do that:
1. Ask yourself if there's any reason not to build green.
2. Involve affected parties early in the process so you can incorporate their opinions and concerns into the solution, rather than try to find remedies afterwards. Turn suppliers into partners so you can best utilize their knowledge, experience and enthusiasm.
3. Take the entire lifecycle of the building or structure into account during planning. The operational cost of a building over time has traditionally been much more than the initial cost of construction. And look at new financial planning models that support long-term value rather than the lowest cost in the short term.
4. Consider the financial and social benefits of how building green can improve human health, wellness, productivity, social equity, diversity and inclusion. These attributes have the potential to dwarf the beneficial impacts of saving carbon, energy and water, and are relatively easy to quantify.
5. Think long-term flexibility to avoid the high costs and environmental impact generated by rebuilding when having to respond to evolving space needs.
6. Be open to innovative and elegant solutions. Consider the local conditions, local materials and utilize leading technologies. State-of-the-shelf technologies elegantly deployed can transform building today.
7. In the planning and design process, keep the four R's in mind: reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.
8. Define your own plan for the Deep Green journey and make it visible. Start now. Communicate the strategy and operations so everyone involved understands their necessity, and what they need to do. Consider the impact that the occupant and facilities management team has on building performance and inspire all of your building stakeholders to think greener.
9. Consider the positive effects of green building on the brand equity of your company.
10. Again, ask yourself if there's any reason not to build green.

The University of Jaffna had begun the construction of buildings as part of the plan.
Earlier, in her special address, she said lifestyle, family set up, duties, and responsibilities of women of India and Sri Lanka had been the same.
Women should come forward to take up entrepreneurial assignments.
Self confidence was the key to success.
M.M.M. Najim, Vice-Chancellor of South Eastern University of Sri Lanka, said there was a need to motivate and encourage women to start business ventures.
A large number of women, who had lost their husbands in the civil war, had been looking for career opportunities. A section of them had gone for employment in foreign countries. They could be trained on business opportunities.
G. Kannabiran, Professor of Management, NIT-T, said the project on business and management capacity development of rural women entrepreneurs, funded by the Asia Foundation, had come as a boost to bring a number of rural women of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka under the fold of entrepreneurs.
They had been given training on various aspects of entrepreneurship, including raising funds, creating access to markets, augmenting managerial skills, and so on.

Consider us shaken and stirred - in the best way! Kate Middleton waltzed onto the scene at the world premiere and Royal Film Performance of the latest James Bond film, Spectre, on Monday, October 26, wearing an especially sizzling ensemble, complete with a sheer back.
Stepping onto the red carpet at London's Royal Albert Hall, the Duchess of Cambridge, 33, stunned in a see-through, gray blue confection by one of her favorite designers, Jenny Packham. Middleton accessorized with the label's crystal-embellished belt and bedazzled "Casa" clutch, aquamarine Robinson Pelham chandelier earrings (on loan from her mom, Carole Middleton), and her tried-and-true Jimmy Choo platform sandals.
While the mother of two - Prince George, 2, and Princess Charlotte, 5 months - regularly turns heads in her ensembles, this one was especially a standout, as at its base, it is a halter dress enveloped in a sheer overlay, putting her toned back and arms on display.
As she had been for a charitable BAFTA event earlier that day, the duchess was accompanied to the premiere by her husband, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, both of whom looked quite dapper in their tuxedos.
Once inside, the royal trio met with members of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), which helps to support those who work behind the scenes in British motion pictures, as well as representatives from two more charities, Save the Children and Shelterbox.
After that, the royals greeted the A-list cast of Spectre, including Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Naomie Harris (in Stella McCartney), Lea Seydoux (in Prada), Monica Bellucci (in Ralph & Russo), Stephanie Sigman (in Marchesa), and Ben Whishaw.
Spectre is third James Bond film chosen for a Royal Film Performance, which highlights iconic movies (with members of the royal family in attendance!) since it began in 1946. Each Royal Film Performance screening helps to aid the CTBF.
Titanic (1997), Star Wars: Episode 1 (1999), and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) have all been Royal Film Performances. Most recently, 2015's The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was given the honor and attended by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Yahoo

Despite her popularity, Miss Andrews, now 80, was not the only person to secure their spot in the Top 10, revealed today.
The new Star Wars film is due to hit the big screen in less than two months, but fans proved they haven't forgotten about the old films during the survey.
The star cruiser gliding overhead in a galaxy far, far, away in Star Wars Episode IV was voted number four in the poll.
It was the only inanimate object to reach the Top 10, though the flying saucer in Close Encounters and the ship in 2001: a Space Odyssey, found themselves in the Top 100.
Daniel Craig has dominated the headlines of late as Bond film, Spectre, in which he plays 007, was screened at a Royal premiere last night.
But it was actually the first ever Bond film, Dr No, released in 1962, that found itself in the Top 10. Sean Connery was awarded the seventh best entrance, as he introduces himself for the first time as 'Bond. James Bond.', at a card table.
Late Omar Sharif was awarded second place, for his renowned entrance on camel back in the hit film Lawrence of Arabia.

Meet the Jewish doctor who saves Palestinians and the Muslim doctor who saves Jews
ISRAEL: This isn't really a good news story. This is a sad story about a special place where Jews and Arabs come together to heal the broken bodies of victims and their attackers, some of them children.
The staff call them "Bert and Ernie" or "Fried and Eid."
Ahmed Eid, 65, is a Muslim from the Galilee village of Dabburiya. Elchanan Fried, 41, is a Jew from Petah Tikva in central Israel. They both live in West Jerusalem.
Eid wears green scrubs and a scrub cap. Fried wears green scrubs and a knitted kippa. Eid is the head of surgery at Hadassah University Hospital in Mount Scopus. Fried is the head of the Intensive Care Unit. They both keep glancing at the time on their smartphones. They are on call.
For the past month - during a wave of Palestinian attacks on Jews and harsh Israeli responses, including shoot-to-kill countermeasures - the two have worked side by side.

Megalodon teeth washed ashore on US Coast
US: North Carolina has been shocked by the fossilized teeth of an ancient shark washed ashore which are believed to have belonged to a 60-foot (18 plus meters) Megalodon.
Beach goers in Surf City, North Carolina recently bumped into giant 6-inch teeth specimens which once belonged to the king of the ocean, a Megalodon.
The massive shark-like creature, believed to be the size of a large bus, roamed the ocean waters 15 million years ago, long before humans existed.
According to experts, the enormous size of the teeth is indicative of the size of the Megalodon whose massive jaw once housed them. When measuring sharks it is believed that every inch of tooth equals 10 feet in length so the 6-inch teeth are thought to have belonged to a 60-foot creature. Megalodons grew up to 60 feet in length weighing up to 100 tons and became extinct around 2.6 million years ago. It is still unclear as to why the humongous prehistoric sharks died out, but it is thought that ocean cooling may have contributed to the extinction of the species, whereas some also cite a decline in food supply.

Persian Gulf may become unlivable - Study
IRAN: The Persian Gulf region, the center of a high-rise building craze, could experience "intolerable" levels of heat in the decades ahead because of global warming, according to a scientific finding.
Cities like Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Qatar and those in Saudi Arabia besides some coastal cities in Iran's south would face extreme heatwaves by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, the journal Nature Climate Change said.
Heat is projected to exceed the capacity of a young, healthy person to maintain a normal body temperature and maintain survival.
According to the finding, extreme heat that might occur one out of 20 days now will be the normal summer day of 2070 and beyond. Under the circumstances, the heat index which is a combination of heat and humidity would hit 165 to 170 degrees for at least six hours.
In July, the Iranian city of Mahshahr recorded a "heat index" of 74C (165F), believed to be the second highest temperature ever experienced. In their new study, the scientists concluded that conditions in the Persian Gulf region make it "a specific regional hotspot where climate change, in absence of significant mitigation, is likely to severely impact human habitability". Without air conditioning, humans could last about six hours under such conditions before their bodies began shut down, they said.
Thanks to the oil wealth, Arab sheikhs in the Persian Gulf region have embarked on a series of record-breaking projects in a bid to promote the standing of their small emirates.
Dubai, a city-state in the United Arab Emirates, has gone on a spree of high-rise building and creating artificial islands which are seriously impacting the regional ecology.
The researchers said conditions in the Persian Gulf are ideal for creating the kind of steamy cauldron that could make certain areas there close to unlivable.
Last week, Iran's lead envoy at UN climate negotiations said that the country would be able to quadruple its efforts to curb fossil fuel emissions with the removal of Western sanctions. - PRESS TV

Scientists invent chocolate so healthy 'it could be eaten as medicine'
Chocolate so healthy it could be eaten as medicine has allegedly been invented by scientists.
Scientists at an American chocolate company specialising in herbal technologies claim to have developed the "medicinal" chocolate, which contains only 35 per cent fat.
Cacao, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains a variety of antioxidants and minerals, which perform health benefits such as protecting the nervous system, reducing stroke risk and lowering blood pressure.
However, cacao is extremely bitter meaning many chocolate companies sweeten their products with fat and sugar, overriding cacao's health benefits. Kuka Xoco, the Boston-based firm, have discovered a new de-bittering agent in the form of a little-used herb from the Andean region of Bolivia and Peru.
Using micrograms of the plant extract can completely de-bitter large amounts of unsweetened cacao, the company have claimed, developing a prototype with only 35 per cent sugar and fat.
Speaking at the World Chocolate Forum in London this week, Gregory Aharonian, president and chief scientist at Kuka Xoco, said: "This eliminates the need for sugar, sweeteners and much of the fat in chocolate, unleashing the medical benefits of cacao," the Daily Mail reports.
The company's long-term goal, he added, is to develop chocolate with just 10 per cent of fat and sugar.
If the unhealthy ingredients are removed from chocolate, it could be eaten medicinally, Mr Aharonian said. Independent

'Strategic depopulation' of Syria likely cause of EU refugee crisis - Assange
UK: The flooding of Europe by countless waves of refugees may be the result of the "strategic depopulation" of Syria carried out by opponents of the country's government, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has suggested.
Transparency organization WikiLeaks has looked through its diplomatic cables and unearthed "an interesting speculation about the refugee movement," Assange said in an interview with Geek news site, ThePressProject.
"So, the speculation was this: Occasionally opponents of a country would engage in strategic depopulation, which is to decrease the fighting capacity of a government," he explained.
The whistleblower pointed out that "it's predominantly the middle class that is fleeing" Syria on account of having "language skills, money, some connections." Engineers, managers and civil servants are "precisely, the classes that ...[are] needed to keep the government functioning," he said.
Syrian people are encouraged to flee their country "by Germany saying they'll accept many-many refugees, and by Turkey taking nearly three million refugees, thus significantly weakening the Syrian government," Assange stressed.
Syria isn't the only case of migration being used as a weapon in recent history; during the Iraq War, Sweden told the US that "the acceptance of Iraqi refugees was part of its contribution," according to cables.
The WikiLeaks founder said that it's a "disgrace" that the US refuses to take in Syrian refuges because it's Washington who should be held accountable for the hundreds of thousands of people arriving in Europe and making EU states close its borders with one other.

Surya condemns Sarathkumar's hate speech against Kamal Haasan!
Issuing a statement, Surya indirectly took digs at Sarathkumar, who had demeaned veteran actor Kamal Haasan as he supported the opposition party during the heated elections
Popular Tamil star Surya today rued that many "regrettable" incidents, including personal attacks, had overshadowed the campaign leading to the just concluded polls to Nadigar Sangam, or the South Indian Artistes' Association (SIAA), and said the film fraternity should remain united to avoid recurrence of such issues.
In a letter to the SIAA, the actor said that the latest elections had given many lessons to the actors and that many regrettable incidents had happened. "Personal attacks were carried out in the name of criticism. Responsibilities delivered by those while in office were described as favours. Divisions in the name of caste, language and race were made even while insisting that actors were from one family," he said.
The 'Rakhtha Charitra' actor did not name anybody while expressing his concerns, but said even a film's success or failure were turned against rivals to ridicule them while "respectable" senior actors were not shown the due respect for supporting the candidate of their choice and were verbally abused.
"It is everybody's duty to ensure such an atmosphere does not arise again," he said while extending his greetings to the newly elected members.
Surya, himself the son of veteran actor Sivakumar, advised the new set of office-bearers to set themselves as examples in treating senior professionals properly, not consider their duties as favours and work for the benefit of all actors. "Do away with enmity and let us all jointly work for the betterment of the cinema industry," Surya, who has a number of hits, including the 'Singam' series, said. At the end of months of heated campaigning by the rival sides led by young Vishal Reddy and former SIAA President R Sarath Kumar, the elections to the actor's body on Sunday was no short of an action film or general elections. While there were allegations of bogus voting, Vishal was allegedly attacked during a heated argument.
At the end of the day, the Vishal-led 'Pandavar Ani' (five-men Pandava team) swept the polls with M Nasser being elected as President and Vishal as General Secretary even as his backed candidates were elected as Vice-President (two posts) and Treasurer. Bollywood Life

## Title: Try 'a little' feng shui...

Try 'a little' feng shui...
Feng shui is something that most people have heard of, but few have an understanding of what it actually is. When it comes to interior design and architecture, the basic concepts of feng shui can be useful when coming up with new ideas or to develop a greater understanding of space. To help you improve your understanding of feng shui and how it can help your own practice, here are the basics, including 10 feng shui interior design tips to get you started.
What is feng shui
Feng shui is concerned with the flow of energy, or chi, within a space. There can be overly aggressive 'attacking' energy (sha chi) and low energy (si chi). The aim is to get a balance between these two to ensure the energy flow is harmonious. By placing certain objects in different positions around a space, you can manipulate the flow of energy to improve every aspect of your life - health, wealth, relationships, career, etc. While the practical interior designer may turn their nose up at the suggestion of their profession having such a drastic impact, by following the basic principles of the energy flow of a space, interior designers can improve what is often referred to as the 'feel' of an interior space.
Improve your energy flow
The flow of chi energy comes in and out of windows and doors. The aim of feng shui is to place objects within a space that slow this energy and allow it to calmly flow around the space before exiting again. Placing bulky objects in awkward places can cause the chi to build up, leading to a blockage in the energy flow. Conversely, having no objects at all in a space will cause the energy to flow far too quickly. A balance is achieved through developing an understanding of the nature of the objects you have in your interior.
Feng shui tips
Here are a few quick feng shui tips to help you improve your own interior space:
1. Keep the entry clear
The front door of a home is thought to be where the chi gets in. You want to let it in by minimising the clutter that sits around it. Don't place tables, plants or anything near the entry. Keep it wide open and let in all that good energy.
2. Fix any breakages
Anything that's broken in your interior space will prey on the anxiety and frustrations of the person who inhabits it. Keep hinges oiled, make sure locks work well and make sure the doors don't scrape the floor when they open and close. A working interior will lead to a relaxed life.
3. Put the bed in the power position
The best place for a bed to sit is in the furthest corner of the room where you can still see the door when lying down. This will make you the master and commander of the space, leading to a stronger, calmer and controlled outlook on life.
4. Place a bookcase in the hall.
A bookcase (preferably with books in it) should be within the view of the front door, but not blocking it. The energy will interact with the material and encourage learning.
5. Remember to put the toilet seat down.
Open toilets, plugholes and drains will encourage money to drain out of the inhabitant's pocket. Keep the toilet seat down, keep the plugholes plugged, cover all open drains, and open up a savings account.
6. Put plants in the bedroom
By placing three plants in the bedroom you will be greatly improving the romance in your life. Using plants with pink flowers will enhance the romance (or a certain aspect of it anyway).
7. Give your career a boost with better desk placement
In an office, a desk should face the door from the opposite corner. If this is impossible, a mirror should be strategically placed that allows you to see who's coming in the door. If you do this, be prepared to become a winner and stumble upon an abundance of opportunities.
8. Keep the curtains open
Open the windows too. An abundance of natural light and fresh air are essential for good chi. Plants inside and good ventilation will also help clear the air.
9. Focus on the feel of the bathroom, bedroom and kitchen
These three areas are the feng shui 'trinity' and where the energy will thrive. If you get the feng shui interior design right in these three areas you will be in good stead for creating a positive energy flow through the entire interior space.
10. Use water features to your advantage
Water enhances the flow of energy. You don't have to leave the taps running but consider adding small fountains to enclosed spaces to improve their energy flow. - inversearchitecture

Well updated!
Archt. Varuna De Silva will safeguard your dreams with his style of simplicity and at the end of the day you will have a home that is all about you. Your house will truly be your castle. Arch World brings you the wonder of a simple and beautiful home.
Varuna studied at Royal College and then went to the University of Moratuwa where he did his Bachelors and Masters. And subsequently he started lecturing there. As soon as he finished his studies, he started as a visiting design tutor and then as a permanent staff member. And has been teaching ever since. So basically he is an academic and a practitioner in Architecture, balancing both.
"To me, a house is everyone's dream. In Sri Lanka that is your ultimate goal - to be able to build a house. I create buildings which are very simple. My approach to architecture is, I keep things absolutely simple. I don't do anything that is not needed functionally, structurally or spatially," said Varuna.
A home is a lifetime investment. After all the effort and money put into a project, if at the end of the day it doesn't work for you, then that is tragic.
Commitment
The building happens because of requirements. I don't add on things. A project takes about one year. So it is a commitment of one year or more and I think it is unfair for me and the client if we are not on the same wavelength. If a client comes to me, generally that problem does not arise because they come to me if they have seen my previous houses. It is an investment for life. So I keep it very simple. And I tell my clients when we do the house, after designing the house even the furnishing must be kept absolutely simple."
It seems in simplicity there are challenges that crop up. Which is why hiring a capable architect is necessary. "Because I believe to do simple buildings are very difficult. Because if you do a simple building everything is exposed. Structurally it is exposed. If you do a fuzzy building you can hide things by decorations. Whereas in simple buildings, everything is seen and every mistake is seen, so I believe it is very difficult to do a simple building."
Qualified architect
"It is important to go to a qualified architect. In Sri Lanka more and more people are aware of Architecture and qualified architects. You have to go to a qualified person to get your building designed."
A sense of peace is essential to life. And this sense of peace can be given by Architecture.
"If you look at the photos of my projects, you will see that they are very open spaces. They are extremely open and generally I design on small plots. When I design on small plots what I try to do is to get the inside and the outside together. So I have to minimize walls, minimize doors and windows. And then open the house out from the inside.
Outside No need to worry
In Sri Lanka we have this problem where you have no control over what is happening outside. Generally what I try to do is, I try to blank off the front where you are not depending on the outside for anything. What I try to do is, I try to internalize the space and completely open it out.
Within the space I try and open out the house. Whatever happens outside, you don't have to worry. So I try to create a space where regardless of whatever happens outside, your internal space is completely open where you feel you are almost in a garden pavilion."
Interaction
A home should interact with you like a living entity - no matter how inanimate it is. That's a sign of a good home - A home that guards you and your interests every day.
"In Sri Lanka you don't need to air condition your homes. You don't have this problem of massive heat. You open the house and you have cross ventilation and that is all you need.
The outside is completely blank and you don't know what is happening inside. So there is the element of surprise because the outside is completely blank and people are not looking into your house.
I take the requirements of the client and I interpret the requirements and how they live, architecturally.
Architecture is a fast changing field with the technology and materials changing. Because I am a University lecturer it keeps me on the ball! It really helps me in my practice. So I am updated on the new trends. So I am aware of these things."
Design Tips
*If you want to build a house go to an architect. It is architecture that everyone thinks they can do. You don't take up the duties of a lawyer or a doctor do you That is really not a good thing.
*If the building is simple you won't get bored. If you have too many things happening then that is not a good idea. The play of light and how the shadows fall on the walls and how the color changes during the different times of the day- all these factors are important. There is a different kind of ambience and atmosphere within the house and the spaces.

Wild elephant menace, a hinderance to children's education
Wild elephants from the Ampara district invade villages such as Addalaichenai, Palamunai, Ashraff Nagar, Hira Nagar, Meelath Nagar and Sambu Nagar in search of food and residents live in fear.
These elephants enter villages and destroy paddy fields, home gardens and other arable crops, while the daily income of the people have also been considerably reduced.
Due to this situation, parents complain that the education and academic activities of their children are affected badly.
Earlier, elephants enter villages only during night time. But now they enter these villages even during day time.
During day time when school children are studying in their class rooms, elephants enter the school premises in herds, thereby the education of the children is jeopardized.
In December this year, the GCE Ordinary Level examination would be held, but these students are unable to prepare for their examinations due to the wild elephant problem.
In order to chase these elephants out of residential areas, villagers engaged in chasing these elephants by setting fires at various points of the village.
