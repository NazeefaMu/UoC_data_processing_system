Reconciliation should go to school curriculum: Chandrika
Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairperson former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga yesterday said that reconciliation should be included as a subject in the school curriculum.
Addressing a ceremony to mark the National Integration and Reconciliation Week at Ananda College, Kumaratunga said her office was discussing the matter with the Education Ministry.
The event was part of ONUR's programme to promote national unity and integration at the school level. Kumaratunga said education is not merely about learning subjects, such as languages, religions and sciences. "If we are to cultivate a wholesome education, social education should be a key component," she said.
"We must do a comprehensive study on what social issues we have, what could be the solutions and what we should do about them. The Education Department has consented to include Reconciliation for National Unity as a subject to the local syllabus," Kumaratunga said.
"During my term of office, I included Peace Education as one subject, but the previous regime discontinued the programme. We are going to make it a compulsory subject," Kumaratunga said. She said many Sinhala and Tamil students like to learn each others languages, but the lack of qualified teachers is a major obstacle. She said there is a shortage of 6,000 Tamil language teachers in government schools.
She said government institutions lack officers who can execute their responsibilities in Tamil language.
The former President expressed her anticipation of people abiding by their oath on national integration and reconciliation.
National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie said Sinhala Buddhists are not racists. "When I competed for the Colombo district, there were 23 Sinhala, Buddhist candidates with me. But Sinhala Buddhist people voted and made me the first in the district, as they know I am not a racist," he said.
The State Minister said there are certain groups who attempt to topple the government by provoking racism and religious animosities. "We can never prosper if we give up to ethnic and religious animosities," Fowzie said.

Removed official still powerful at Health Ministry, says GM
An official who had been removed by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne from the Transfer Board which handles doctors transfers, is still very active and blocks all functions of the Board and even prevents the implementation of orders given by the Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama, Government Medical OfficersAssociation (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Office in Colombo yesterday Dr. Zoysa said that the removed official is preventing the implementation of orders given by Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama in connection with doctors transfers in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The official had been removed as a result of a discussion held with Minister Dr. Senaratne on the intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena. But it seems he is much more powerful than the Health Minister.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the disciplinary inquiry commenced on the officials who ignore the orders of the Transfer Board is not complete yet and no action has been taken against such officials. Due to the `operation and intervention of the already removed officials, all transfers of doctors will be delayed until April. He is now changing the lists specially finalised by the Board.
Meanwhile a `Health Ministry Spokesman  is issuing media statements stating that it was the GMOA which was behind closing down peripheral hospitals. A special central committee meeting will be held on January 19th (today) in order to discuss these issues and to take appropriate decisions, he added.

200,000 tourists to Sri Lanka from France by 2020: Jean-Marin Schuh
Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean-Marin Schuh lauded Sri Lanka for its efforts to promote tourism and establish itself as a must-visit destination for French people and said about 100,000 from France visited Sri Lanka in 2010 and over 200,000 will arrive by 2020.
He was addressing a news conference hosted by the Alliance Francaise de Kotte in Colombo yesterday to introduce its new director, Francis Cappe, and to outline how it will expand its activities to teach more Sri Lankans the French language and familiarise them with French culture
Sri Lanka has entered the tourism age, as two million visitors came last year. There were only 30,000 visitors from France in 2010. .
Because of this increase in French travelers, Sri Lanka will need more French-speaking guides in the coming years. The Alliance Francaise de Kotte currently teaches French to about 2,000 Sri Lankans each year. About 10,000 are learning the language in schools and universities, he said.
The Ambassador also explained that those who study French at the Alliance Francaise put themselves in prime position to pursue further study in France.
France wants to receive more Sri Lankan students. French universities are subsidised by the government and are very cheap, which makes them attractive to foreigners, he said, while adding that there are currently roughly 200 students who are either Sri Lankan or of Sri Lankan origin studying in French universities.
Schuh highlighted that the Government of France does not recognise the Alliance Francaise de Colombo on Barnes Place, due to an internal dispute.
The Alliance Francaise opened in Sri Lanka in 1954 and has branches in Galle, Matara, Kandy, Jaffna, and Colombo.

ACCJDENTAL LOVE
Clifford Richards has been in all the right places at the right time. Outstanding Personalities features Clifford Richards who believes that Gods grace and gift of music have done wonders for him.
Q. Clifford, you are a renowned entertainer, singer, compeer, and TV and Radio presenter. What set you on the path to stardom
A. Since my school days, I have been singing and taken part in college musical activities and talent contests. Over the years my involvement grew. I was also involved in university activities such as organizing shows and being a part of shows. That is how it all started. Subsequently, I went into radio and then to TV. It has been a gradual journey.
It was not planned because I am an engineer by profession. Now I am involved in a family agriculture business. This was not planned either. When it comes to singing, over the years I have been doing it, but compeering was definitely by accident.
I have an interesting story to tell you about compeering. One day I went to sing at an event in Kandy. Suddenly they realized that there was no compeer. One of the organizers wanted me to play that part. They said I did it well! That was the start. Actually her name is Indrani Wijesundara. She is a pianist and a leader of a band called Friends in Harmony of which I was also a part for some time. Friends in Harmony play at weddings, parties and functions. I was there to sing, being a part of Friends in Harmony. But there was no compeer that day and she asked me whether I could do it. Reluctantly, I said yes. I was nervous and reluctant to do it because I was never a talkative person. I was a singing person! That is actually fate. It comes to you in strange ways. I believe that it is Gods plan. When I look back at my life, I am satisfied and I always thank God for all that he has given me. It has been a blessing. There is reason for everything.
Q. To be charming is a coveted ability. How did you develop your charm
A. I didnt develop my charm (laughs). This is who I am! I dont put on anything. During my school days and also maybe campus days, I was a totally different person - very shy and not very outgoing. Suddenly that changed. Now this is the character you see. It is mysterious how that character suddenly changed. Now I am not shy at all. It is difficult to say how it happened. When I was at school, girls used to bully me! Now it is the other way around  I bully the g irls! I went to Trinity College, Kandy.
Q. How did you develop your charismatic and dynamic personality
A. Well, I have not followed any personality developing courses or anything of the sort. It is Gods gift and I am using it to enhance my profession. I make the maximum use of my potential. The potential is within me. I have been fortunate that I have been at the correct place at the correct time. Only then, can you build on your potential. You meet the correct person at the correct time and you do your job well. Then things happen. Success depends on the opportunities you receive and how you make use of the opportunities.
Over the years I developed a liking to be a radio presenter. The former director of the Police band DIG Lancelot Perera was instrumental in introducing me to radio, giving me a lot of support. It was through him that I got the opportunity. Some people have the potential and the talent, but most of them are not discovered. They die a natural death and no one knows about them. To be identified is very important. You may have the talent but you need someone to identify you and hire you. Certain people come into your life at certain times and that sets you on the path.
If you dont have butterflies, then you are not human. Noeline, one of my teachers said that having butterflies in your stomach is natural, but you must teach them to fly in formation. Having butterflies is good, but if you let them go out of control, people will notice. Having butterflies is good because it keeps you conscious of your surroundings.
Q. Out of all your concerts, which one do you cherish the most and why
A. I cherish all my concerts. Every concert is different from the previous one. This is because I have to change everything because it is more or less the same crowd that comes. I have done about eight concerts  Clifford Richards Live in Concert. Though it is Clifford Richards Live in Concert, I have dance troupes and duets. I have sung duets with Correen, Dalreen, Noeline, Mariazelle, Stephanie and Chathurika. Being with people like that on stage has been a great honour for me. They have been inspirational. It is a pleasure to work with people like that because they are legends.
Q. Have you reached the zenith of your career
A. My bar is always increasing. There will always be something to look forward to. I always want to do the next event better. I want to test my limits. It is then that you know your true potential.
Q. Who has influenced you the most
A. One person is my wife, Marcelle. She has been very supportive looking after the kids and taking care of their activities. We live in Kandy and I am mostly in Colombo. She has always been a very good critic. She always provides constructive criticism. That has helped me improve.
I dont believe in good times and bad times or auspicious times. Every moment is Gods moment. You have to do everything with a good heart and good intention. The time you do something is immaterial.
Q. What is your message to the youth
A. My message is to be yourself and not try to be someone else. See what you have inside you. Try to bring it out as much as possible. Listen to other people. Be open to criticism. Then you will realize how capable you are and you will do well.
Q. You are a singer. How did you refine and perfect your voice
A. I am self-taught, but I remember going to Lylie Godridge for five or six months many years ago when I was schooling. I went to Maryanne David as well. Besides that, I have never gone through formal training. Of course I do a lot of physical exercise and have started yoga.
Q. Tell me about your involvement with yoga
A. I started doing yoga. I have realized the best thing you can do for yourself is yoga. It will heal you and bring you a lot of relief mentally and physically. Your well- being is very important  mental and physical.
Q. Are you a spiritual person
A. Of course. Like compeering, yoga is an accidental thing. I went to compeer a yoga conference by Anoja Weerasinghe. Until then I did not know much about yoga. I thought the slow motion thing does not work well for me. Listening to the people and doctors who spoke about the benefits of yoga, I decided I should do it. That is how I started. Yoga has nothing to do with religion. Yoga basically makes you a different person. It changes your attitude. It teaches you many things. Sometimes we believe we can change things and change people. When we cant change a person, we get depressed. When someone is ageing you cannot change it. If you cant stop yourself from ageing, how can you change someone else That brings a lot of perspective to life.
It changes the way you look at things. It changes your attitude and changes you physically. Unfortunately, the media does not place enough emphasis on yoga  telling the people about its benefits. Because it comes from India, people associate it with Hinduism and Buddhism. But there is no connection to religion. In yoga, you have Asanas (different poses). Every Asana or pose has a positive impact on a particular organ in your body. When you do the shoulder stand, it stimulates the thyroid glands.
Q. When compeering, do you still have butterflies in your stomach
A. If you dont have butterflies, then you are not human. Noeline, one of my teachers said that having butterflies in your stomach is natural, but you must teach them to fly in formation. Having butterflies is good, but if you let them go out of control, people will notice. Having butterflies is good because it keeps you conscious of your surroundings.
Q. Who are your favourite singers globally
A. Tom Jones, Elvis Presley and Engelbert. But mainly Tom Jones. I love his voice. He is really able to capture the audience. Your level of competency comes second. First comes how well people like you. You can be the best reporter or photographer or singer, but if people dont like you, they wont take you. If they like you, they will take you.
Q. What makes you get out of bed and do what you do
A. It is the joy knowing you can bring a smile to someones face. It is rewarding knowing that you have made people enjoy the occasion. It is the job satisfaction, knowing that you have done something really well.
Q. What motivates you

A. The motivation is definitely due to the grace of God which I believe will always sustain and strengthen me. My familys support is also a blessing. Music to me, is a gift from God. God gives different people different gifts. You are supposed to polish it and make good use of it. If you do not make good use of it, the gifts you have been given will be withdrawn. You have been given something so that you make maximum use of it.

AICPA urges S. Africa's audit regulator to reject mandatory audit firm rotation
The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (the Association) has voiced its strong opposition to a plan by South Africa's Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) to implement mandatory audit firm rotation (MAFR).
In a written response to IRBA's Consultation Paper, the Association, which has offices in Johannesburg, Colombo, Kuala Lumpur, London, New York and Shanghai, wrote that MAFR may have a negative impact on audit quality, increase market concentration to a more limited number of auditing firms, and will hinder, rather than promote, transformation of the profession.
The letter, signed by Association CEO Barry C. Melancon, includes analysis of the most significant factors supporting the profession's longstanding position. It notes that mandatory audit firm rotation: Negatively impacts audit quality, causes loss of institutional knowledge and experience,limits auditor specialisation,creates resource strains,could increase audit market concentration,may result in unintended costs,limits the audit committee's ability to determine the best audit firm for the company and limits ability to attract and retain talent.
The Association believes that each of these factors demonstrates that MAFR should be rejected, the letter stated. It is clear from at least some of the regulatory regimes that have adopted it that MAFR has not had the intended benefits and its continuation is either being questioned or discontinued. MAFR takes away the key responsibility of audit committees which, along with the board of directors, are in the best position to watch management actions and ensure that companies are obtaining high quality audits to protect the investing public.
Concluding that MAFR is not in the public interest, risks harm to audit quality, would impose significant costs on businesses and shareholders without commensurate benefit, would be economically disruptive and create other negative consequences, the Association asks that IRBA reject a move to require it.

A brush with  Colour
S H Sarath is a well known name in the art scene. One of his exceptional features is the skill to use his innate talent in such a manner so as to create a painting which is meaningful as well as entertaining to his viewers. With rich, expressive colours, radiant strokes and a blend of curves, he makes up subtle creations.
S H Sarath
Born in 1947 at Weligama, Matara, Sarath is a remarkable painter with unique talent. His works of art are eye catching and meaningful. Sarath belongs to the post-independent generation of Sri Lankan artists. After completing a five-year course in painting at the Government School of Fine Arts (1968-1973) he followed post graduate studies in art at the Silpakon University in Thailand under a UNESCO fellowship. Thereafter he completed a course in printmaking at the University of South Australia, Adelaide, in 1995.
Sarath's drawings are full of social consciousness, satire, sarcasm, irony and multi-religious philosophy. Each and every drawing portrays a thematic content which is very tropical. He tries to highlight aspects of the prevailing society through his paintings. He has held a large number of both international and local painting exhibitions. . His work of art have been elected for exhibitions held in such countries like Australia, Canada, Norway, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, Bangkok, France, India, Bangladesh, Cuba, Korea, Japan, Brazil, and the UK.

Compostable, biodegradable lunch sheets, bags solution to polythene issue
This is the high time that authorities encourage local polythene product manufacturers to produce compostable and biodegradable bags rather than producing non degradable polythene products which is harmful to the environment, a leading compostable and biodegradable bags manufacturer, Chairman, Plastic Pakaging (Pte) Ltd Mervyn Dias said.
He made these remarks as a response to the recent proposal made by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to increase the thickness of the currently used 20 microns polythene lunch papers and bags to 40 microns.He said although the CEA has brought such a proposal, polythene products badly affects to the environment and therefore suggested to authorities to educate polythene product manufacturers in the country on the importance of producing environmentally friendly compostable and biodegradable lunch sheets and bags. He said compostable and biodegradable papers are manufactured with a globally certified compostable and biodegradable bio- resin.
Chairman Dias also said that they are tested and certified at the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) in Sri Lanka and certified that there is no polythene in compostable bags & sheets.
These sheets are 100% environmentally friendly and degrade within a period of 180 days in an industrial composting plant which has high temperature and high moisture and also the correct oxygen content.
Asked how to identify the compostable bags from other normal bags, Dias said compostable bag has a balloon effect but polythene bags do not have this effect. He said according to a research polythene papers take over 500 years to degrade.He said compostable papers do not have any polythene as they are manufactured using a globally certified compostable and biodegradable resin.
It confirms to international standards for composting European standard EN13432 and American standard D6400 . This can be disposed in a home compost bin as well, but would take longer duration to get it composted. These sheets would also biodegrade to water and Co2. He further said that the daily consumption of lunch sheet in our country is over one million and these polythene sheets are very difficult to recycle as they are soiled with oily food and even if they are recycled It is difficult to collect one million sheets a day.
if using polythene lunch sheets are banned one day then people will have to use compostable products or go to another option of using banana leaves (Kehelkola). But,everybody is personally against the use of banana leaves as it can retard the growth of the tree." he said.
Chairman Dias said that his compostable and biodegradable products are exported to few countries, mainly to UK during the last 28 years. He also said that during this year he is planning to find new markets in the European region markets such as in France .

Drought and peoples response
Sri Lanka is in the throes of one of its worst droughts in recent memory and alarm bells have been already sounded by the concerned authorities, with the Met Department forecasting that the prevailing dry spell could extend to even May. Already over half a million people have been affected by the drought, with daily TV footage showing large expanses of parched earth and dying crops. Livestock too have fallen prey to the drought, with carcasses of cattle strewn across the arid terrain.
The World Bank has estimated the impact of the drought on Sri Lankas economy to be at US $ 1,080 (Rs.150 billion) while President Sirisena has called for UN, FAO and WFP involvement in drought relief measures.
Drinking water has become a precious liquid to most in the drought affect areas, with television showing pot carrying villagers trekking far afield to fetch what remained of the muddy water in the dried up wells and other water sources. The authorities have sprung into action, dispatching water bowsers to the far flung villagers, badly hit by the drought. The President has also appointed a Multi Institutional Task force to deal with the crisis while other contingency plans have been put into place to confront emergency situations.
The people of Rajarata, it may seem, have been delivered a double blow by the drought, with its multitude of kidney patients starved of water, threatening to exacerbate the problem. The authorities should lose no time in dispatching purified water to the kidney patients in order to alleviate their suffering.
Natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, are visited upon us without warning and whatever contingency plan drawn up is bound to fall well below expectations. The present drought is no exception. But there are measures that could be taken to mitigate the disaster such as conservation of water and energy. For this, the cooperation of the wider public is called for. The President, no less, has called for the switching off of all Air conditioners in all state institutions until the situation improves, with an appeal going to the private sector too in this regard. Calls have also gone out from the CEB to customers to switch off lights and use electricity with restraint, with the drastic decrease in the water levels in the Hydro catchments. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board too have appealed for water to be used sparingly.
Restrictions in the water supply and electricity have been sounded if the situation worsens. Hence the need for drastic measures to curb over-consumption of water and electricity and the appeals gone out to the public in this regard.
But, whether our largely, gadget oriented, present generation heed these appeals is another matter. Not just the young, even the grownups are wont to act in callous fashion. It is hard to comprehend addicts of the multifarious teledramas, switching off their TV sets just to comply with a government request to conserve electricity. Into the bargain we have the next segment of the South African Cricket tour where the one day matches, which is a bigger draw than the tests, will unfold, with the games going late into the night. It is difficult to imagine that cricket fans will forgo the pleasure of watching the Lankan team in action just to please the government. With the cricket mania what it is today in this country, there is little doubt that there is going to be a heavy draw on the national grid during the One Day series.
But the public cannot be faulted for the present energy crisis. All governments procrastinated over the power projects, fearing a negative political fallout. To his credit, Mahinda Rajapaksa went ahead with the Norochcholai project, overcoming the objections, but for which the energy crisis would have been exacerbated. The government should, at least, at this stage, think of going for alternative energy sources to meet the ever increasing demand. Besides, the foreign investors who are expected to descend on the country, in their numbers, in the near future, are bound to frown on power cuts.
Be that as it may, it is hoped that the general public, particularly the urbanites, would restrict their use of water and electricity until the crisis is overcome. Vehicle owners should find alternative means for washing their vehicles. They could easily do this at some river or canal bank instead of using the water from the main supply. Housewives too can help by restricting the watering of plants at their homes. Water taps could be opened partially, without turning them at full force. The young too could assist by cutting their time at the computer or by knocking off fans or ACs.
This country has seen through many calamitous situations in the past, such as the Boxing Day Tsunami, and come out the better for it. This is because as a nation we are known to be a resilient one. Similarly it is certain that we will see through this crisis situation and be better for the experience which will equip the authorities to deal with similar crisis in the future successfully.

Executive promise!
Politics is sometimes all about timing and being in the right place at the right time, even if it is unintentional. The leaders of the present government, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will certainly agree.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe happened to be at the right place at the right time when he first assumed that office. That was way back in May 1993, when then President Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated by a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber. Then as Industries, Science and Technology Minister Wickremesinghe was also Leader of the House. That is how he came to be chosen as Prime Minister by the incoming President, D. B. Wijetunge.
President Maithripala Sirisena chose to be at the right place at the right time in November 2014, by defecting from the ruling United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) defying President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The rest, as they say, is history: he achieved an election victory that few believed was possible, against all odds as the Rajapaksas had established a stranglehold on most state agencies by being in power for a decade.
Presidential election
In recent weeks, there has been much speculation about the presidential election, supposedly due in 2020. Who will be at the right place at the right time in 2020
The speculation was triggered initially by Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake. Addressing a meeting at his home turf in Anuradhapura several days ago, Dissanayake said that President Sirisena would be the best candidate for the next Presidential election in 2020 to represent the SLFP.
Dissanayake posed the question as to whether Rajapaksa could contest and provided the answer that he could not. He then argued that the only person from the SLFP who was eminently suitable was none other than President Sirisena. To be fair to Dissanayake, he did say that the President has said that he would contest the Presidency only once.
Dissnayakes statement fuelled speculation in political circles that President Sirisena might be reviewing his options in view of his public pledges not to run for President again. This is because Dissanayake is known as a strong Sirisena loyalist and one of a handful of parliamentarians who defected along with Sirisena when he left the Rajapaksa government in November 2015 to contest the Presidency.
Controversial statements
Duminda Dissanayakes statement was followed a few days later by the other Dissanayake in the SLFP making a similar statement. S B Dissanayake who himself is a former General Secretary of the SLFP said that a majority of party members were requesting that the President should run again.
As leader of the SLFP he cannot disregard a request by party members; I hope he will agree to contest, Dissanayake, who is well known for his controversial statements, said. This statement only added to the rumour mill that the President was keen to contest presidential elections again.
Of course, S B Dissanayake is not a Sirisena loyalist in the calibre of Duminda Dissanayake. The former minister, who had held the portfolios of Sports, Samurdhi and Higher Education, has served under Chandrika Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena and even in a United National Party (UNP) government headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Nevertheless, as a senior SLFPer, his comments were noted with concern.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne, fronting the media for the Cabinet briefing a few days later, was grilled on the issue. He provided an entirely different response. He put a dampener on all speculation, asking what election
His argument was that the government had come to power on a strong pledge to abolish the Executive Presidency and that this would be achieved by 2020. Hence the question of who would be candidate at that time would not arise, Senaratne said.
Senaratne too is known to be a strong Sirisena loyalist. He too left the Rajapaksa Cabinet along with Sirisena in November 2015. Whatever his detractors say, Senaratne has been consistent in demanding the abolition of the Executive Presidency for decades, ever since he was a young leftist in the health sector trade unions, bearing the brunt of the J R Jayewardene Presidency.
As such, it is apparent that even loyalists of President Sirisena are sending mixed messages. Although there was some confusion as to whether the SLFP had formally taken up the position that the President should run again in 2020, this was not so. The matter had apparently been discussed at meetings of SLFP ministers in President Sirisenas presence but the President had been noncommittal. It certainly hasnt been endorsed by the partys highest decision making body, the Central Committee.
It is interesting that this issue is coming to the fore now, three years before any potential election. It is also noteworthy that the SLFPs would-be rival at any such election, the UNP, has been maintaining a dignified silence on the matter. These two factors may, in fact, provide an understanding about the political undercurrents related to the controversy.
It is no secret that there is a cold war in the SLFP between the Sirisena and the Rajapaksa factions for control of the party. Moves are afoot for the Joint Opposition (JO) to function as a separate political party in the form of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). However, Mahinda Rajapaksa remains a member of the SLFP. The JO does command the support of a majority of members elected under the UPFA banner at the last elections.
Rajapaksa himself has thrown down the gauntlet, saying that 2017 will be the year in which the government is toppled. However, as long as the Constitution remains what it is and an Executive Presidency is in place, he will not be able to return to power as he is now debarred from running for President under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
If, on the other hand, the Constitution reverts to a system of government headed by an executive Prime Minister, Rajapaksas political life will receive the oxygen it desperately needs. The statements by the SLFP ministers who want President Sirisena to contest again must be viewed in this context.
Some sections of the SLFP who are keen to see the party kept away from the clutches of the Rajapaksas see the continuation of the Executive Presidency as a means of achieving this. Therefore, they are proposing that President Sirisena should run again, despite the public pledges he has made saying he would not do so. This is also why the UNP is silent on the issue, letting the SLFP fight its own internal battles. To be fair by the President, he has not yet publicly expressed any desire to run again for the Presidency. What he has said in public is that he will not contest the highest political office in the country again.
Election campaign
Abolition of the Executive Presidency was a key aspect of his campaign and that endeared him to the masses and won him the election. After his election victory, he has reiterated his pledge several times: at his inauguration at Independence Square, a few days later at the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy and again a few months later, at the funeral of Venerable Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera who provided the spiritual inspiration for President Sirisenas election campaign. However, President Sirisena has also not denounced or dismissed outright the comments made by some of his ministers and that sustains the speculation that he too might be weighing the pros and cons of the suggestion made to him by colleagues in the SLFP.
As a politician, he is entitled to do so but he could also choose to be a statesman instead, and keep his promises to the nation by abolition the Executive Presidency and restoring a system of government that reinstates the supremacy of Parliament. History is usually kinder to leaders who are remembered for what they did, compared to leaders who are remembered for what they did not do.

Foreign referee ensures that its a clean game
On Sunday evening the key Dialog A division rugby game between Kandy SC and Navy SC at Nittawella proved beyond doubt that it is the right choice of referee that not only changed the game pattern but it was very efficiently handled. Rugby referees often have a difficult job on their hands. Unlike other sports, rugby laws can at times be very complicated and are subject to constant reviews and renewals.
Sam George Jones, an Englishmen born in South Hampshire and now a resident of Perth was brought down to referee the all-important game in Kandy. By some distance he has a promising career ahead of him if he can maintain his fitness and doesnt get ahead of himself. This 19-year-old referee who migrated to Australia when he was seven years of age is sure to hit the top. He is a member of the Western Australian Rugby Union Referees Association and a student of the University of Western Australia. He arrived in Sri Lanka on Friday, and he was in the company of Imran from SLRFU and left on Tuesday.
Jones said that he enjoyed the game, and if invited once again he would be pleased to accept the offer. He said, as a young referee he may have been under-appreciated but he did the job in a positive manner, looking to keep the game flowing by being quick to penalize players who do not roll away or release, something that fans appreciated. Possessing a strong character Jones had the courage to take complete control of the game in front of a stadium almost house full. He seemed to have a good rapport with the players and his consistency was a benefit to the game. He uniquely became popular amongst the players and the spectators. There were no issues at all or referring to the Linesman, Commissioner or the TMO. This young referee has mostly blown in schools games and this was his first big game against a packed house.
Jones said both sides played a clean game without any cause to reprimand any player adversely and the spectator behavior was very good. The winning team forwards were in top form and due to their forwards good work they won the match and accumulated points. He said his club in Australia is packed with 30% each of Englishmen, New Zealanders and South Africans and with only 10% Australians. He said that in rugby teams should learn to play a clean game with no mistakes, its only then the game is enjoyed by the spectators and the players develop for their future.
He said the winning team played to their skill levels and that too in the style they wanted, but that was simply because the forwards were together won good ball and fed their three quarters to score. Today according to the Referees Society except for Kandy SC and CH & FC all other clubs have asked for foreign referees.

Google Play and iOS apps demand surges in India and China
The two leading app stores both experienced a tilt towards Asia in 2016, according to an annual study.
India leapfrogged both the US and Brazil to become the nation that downloaded the most apps from Googles Play Store, according to analytics firm App Annie.
It also claimed that China became the biggest source of revenue for Apples iOS App Store for the first time.
However, the BBC understands that Apples own figures contradict this.
They suggest China still lagged behind the US and Japan last year. The tech firm has, however, not commented on the 2016 Retrospective report. A spokeswoman for Google also declined to comment. Google and Apple both take a cut of software sales and in-app fees from third-parties that publish on their respective platforms.
Their differing successes are explained by the fact that Google Play does not operate in China, while iPhones have a much smaller share of the Indian market than they do in most other countries.
San Francisco-based App Annies research is widely used by app publishers and others involved in the digital industries.
We are always confident with the data we release in our reports, attributing the estimates to a veritable degree to accuracy, a spokeswoman said.
In total, it said more than 90 billion apps were downloaded via the two stores over the year.

Growing up with Geo-strategy
Following years of civil unrest, Sri Lanka is now finding its feet as an influential country in South Asia for trade.
Sri Lanka, though a small island state, lies at the tip of the South Asian subcontinent and at the centre of the Indian Ocean. In a vastly interconnected world, the sweeping effects of globalisation; Chinas economic downturn; growing discontent and destabilisation in the West; and Indias enhanced involvement in the region as an emerging power, have all been major thrusts of global politics in 2016. Sri Lanka remains at the centre of it all, enjoying great geostrategic importance, owing to its deep harbours and trade-friendly location.
A review of 2016 suggests that in the coming year Sri Lankas domestic and foreign policy decisions will likely continue to have an increasing impact on the broader dynamics of Southern Asia as a whole.
Perhaps the most significant decision taken by Sri Lanka in 2016 was in relation to recommencing construction of the Chinese-funded Colombo Port City. The port city project, initially halted after the change in regime, is now back on after several protracted negotiations. Envisioned as a $1.4 billion financial centre of skyscrapers, luxury hotels, shopping malls, and a marina, it gives China a lease on 110 hectares of the port city (2/5 of the project area) for 99 years, and attempts to fill the gap of a financial hub between Dubai and Singapore.
Trade, investment and tax policies
By some accounts, it is expected to be a quasi extra-territorial zone with its own laws and authority to offer favourable trade, investment and tax policies. These port cities have become indispensable as logistical centres to handle greater volumes of people, cargo, and trade than ever before. They are expected to attract volumes of tourism and create new employment opportunities across different sectors.
Within the region, India has been growing concerned about an increasing Chinese presence in Sri Lanka, including the re-commencement of the port city, and the projected sale of stakes in another port, along with the docking of two Chinese submarines in the recent past. As the relationship between Sri Lanka and China continues to grow, we can only assume what ramifications it will have on geopolitical balances in the region, and the geostrategic interests of the multiple powers interested in the Indian Ocean region. Simultaneously, it is critical to remember that China remains one of Indias greatest trade partners.
In 2015, Sri Lanka co-sponsored a resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council, committing itself to promoting reconciliation, accountability, and human rights post-conflict. Several domestic policies, mechanisms, and developments have manifested in the past year to implement this commitment. The passage of legislation for setting up the Office of Missing Persons and wide public consultations on constitutional reform and reconciliation mechanisms were key developments in 2016.
Another milestone was the passing of the Right to Information Act, the result of a two-decade long campaign of civil society and media activists, ensuring that the right to information is finally a reality all across South Asia! Though liable for critique for their respective shortcomings, these changes have contributed positively towards Sri Lankas image globally.
Most recently, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), an independent US government agency, selected Sri Lanka for a new MCC compact (five-year grant) to encourage economic growth and reduce poverty. The criteria for the above grant calls for the demonstration of a commitment to just and democratic governance, investments in its people, and economic freedom. Similarly, the inaugural US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue, held in February 2016, implies a positive shift in Sri Lankas relations with the West. The multiplier effect of this, on the rest of South Asia, relates to the aforementioned improvement in trade and investment. In a globalised word, cooperation like this contributes towards greater collective prosperity for the region.
Regional economic development
Despite shared interest in regional economic development, however, regional cooperation and the role of SAARC continues to falter due to various deep-seated conflicts and tensions. Despite the existence of the South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement (SAPTA) and South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), inter regional trade remains as low as 5% in South Asia.
The recent indefinite postponement of the 19th SAARC Summit speaks to this. A boycott of the summit to be held in Pakistan, initiated by India, was endorsed first by Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Sri Lanka became the fifth nation to endorse the postponement, echoing the idea that until a more conducive environment is fostered, the pursuit of regional cooperation will be limited. The question therefore remains what implications these decisions, in the broader global context, will have on the future of SAARC and the region.
Year 2016 also marked negotiations regarding the Indo-Sri Lanka Economic And Technology Cooperation Framework Agreement (ETCA). Although the agreement has not yet been finalised, it remains widely controversial in Sri Lanka.
The agreement promises trade in services and technology in sectors such as IT and shipping, also enabling movement of professionals back and forth. However, this has implications both in terms of providing job opportunities and in augmenting competition. It remains to be seen whether this agreement will truly stimulate growth and trade for the region.
Finally, the past year also saw Sri Lanka restarting negotiations to regain Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) Plus status, after the European Union (EU) withdrew these benefits in early 2010, following the end of the civil war. GSP with the EU is significant because nearly 30 percent of Sri Lankas exports go to the EU, and it accounts for 43 percent of Sri Lankas apparel exports while also being a leading market for fishery products, coconut products, cut flowers and foliage. However, both Pakistan and Bangladesh, who are Sri Lankas direct competitors, particularly in terms of apparel, currently benefit from the EUs special concessions and incentive plan but Sri Lanka doesnt.
The possibility of regaining GSP Plus from the EU is closely linked to shifts in Sri Lankas foreign and domestic policies. While confidence is strong that increased growth for Sri Lanka will have positive effects on the rest of the region, the question of competition may also prompt cause for apprehension, particularly in light of growing concerns over economic instability and regional competition.
More than ever, it is apparent that whilst maintaining its strategic interests, for the shared prosperity of the region, Sri Lankas policies and decisions need to be articulated in a manner that transcends boundaries and fittingly balances the multiple actors and interests circling its waters. - South Asian Voices

Harmony of religions
I did not think that my recent pola day encounter with Kenyan-born nun Sister Estelle would be a sort of precursor to culminate in an awareness never to have been experienced before. It was out of the blues that she emerged from that motley crowd having sighted me from a distance and even before the usual Sri Lankan pleasantries could be exchanged asked, what are you doing tomorrow evening I said,Sister, what the next minute has in store, one never knows.
Well if you find time why dont you come to church for our Christmas party she said.
For one to whom all religious places of worship and chantings disturb my inner peace for my belief in God being a non-traditional acceptance of doing the right thing with no conflict of interest, this caring invitation led me to a kind of reluctance and trepidation that I dare not disclose to her with the ultimate thought that there could be some message in this whole exercise as Sister Estelle herself proclaimed the following day, nothing happens by accident.
My ignorance of procedural formalities at such functions compelled me to inquire friends of the Christian fraternity about the dos and donts that entail such a function and was informed that not being a part of the congregation licensed me to the non- adherence of whatever religious protocol the gathering warrants. I stand to disagree with their belief as my not being a part of the congregation - for had they specifically mentioned visible congregation I would not have minded for who or what is to decide on my congregational membership
And so, come 4 oclock the following day on January 1st, I was there at the church only to be welcomed by Mother Theresa whose life-size picture celebrated the sprawling church entrance. As I walked down the silent corridor, I was soon to be in the company of the affable resident Priest Father Antony Christy whose first question to me was whether I was a Roman Catholic. Unbound by the fetters of formal religion, my soul wriggled in trying to reach out for an answer. Addressing him I said, Father, when the Buddha sat under the Bo tree and reached enlightenment he did not call it Buddhism for the Nirvanic state cannot be labelled. The whole exercise of labelling is worldly and relative. Nirvana being an unrelated state of absolute bliss and peace has nothing to do with whatever is relative. Likewise, when Jesus reached Mt. Olives and fell down in a spiritual swoon, he did not label it as Christianity. So did Prophet Muhammed when in the cave atop Mt. Hira he was confronted with the highest spiritual bliss he would not label it as Islam. The purity of perfection or truth cannot be labelled. The segregation of congregational divisions was not their creation and aim but arose from social constructs to keep the system alive.
With raised eyebrows and dropped jaws Father Christy listened to me very attentively and we parted our ways on entering a beautiful summer house where the party per se was to take place. A band played and the hands behind each instrument were all special youth. The timing was perfect. The beat very vigorous. The vocals resonant. Followed by all this was the elders drama highlighting a moral ending of poetic justice. Then came the girls that lined up for a dance item. After their traditional greeting before the audience, they put on a splendid performance - the youngest - a 4-year-old stole everyones heart as she daintily stepped to rhythm and song. Their shortfall was a few donations of musical instruments to come their way not to forget a piano, even a used one some kind soul is willing to part with, which for these children will illumine their lives. They are all residents of the home run by the sisters of Mother Theresas church at Wellawa in Kurunegala. Going by their performance, it was indicative of the reservoir of talent these inmates are gifted with and such donations would surely facilitate their recovery as well.
This dedicated team of nuns is from Nigeria, Kenya, India, the Philipines and Bangladesh - the youngest at 22 sister Sabina, the only Sri Lankan over here. Caring for 60 elders and 15 special youth  with absolutely no foreign funding is no piano  yet their heart is in the matter  as they face Jim Reeves hymn dedicated to Christ, one day at a time. To the numerous other religious establishments and ironically some within the Christian denomination itself that prioritize money over all else, these nuns indeed are emulation worthy as they live up to Mother Theresas cherished ideals needless to mention those of Jesus Christ himself.
Besides, it was the grandest Christmas party ever for this writer - the grandeur of which came off in its high degree simplicity. Devoid of the vanity, pomposity, cock of the walk arrogance, conceit and sophistication that hallmark Colombos elite gatherings come Christmas or otherwise, the simplicity of this small and humble gathering was a memory enhancer ever to remain there even in the years to follow. Artificiality was not within their realms. Recalling from scripts were not their bane. Everything was so very spontaneous and natural as the inmates took the evening by storm till the sun went down casting its last rays on the tiny but well kept lawn that bordered the beautiful summer house.

Hear the trees whisper!
Architect Shobha Senaviratnas strength as an architect comes from her understanding of nature. She is truly a gifted architect in this respect. Having had the opportunity to work with Architect Minnette de Silva, the first female to be trained as an architect in Sri Lanka, Senaviratna has 26 years of professional work experience.
When beginning the process of a design, in addition to gathering data from the client about his or her lifestyles and requirements (the clients brief) and the site requirements, we have to identify the energies available at the site and existing trees - the cosmic energy or the positive energies. We are part of nature. When constructing buildings we should not harm nature. Natural disasters are a result of destroying nature. When disrupting nature, the bio diversity is affected. Therefore, we need to visit the site and identify these things, said Senaviratna.
In the good old days, people used to call it Vastu. Vastu mostly considers the energy. First of all, we have to find a good place to live. There should be a lot of positive energy. Mainly the source of cosmic energy is the sun.
You need to bring positive energy into your interior space. You can do this in the orientation of your house. When designing according to spaces, you have to consider how you are going to get natural energy into the interior spaces, stated Senaviratna.
An architect analyzes site data and client requirements, and comes to a conclusion. They develop a theme or concept depending on the information. Then you know the ingredients for the house.
We develop the theme and then decide on what kind of line types, colours, textures and shapes you need to get the form, define the shape or the spaces that is done by the lines. It can be two dimensional or it can be three dimensional. For lines, there is a psychology. For example if there are horizontal lines, it is more calming and relaxing. When you have more horizontal lines it is more relaxing. When the lines are curvy or wavy, it is more nature-friendly, pointed out Senaviratna.

You can define something only through the lines. For example, even when you consider fashion, tall people should never wear vertical lines. That makes them appear taller. Short people should never wear horizontal lines because then youll feel shorter. That expresses many things. This applies not only to lines but even to colours.
There is a psychology to colours as well.
There are three types of colours, cool colours, warm colours and neutral colours. Warm colours are red, yellow and orange. They are highly intensive and visually attractive. Cool colours are green, blues and purples. They are visually less attractive. When you have neutral colours, you feel relaxed. When you have a lot of red, you feel very warm, explained Senaviratna.
Nature colours are cool colours such as the blue sky and the green environment. In nature, greens and blues dominate. But for a sign on the road, we use warm colours to emphasize something. It stands out well rather than a cool colour or a neutral colour.
For example Ruwanwelisaya Dagabe is completely white. The sky is blue and the background is lush green. It stands out very well. White is a neutral colour according to colour psychology; a certain peacefulness is expressed. Just imagine Ruwanwelisaya in red! added Senaviratna.
With concept analysis, an architect will be aware of the kind of line types he or she has to use. The second thing is the finishes. The surface quality matters a lot. Everything has to be considered.
We do everything according to client requirements and our understanding of the Client Brief. Once we get the proper concept or theme, we will know the kind of colours, line types, textures and finishes are necessary for the spaces. That is the point we start our design, said Senaviratna.
Architecture is not only about arranging spaces. It is all about connecting nature and buildings - the interior and exterior. Even though my house is in a housing scheme, I dont feel that we are in a housing scheme because it is connected to nature.
Moana is one of Senaviratnas favourite movies because it is all about nature! She pointed out that if people dont respect each other, how will they respect nature
Though trees cannot speak, they can hear us! I am telling you this seriously. It is not a myth. For example, when they were constructing Ruwanwelisaya, there was a huge tree. And there is a god presiding over that tree. Before constructing Ruwanwelisaya, they had to receive permission from the spirit presiding over that tree. Those days before cutting any tree you have to get permission from the spirit presiding, informs Senaviratna.
Trees can hear us. Definitely, why not She enthusiastically points out.
There was an orange tree that was almost dying in the land I purchased recently. I refurbished the house. We wanted to have more garden rather than the house. So I touched the tree and prayed for it. I watered it and looked after it well because I love that tree so much. I was so thrilled to see it responding. Even animals, though they cant speak, they can feel, shares Senaviratna.
With regard to architecture, most people think that these are just a few lines and spaces. But it is more than that.
With humans there are Chakras. This is famous in Hinduism and Buddhism. You get the Crown Chakras, Eye Chakra, Throat Chakra and Heart Chakra. You have knowledge and I have knowledge. I have qualifications and I can say I am an architect. If you have the knowledge and not the wisdom, then how can you apply that knowledge Wisdom is the most important thing. Wisdom comes from the Crown Chakra and the colour of the Crown Chakra is blue. It is a cool colour. Even when you are designing, when you are discussing with a client with our experience, we can grab what they want for their house. We can see that. Then we advise them, believes Senaviratna.

HP Designjet celebrates 25 years
HP Designjet launches innovative experience centre at Trident Corporation, to commemorate the Event Building on the famous HP 7550A, HP DraftPro and HP DraftMasters pen plotters and the industry standard HP Graphics Language (HP-GL).
HP reinvented large-format design in 1990, launching the first inkjet large-format printer called HP DesignJet. A new way to print AEC drawings was born.
Printing was made easier and faster than ever before. Back in 1990, it was a printing revolution with HP DesignJet leading the way. Soon after launching a monochrome model, HP introduced color printing, faster speeds, and higher quality images for new applications such as GIS. We stayed true to our identity, making technology better for everyone, everywhere.
With each new printer, with each new detail, from light-resistant prints to multi-functional devices with Wi-Fi, we collaborated with our customers to make the improvements they needed. Our innovations have not only brought reakthroughs in speed, quality capabilities, workflow, consumption and cost, but have enabled the development of new technologies such as HP Latex printers, HP PageWide XL and HP 3D printers.
Now, with more than 3 million HP DesignJets around the world delivering prints after prints, HP DesignJet is a synonym of large-format printing.
In Sri Lanka HP Designjet Partners have been actively promoting HP DesignJet printers and this has helped the Sri Lankan market to grow substantially .
The commitment of Sri Lankan HP Designjet Partners to increase market share of HP DesignJet printers has increased market penetration in key provinces throughout the island.
Sashika Vishan Country business Manager for Singapore and Asia Emerging Countries for Designjet Printers in his keynote speech said, HP Designjet printers give customers cutting edge technology which is unmatched and have created instruments where customers can share their complex technical content with confidence.

Hybrid ventilation: Breathing life into buildings
As buildings become more contemporary in their design, sustainable strategies, such as natural and hybrid ventilation, are becoming increasingly important to a structures core principles.
Not only does such an approach allow for a building to use 60% less energy, it can also drastically improve the air quality for the occupants within. Add to this the impact of government targets to reduce carbon emissions, and its easy to see why more architects are now embracing this green building revolution.
How does it work
Natural ventilation takes advantage of wind and buoyancy in order to drive fresh air through a building. This removes the need for energy-intensive air handling units  which can be expensive in terms of installation, energy use and maintenance. Purely passive ventilation, however, may not always be the best solution for balancing thermal comfort, air quality and energy use in a ventilation strategy which works all year around.
Why use hybrid ventilation
For a start, it costs less to use than some other ventilation methods. By making best use of natural driving forces, an intelligently-designed hybrid mixing ventilation system saves energy all year around, and can lead to much cheaper energy bills:
In summer, fan energy use is reduced or eliminated, by making best use of the natural driving forces.
In winter, heating bills are greatly reduced, through the use of mixing ventilation to recycle the internal heat gains.
In fact, according to a Carbon Trust case study, a building which uses natural or hybrid ventilation can save an average of 30,000 a year on energy.
In the UK, buildings contribute just under half of the countrys total carbon emissions, tackling this issue will greatly benefit the environment on a wider scale. Research, carried out by the Carbon Trust, found that the majority of buildings which utilised natural/hybrid ventilation saved 24  71% of carbon emissions.
A further advantage of of hybrid-natural ventilation is that it typically requires far less maintenance, when compared with conventional AHU air conditioning. Whats more, it gives a buildings occupants more control over their surrounding environment, as well as making them more comfortable.
Educational establishments can greatly benefit from the supply of fresh air; research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests that improving fresh air provision can reduce the rate of student absence due to illness by approximately 3.4%.
A versatile solution
Most occupied buildings are viable for hybrid ventilation. Such systems can work in isolation, but more commonly, they are employed in conjunction with other energy-efficient systems. Offices, schools, universities, health centres and council buildings can all make use of this type of sustainable ventilation strategy.
Although it is best to design and integrate the ventilation strategy at the earliest possible stage, it can be introduced later, as a part of a retrofit project, meaning that existing buildings can still benefit on some level.
So, now that you are aware of the benefits that natural and hybrid ventilation can offer, whats stopping you from joining the green revolution

Iconic Galaxy begins work on US$ 50 mn apartments
Iconic Developments of India will invest around US$ 90 million within the next three years in Sri Lanka for luxury apartments in Colombo and in the South.
The Indian property developer has already invested US dollars 30 million for their first project, 110 Parliament Road, apartments in Rajagiriya opened in 2008.

Iconic Developments Managing Director Rohan Parikh speaking to Daily News Business at the ground-breaking ceremony of Iconic Galaxy apartments said that they see a great demand from Sri Lankans for the project. Given the current booming real estate industry, we see a bright outlook for further development and expansion of our Brand,Parikh said. He said that he does not see any oversupply of apartments for Sri Lanka. Parikh said they will construct two similar apartments in Colombo 5 and 3 and also invest in a villa style housing project in South. We hope to invest around US$ 40 million for these three projects.
The apartments on Buthgamuwa Road, spanning over two acres will be completed by end 2020 and they will build 261, super-luxury, two, three and four bed-roomed apartments housing world class amenities and services to compliment the lifestyles of the buyers. We hope to complete the property in less than two years.
The total investment for the project is US$ 50 million.He said that they were one of the first international investors to invest in Sri Lanka soon after the war and they are up beat on future investments.
The present and the previous governments were both investor friendly and we are happy about it. However we played a waiting game for almost one year after the change of government until some uncertainty cleared.I must say that from our experience that its definitely easier to invest in Sri Lanka rather than India!
He also said that some concessions spelled out in the last budget too were encouraging for both foreign investors and buyers in the real estate segment.
Urban Development and Infrastructure Minister Patali Champika Ranawake, said that the area would be converted to a major transport hub with both the proposed US$ 1.2 billion Japanese funded light railways and elevated road network connecting the Peliyagoda Highway exit with Battaramulla.We will also bring in all government institutions including the Presidential Secretariat to this area under the megalopolis plan.
Iconic Galaxy will be exclusive, self-sustained, environment friendly residences for the elite, uniquely configured and elegantly landscaped, providing an ideal ambience for modern day living, it is more than a luxurious address, it is a lifestyle statement.

India, Sri Lanka talks to develop Trincomalee port in final stage

Sri Lanka is in talks to offer the port of Trincomalee to India. Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Colombos Minister of Regional Development, said that the decision on offering the port to India would be taken soon.
Talks are at present going on between India and Sri Lanka and we hope to offer the Trincomalee port, which is one of the best deep sea ports in the world, to India, said Fonseka.
Trincomalee has been on the table for sometime as Sri Lanka wants to maintain a neutral stand and provide equal access to its ports to both China and India.
Hambantota hurdles
Sri Lankas experience with the Chinese, who carried out major infrastructural work at the Hambantota port in southern coast of the island nation, has put a heavy burden on the country, said Fonseka.
Our experience [with the Chinese] on Hambantota has not been very beneficial as we are facing a heavy debt burden due to the work done in that port. The problems and corruption in the project prompted us to review our policy on infrastructural development. We have currently given the port to a private entity so that some of the more immediate issues are resolved. This arrangement will also address Indias security concerns, said Fonseka, indicating that Sri Lanka is willing to address Indias concerns on the visit of Chinese nuclear submarines to Sri Lanka.
Debt burden
The port of Hambantota was conceived as a major Sri Lanka-China project during the presidency of Mahinda Rajapakse, but the controversy around the debt burden has slowed down the project.
Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, Fonseka, who led the Sri Lankan defence forces during the 2009 Eelam war against Tamil rebels, said that Colombo is aware of its responsibilities in the Indian Ocean region, and is committed to freedom of navigation.
Support for Tamil rebels
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said that Sri Lanka would remain committed to the fight against terrorism and extremist violence in the region and beyond.
Recollecting the fight against the Tamil Tigers, he said that insurgency often receives extra-territorial support, and pointed at the support for the Tamil Tigers from India.
Some political parties and leaders from the southern part of India, extended support to the Tamil rebels at the time of the war due to narrow political interests, he said.

iOM integrates business intelligence solution at Seylan Bank
Business intelligence (BI) is a computer based technique used in spotting, digging-out and analysing data.
iOM BI uses a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical and operational insights and decision-making.
iOM BI also includes technologies such as data integration, data quality, data warehousing, master data management, text and content analytics, among others. iOM recently integrated the Business Intelligence solution to the HR information system at Seylan Bank.
With a staff cadre of over three thousand employees with different banking experiences and skills, to be able to analyse them in order to ensure that its 140 plus branches are optimally staffed was a nightmare. iOM BI allows the HR staff to analyse this information instantaneously.
Customised Graphical Dash-boards immediately alert users of any critical areas.
Some of the Dash-Boards in use currently are Performance Management, Transfer Requests and Transfers, Competency Comparison, Resignations and Recruitment to name a few.
iOM BI with its Drag and Drop capabilities allows non-Technical (ie non IT) HR staff to create their own Analysis Reports.
These reports can not only be created with Drill-Down capabilities but can be exported at the press of a key into an Excel Worksheet, a PDF, a Word document or even a Text file. All reports can also be viewed graphically and can be scheduled to be emailed to any given number of Users.
iOM BI is built using the latest technologies including ASP.net MVC, Kendo UI, AJAX WCF web services and SQL Server data tools such as ISIS & SSAS and is not only 100% web based but is also responsive (re-sizes the output to fit the screen) to any smart devise such as a tablet or smart phone.
Capable of collating together information from different data sources ie SQL, DB2, Oracle etc, as well as Excel spread sheets or even Text files iOM BI has unlimited potential for analyzing data across all industries.
Back in 1979, when IT was at its infancy, iOM (known as EDS at the time) was one of the pioneering system integrators that computurised some of the largest state-owned and blue-chip Organisations across Asia.
Having started as an integrator of Finance, Distribution and Manufacturing Solutions (commonly known as ERP today) together with Implementation and Software Maintenance services, subsequently iOM introduced its own product line for niche markets.

Iran female bodybuilder arrested for un-Islamic photos
TEHRAN, Iran, Wednesday: An Iranian bodybuilder has been arrested for publishing revealing photos of herself on social media, the judiciary's news agency reported on Wednesday.
"One of the female bodybuilders who recently published nude photographs on social networks has been arrested," the agency said.
In Iran, "nude" can refer to any woman who is not wearing a headscarf or revealing parts of her body such as arms and legs that must be covered in public. The unnamed bodybuilder has been sent to prison because she was unable to post bail of two million rials ($50,000, 47,000 euros), the Mizanonline news agency said.
She is thought to be one of two women reported in September to have taken part in an international competition.
Iranian women are allowed to take part in international sporting events, but must respect Islamic rules on clothing at all times. - AFP

Jaffna hopes for the best
Jaffnas streets were buzzing with jovial Thai Pongal celebrations as people crisscrossed the city to visit friends and relatives and attend ceremonies at various Kovils. Children played in the streets while their parents spoke and laughed together, and dogs barked after the loud pops of exploded firecrackers.
When discussing Pongal festivities, people beamed as they proudly described their revered traditions and explained for what they were thankful this year. These were scenes of a rebuilding community that is eagerly looking forward to a brighter future.
As I shifted my questions away from the subject of Pongal towards those of reconciliation, resettlement, and demilitarisation, however, the smiles and pride were largely replaced by blank stares and expressions of irritation.
A home built for resettled communities
While many expressed frustration with what they described as the slow pace of reconciliation measures, others did note that some marked progress has been made in the two years since the National Unity Government took over.
My quality of life is better than it was in 2014. I obviously live a nicer life than I did during the war as well. I have access to a livelihood, live in a decent house, and dont have to worry about the terrible aspects of war, said R. Varagunam, a teacher at a local school.
I am also very happy about the prospect of the return of the GSP+. I think the government needs to be commended on that achievement if it does come through, she said, while adding that she would like to see the government undertake more economic development projects to open up industries beyond agriculture and fishing.
Several people also lauded the government for carrying out various resettlement projects but noted that there can be improvements in this regard.
Many people who had lost their homes during the war have been resettled and are living on their own land. There is still some work to do in this regard, but the housing situation is improving here, said A. Kaviraj, a security guard.
A complaint that many relayed, however, was that the government had enacted legislation but had not actually set up the offices and commissions that were promised two years ago.
I think that the slowness and delayed action has really discouraged a lot of Tamils in the North. We are aware that these institutions are difficult to set up and that the government has to satisfy the Sinhalese Buddhists, but two years is too long to wait, said N. Sivaram, a lawyer.
The government knows that votes from the minority populations from communities like this allowed them to come to power in 2015. They should make every effort to keep the promises they made in the past, he added.
Sivaram added that he and his friends and family are tired of hearing politicians say that they are making progress without providing any proof.
A way forward
Every month there are reports of more progress towards establishing these institutions. But I want to see some action being taken. Hopefully the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms Report (CTFRM) will provide a way forward, he said.
T. Ganeshan, who told the Daily News that several of her friends and family members are still missing, complained about the delays in setting up the Office of Missing Persons.
Every year that goes by makes it less likely that loved ones will be found. To me, this is not a political issue. I can understand delays in setting up the court process, but I just want to know the fates of my friends and relatives, she said.
Perhaps the most contentious issue was the question of whether or not to include foreign judges, prosecutors, and investigators in the hybrid courts. Both the CTFRM and the UN Human Rights Council have recommended including foreigners in the special court.
Many prominent members of the government such as Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe have pointed out that the measure of including foreign personnel in the courts is a violation of Sri Lankas constitution.
Rajapakshe has also argued that the countrys judiciary is fully independent and completely able to carry out any and all transitional justice rulings.
Several opponents have also argued that foreign judges would be biased against those accused of human rights violations and make unjust rulings in favour of individuals from minority populations.
Despite the assurances of an independent judiciary, every Jaffna resident who spoke to the Daily News communicated his or her support for the presence of foreign judges in the hybrid court.
I will have next to no trust in the special courts if foreigners are not allowed to participate in them. The judicial system we have has proven many times that it cannot be impartial when it comes to minority issues. Look at what just happened with the Raviraj case, said V. Ramanathan, who works at an NGO.
Many of the military figures who would stand trial are considered war heroes. I dont think these people would be convicted by a fully Sri Lankan court, he added.
S. Coomaraswamy concurred: I know that most people living outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces will not agree with having international involvement in the courts, but I think that is the only way to ensure justice for those who suffered unjustly during the war, she said.
Alongside the courts issue, people focused on continuing demilitarisation as an essential piece of the resettlement and rebuilding effort.
Need for extra aid and assistance
Resettled citizens
There has been a lot of progress with demilitarisation over the past few years. Just after the conflict ended, there were military checkpoints everywhere, and everyone had to carry their government-issued identity card. But the continued presence of the military in places that they did not occupy before the war concerns me, said P. Thiranagama, who works in advertising.
Im not saying the military needs to leave completely, since I dont think that will ever happen. But they are still on lands that belonged to the people, she added.
The frustration for most of those who spoke to the Daily News lies in being given promises that as of yet have not been kept.
The government has changed, and it is now much better than the one Rajapaksa headed, but the mechanisms within the government seem not to have improved, said Varagunam.
The Tamils and Sinhalese remain divided. The fact that Parliament sings the National Anthem in Sinhala and Tamil is a nice symbolic gesture, but I think it finally does not do enough to bring the country together, she said.
I wish there were more of a Sri Lankan national identity, but perhaps the current government can help foster that if it is given more time, Sivaram said. Though most people agreed on issues related to what the government has or has not done since it came to power, their views of how the Tamil population should be treated differed widely.
Some, like B. Ramachandran, argued that, because they experienced the worst of the civil conflict, Tamils should be given extra aid and assistance.
We suffered greatly during the conflict, so I think it is only fair that we receive more economic support than those who were not as affected by the fighting, he said.
I think the Northern and Eastern communities could do with more help in order to level the playing field, he added.
Others, however, pushed back against this idea of exceptional treatment, arguing that Sri Lanka can become a more unified country if people try to put aside their differences in order to get along.
We as Sri Lankans need to try to fit in with one another. There is too much concentration on our differences. If we treat each other as Sri Lankans first and foremost, and the government follows suit by treating everybody the same way, I think that there is a lot of hope for the people of this island, said A. Sathavisam, an employee at a bank.
Indeed, Sathavisam argued that the focus on politics could take away from the equally important building of understanding and brotherhood between not only Tamils and Sinhalese, but also Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.
The glory and the curse of this island lies in its ethnic and religious diversity. If we can learn to accept each others differences and focus on our similarities and achieving shared goals, there is no doubt that we can build a unified and peaceful country, he said.
Sathavisam maintained that some kind of route outside of the explicitly political realm could lead to improved ethno-religious relations: Politics has not succeeded in smoothing over the differences of the people of Sri Lanka. I think we should look at different methods of reconciliation and building understanding.

Thus besides being a unique product, and supremely cost effective, it also ensures the conservation of scarce natural resources such as sand.
In keeping with JATs Green Policy, Master Plaster respects the boundaries set by global environmental protection regulations which frown upon the excavation, transportation and usage of river sand in the building industry. Sand mining has immense long-term negative effects on the environment. With the introduction of Master Plaster, we eliminate this issue and offer an easier, cheaper and environmentally friendly product, said Managing Director of JAT Holdings Aelian Gunawardene.
The conventional manner of constructing walls is to use bricks or blocks and finish with coats of plaster done through a process of sand-cement plastering using POP/putty pruning. Now, with a single, direct coat application of Master Plaster, this costly and archaic two process method of plastering has been eliminated, affording optimum, cost effective results.
As the leader in Sri Lankas furnishing and finishing industry, were very happy to introduce this revolutionary product which will dramatically change the face of the industry. This is a high performance, cost effective and environmentally friendly product which offers new possibilities and takes the concept of plastering to the next level and thus to international standards. I have no doubt that this product will be accepted by thousands of masons across Sri Lanka and help them in their daily operations, Gunawardene added.
The revolutionary cutting edge technology of Master Plaster guarantees a staggering 70% saving in both time and cost by incorporating user-friendly innovation.
Its ready-mix configuration helps the simplest of masons to achieve the most professional of outcomes compared to the trial-by-error means adopted by traditional methods. The elastic properties of Master Plaster certify the complete elimination of hairline cracks which inevitably result from the sand-cement plastering method.
Yet another of the merits Master Plaster boasts is its light weight properties when compared to sand cement, hence reducing the dead load on structures.
In keeping with JATs Occupational Health and Safety safeguards, the fire-retardant composition of Master Plaster makes it non-combustible thereby significantly reducing the risk of a loss of lives and property through accidental fire.

largest ever heroin haul: AG to indict Lankans, foreigners involved
The Attorney General is considering indicting several foreigners and Sri Lankans for alleged smuggling of the largest ever heroin haul into the country.
Senior State Counsel Suharshi Herath appearing for the Attorney General informed Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke that the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) has concluded its investigation and sought the Attorney Generals advice in order to institute legal action against the possible suspects.

The Senior State Counsel made these submissions when the revision applications filed by three foreigners held in remand custody were taken up before Colombo High Court. The revision applications were fixed for inquiry on March 14. Sixteen suspects, including thirteen foreigners and three Sri Lankans allegedly involved in the largest ever heroin smuggling incident in the southern seas had been ordered to be further remanded by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. The 10 Iranians, three Sri Lankans, a Singaporean, an Indian and a Pakistani produced before Colombo Fort Magistrate, are being held in remand custody.

The long hard road to Victory....
In those immortal words not as frequently used these days...the time has come to separate boys from men ...and the writing is definitely on the wall. Much will be written and plenty will step up to be seen and heard when the champions elated captain steps up on the official podium to accept the Dialog league trophy it will certainly be a fair reward for months of sheer hard graft and defiant toil past odds obstacles, injuries and pain but the bitter sweet taste of the win soaked in combination of blood sweat, anticipation and adrenaline ...will speak incoherently as the team claims their prize,.... wildly cheering with all their lungs ...history is writ as the worthy claim their spoilsas did gladiators in classical times, to win their freedom and escape a life sentence.
There will be a glow in Colombo that evening ...especially around Fife Road, Park Road, bordering Dickmans Road and Isipatana Mawatha ...parking will be impossible too. All roads from London, NY, HK and Paris will lead to Havelock Park for the floodlit final 6.30pm kick-off - my mind races back to thousands of die-hard fans converging on the old Havies premises for what was then a Clifford Cup final ...the ground was chock-a-block and we had to climb a tree to watch CR play a star studded Havelocksit was a brutal final and pure sweat, skill, hardwork and guts on the line.
My voice was gone before half time screaming my proverbial off for JDJ, the impossible Jeff de Jong, Jeffa Yu, Frankie Hubert, Mickey Jayasekera and the hitman Angelo Wickramaratne ...what skills, what reputation, what fans, what a roar to greet their warm-up ....there was a hush for the interested designer crowd as they stretched and flexed it was poetry in motion and mesmerizing for the kids present ...seeking the quickest way to intense practice ...and sharper reactions from their real life heroes - household names and reputations to match the blushes all over!
Rugby union needs serious players and skills, to carry their flag and respect the code. If this happens ...all else will run smoothly.... if we are unable to do so, the magic doesnt stand up on that day and the full house bitterly disappointed ,... wonderful trailerscant hide the ...darkness and lack of form, plus two more experts
The script for this final is a real blockbuster ...hope the management and backroom staff, live up to expectations as well.....we have two weekends to breathe and shuttle past. I hope they talk with the national channel and schedule a multi camera production for the rumble in the city by the sea - thus allowing kids, whole villages and homes throughout the island to absorb and enjoy the upcountry- low country skill and pressure final for the rugby league title 2017.
Our experts will be buzzing as per their predictions and speculations ...pulse rates and muscle twitch at its compulsive best ...Kandy the defending champions or Havelocks for the cup Your decision a lot better than mine, so let them grab the 50-50 odds and provoke max thought and cup pondering!
Lets not harp too much on form and efficiency in the middle this week ...as injuries on both sides dont make comfortable reading ...if we discuss the list and names this edition ...it will only add to the heartburn and much anxiousness - lets tantalize with those morsels and facts next Thursday!
Reality is much stranger than fiction and I am convinced that it bites a lot harder and deeper......let me try to qualify that island brashness with some calming inclinations ...and facts - injuries on both sides are quite a chunk of the experience with both squads ...wonderful matchup to see a Fazil vs the inform Dulaj (133 points) in the form of his life. Can Fazil who is 3 games shy of match fitness, push past his recovery and use his immense experience to outwit and outclass the Dulaj factor
Havelocks function and play intense rugby with him and the likes of Niroshan, Kutty Dixon, Dabare, Hirantha, Rahul de Silva at the base needs max clean ball to put pressure and turn Kandy round. The forward power will be with Muthuthanthri and his superior level of petrol and fitness, both in the sets and lethal in the loose.
Will coach Ronnie Ibrahim trust his forward 8 ...or will he look to his back line to step it up There are bound to be a few experts at Havies who know the form and would jump at the chance of sharing their platinum insight Ronny might let diplomacy prevail, and his senior players dictate the path they intend to focus on Kandys weak areas to outplay them.
Kandy will be hoping for maximum from the vast list of Sri rep players they certainly have experience, fitness and skill on their side...but its how well the mind and belief on the day...and to do all that ...they still need both Weeraratnes to be at their aggressive best, with Ratwatte, Ritchie Dharmapala and the almost untouchable finisher Danushka Ranjan (13 tries) to create opportunities from scraps and any good ball that comes their way. Coach Sean Wijeysinghe will expect his class outfit to turn on the charm, given the occasion and familiar pressure terrain of another cup final.
I am a firm believer in trusting your instincts, in relying on what has been successful under pressure and the players in my team who I trust to do their job even with injured bits taped together. I want to know that we are ready for another match and will be max oxygen on the breathing in readiness to give 180% come the time, come the kick off and 80minutes from there ...everything else is after that and as the adrenaline starts to bubble ...its sheer joy and the immense pleasure of running out for a Cup final that peppers the blood and makes the heart beat loudest ...we live in great anticipation, blessings islanders ...the wait is delicious and delightful.
Bula Bula all those rugby hearts in Kandy and all over the island ...its our time to cheer.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is the only person who said that a power devolution exceeding 13th amendment to the Constitution was needed to strengthen ethnic harmony, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister said Former President Rajapaksa had pledged to an Indian media during the humanitarian operation that he would go for Thirteen plus going beyond the 13th amendment to the Constitution.
Rajapaksa, who promised for the full implementation of 13+, is now opposing the implementation of a new Constitution claiming that the government is going to betray the country. He had said he would accept any recommendation of the Parliamentary Select Committee on power sharing based on 13+, the minister said.
He said Rajapaksa could not appoint a parliamentary select committee (PSC) as pledged, as he could not obtain the consent of political parties.
Rajapaksa, who talked about power sharing by implementing 13 plus, is now opposing a new Constitution, he said.
Answering to the media, the minister said President Maithripala Sirisena received a mandate to prepare a new Constitution.
He said other political parties in the government should understand that the UNP was mandated by people at the General Election.

Murray magic but Kyrgios booed in stormy defeat
Melbourne: Top seed Andy Murray sped into the Australian Open third round on Wednesday but bad boy Nick Kyrgios was booed and accused of not trying as he crashed to a stormy defeat.
Roger Federer progressed despite unexpected resistance and womens world number one Angelique Kerber celebrated her 29th birthday with a hard-fought win.
Murray painfully rolled an ankle and needed treatment in the third set against Russian qualifier Andrey Rublev, but he shook off the problem to win 6-3, 6-0, 6-2.
While the world number one cruised, Kyrgios stood accused of tanking, or giving up, during his 1-6, 6-7 (1/7), 6-4, 6-2, 10-8 loss to Andreas Seppi.
Kyrgios, who is returning from a ban for lack of best efforts in a match in Shanghai, played lethargically and casually, especially in the fifth set.
Obviously its not the greatest thing to hear, he said of the booing. I didnt have the best preparation coming into the Australian Open. Pretty banged up, my body.
I dont even know what the score was in the end. Was it 10-8 10-8 in the fifth, getting booed off, definitely not the best feeling.
Tennis legend John McEnroe said Kyrgioss lack of effort was a black eye for the sport. Kyrgios explained that my body was sore. I was hurting.
I mean, John McEnroe. Good on him. Great career. Good on him.
Asked how he could have been better prepared, Kyrgios, who hurt his knee playing basketball, said: I dont know, maybe just not play as much basketball. Actually take my pre-season seriously.
Earlier Federer was made to work by 200th-ranked Noah Rubin for a 7-5, 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) win that set up a third-round assignment against his old rival Tomas Berdych.
I know what hes got. I dont need to tell you where hes beaten me, Federer said of Berdych. Then again Ive played him here, played him on many occasions, as well, when it went my way.
Happy birthday
Federer wasnt the only leading player challenged in the second round as Kerber, the womens defending champion, dropped a set against world number 89 Carina Witthoeft.
Kerber won 6-2, 6-7 (3/7), 6-2 before being treated to a rendition of Happy Birthday by the Rod Laver Arena crowd.
I was doing I think a lot of mistakes in the important moments. But at the end, Im happy that I won the match, said the world number one.
In the mens draw, Japanese fifth seed Kei Nishikori marched into the third round alongside former finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, with both winning in straight sets.
Nishikori was extended to five sets in his first-round win over Andrey Kuznetsov, but he found the going a little easier in his 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory against Jeremy Chardy.
Nishikori, who believes he is due a first major win this year, next plays Lukas Lacko, with Berdych or Federer waiting in the fourth round.
Frances Tsonga, who is seeded 12th and was runner-up to Novak Djokovic in 2008, beat Serbias Dusan Lajovic 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 to go through.
Stan Wawrinka, the 2014 winner, recovered from his tetchy five-setter with Martin Klizan to beat Steve Johnson 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.
In the womens draw, 36-year-old Venus Williams continued her smooth progress when she beat qualifier Stefanie Voegele 6-3, 6-2 to set up a meeting with Chinas Duan Yingying.
Williams, the oldest player in the womens draw, pulled out of the doubles competition with her sister Serena as a precaution to rest a sore elbow.
Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova thrashed Australian wildcard Jaimee Fourlis 6-2, 6-1 to set up a third-round clash with 31-year-old Serb Jelena Jankovic.
And Britains Dan Evans claimed the highest-ranked scalp of his career when he stunned former US Open champion Marin Cilic, the world number seven. - AFP

New leasing scheme proposed by Budget 2017 comes into effect: Treasury directs line ministries to take specific action to implement Budget proposals
The Secretary to the Treasury has informed the secretaries of all line ministries to take necessary steps to implement all development proposals made by Budget 2017 for each ministry.
These proposals in the Budget which had already been passed by Parliament would be implemented through the relevant ministries and their affiliated institutions. Certain Budget proposals during the past had not been implemented properly during the targeted period of time, thereby the country had lost its expected benefits.
The prime objective of this programme is to ensure the proper implementation of all development projects proposed by Budget 2017 in time. The Ministry of Finance has summarized in a report to all ministry secretaries concerning the projects coming under the purview of each ministry and how such projects proposed by the Budget are to be implemented.
The report also includes details with regard to new laws to be introduced if necessary. The report has further advised ministry secretaries to prepare an action plan and implement all the projects and proposals made by the Budget within this year, in order to eradicate poverty, generate employment enabling the the public to increase their income.
Budget 2017 has proposed 325 projects to be implemented and the National Budget Department has allocated the necessary funds for each ministry to implement them, hassle free. Accordingly, Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga had already informed ministry secretaries to prepare procurement plans and action plans with immediate effect and submit them to the Director General, Budget Department, to enable him to provide the necessary grants for each project. Certain Budget proposals have been implemented with effect from the very midnight following the Budget which was presented to Parliament, while the responsibility of implementing the balance was left with the respective ministries and their regulatory bodies.
Accordingly, prices of several essential commodities including kerosene, sugar, canned fish and powdered milk have already been dropped. Relevant Acts and regulations introduced under a move to simplify the tax system, would be implemented with effect from 01.04.2017.
The specific feature in preparing the Budget this time was the inclusion of proposals by people from all walks of life, including ordinary people, businessmen and professionals. Tourism has been bouncing back in the country and a group of businessmen engaged in transporting tourists, had requested for assistance to improve the sector.
Accordingly, new regulations with regard to leasing loans for vehicles would not be applied to transport service providers in the tourism sector. They would be able to enjoy 100% loan facilities for the leasing out of vehicles.
At the same time, university scholars who brought forward research details, pointed out the need for a regulatory body with regard to three wheelers. Budget 2017 which welcomed the argument of the university experts, had proposed new regulations in leasing out three wheelers.
Accordingly, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake proposed in Budget 2017, that loan to value ratio should be 25% for three wheelers, 50% for motor cars and vans and 90% for lorries and buses.
Therefore, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has advised commercial banks and leasing companies to follow the new regulations in granting loans for vehicle leasing, including three wheelers. Currently, loans could be borrowed by paying 10% of the total value of a three wheeler, which a borrower intends to buy. In future, under the new leasing regulations, 25% of the total value of a three wheeler should be paid instead.
Proposed traffic laws and spot fines are scheduled to be revised in the near future and the Finance Ministry believes that the new regulations imposed on loans would make an impact on leasing out of three wheelers. 325 projects have been proposed to be implemented within this year.
Each line ministry and its affiliated bodies, should prepare their own action plans to properly implement the proposed projects which have been earmarked for each ministry.
Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga has informed all ministry secretaries to set up task force to assess the performance of each project and inform the outcome monthly to the Treasury.

New Shipping giant said to create subsidiary for container business
China's new state-owned shipping giant has created a subsidiary to handle the various container businesses now under its control, a person close to the situation says.
China COSCO Shipping Group launched the new subsidiary, China Lines, on March 1, an employee of the parent said. The new company will operate ships and lease out containers, he said.
China COSCO Shipping Group's general manager, Wan Min, said China Lines will allow his company to cut costs to become more competitive and to have a greater say in setting global industry standards because a large fleet of ships will be brought under one company.
That can also bolster our ability to adapt to the global market so we can provide our clients with better services, he said.
China COSCO Shipping Group was formed on February 16 through a merger of two state-run shipping companies: China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co. (COSCO Group) and China Shipping Group Co.
China Lines will not be fully functional until July, the employee said, because it needs time to organize personnel and management matters.
The cabinet approved a plan for the merger in December in a bid to create a more competitive company abroad as the economy slows and demand for shipping drops.
The February merger meant China COSCO Shipping Group became the world's fourth-largest container operator by capacity, the global maritime news agency Alphaliner said. The top three spots are held by Denmark's A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, Switzerland-based Mediterranean Shipping Co. S.A. and France's CMA CGM SA.
The two companies that merged to form China COSCO Shipping Group owned 293 container cargo ships as of the end of January, data from Alphaliner show.
Its vessels could transport some 1.56 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), the standard measurement for shipping containers, good for 7.6 percent of the global market.
China Lines will work with clients and partners to reorganize routes and port resources to build a global shipping network revolving around nine hubs in China, the employee at the parent firm said. (CaixinOnline)

No deviation from past criteria for GSP+ eligibility
The European Union (EU) said yesterday that the ratification and implementation of 27 international conventions signed by a succession of Sri Lankan governments, are the only criteria on which the Government of Sri Lankas application to rejoin the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) is assessed.
The EU in a media statement went on to say, these conventions relate to international human rights, labour rights, environmental standards and good governance.
Benefitting from GSP+ requires the government to undertake to make further progress in implementing the conventions and to cooperate with the EU to monitor implementation and address shortcomings.
More generally, the European Union supports the leadership shown by this government in committing to address historic and long-standing problems that have caused conflict and negatively affected the lives and living standards of all Sri Lankans.
This includes the undertakings made, for instance, in the resolution that Sri Lanka co-sponsored at the UN Human Rights Council. The European Union is working with the government and civil society organisations to structure our support and engagement to positively contribute to the governments national reconciliation and good governance aims.
The EU is Sri Lankas biggest export market, accounting for nearly one-third of Sri Lankas global exports. In 2015.Total bilateral trade amounted to 4.7 billion.
The EUs Special Incentive Arrangement for Sustainable Development and Good Governance, GSP+, is part of EUs unilateral tariff preferences in favour of developing countries.
The GSP+ scheme is designed to help developing countries by granting full removal of tariffs on over 66% of tariff lines covering a very wide array of products including, for example, textiles and fisheries.
The GSP Regulation sets strict and clear criteria for granting GSP+. Firstly, the applicant must meet economic criteria, i.e. it must be a vulnerable developing country with a non-diversified economy and low level of imports into the EU. Secondly, the country must have ratified the 27 international conventions required under GSP+.
It must not have formulated reservations which are prohibited by these conventions, and the most recent conclusions of the monitoring bodies under those conventions must not identify any serious failure to effectively implement them. The new GSP Regulation provides for continuous monitoring of the GSP+ beneficiaries obligations. Once a country is granted GSP+, the EU must, therefore, monitor that it abides by its commitments, namely to: maintain ratification of the international conventions covered by GSP+; ensure their effective implementation; comply with reporting requirements; accept regular monitoring in accordance with the conventions; and cooperate with the EU and provide all necessary information.
There are currently 8 GSP+ beneficiaries: Armenia, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay and Peru.

Highlighting the changes taking place in Sri Lanka between the majority and Tamils, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka on Tuesday said that there are no grouses with the majority community in the northern Sri Lanka regarding the 13th Amendment.

"There are a few legal and political issues to a certain extent. We are determined that everybody in the country is given due place, equal place," he said.
Expressing hope that the current change in the social perspective Fonseka said, "We have mentally conditioned the country to live together. They understand that there must be reconciliation as one nation. But political devolution and other things are being discussed. Legal issues are there changing Constitution, referendums and various things are being considered. Things will fall in line." ANI

NSB gets AAA(lka) rating for 15th consecutive year
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the AAA(lka) national long-term rating to NSB with stable outlook following their periodic review of the large banks peer group which was announced by the Fitch recently.
NSB is the first Sri Lankan bank to affirm AAA(lka) rating from Fitch Ratings and the only bank to retain the same rating for 15 consecutive years. This is a significant achievement by the Bank. Fitch confirms that authorities would support, in case of need, the Banks depositors and senior unsecured creditors to maintain confidence and systemic stability due to the Banks policy mandate of mobilising retail savings and investing them in government securities and explicit deposit guarantee provided by the NSB Act.
Further, AAA(lka) National Long-Term Rating of NSB is Stable, as National Rating reflects the Banks creditworthiness relative to the best credit in Sri Lanka, and as such, is unlikely to change due to sovereign rating action.
Fitch has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of NSB as B+ with negative outlook which is equal to the sovereign rating.

Pakistan PM stresses Pak-Sri Lankan collaboration to achieve SAARC objectives

DAVOS: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday said Pakistan wishes to see South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) a vibrant regional organization.
In a meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of World Economic Forum, the Prime Minister said Pakistan and Sri Lanka could collaborate for the achievement of objectives of SAARC.
Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan attached great importance to SAARC and was fully committed to the principles and objectives of the SAARC Charter.
He mentioned that Pakistan believed that SAARC could not be replaced by BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation).
Sharif said Pakistan attached great importance to its relations with Sri Lanka, which are most cordial and friendly, and have grown from strength to strength over the last six decades.
He said it was Pakistans ardent desire to promote peace and cooperation in South Asia.
He termed security and stability as pre requisites for fighting poverty and promoting economic growth and development.
Nawaz Sharif reiterated that Pakistan considered Sri Lanka to be a key partner in this regard.
It is our desire to promote good relations with the countries of our region, so that our people may benefit from the fruits of regional integration, he said.
The Prime Minister said Pakistan desired to resolve all outstanding issues with India, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, through comprehensive dialogue.
He apprised the Sri Lankan Prime Minister that Indian forces were perpetrating atrocities in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir on innocent Kashmiri people, who were demanding their right to self-determination.
He said Indian forces had resorted to escalating tension on the Line of Control (LoC) only to distract the world attention away from their grave human rights violations in the valley.
The Sri Lankan Prime Minister conveyed best wishes from the people of his country to the people of Pakistan.
He expressed desire for more cooperation with Pakistan in trade and defence and said the two countries needed to enhance trade relations as well.

The youth in Sri Lanka have become a political football since decades. They followed the path shown by the politicians and were misled and remained jobless, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The minister was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone to a youth centre at Lunugamwehera. Minister Premadasa said creating a better future for the youth is the duty of the Yahapalana government. When building construction is over, the government will allocate Rs.500,000,000 for its activities and maintenance.
He said the previous regime used the youth to gain political mileage and not for the benefit of themselves. He said instead of politicians creating a future for the youth, they were compelled to create a bright future for the politicians.

Meteorology Department experts yesterday said the countrys Eastern and Northern Eastern regions are in for some heavy spells of rains for seven days or so starting from January 22.
This is apparently due to the subsequent movement of wind patterns in the Bay of Bengal which is moving towards the country from the West. Weather watchers said it comes like a wave.
Meteorology Department Director Forecasting Sarath Premalal said, there is a slim chance of the North East monsoon being established, but they cannot say that there would be rainfalls enough to fill up hydro reservoirs whose levels have fallen. Nevertheless, he said, there is a good chance of that the rains would continue.
We cannot forecast how much rain in terms of amount yet, but the rains are inclined to pick up. We have to wait for the showers to come. The rains will be felt throughout the country for about a week, Premalal said.
Asked why that a drought is expected with rains around the corner,Premalal said the monsoons last year did not establish at proper times. We did not have expected rains, he explained.

Wealthy Chinese and Russian couples snap up replicas of Princess Dianas ring
Wealthy Chinese and Russian couples are behind a surge in demand for replicas of Princess Dianas iconic sapphire and diamond engagement ring.
Orders for the famous ring, which Prince William gave Kate Middleton, have soared, according to the Royal familys favourite jeweller.
Garrard, which made the original piece ordered by Prince Charles, said there had been a significant uplift in sales in recent months.
Chief executive Joanne Milner said: The Diana ring is our most popular piece of jewellery.
In one week alone in December, we had three orders for them and had to work flat out to make them in time for Christmas.
The surge in popularity has been put down to the spending power of the growing Russian and Chinese middle classes. The 14-diamond and 12-carat sapphire ring was reportedly worth 28,000 when the Prince of Wales picked it out in 1981. In todays money it would cost around 108,000,
The jewellers behind the classic ring will not make an exact replica, but rather similar versions  the smallest of which costs 5,000. The jewellers chief executive added: We would never make an exact replica because we treat that ring like a bespoke piece and every bespoke piece is strictly a one-off.
Yet Dianas ring was not strictly bespoke as Charles chose it from the Garrard s catalogue - possibly because it reminded him of a sapphire and diamond brooch bought from the jewellers by Prince Albert for Queen Victoria. (Daily Mail)

The Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) announced the annual Sancharaka Udawa Tourism Product Trade Fair, which will bring to the forefront many unidentified small and medium service providers by creating a platform to showcase their services as well as build links with the tourism industry.

SLAITO Founder President Nilmin Nanayakkara said The Sancharaka Udawa tourism product trade fair to be held in May will provide a forum for small and relatively unknown suppliers and producers, while creating a cascading effect of revenue generation to all levels of society in Sri Lanka. "It will not only be limited to showcasing sources of accommodation, but will also cover new and varied locations to visit, transportation facilities, foreign language speaking guides, wildlife parks and rain forests,he said.
This event is aligned to SLAITO's mandate to promote and foster the rapid and long term growth of tourism by providing and maintaining a high standard of excellence to foster the long term growth of tourism.

Sri Lanka registers best air quality in South Asia
Nearly 220 million children of South Asia breathe toxic air in the most polluted regions in the world including India, deepening worries over health of minors in several parts of the country, reported Indias Hindustan Times citing a report by UNICEF released in the third quarter of last year.
Sri Lanka is excluded from this list. Experts attribute Sri Lankas low air pollution to the stringent vehicle emission testing program the island nation initiated in 2008 resulting in a higher quality of air compared to its neighbours.
The World Health Organisation (WHO), named India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh as having cities where the air is so toxic, it kills. A 2015 study by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, found that in 2012 air pollution accounted for 3.3 million deaths worldwide. Out of these, 2.2 million were in South Asia.
Undoubtedly, vehicle emissions are a major cause of air pollution and unlike factories and other industrial sites, vehicles emit pollutants in and around densely populated human habitations directly impacting those who live there, CleanCo Operations Head Surendra Perera, the company operating DriveGreencentres said.
In its 2014 environment performance index, Yale University ranked Sri Lanka highest in South Asia occupying 69th place in the world.
Even Bhutan, up in the green Himalayan Mountains came in 34 places lower in 103 rd place, DriveGreen Technical Manager Thilak Dilshan Epa said.
A first-of-its-kind analysis based on satellite imagery, UNICEFs Clear the Air for Children report published end October 2016 stated that Around 300 million children currently live in areas where the air is toxic - exceeding international limits by at least six times.
In total, around 2 billion children live in areas that exceed the World Health Organisations annual limit, the report said.According to UNICEF, the factors responsible for outdoor air pollution include vehicle emissions, heavy use of fossil fuels, dust and burning of waste.

This renovation is a massive undertaking and marks the first time a renovation like this has taken place, which has required significant adjustments for all stakeholders. However, the stipulation by the authorities for passengers to report to the airport 5 hours before the flight has helped significantly.

Thomson forces global race into thrilling finish
Les Sables-dOlonne: Alex Thomson forced himself to within 40 nautical miles of Vendee Globe solo-round-the-world race leader Armel Le Cleach as they head toward the finish on Thursday.
The 42-year-old Welshman is bidding to become the first non-French winner of the gruelling non-stop race which started in Les Sables dOlonne on Frances Atlantic coast on November 6.
Thomson, on Hugo Boss, made up 30 nautical miles on Tuesday but his pace slowed during the night leaving his French rival, on Banque Populaire, still in the lead and favourite to cross the line first on Thursday.
Both had to sail past Les Sable dOlonne toward the English Channel to get a favourable wind to bring them back down the coast faster to the finish line. Their gamble will be to see who turns first to catch the wind.
Tell him to stay behind, Le Cleach told a French Navy helicopter that flew over the Frenchmans boat and asked whether he had a message for Thomson.
Some 300,000 people packed Les Sables dOlonne and the nearby coast when the race started with 29 competitors. With the stakes high for the two leaders, big crowds are already gathering in the town for the return.
The winner is heading for a record time. A finish before 1202 GMT on Thursday would mean a circumnavigation in 74 days, four fewer than the record held by Francois Gabart since his win in 2013.
Le Cleach was beaten into second place for the last two Vendee Globe races. Thomson, whose team is based in Gosport on the south coast of England, was third last time, but abandoned in 2004 and 2008. The Britons support team and family gathered at in the Galway restaurant in the French port on Tuesday night. All shouted for joy when the night rankings indicated Thomson had cut Le Cleachs lead again.
Third placed Jeremie Beyou is only expected in port on Monday. AFP

Tom Hanks  May Play A Villain In A Major Disney Remake
Some actors make a career out of playing the good guy, much like Tom Hanks has throughout the majority of his time on screen. But every now and then, the Academy Award winner does find time to cut loose and play a baddie. Well, if current rumors are true, Hanks is circling his latest villainous turn, and its a pretty big one. You see, Tom Hanks may play the villain to Tim Burtons Dumbo, opposite Will Smith.
Variety grabbed the scoop today, around the same time that Will Smith was announced as another potential live-action cast member, in the story of a father whose kids befriend the classic elephant at the circus. Hanks role has been described merely as the villain of the film, but if the live-action Dumbo follows the story structure of the original film, hell more than likely be the ringmaster of the circus that Dumbo is performing in. All thats standing in the way of Tom Hanks possible participation is another role hes been circling.
As previously reported, Hanks has been looking at playing a lead in the World War II naval drama, The Grey Hound. Should he take the role, the Sully actor would be playing a commanding officer whose going through a crisis of professional faith in combat. Undoubtedly, this other role sounds like a shoo-in for Hanks, as it touches on a couple other major roles that hes played throughout his career. While The Grey Hound is the safer option of the two, Dumbos villainous lead could be a nice change of pace for Tom Hanks, as it gives him an opportunity to break out of his usual mold.
Despite his limited experience in villainous behavior, Hanks has certainly made for a compelling villain / anti-hero before. With straight up villainy radiating from him in The Ladykillers and Cloud Atlas, as well as his memorable turn as a mob hitman on the run in Road To Perdition, Tom Hanks isnt taking a completely alien risk by possibly playing the lead villain in Dumbo. If anything, the cartoon-ish nature of the film may help Hanks cleanse his palette before moving onto the next project thatll undoubtedly return him to his usual type of project.
Most interesting of all would be the fact that should Tom Hanks sign on as the villain in Dumbo, hell be working with Tim Burton for the first time. Whether the more reformed or more indulgent Burton shows up to direct the film, having Hanks in the mix to work on either side of the Burtonian spectrum is an intriguing enough possibility to want to see where it goes. For now, there is no release date for Dumbo just yet, but production is looking to start in the near future.]

In some foreign zoos with limited knowledge and funding, animals are often housed alone in sterile environments, on bare concrete floors and with no furniture (climbing structures, resting platforms, visual barriers and the like). Many times they are malnourished, injured and/or have a variety of behavioural problems. To complicate matters further, when she visits one of these zoos, she typically have only one week to make improvements. In the remaining time, it is her responsibility to assess, negotiate and improvise to make immediate changes with limited available resources.
She must quickly determine how to effectively implement all necessary changes. Every zoo and every country is different when it comes to available resources. Initial doubts and fears of proposed changes by zoo staff are often evident; she must develop a working relationship with unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar setting. Suggestions that would seem to be common practices for those working in an Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) facility in the United States are viewed as novel recommendations by many visited institutions.
Smaller groups
I visited Sri Lanka to introduce two solitary male chimpanzees to four females and to provide suggestions for improvements to the basic husbandry, enrichment, training or behavioural issues for all species in the collection.
Since the males were raised and kept alone, they had both developed some odd behaviours and tried to communicate with humans. Tony was making noises with his lips (similar to sucking on ones teeth), perhaps to entertain himself, and Sanju made praying and kissing movements as soon as a human being approached. None of these are natural chimpanzee behaviours.
Malee was an overly aggressive female (even during the howdy period), sometimes biting the bars with such force that I was concerned about her breaking her teeth.
The zoo asked to create two smaller groups in order to be able to ship one group out to their Safari Park later. Kiri Menika was old, and I felt she should not be transferred to a completely new place at her age. Malee was the mother of Tony, and Pinky was the mother of Sanju. Further, the zoo had not put the females under contraception yet. Therefore, in order to create two healthy groups without inbreeding, Malee had to be introduced to Sanju and Tony would be introduced to Pinky. Lacking flexibility within introduction groups made the integrations even more challenging.
Tony was also older than Sanju and the favourite chimpanzee of the visitors, so he needed to stay.
Thus, the only option for group configuration was: Tony and Pinky were introduced without incident and their closeness grew daily, while Kiri Menika appeared indifferent.
Introducing Sanju and Malee, on the other hand, was more involved due to aggression from Malee (e.g., screaming, biting the mesh when housed next to Sanju). Because of this aggression, Malee was separated from her daughter, Masha, so Masha could get acquainted with young Sanju in hope that if Malee saw her daughter relaxed and playing, maybe aggression towards Sanju would cease. Malee became even more upset when separated from her daughter, but the step was necessary.
Positive behaviours
Every time Sanju approached Masha, she ran to the mesh to her mother, naturally making the situation even worse. Sanju and Masha were together for tense three days, warming up to each other a bit but, never overcoming the tension. When, all three were introduced. Malee spent the next five days periodically attacking Sanju.
Although it appeared to be quite vicious and the zoo management wanted to separate them, Malee was merely displaying without causing any real threat of physical harm towards Sanju. Malee was regularly chasing, hitting and biting, but was extremely careful of not penetrating the skin, and Sanju had a similar response verifying the decision to keep them together and not separate unless a serious injury was to occur.

Top tourism professional to promote Sri Lanka in Europe
A veteran hospitality and tourism industry professional has been appointed as honorary consultant to the Ministry of Tourism Development with special focus on Germany and the European Continent. Minister of Tourism Development John Amaratunga officially presented the letter of appointment to Nihal Samarasinha at a special event in Colombo last evening.
Samarasinha who has wide experience in the European tourism and hospitality industry presently serves as Sri Lankas Honorary Consul in Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany. Speaking at the event Minister Amaratunga noted that Samarasinha was a great fit for the role given his impeccable credentials. Samarasinha is an asset to Sri Lanka and the time is right to tap his wealth of experience for the benefit of the country. Sri Lanka Tourism must make use of this golden opportunity by leveraging his knowledge of the European market to promote Sri Lanka, said Minister Amaratunga.
Emphasizing the importance of focusing on the European market Minister Amaratunga said that Europeans were traditionally identified as good spenders and demanded high standards. Before the influx of the Indian and Chinese tourists it was the Europeans that formed the bedrock of our tourism industry. Even during the 30 year war the Europeans never stopped coming. Today with so many hotels coming up we need to redouble our efforts to attract more Europeans to our country. It is with this in mind that I made this appointment, said Minister Amaratunga.
Samarasinha, a distinguished alumnus of St. Josephs College Colombo ventured on his own to Europe way back in 1972 to join the hospitality industry.
Starting at the bottom he quickly rose up the ranks to senior management positions in leading international chains some of which include Intercontinental Hotels, Holiday Inn, Canadian Pacific and Ramada. He crowned an extremely successful career by becoming Vice President of Ramada International.
Having risen to the top as an hotelier he then succeeded in building a hospitality empire of his own. Today he is the Chairman and Managing Director of Millennium Hospitality International based in Germany which owns and operates six properties under international brands such as Ramada, Mercure Hotels, Clarion Collection, Comfort Hotels, Hotel Savigny and United Hostels.
Samarasinha has been actively promoting Sri Lanka as a preferred destination for holiday makers. He is a regular visitor at all the top international travel fairs and trade exhibitions. In recognition of his efforts he was appointed as an Honorary Ambassador for Tourism Promotion in 2009. Subsequently he was appointed as an Honorary Consul for Sri Lanka in Germany.
Welcoming the appointment, Chairman Sri Lanka Tourism, Paddy Withana said that Sri Lanka was fortunate to have the services of a professional of the caliber of Samarasinha who is a respected figure in Europe. Having him onboard to promote Sri Lanka in that region is a huge bonus for Sri Lanka Tourism, he noted.
Expressing his delight at receiving the new appointment, Samarasinha said he will go to any length to expose Sri Lanka as the best value proposition in global tourism.
First off, I want to help the Sri Lankans based in Europe who are already promoting Sri Lanka. I will help, guide and support them to grow their businesses. I will leave no stone unturned in leading the charge to establish Sri Lanka as a top destination in the European market, he said.

Trumps popularity lowest of any President in decades
US: President-elect Donald Trump takes office this week with dismal approval and popularity numbers, according to polls out Tuesday, u nderscoring the deep divisions among Americans as the New York businessman prepares for his inauguration.
A CNN/ORC poll showed 40 percent of respondents approved of the way Trump has been handling the transition period heading into Fridays inauguration, a figure thats sharply lower than any incoming US president in recent history.
Trump will enter the Oval Office as the least popular incoming president in at least four decades, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.
The president-elect immediately slammed the findings, pointing out that a majority of surveys ahead of his November 8 electoral win predicted victory for his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.
The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before, he said on Twitter.
The real estate developer who is working in government for the first time has presided over a chaotic and unorthodox transition period since his election.
The recent weeks have featured -- among other things -- a drawn-out search for top cabinet members, questions over conflicts of interest, feuds with the media, unsubstantiated allegations that Russia holds compromising material against Trump, and the president-elects Twitter blasts against critics ranging from the CIA chief to the screen legend Meryl Streep.
The CNN poll showed Trump lagging more than 20 points behind the approval ratings of his three most recent predecessors and 44 points below that of President Barack Obama as he prepared to enter the Oval Office in 2009.
Obama had an 84 percent approval rating ahead of his inauguration, Bill Clinton scored 67 percent approval in late December 1992 and 61 percent approved of George W. Bushs transition in poll figures from January 2001, CNN said. Forty percent of respondents told the Washington Post-ABC survey they have a favorable impression of the incoming president, compared with 54 percent who said they have an unfavorable impression.
That makes Trump the most unpopular incoming president since at least Jimmy Carter in 1977, the Washington Post said.
Forty-four percent said Trump is qualified to serve as president, as opposed to 52 percent who said hes not qualified, the Washington Post-ABC poll said.
When asked how much confidence they have that Trump will make the right decisions for the countrys future, 38 percent said they had a great deal or a good amount of confidence. Sixty-one percent said they had just some or no confidence. The CNN/ORC poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. The Washington Post-ABC poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.- AFP

University of Peradeniya: Down scenic memory lanes
It is great news for the undergraduates turned senior citizens. It is welcome news for those who are in the evening of their lives who wish to renew the past memories. It is surprising news for the few living to go down memory lane, refreshing the enthusiasm, the interest, the experience and excitement that illumined their lives.
We still have pleasant recollections of our stay at Peradeniya. The news item calling for all graduates of pre-seventy era to provide information and furnish details of their stay at the University of Peradeniya is unique and beyond expression.
The organizers should be congratulated and honoured for the bold decision and the splendid opportunity provided. The deep bond with the institution and how it played a vital role in their lives cannot be erased from their minds. Gone are the days when they enjoyed the fruits of life and education replete with quality and excellence. Many reminisce the past glory.
There are some enthusiastic, outstanding personalities who are worthy of praise at Golden Jubilee celebrations. They have taken great interest in bringing the old faces together. Somasundaram popularly and affectionally known as Jolly to his friends commemorated the great day of Group 56 (Aug 20-2006). Thilak Ranaviraja and Sena Thoradeniya who organized the GT of 1961 batch and Neville Perera and Kularatna are just a few names among hundreds who actively participated in the honoured task.
The institution is located on a site which is stunningly beautiful with nature's beauty reigning supreme. The person behind this supreme gift to the paradise isle was Sir Ivor Jennings, the founder vice-chancellor, an intellectual genius. The pioneer and the gifted architect Shirley de Alwis rendered a tremendous service, which then with its majesty and grandeur ranked as the most prestigious in the globe. It was truly an important milestone in our history. Academically, the dedicated service of the pioneer was not single-handed.
He was assisted by a galaxy of academics. The students during the period were fortunate to have received their education from the most learned scholars, professors and lecturers who were willing to accomplish the gigantic task.
They had strong intellect to plan, guide and plead the students to success. The undergrads were forging ahead with hardly any problem, whatsoever. The so-called ragging then was simple fun which everybody enjoyed. The students in this heaven on earth mindfully started the day, with thoughts of serious studies, enchanted by the scenic beauty and encouraged by the atmosphere. It was hard work filled with joy. It always remained a memorable glittering period in their lives. It is with great pride that we recall the good old days.
Peradeniya as the residential university, the first of its kind, was created for the intelligentsia bent on learning with one aim in their lives  getting out with a brilliant academic achievement worthy of a rewarding career and refinement in life. Indiscipline or instability was unheard of. Instead, there was perfect peace and harmony which we could be proud of reminiscing even today. The undergrads were well aware of their responsibilities, rights, and duties. There were no tragic situations of any calibre. The smooth functioning of the honoured institution was never disrupted. We could be proud that discipline has been very important in the glorious past. Repeating it once more, as old as we are, we can be truly proud that we were a truly disciplined set of students. We are grateful that it offered the undergrads the best of everything that anyone could ever dream of. Well equipped with luxurious residential halls, comfortable lecture halls, first class library, a good sports complex and many other comforts (when modern technology was nonexistent), learning was a lifelong pleasure and a guarantee for a successful future. This was further facilitated by the medium of instruction which was English in accordance with the British system.
Undergraduates possessed a sound knowledge of English and a high standard was maintained. It was the first institution to offer degrees in the English medium which provided them with the best career opportunities. They became accomplished graduates fit to serve anywhere in the globe, serving humanity. In addition to the excellent facilities, with the best staff, the study programmes and curriculum then, was the most advanced on par with modern teaching methods. Each semester was a new learning experience. The multicultural outlook and background helped them to acquire a broad outlook. There was the strong tradition of quality in every aspect. It is a well-known fact that the university offered the best and illumined the lives of almost everyone of that era. The glory of the university still lingers in our hearts.
The University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, the oldest, largest and the most well-known with its glorious past, did everything quite successfully in its own way setting an example to the subsequent universities which were to come up later. It still remains as the most important and the highest centre of learning in Mother Lanka. Its colourful history does not end here. It has touched the hearts and minds of thousands with a deep sense of affection.

US to close VOA Iranawila station
The United States Embassy will close down the Voice of America radio station and hand over the land leased out for it in Iranawila, Puttlam back to the government of Sri Lanka.
The lease on the land was scheduled to expire in 2020.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing said the land spanning an extent of 166.038 hectares was leased out to the American Embassy in 1991 for a twenty year period to establish the Voice of America transmission station in Sri Lanka.
The US Embassy had been paying an annual lease of US$ 40,000 for the land to the General Treasury since being granted the land in 1991.
In December 2016 however, the Embassy had informed the government that they would close down the station and return the land. Hence Cabinet granted approval to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, headed by the Prime Minister to take over the land, develop it as an eco-friendly investment/tourism zone and to call for proposals from interested investors.
Furthermore the US Embassy will also hand over items such as buildings, vehicles, radio equipment, furniture, etc to the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), Army, Sri Lanka Telecom and the Divisional Secretary of Mahawewa. The SLBC has also shown interest in taking over some of the land.

Wild  adventure
What happens when two childhood friends share a passion for the wild and photography Discover the answer this weekend when Amrit Rajaratnam and Shanik De Silva present The Wild, an exhibition of photographs on January 21 and 22 from 9am to 6pm at the Lionel Wendt Gallery. The exhibition pays tribute to animals that inhabit the African savannah.
Amrit Rajaratnam, Managing Director of Maitland and Knox, the managing agents of The Galle Fort Hotel, Thotalagala and The Havelock Place Bungalow, traces his love for the wild back to his infancy.
When his father gave him his first camera, his love for photography proved a perfect match for his already ingrained passion for the wild.
Having spent several years overseas while he read law at the University of Nottingham and was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn, Amrit returned to Sri Lanka. He was devastated by the changes the relentless march of progress has wrought in the quiet wild places he had known. Seeing similar changes across the globe, he was determined to capture the essence of the last remaining locations and to share them through his photography.
He found the perfect companion with whom to embark on this endeavour - his childhood friend Shanik De Silva. Shanik has always been enthralled by the wild. Having learned most of his photography on a film camera, he moved on to digital cameras about 10 years ago.
Shanik is the Managing Director of Water Mart Systems having graduated with an Honours degree in Industrial Economics from the University of Warwick. However, he says that nothing makes him happier than being in the wilds of this world with like-minded souls.

Drivers licences in future are to contain information on whether the holder is willing to be an organ donor or not, according to Cabinet proposal approved this week.
A proposal made by Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne to amend forms of obtaining and renewing driving licences by including a declaration to declare the will of drivers to donate their organs and to indicate that will on the driving licence card,was approved this week, Minister Senaratne said addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday.
With drivers facing accidents on a regular basis, they can be an important group of donors. Cabinet two months ago approved the issue of new drivers licences which would contain more information on the chip. This is one such information which would be included in it, explained the Minister.
With Chronic kidney disease and end stage renal failure becoming a common problem in Sri Lanka, the country is facing a major issue with a scarcity of donors.
Sri Lanka is the leading nation in the world for cornea donation and provides corneas to around 54 countries.
