Mandelas walk
I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to see realized. But if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die,
 Mandela's Rivonia Trial Speech, 1964
Nelson Mandela will be remembered for his struggle against the South African Apartheid government and his instrumental role in overthrowing it. While he was alive he was a living example that love conquers all. And in this death his message shall be forever. He was imprisoned for 27 years by the Apartheid Government for fighting for the rights of Black South Africans.
The United Nations designated July 18 as Nelson Mandela International Day in 2009 in order to recognize the values Nelson Mandela fought for. A concert was organized by the High Commission of South Africa and the Guitar Association of South Africa.
In his speech Charge d affaires, South African Commission, Johannes Van Niekerk spoke about Mandelas impact upon history.
Today for all South Africans, it is a day of celebration. This day is in recognition of our former presidents contribution to the culture of World Peace and Freedom. The General Assembly resolution recognizes Nelson Mandelas values and dedication to the service of humanity, in the fields of conflict resolution, the promotion and protection of human rights, reconciliation, gender equality and the rights of children and other vulnerable groups. It acknowledges his contribution to the struggle for democracy and the promotion of a culture of peace throughout the world. This day, Mandelas birthday is aimed at bringing people together to fight poverty and promote peace and reconciliation.
The marking of Mandela day is to serve as a global call for action, for people to recognize their individual power and to make an impact that can help change the world around them for the better. For 67 years Nelson Mandela devoted his life for serving humanity as a human rights lawyer as an international peace maker, and as a democratically elected president of a free South Africa, said Niekerk
Niekerk said that Mandela Day is not meant to be a day or parties or celebrating but rather a day that we can devote to helping others. Perhaps those less fortunate.
The South African High Commission in Colombo decided to partner with the Guitar Association of Sri Lanka, who expressed their willingness to compile a musical and cultural program symbolically designed to last for about 67 minutes to mark Nelson Mandela international day. Mandela once said: Everyone can rise above their circumstances and achieve success as long as they are dedicated and passionate, stated Niekerk
UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka Una McCauley read a statement by the Secretary General of the United Nations
Today gives me immense pleasure to say Happy Birthday! to Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela has been a lawyer, a freedom fighter, a political prisoner, peacemaker and president. He has been a healer of nations and a mentor to a generation of leaders and people from all walks of life throughout the world. Nelson Mandela gave 67 years of his life to bring change to the people of South Africa.
Our gift to him must be to change our world for the better. Feed the hungry, care for your environment, volunteer at a hospital or a community center, be part of the Mandela movement and work to make the world a better place.
That is the best way to wish Nelson Mandela a happy birthday. It is the best way we can thank him for being such an inspiration to us all. Take action and inspire change. Make every day a Mandela Day, said McCauley.
Secretary of the Sri Lanka Guitar Association, Mohammed Iqbal said that the Guitar Association is proud to partner this event on this special day
Today we have gathered to commemorate Nelson Mandela International Day. This is to celebrate and to honor the lifetime service Nelson Mandela gave to humanity. July 18 was marked as Nelson Mandela International Day by a unanimous decision by the UN General Assembly. Nelson Mandela once said: What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived.
It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead. The Guitar Association wishes to spread the message of harmony through Sri Lanka, and is proud to be part of this global event.
All the artistes who will be performing here are performing voluntarily with no monetary gain. This is because of their respect for Nelson Mandela,said Iqbal.
The performances of the evening, which were all very flamboyant, all paid tribute to Nelson Mandela in a splendid fashion. They were all very charismatic. There was a dance by the students of Dr. Subashini Pathmanathan that was aesthetically pleasing. It was very beautiful to watch the graceful dancers who commanded the attention of the audience by their dance. The outfits of the dancers were eye catching and very conspicuous. Their dancing had a lot of power in it and it was certainly entertaining. Such stage presence!
There was also a guitar performance led by Iqbal where Nelson Mandela was lauded by simple yet thought provoking lyrics accompanied by a catchy tune.
The evening on the whole was a memorable one with fine music and the dedication and commitment of the performers was pleasing to see. All in all it was evident that much effort had gone into the evening and all the items were well prepared and put together.
Much attention had been paid to the details and the performers all seemed really enthusiastic and showed a lot of panache. And I think the crowd appreciated the performances and appeared to be satisfied. The evening really picked up momentum and at the end it was hats off to the performers!

THE MATCHMAKERS DAUGHTER
Short story:
I still remember an incident that happened in our village long ago. Asilin Nona was a middle-aged woman, a matchmaker who lived in our village. Her husband, Martin was a very lazy man who did nothing but sleep the whole day. He went fishing at the river, which flowed at the edge of our village when he felt like doing some work or when Asilin Nona started shouting at him. Yet, even there he would sit on a boulder or a protruded root of a big tree and after throwing the fishing rod into the water would start dozing. He hardly caught any fish. The urchins when passing him near the river used to sing.
Martin Mama gala uda doyi - Malu patav bili piththe doyi
(Uncle Martin is sleeping on the boulder; little fish are sleeping on his fishing rod)
Asilin Nona somehow managed to earn their bread and butter. She, being a matchmaker, was a good friend of the mothers who had young children of marriageable age. I can still remember her well, walking along the lane carrying an old black umbrella and a pan malla, the small woven bag in which she carried copies of horoscopes that she had received from prospective brides and bridegrooms. A mother had only to tell her what type of a person she was seeking for her son or daughter, when Asilin Nona would take out the bundle from her bag and sort out a relevant horoscope, be it a farmer, a trader or anybody who would suit the mothers description. Then she would start praising the good qualities of the relevant family too. If the mother was not satisfied with that one, in no time she would produce another. She had so many with her, inside that small bag. However, only a few, less than even the number of fingers in one hand, were the number of marriages she had been able to arrange in our village.
Whether the horoscope tallied or not, the matchmaker had to be given some money for her services every time she visited you with a fresh marriage proposal. That was the income Asilin Nona had.
She was a regular visitor we too had, until we all got married, although the ones she brought up for us never materialized. When she came to our place, my mother used to treat her cordially as she always did for our villagers and neighbours. She was given something to eat and drink and while feeding on these she would feed my mother too about all the gossip in the village, would boast about the marriages she had been able to fix, how grand feasts they had at their wedding ceremonies and also how these marriages had all turned out to be very successful.
You wont believe Loku Nona, she said addressing my mother. They still treat me as one of their family members when I visit them. They still thank me for bringing them together in marriage.
I never knew whether they were true or not since none whom I knew got married through proposals brought up by her.
There were rumours about her that she had helped runaway couples and that she could be bribed with money for carrying love letters. Once a neighbour of ours too complained to my mother about Asilin Nona helping her daughter to run away with a boy from the next village.
Loku Nona, dont let that viper, Asilin Nona step into this house. Dont let your daughters get involved with her, she said. Look at what she had done. She had been helping Janakie (their daughter who ran away) all these days. In fact, she herself gave us the horoscope of that boy from the next village a few months back. We were not in favour with that since we had better prospects about our daughter and we had already arranged another marriage. We were kept completely ignorant of the affair between these two. Asilin Nona used to visit our place even after that proposal was rejected. She was friendly with Janakie too. We had no suspicions about them and knew not what they were planning behind our back. When they knew that we were not for that marriage, they have sought after Asilin Nonas help to carry on the affair. Finally, when Janakie realised that we would never give our consent she ran away. Do you know that it was this damn woman who had carried away Janakies clothes out of our house
Yet Asilin Nona did not seem to be worried about such a thing. All nonsense! she had commented when somebody had asked whether she had any hand in that elopement.
However, our mother was very careful after what she had heard and never let any of us to be over-friendly with Asilin Nona.
Nanda was the daughter, the only child Asilin Nona had. She was neither a beauty nor a well-educated girl. The mother was travelling up and down with her business and the father although at home was sleeping the whole day. So Nanda just grew up just like any other village girl. She stopped schooling when she did not wish to attend school anymore. There was no one to comment for or against anything she did.
One morning, we heard a big commotion close the matchmakers house. Martin who hardly got up from his bed was coming down the lane wailing uncontrollably. Asilin Nona was behind him sobbing and shouting. She was using the most indecent words the villagers used at brawls. Without aiming at any particular person, she was abusing somebody, whom as she said, had been helping their daughter to take such a drastic step. We were wondering what it was when a villager passing our house told my mother, Nanda had run away.
How we looked after our child shouted Asilin Nona. She was the apple of the eye of both of us. Such an innocent girl! Never looked straight at a boy, she cried pulling her hair and beating her chest and boasting what a blessing of a girl her daughter was.
A villager came out with the latest news then that Nanda had sent a scribbled note to her mother. It said, You are a matchmaker. Yet, I am 34 years and still unmarried. I dont need your services any more. I am going away with the one I had chosen.
I know who had helped her! shouted Asilin Nona. A string of indecent, vulgar words poured out of her mouth. She ended up with wishing a thunderbolt to strike at the culprits.
No one either replied or pacified them. After shouting for a little while, they returned home. The scene was over.
What a surprise! Nanda is thirty-four Such a blessing of a girl as her mother says, sarcastically commented my brother. Asilin Nona, according to her is the most popular matchmaker and the one who could boast about such a number of successful marriages, could not find a suitable partner for such a girl like her own daughter.
Janakies mother was also on the road. Its a boomerang. What she did to my daughter had come back to them, she said turning towards her home.
However, everything ended satisfactorily since the next week itself Nanda returned home with her husband.

Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler issues huge recall as diesel emissions questions linger
Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler issued a major recall in Europe to fix diesel vehicles amid speculation that regulators are probing whether the company violated emissions standards.
Daimler said Tuesday that it would repair more than 3 million vehicles in Europe to reduce nitrous oxide emissions.
Excessive NOx emissions enveloped fellow German automaker Volkswagen Group in a scandal when it was revealed in September 2015 that the company had intentionally evaded regulations.
Though Daimler did not immediately announce any recalls for the U.S. market that could come soon. U.S. regulations on diesel emissions are stricter than European standards.
Daimler has been under scrutiny in Europe with public reports indicating that German prosecutors are investigating the company's diesel vehicles to determine whether they contain software designed to beat emissions tests.
Following the VW scandal and the U.S. government's lawsuit against Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler over its own diesel emissions, diesel "bashing has become more fashionable than popping Ros corks in the South of France," Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said Thursday in a bulletin.
Daimler said it would spend about $254 million to fix the diesel vehicles at no cost to customers. "In this way, Daimler is making a significant contribution to the reduction of nitrogen-oxide emissions from diesel vehicles in European inner cities," the company said in a statement.
Daimler U.S. representatives did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
Asked whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is the investigating Daimler, the agency in a statement said: "EPA is continuing to evaluate light-duty diesel vehicles from a number of manufacturers" but "will not comment on the status of our testing and administrative decisions regarding any specific manufacturer" or any potential investigation. www.usatoday.com

Ministry of Health partners Litro Gas to bring healthy cooking
In a bid to enable a culture of health conscious culinary habits to penetrate into the wider social spectrum within Sri Lanka, Medical Services of the Ministry of Health recently held a Healthy Cooking competition at the BMICH for Medical Administrators of Uva Province attached to the College Medical Administrators.
Facilitated by Litro Gas, the event featured ten enthusiastic teams representing numerous departments of the Medical Services of the Ministry of Health competing for the top three spots. Event patrons, Chefs Guild of Lanka provided guidance to competitors and selected the three winning teams accordingly.
Our ultimate goal is to advocate a behavioural change in the Sri Lankan social fabric. It is imperative that Sri Lankans adopt not only healthy diets but also healthier ways of preparing those food items, said Dr. Lakshmi Somathunga  Deputy Director General - Medical Services of Ministry of Health.
The Healthy Cooking competition aspired to reach out to more than seventy high profile medical officials attached to Medical Services of the Ministry of Health representing more than 47 Hospitals Island wide as well as the Ministry of Health and The College of Medical Administrators.
It was inspiring to see the vitality and passion that competing teams generated during the event. I believe the same enthusiasm will slowly but surely translate into lifestyle changes which the general public will also adopt given the rise in awareness on the subject of healthy eating and cooking habits, commented Chaminda Ediriwickrama, Director- Sales and Marketing/Corporate Affairs - Litro Gas Lanka Limited
Food is much more than just something that tastes good and fills up your stomach.
What you eat can heal, cause sickness, or even inflict pain. Cooking your own meals can teach you what foods are high or low in certain vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.
It will even boost your creativity as you learn to combine nutritious foods to satisfy your palate, added Nilmini Ferdinando, Marketing Communication Manager, Litro Gas Lanka Ltd.

Mistaken dance  dramas
Dance dramas are not a part of classical dance forms. But multiple character dance dramas more or less belong to drama forms rather than that of the classical dance forms. Today there are numerous misconception about the dance dramas.
Dance drama developed and penetrated into classical Bharatha Natyam in the 20th century. From ancient times dance and drama were practised together. Earlier there was no proper distinction between the two. The Tamil classical dance is always considered as a divine art. There are some who believe that dance evolved out of the drama, while some others believe that drama had its origin in dance. Anyway, dance and drama emerged together to attract common people in the 20th century.
According to history, the relationship between the two is very close. Earlier dance and drama were known under one single art form.
New techniques
But in the course of the 17th century, there was a gradual separation of dance and drama.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, dance faced a setback while drama gained recognition and popularity. In the early 20th century, cinema with its new techniques acquired a preeminent position at the expense of drama which was pushed back to the verge of extinction.
This was the period when drama stars of the theatre blossomed into cinema stars and drama halls were transformed into cinema studios. After a brief period of oblivion dance then known as Sadir, blossomed into Bharatha Natyam.
After 1940, Bharatha Natya dance teachers and Bharatha Natya institutions choreographed dance drama for epics. The first dance drama was Kutrala Kuravachi presented by Srimathi Rukmani Devi of Kalashetra. Whatever it may be, it is more or less based on drama than dance.
It was followed by several others. After 1962 dance dramas were presented on several themes even on fiction works. In the last decade of the 20th century, tolerance drama emerged and featured in TV channels. This was a new innovation and acquired a unique position with the aid of lighting and sound techniques. This partakes more of cinema than stage dance drama.
Exquisite combination
Though dance drama has much in common with dance there are essential differences between the two. Bharatha Natyam, for instance, has a repertoire of its own. Bharatha Natyam with its exquisite combination of Adavus, Abhinaya, Bavas Rasas, eye movements, neck movements, and hand madras (gestures) is essentially an individual dance.
Bharatha Natyam is totally based on classical Carnatic music base while in dance drama the repertoire is set then and there based on the story of the dance drama portrays. And many of times most of the dance dramas are considered as a part and parcel of Bharatha Natyam or branch of Bharatha Natyam. Yet one act dance dramas are totally based on classical dance Bharatha Natyam and one act dance dramas are more or less based on Bharatha Natyam. Still, in one act dance dramas, the sole music is not at all always based on classical music. Many of times in one act dance dramas the sole music is in a mixed form. Especially the music is adopted along with classical, folk and fusion music.
Idiom and grammar
For dance drama, the music is not necessarily confined to the traditional Carnatic music. In dance dramas, a variety of musical instruments is used to enhance the effect and beauty of the scene.
But in Bharatha Natyam, the use of musical instruments are limited and strongly adhered to the tradition. However, for Bharatha Natyam the stage is set once and for all while in dance drama the stage has to be rearranged according to the scene portrayed.
Generally, in dance drama the costumes, the make-up and hair dressing are adapted to each characters needs and necessity, while Bharatha Natyam uses only certain designed costumes and one distinctive makeup.
Dance drama is considered as Bharatha Natyam by laymen because dance drama are presented through the idiom and grammar of Bharatha Natyam.

To move heaven and earth
Head Prefect of Wesley College Joshua Siriwardena has many aspects of his life that work for him such as faith in his God, the people who have a positive impact on his life and faith in himself. Perfect Prefects features Siriwardena a leader who leads others with peace and purpose in his heart and mind.
In times of adversity I read my favorite verse Psalm 121:1 -2 I look up to the mountains, does my help come from there My helps comes from the lord who made the heavens and the earth.
I always carry a key in my pocket, and I when I hold that key I realize that I have the key to my life. I am responsible for my success and failure. If I fail it is all my fault. I could have done better, explained Siriwardena.
Real privilege
In school I look up to my chaplain Rev. Obeth because he has a lot of experience and knows how to tackle each and every situation in the right way. Then there is our principal, Avanka Fernando, a great leader who knows how to tackle every situation in the right way. Being in touch with them and working with them gives me much wisdom. Seeing them tackle the situation makes me learn so much. It is a real privilege working with them.
When I am in real trouble then I pray. If it is a really tough problem I face, I would consult my mom. She is a very practical thinker. She knows how to get stuff done in the right manner.
To solve a problem I would stand by my ground. I listen to everyone and make sure I make the right decision. If I am not sure about the decision I would consult someone or pray about it. Whatever I decide I would stand by my ground. I will stand my ground and make sure the proper thing is done, elucidated Siriwardena.
Wesley College has a long history and a proud culture.
We all treat each other as brothers. We are all very united. No one leaves the school gates with an angry heart. There is a strong brotherly culture in Wesley. I thank Wesley for all I am.
Educational system
As a Head Prefect you have to play more of a brotherly role in Wesley College. Because that is the culture that has been passing on. Being a leader cannot be taught by any book or educational system. You need to get out there. It is more or less a practical lesson. You cant read a book and learn leadership. The experiences you go through day by day is what makes you a good leader, said Siriwardena.
Siriwardena has so many role models to look up to.
I have had so many heroes that have impacted my life. My dad is my first hero. I guess every boys first hero is his dad! Then there is our Chaplain Bro. T.R. Obeth who has helped me grow spiritually and gave me a whole new perspective of life. Then another leader I look up to is Nelson Mandela. 27 years in prison. But he just forgave and gave love. That takes a lot of courage. He was a very strong leader, stated Siriwardena.
Living in the moment is one message he gives to the youth.
One message I wish to give the youth is to live in the moment. Live in the present moment. Do what you have to do at that time. If you are in the classroom then do your studies. If you are on the field then do your sports. Because these days unlike those days life is not a run anymore. It is a sprint. Life is like a Marathon and you got to sprint the whole marathon. I treasure each moment in life because I will never get it back again. There are ups and downs, and days I want to put behind me, but I gain an experience out of it. But one day that was really special for me was the day I was appointed senior prefect. Being appointed Senior Prefect happened so fast. My mom and dad were in tears that day. I consider that the happiest day of my life, pointed out Siriwardena.
Another message he gives the youth is to correct their attitudes.
I think the attitudes some people have make a huge difference in this world. You should be able to treat the janitor the same way you treat the CEO. I should be able to treat the Grade 1 student or the support staff the same way I treat the principal. This I say in terms of respect. I should be able to respect each and every one equally. When I respect you, you give me respect back.
Pride and ego
In order to change the world today what I feel is, you need to change the attitudes of the people. You should be down to earth. These days people have more pride and ego. I have the title of Senior Prefect and I can become arrogant about it. But that is not how it should work. I should be humble and treat everyone equally. I should be who I am after getting the title as well.
If we want to change the world then we have to change our attitudes and thinking patterns. In other countries you see young people working in Mcdonalds and places like that. So the thinking pattern should be  He is trying to lay his foundation in life. He is doing it part time to come up in life. The attitude should not be to look down on jobs like that, elucidated Siriwardena.
Wesley College is a special place for Siriwardena.
I have been at Wesley from Grade 1 and all the other boys in the school get home by 2.30pm or 3.00pm. But Wesley College is nicest before 6.00am and after 6.00pm. That is the time you get to interact with nature a lot.
Also the Chapel is the most peaceful place I have ever been. Whenever I am in trouble or whenever I feel down, this is the place I come to. Before and after six it is really silent. The chapel is where I come to meditate and do my prayers and then I feel totally different. I am a person who has a lot of patience. I listen to what everyone says. Because they may be right at some point. When the work has piled up and I just feel like giving up, the chapel is where I come. This place is really magical to me. It takes the stress out of my head. It brings me back to a whole new level, added Siriwardena.
Attention todiscipline
A love and sense of gratitude towards his school are his guiding principles in life.
In Wesley we give more attention to discipline. But we give ample opportunity for all students to excel in their talents and strengths. Being the Head Prefect of Wesley, I get the opportunity to represent the whole student body. So a Head Prefect should be able to treat everyone equally. His vision should be to uphold the schools name in every possible way. He should be able to rally the other prefects to be able to work towards one goal and uphold the schools name, stressed Siriwardena.
As he said before strong and positive role models are what any young boy or girl needs.
In any stage in a persons life you need proper and strong role models or a something strong to believe in, otherwise your path starts to deviate. It is not your fault because you think you are doing the right thing. I feel that the youth need to use their time in a productive manner. Again I think the biggest problems in this world are due to the attitudes. Ego plays a huge role and having an ego will not get you very far. Not forgiving the other person and the ego are the main two causes for all the problems in society, shared Siriwardena.
I watch inspirational movies like Invictus and the Miracle. I watch more or less motivational movies. It is not action movies as such, but if it is about a sport and motivation, then that would be my kind of movie. I even watch comedies. I am fond of Adam Sandler movies, summed up Siriwardena.

## Title: THE OTHER-SIDE OF MARGOT FONTEYN

THE OTHER-SIDE OF MARGOT FONTEYN
She was perky and never more dramatic than any single moment when she danced Juliet, the intelligent portrayal with no sign that she was aware of the tragic ending; neither in her body nor in her bedchamber. She took gently the burden of an apprehensive mantle. To Margot Fonteyn the powerful confrontation with Tybalt's murder, the prospect of having Paris as her husband and Romeo's death, came lightly that she pushed back her creator, William Shakespeare to a dull corner.
She alone was responsible popularizing Juliet more than the Bard and making the ballet more powerful than the story behind it than Shakespeare intended in his drama and lighting up the world (with Romeo) as the world's young tragic lovers.
We all who have seen her in the ballet, run the full length of the stage when she speeds off to meet the Friar in desperation.
Virgin purity
So, that was the icon behind the world of ballet that her fans came to hold her in reverence as Juliet, the young godess of virgin purity, hardly-fourteen year old Princess from the House of Capulets. Fonteyn gave so much life in to this character that no one else was able to supersede her.
Or did she
There was more in store for this perfect ballerina. This was in the wake when most dancers left Russia, departed for good under strained circumstances: never on amicable terms, so was Rudolf Nureyev, destined to be her eternal partner as they took world by storm, delighting new audiences.
Then, she was exposed.
Nowhere from the blues, a bombshell was dropped by the DANCE EUROPE magazine that shocked one and all and ripped apart her glory, Rudolf Nureyev may have died a hundred times.
Margot Fonteyn got trapped in a web of politics, intrigue and suspense like in a high-profile movie.
Legendary ballerina
She had worn a cloak of treachery around her flawless diminutive figure, fooling her audiences and choreographers.
While Britain's legendary ballerina Margot Fonteyn is remembered rather more for her dancing and partnership with Nureyev than for her involvement in politics, government files recently made public at the National Archives suggest that the dancer was not as innocent as her elegant manner suggested.
The files claim that Fonteyn was involved in a planned coup by her husband, Dr Roberto Arias, to overthrow the Panamanian government in April 1959. The coup went wrong, Fonteyn was jailed overnight and Arias went missing.
Smitten and desperate, Fonteyn had bad experience in jail not knowing where Arias was.
When released, Fonteyn is chronicled as having spoken with the British Ambassador to Panama who wrote: "She knew that her husband was gun running. She knew that he was accompanied by rebels and at one point she used her yacht as a decoy for government boats and aircraft away from the direction which her husband was taking."
On returning to London, she was famously grilled by the press but graciously fended off all questions with, "If I try to explain it to you, I'll get involved in something so complicated that I will be misquoted again and so I'd rather not talk about it".
The prima ballerina assoluta subsequently visited the UK's Foreign Minister, John Profumo, and told him how she had met Fidel Castro in Cuba with her husband earlier in the year and that, even though the conversations were in Spanish, she understood that Castro had agreed to help Arias.
Profumo wrote that he was so astonished by her story that he had pinch himself to make sure that he wasn't dreaming, but having promised to keep the conversation with Fonteyn confidential, he did not pass on the information to American colleagues.
When Arias finally surfaced in Brazil in June, Fonteyn duly wrote to Profumo, "I do want to thank you very much indeed for your extreme kindness to me. My husband's definitely out at last and I am trying to fly to Rio this evening. I do hope that you and Valerie will have time to come and see us when we are both back, and definitely no plotting."

[Parliament (26-07-2017)]
New Act : Central Bank to manage foreign exchange
The Central Bank as a Government agency would manage but not control foreign exchange under the new Foreign Exchange Act, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament.
He said the previous Act had to be repealed as there were contradictory provisions. While several provisions were to control, the others were to liberalise foreign exchange.
The Prime Minister said the objective of the new law is to promote and regulate foreign exchange and to bring in foreign exchange belonging to Sri Lankans for the development of the country.
He said there would be no draw of foreign reserves as the Government assures the preservation of foreign exchange is of paramount importance.
He said the Government would within next few months acquire US$ 1.1 billion to its account by way of transactions of the Hambantota harbour and another additional amount with the Mattala airport agreement.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations commencing the second reading debate of the Foreign Exchange Bill yesterday.
He said the country's Law applicable to foreign exchange is the Exchange Control Act 1924-1953. He said after World War II, many countries in the European Union brought in exchange control, whereas the UK had such a mechanism from the start of the WW II. With the WW II, many European Union and Asian economies collapsed. They would not have revived without the Marshal Aid Programme of the Americans. However, Sri Lanka did not see it necessary to control foreign exchange since it had sufficient reserves. The country had developed reserves during the war thanks to the sale of tea and rubber, he said.
"When we gained independence after the World War II, our reserves were such that we gave a loan to the United Kingdom. The Galoya project was implemented with the reserves of Sri Lanka. We did not have to go to the World Bank or any one else, the Prime Minister said.
"However, in 1953, we had a foreign exchange crisis when our earnings from tea and rubber dropped. Then, the Foreign Exchange Act was introduced. The situation revived, but the Central Bank and the then Foreign Minister felt this was a necessity. The proponents of the socialist economy thought the control of foreign exchange was necessary. It became a habit," he said.
"We started liberalising since 1977. Many countries that started liberalising after us had changed the laws, amended the laws and repealed the laws. Only 47 countries had not repealed restrictive laws on foreign exchange," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
"We have a peculiar system. On one hand, we have laws to control foreign exchange. But if you look at liberalisation, it has come through under many regimes. The law is to control foreign exchange, whereas the regulations are otherwise. We have a contradiction here. People don't have full confidence in Sri Lanka. The other is regulation on gold. We don't control gold. Any person can purchase gold but under the permission of the Director General of the Customs. It is not controlled by the Central Bank, but regulations say it should be controlled by the Customs. We have contradictory provisions in the Exchange Act. That's why we brought in new law," he said.
"The objective of the new law is to promote and regulate foreign exchange. We have repealed the Foreign Exchange Act. The key feature of the new law is that the Central Bank as a Government agency is responsible for implementing the law. They manage foreign exchange, they need not control foreign exchange. The authorised dealers and restricted dealers authorised to deal foreign exchange will continue to be subjected to the provisions of the law. Every Commercial Bank continues as authorised dealers. A citizen having foreign exchange or foreign asset may use it for current or capital transactions. Capital transactions will be defined by regulations. Certain classes of transactions will be free of control," the Prime Minister said.
He said if some one has undeclared foreign exchange outside Sri Lanka, the Government can bring them in. It will play a major role in the country's development. Foreign exchange is not the luxury of a few rich people, he said.
"There are many Sri Lankans who have foreign exchange outside Sri Lanka. We need to bring them in. Our interest rates are higher than those in many countries that those monies are kept. We have given concession to Sri Lankan citizens to remit upto US$ one million with only a remittance fee of 1 percent. We have excluded monies coming under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Conversion on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, the Bribery Act. If the monetary board says there is a shortage of foreign exchange, the minister with the approval of the Cabinet can regulate or restrict the remittance of foreign exchange for six months, thereafter, another six month with the approval of the Cabinet," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Agreement on H'tota Port Joint Venture toParliament today
The Government will table the agreement related to the Hambantota Port Joint Venture in Parliament today, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He was joining in the debate on the Foreign Exchange Bill in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said the agreement approved by the Cabinet yesterday would be tabled in Parliament by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe on the direction of President Mathiripala Sirisena.
We will provide ample room to debate the content of the agreement in Parliament. The project will be a great leap forward in relation to the development of the country. It will lay the foundation to convert the Hambantota port a profit making venture while generating thousands of employment opportunities for youth, the minister said.
Replying to criticisms on slow-paced investigations on fraud and corruption charges, the minister said, We have filed court cases pertaining to Rs. 3.1 billion worth money and property belonging to three members of the Rajapaksa family. These include lands, houses and black money invested on various purposes.
Minister Samaraweera, explaining on the debt crisis of the country, said, This year, we have to pay USD 2,805 million to repay the loans and interests. Loans obtained during the Rajapaksa regime account for 72 percent of the sum. The peak of the debt crisis will be from 2018-2020. In 2019, we have to find USD 4,245 million (Rs 3.2 trillion) to service the foreign debt. Loans obtained during the Rajapaksa regime account for 82 percent of the sum. However, the total annual revenue of the country is little over Rs 1 trillion".
The minister, observing that the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations is a vital step forward by the Government to resurrect the countrys economy, said the Government has taken precautions to address any potential detrimental impact from the move.
Police vehicle used in arrest attempt on Ryan Jayalath: Sagala
Man with five arrest warrants
The vehicle used in the incident involving the Medical Faculty Students Action Committee convener Ryan Jayalath last week was not a white van, but a Police vehicle, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said in parliament yesterday.
He said the persons involved the incident were police officers ordered to arrest Ryan in connection with several cases.
He expressed his regret over inconvenience caused to the public while making a ministerial statement.
Minister Ratnayake said he had observed serious mistakes and shortcomings in the operation carried out by Colombo Crime Division policemen when they tried to arrest Ryan Jayalath.
"I have obtained a report from the IGP on the incident occurred when the CCD officials attempted to arrest medical student Ryan Jayalath at the Organisation of Professionals Association premises in the Cinnamon Gardens police area on July 20," Minister Rathnayake said.
The incident occurred when police tried to arrest Jayalath, a wanted suspect with regard to the Case No. B 16250/17 at the Maligakanda Magistrate Court under the charge of trespass and damaging public property during a protest at the Health Ministry on June 21 and Case No B 3049/16 at the Fort Magistrate Court for violating court orders, the minister said.
He said Police had come to know that the suspect was at the OPA building on July 20. The CCD officials launched an operation to take the suspect into custody, Minister Rathnayake said. Four policemen in uniform and nine policemen in civvies had participated in the operation. They had been transported to the location by a vehicle belonging to the police and driven by an uniformed police driver, he said.
"I have instructed the IGP to ascertain whether there had been mistakes in the hands of senior police officials when they issued instructions to launch this operation which drew public displeasure and international attention," Minister Rathnayake said.
"The IGP has issued a circular on the methods to be adhered by policemen when they make an arrest."
He expressed regret to the public, the President and the Prime Minister for the inconvenience caused by the Police Department by Police conduct in trying to arrest medical faculty student Ryan Jayalath.
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena making a special statement under the standing order 23 (2) said the Government deploys white vans to abduct those who stand against them. He questioned if the Government deny that those in the civil attire were not the police officers. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the vehicle was not a white van but a Police vehicle. Court had issued five arrest warrants on Ryan, he said.
Dual citizenship holders allowed to serve in foreigndiplomatic missions
The Foreign Affairs Ministry has taken a decision to allow persons holding dual citizenship to serve in Foreign Diplomatic Missions of Sri Lanka, Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister said the decision was taken after discussions at the ministry.
Some Sri Lankans living in foreign countries are talented professionals. We are depriving the chance to get their services to the country, if we impose citizenship restrictions. These individuals are not elected public representatives unlike the MPs. There is no harm in appointing them to Foreign Diplomatic Missions, the minister said.
Responding to a question by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake in Parliament yesterday, the minister said two dual citizenship holders were among the appointees to Foreign Diplomatic Missions of Sri Lanka from August 1, 2015 to August 1, 2016.
Swarna Gunaratne, who was appointed as the Consul General of Los Angeles, USA in March 2016 is a Canadian and Sri Lankan dual national and Manoj Warnapala, who was appointed as Counsellor to Sri Lankan High Commission in London, UK in October 2015 is a British-Sri Lankan dual national, he said.
The JVP, however, questioned how the Government could assure the loyalty of the dual citizens appointed to represent Sri Lanka in overseas missions.
Parliament was told that 88 appointments to the Foreign Diplomatic Missions of Sri Lanka from August 1, 2015 to August 1, 2016 were made outside the Sri Lanka Foreign Service.
There are non-diplomatic officers, Cabinet appointees, officers from other relevant Ministries and Departments, Public Management Assistants, Drivers and Office Assistants among them, the answer given to Parliament stated.

In Parliament: Ravi raises privilege issue on Bond Commission
Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday in Parliament rounded on the members of PCol inquiring in to the Central Bank bond issues for summoning him before the Commission at short notice.
The minister, observing that his Parliament privileges have been breached by the summon issued to him on a day that Parliament sits and the Cabinet meeting takes place, requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to look into it.
Government servants must realise that they are part of the Government, Minister Karunanayake said.
They should not try to run the Government. Today the problem is that these people think they run the Government policy, the irate minister complained.
On Saturday, I received summons to come on Tuesday.
Everybody knows very well that I am a senior Cabinet member in the Government and Cabinet meetings take place on Tuesdays. Furthermore they also know it is a Parliament day, the minister stated while also stressing that he has no intention of disobeying the summons issued by the Commission and that he would appear before it as soon as Parliament duties permit him to do so.
The seemingly miffed minister also complained that, the opposition members who robbed the country for eleven years are going scot-free while senior Cabinet ministers in the Government are called before the Commissions.
This is the sense of transparency our Government is maintaining. I am so proud to be in this Government, he noted.
The minister, reminding that Parliament is a Supreme body as per the Constitution, said the right of a member to attend Parliament without hindrance or obstruction is a long recognized privilege as per the Parliament Powers and Privileges Act in the UK, other Commonwealth Parliaments and Sri Lanka.
Speaker Jayasuriya said he would take up the matter with relevant authorities.

Proud, Peaty cap Britains golden night at worlds
Budapest: Adam Peaty and Ben Proud both struck gold for Britain at the world aquatics championships on Monday as Hungarys Iron Lady Katinka Hosszu came close to tears.
Peaty clocked a new championship record of 57.47 seconds to defend his 100m breaststroke title and deliver Britain their first swimming gold in Budapest. The proud 22-year-old said the sight of the Union Flag alone fires him up before he races.
I find the Great British flag very motivating, as soon as I look at that its game time, said Peaty.
I love racing and doing it for my family and my mates back home, making them proud. Its great to have the support at home and from the crowd here tonight -- they went crazy when I walked out tonight. Peatys victory triggered more British swimming success at the Duna Arena, as less than half an hour later Proud won the mens 50m butterfly final in a photo finish.
Proud, 22, clocked 22.75 seconds in the sprint with Brazils Nicholas Santos, second at 0.04sec, with Andrii Govorov of Ukraine taking bronze, 0.09sec behind.
The 2014 Commonwealth champion was seen as an outsider having finished fourth in the semi-finals and Proud only realised he had won when no-one else celebrated.
Seeing what Adam Peaty has done, he has really taken Great Britain a step forward and made it easier for that next person to win gold, said Proud.
Hopefully some more will follow this week.
Hosszu admitted she was bursting with emotion after retaining her womens 200m individual medley title in front of her home crowd.
The 28-year-old is the first woman to win three world gold medals in the event.
She was roared on by the passionate crowd as hosts Hungary claimed their first swimming medal.
It was really amazing how everyone was supporting me in red, white and green, when I got out of the pool, I couldnt believe it, Hosszu said.
Thank you for the experience, it was unforgettable -- I almost cried. AFP

Research Scholars call for hi-tech rapid composting solution for waste management
Research Scholars of the Kelaniya University, Kothalawala Defence University,Sabaragamuwa University and Cordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI) are of the view that Sri Lanka needs a hi-tech rapid composting solution along with proper integrated mechanism to manage issues arising from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) collection process and to achieve sustainable development goals.
Following a request made by the Central Environment Authority (CEA) Chairman, a research was conducted to identify the best waste management system suitable for Sri Lanka and it was identified that the High-Tech Japanese Solution (ESR) as the best solution for the countrys waste management issue. The report was submitted to the CEA before a year go,but measures have yet been taken for its implementation, said the Director and the Coordinator of the Research Centre for Social Sciences of the University of Kelaniya Social Sciences Faculty Prof. M.G.Kularatne.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Prof. Kularatne said the government has not yet been identified the most efficient and effective waste management system suitable for the country.
The University and the CEA has no authority to implement this system and the relevant government authorities should take measures to implement this. This could be implemented as public private partnership project, he said.
Prof. Kularatne said that it was essential to have an integrated waste management system supported by modern technological innovation to address the issue. The proposed ESR is based on a patented microbial and mechanical process in a controlled and closed environment. This technology has also been in successfully operating since 1994 in many countries such as India, Japan, China, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia.
ESR converts waste in to compost in 24 hours while other composting technologies need a minimum 6-10 weeks. Space utilisation for the large-scale machinery is just four perches, no effluents, no smell with no bearing on the public.The ESR system can operate anywhere in Sri Lanka. It can be used for solid, liquid any other waste dis[osal.ESR solutions are scalable and available in many capacities from 1 MT to 100 MT per day.

SLFPs 66th anniversary celebrations under Presidents patronage
The 66th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will be held on a very grand scale under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at 1.30 pm on September 2 at Campbell Park, SLFP Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said. Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Bandara said that all arrangements have been made to make this anniversary celebration a remarkable one and party representatives from all electorates including Womens organisations, youth organisations and trade unions in the country will attend the function.
He said the SLFP is progressing with reforms to face challenges under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. Many people say that the unity government contains only the UNP policies. But, this is not true since many SLFP policies are also followed by the government. President Sirisena was instrumental in changing many decisions taken by the unity government as they are against the S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike policies. Even though, the previous government outright granted the Port City project to a Chinese company,President Sirisena converted this into a 99 year lease. The President rectified the mistake made during the previous government which was totally against the SLFP policies,Bandara said.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera is the first SLFP member who had made a complaint to the Commission to Inquire the Allegations of Bribery or Corruption over the Central Bank bond issue, he said.
We formed this government with an objective of arresting corruption and fraud as it is one of the pledges in our manifesto, the SLFP Youth Front Chairman said.
The President as a clean politician appointed special Presidential Commission to investigate into this scam.This goes to show that the SLFP is not a cats-paw of any party, he said.
The former President granted lots of privileges and high positions to the UNP members when they crossedover. This allegedly weakened the SLFP and rendered the party members helpless. This was one of the main reasons for the SLFPs defeat during the previous Presidential election.Since,the party had no majority, we had to form a unity government with the UNP in 2015 which has been approved by the SLFP Central Committee. Therefore, all must join hands with the President to further strengthen the party. The SLFP members must unite to strengthen the party in order to from a SLFP led government by 2020, Bandara said.

SLRC with IFRC helping to contain dengue in country
Due to the rise in the number of dengue cases to105,000 in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society with the support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are rapidly scaling up emergency assistance to help contain one of the countrys worst-ever outbreak of dengue in recent times.
The Ministry of Health reports that the number of dengue infections is at 105,153 since the start of 2017, with over 301 deaths. The number of cases this year has already doubled the number of dengue infections recorded in all of 2016, when 55,150 people were diagnosed with the disease.
Accordingly, the Sri Lanka Red Cross has allocated Rs. 50 million through the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the IFRC, to scale up dengue awareness activities in the next few months. These funds will aim to support over 310,000 people in severely affected districts of Colombo, Gampaha & Kalutara.
Dengue is endemic here, but one reason for the dramatic rise in cases is that the virus currently spreading has evolved and people lack the immunity to fight off the new strain, says Dr Novil Wijesekara, from the Health Department at the Sri Lanka Red Cross.
Compounding the crisis, the recent monsoon rains and floods have left pools of stagnant water and rotting rain-soaked trash - ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes. Ongoing downpours and worsening sanitation conditions raise concerns that the disease would continue to spread.
Teams of Sri Lankan Red Cross volunteers have been supporting a large-scale government effort to stem the outbreak - providing patient care at hospitals and going door-to-door with public health inspectors to raise awareness about the disease, its symptoms and how to prevent its spread. Volunteers have also been helping authorities to identify and clean sites where mosquitoes are breeding.
In coordination with government partners, the Red Cross teams are set to expand patient care at six priority hospitals and improve or install water and sanitation at nine medical facilities.
Additional teams of volunteers would be trained to identify and eliminate vector breeding sites, and then deploy to 72 vulnerable communities to lead household, school and community information and clean-up campaigns.
The size of this dengue outbreak is unprecedented in Sri Lanka, says Jagath Abeysinghe, President of Sri Lanka Red Cross. It will require a united front in support of the governments prevention and control programme and committed community action to tackle it.

Stokes wants England to right second Test wrongs
LONDON July 25: Ben Stokes has urged England to bounce back from their Trent Bridge thumping by South Africa and show how good they really are when the third Test at The Oval starts on Thursday.
England were thrashed by 340 runs with more than a day to spare at the Nottingham ground as South Africa levelled the four-match series in commanding style.
The hosts have now had over a week to ponder on that defeat, with all-rounder Stokes insisting there was nothing wrong with Englands attitude.
You take good performances and bad performances in your stride and I think its all about how we come back in this Test which will prove how good of a side we are, he told Sky Sports at The Oval on Tuesday. Obviously, it wasnt an ideal performance from us as a team and we know that, the Durham star added.
Its good that we managed to get time away and sort of look back on and assess where we went wrong and hopefully we can right the wrongs this week.
No-ones ever going to get questioned in that changing room about their fight and desire for wanting to perform for England. A lack of runs cost England dear in Nottingham, with Joe Roots side managing 215 in the first innings before collapsing to 133 all out second time around.
But with England having won the series opener at Lords by an emphatic 211 runs, Stokes was confident that South Africa did not now have a huge advantage in terms of momentum. Its 1-1, both games have been pretty one-sided and the team who won swapped around, he said.
Weve got two games left so we just need to make sure that we come out here and put in a better performance than we did at Trent Bridge and really take a front foot in the series. The 26-year-old added: I think the biggest question is just being able to adapt better. We obviously didnt quite get to grips with that in that last innings so I think the quicker we can learn to adapt to different situations the better off we will be.
Meanwhile Stokes paid tribute to Englands womens team, who won a thrilling World Cup final against India in front of a sold-out Lords on Sunday. AFP

Tough laws prerequisite for economic prosperity - Tittawella
Sri Lanka must look at a disciplined society and the rule of law must prevail, said former Chairman PERC, and present Chairman EAP Group, Mano Tittawella at the economic summit 2017 yesterday at Cinnamon Grand.
He said that Singapore in 1960 was in a bad state with unlawful society and the country today has transformed as a major economic power. This was made possible due to implementing tough laws, he said.
This sentiment was also endorsed by Dr. Aravind Subramanian, Chief Economic Advisor to the government of India. He said that Sri Lanka badly needs a framework change to create a disciplined society to take the country forward.
Subramanian said that the country should also change its economic direction from time to time in a bid to adjust to changes in the world. If you take Singapore in 1960s it was a country with unrest and violence.
Then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew tightened criminal laws and implemented tough discipline. The former Prime Minister even went to the extent of banning the eating of chewing gum and this worked well and the sociality got disciplined.
He said that then Singapore introduced the free port concept and followed it by offering bunkering facilities at competitive rates to attract globe businesses. Subsequently the country went in to manufacture cheap electronics and electoral appliances and with the price of labour increasing the next Singapore was transformed as a financial hub.
Moving with modern day demands Singapore has now readjusted as a major tourism, education and medical hub attracting major global businesses.
He said India too opened their economy but had controls to safe guard local businesses.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced a new financial bill cancelling some of the high value currencies and this was a message to install discipline in the country. The recent introduction of GST which may be the biggest reform that happened in the region to is a step taken in this angle and it has simplified the tax system to a great extent.
Before this was implemented it was easy to transform money from Bombay to London than transferring them from Bombay to Delhi, he added.
The two-day event will conclude today. Sunshine Holdings PLC is the Platinum Sponsor of the event, Standard Chartered Bank enters the fray as the Gold Sponsor, Fonterra Brands as the Silver Sponsor and Dialog Axiata is the Telecommunications Partner. Whilst Janashakthi Insurance, Prima Group, Nestle Lanka, GS1 Lanka and Sri Lanka Convention Bureau join in as the strategic partners. Echo Wave comes is the Digital Events Platform Partner and OMD of OmniCom MediaGroup is the communications partner.

Under-prepared India no match for well-organised Sri Lanka
A tour to Sri Lanka by India always evokes memories of their first-ever Test tour in 1985 which marked the countrys first ever Test victory as well as their maiden Test series win. It is a well known fact that Sri Lankas energetic and well-organised pre-season training proved decisive - in stark contrast to Indias near total lack of preparation.
Sri Lanka very nearly reached the milestone of their first victory in the first Test played at the SSC, but resolute and dogged batting from Dilip Vengsarkar - and typically tropical weather - denied them the opportunity. Lanka were left chasing 123 for victory in 11 overs and ended up at 61-4. Ranjan Madugalle and Arjuna Ranatunga the countrys young leading lights scored their maiden Test centuries and Rumesh Ratnayake produced the best bowling figures by a Sri Lankan at the time with 6 for 85.
However the second Test played at the P Sara Oval proved the emotive moment for crickets then-newest Test nation.
Winning the toss and batting first Sri Lanka put up a slow batting performance on the opening day plodding their way to 168-1 in 89 overs. That the Indians were underprepared for the tour was clear when they grassed seven catches in one of the worst fielding displays in a days play. A century by wicket-keeper batsman Amal Silva and a polished knock of 85 by Roy Dias saw Sri Lanka reach 385. Despite half-centuries from Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Sunil Gavaskar and Mohinder Amarnath, India frittered away their margin of safety when they lost four wickets for 32 runs on the fourth morning to concede a 141-run first innings lead to Sri Lanka giving the home team time to set up a declaration by the fourth afternoon. India were bundled out for 244 by the Lankan seam attack of Asantha de Mel, Rumesh Ratnayake and Saliya Ahangama that exploited the conditions to the maximum capturing nine of the wickets. Dias and Aravinda de Silva hit quickfire half-centuries to enable Duleep Mendis, the skipper to set up a declaration that left their bowlers a whole day to bring about the countrys first Test win.
Sri Lanka picked up the wickets of Rajput, Srikkanth and Vengsarkar for 62 by lunch to put India under immense pressure to stave off defeat. By mid-afternoon India found themselves sliding towards defeat as they lost four wickets for 14 runs within the space of 43 balls as Ratnayake, De Mel and Ahangama scythed into their middle order.
Skipper Kapil Dev with the help of Laxman Sivaramakrishnan carried India to 136-7 at tea and extended their eighth wicket stand to 70 in 85 minutes before De Mel separated them by having the latter caught behind by Amal Silva to give him the fifth catch of the innings and nine dismissals in the match for the second successive time in the series. A defiant 78 by Kapil Dev threatened to deny the home side, but Ratnayake dived and took a smart return catch off his own bowling to dismiss the Indian captain and seal the victory which led to a nationwide celebration and a public holiday the following day. India was dismissed for 198 to give Sri Lanka victory by 149 runs. Silvas century and nine dismissals in the match was an unprecedented feat by a wicket-keeper in a Test match.
If the second Test was for the Lankan bowlers, the third proved the resolution they had as a batting unit. Set 377 to win at the picturesque Asgiriya Stadium, Kandy, Sri Lanka stumbled to 34 for 3 before their two most accomplished batsmen - Roy Dias and Duleep Mendis - saved the innings (and the match) with a partnership worth 216. Sri Lankas captain and vice-captain swung the game away from India with their amazing counter-attack, and by lunch on the final day there was even a chance that Sri Lanka might score an improbable victory, but a run out ended Sri Lankas hopes of achieving the impossible.
Dias and Mendis were involved in a terrible mix up over a single that resulted in both batsmen ending up at the non-strikers end. Dias had to go for a classy 106. His dismissal sparked a mini collapse as Sri Lanka lost four wickets for 17 runs in 10 overs. Mendis was out for 124 and Arjuna Ranatunga and Roshan Jurangpathy went without scoring as Sri Lanka slipped from 250-3 to 267-7. It was left to Aravinda de Silva and De Mel to steer Sri Lanka to a draw. They did it with a degree of skill and luck with the umpires calling off play 20 minutes before the scheduled close to bad light, giving Sri Lanka their first Test series win.
Throughout the series Sunil Gavaskar an established opening batman decided to bat in the middle order for reasons best known to him. India without his experience at the top never got off to a good start throughout the series. The best stand that Lalchand Rajput and Krishnamachari Srikkanth put together was 39 in the first two Tests. It was after Rajput was replaced by Ravi Shastri for the final Test that India finally produced an opening partnership of over 50.
Kapil Dev struck a sour note when he blamed poor umpiring decisions for his teams defeat and added, Sri Lanka are very good here, but I dont think they will win outside.
Those words rang true for a decade before Sri Lanka finally broke the shackles to record their first Test win overseas in 1995 against New Zealand at Napier.

Vintages sets sight for point de Galle
The Vintage Car Owners Club which is the pioneer motoring heritage club has made arrangements to hold its annual drive from Colombo to Galle in the oldest of the old motor cars on August 8 this year.
This is a mighty task as all cars on the drive have surpassed 75 years of age and it is not for the faint- hearted to take up the challenge to motor a good 72 miles in a brace of motorcars that was registered prior to the year 1940.
This is the challenge to prove the might of the Vintage motors and the Club is glad to note of the many members who are keen to bring out their vintage delights to participate at this unique event. The drive will be flagged off in Moratuwa and will head southwards along the Galle Road for a lunch break at Beruwela. The parade of the vintages will chug along to Hikkaduwa which would be the place of rest for both the motorcars and the participants prior to setting off on the last lap being the Galle Fort where heritage and vintages will come together creating an absolute ambience of nostalgia of the glory days of the past. This event is much awaited by the vintage motoring fans both local and foreign who swarm the Fort to witness the display much to their amazement to note of the long distance covered and to also note of the excellent condition of these cars that have been in existence for over 75 year.
President of the Club Neil Fernando takes great pleasure to host the participants on an overnight stay with many a fun filled events to keep the vintage toes tapping prior to setting off back to Colombo after a good nights sleep and a hearty breakfast on the following day.
The main organizer of the event Saman Karunanayake is delighted to note of the great interest taken by his fellow members on the above event and it would be an ideal opportunity to witness the oldest of Old motoring Marvels to take on to the streets once again

SL needs to cast FTA net bigger
Institute of policy Studies Deputy Director says that it is much more strategic to have more bi-lateral FTAs and unilateral reforms that will allow Sri Lanka to pace and sequence the trade strategy in a way that the country could reap best tangible benefits out of it.
Commenting on the Indo - Lanka FTA, at the Economic Summit Weerakoon noted that benefits that Sri Lanka received out of the FTA were largely on the services and investment front even thought the agreement was on goods.
Noting that the issues of FTAs and bi-lateral reforms are magnets for the oppositions to hold rallies in the current climate, Weerakoon added that Sri Lanka doesnt have more options but to look at integrating with the global economy as it is a resources constraint emerging economy.
Sri Lanka simply doesnt have a market size to generate growth at a reasonable rate and sustain it over a period of time without relaying on imports of food and services. 
Also Sri Lanka needs to cast its FTA net quite wide while initiating bi-lateral negotiations with a large group of countries with the objective of integrating with the global community.
She said that there is a considerable space for Sri Lanka to align its bi-lateral FTA negotiations with unilateral reforms and th closer economic integration can also have a negative impact on an economy and create long- term structural unemployment in the country.

ABM Exide to introduce revolutionary quick charge battery
Associated Battery Manufacturers (Ceylon) Limited (ABM) plans to double its battery exports in 2017/18 and introduce a quick charge battery to the market, said ABM Director, CEO M Ramachandran.
The Director said they plan to focus on more innovative technology this year and has signed an agreement with Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) to increase charge acceptance where the batteries will get charged in a very short period.
This will create a revolutionary change in the automobile battery market in Sri Lanka, he noted. Further, batteries for electric vehicle will be manufactured targeting electric three-wheelers and when the Sri Lankan market shifts to electric vehicles their products would be ready.
ABM also plan to build solar batteries which will be charged through solar panels to coincide with the governments efforts to promote small and medium scale installations of solar which will need more solar storing facilities like houses,offices and shops. Rs 200 million will be allocated in capacity enhancement and new battery projects and Rs 6.5 million in research and development.
He said the ABM was able to achieve a 17% growth in its top-line and bottom-line in the backdrop of Government policy changes affecting its battery sales in the three-wheeler OEM segment by 50% in Sri Lanka.
Despite decline in the three wheeler market, particularly in OEM, due to the changes in government policy we recorded a growth of 17%and this was possible mainly due to the new strategies that we adopted particularly in the manufacturing and sale of motorcycle batteries and commencing battery exports overseas last year, he said.
ABM meanwhile has recorded a healthy financial performance registering turnover of over Rs 150 million from battery exports and posting a profit before tax (PBT) of Rs 241.65 million in the financial year 2016/17. In 2017/18 ABM intend to double their export targeting an export revenue of Rs 300 million with sales expected to reach Rs 3.1 billion.
Ramachandran said they have recorded significant inroads in battery exports overseas last year and have now established their EXLAN and ABMEX brands in Dubai, Singapore, Indonesia, Myanmar and Maldives.
The feedback and performance for these exports has been very encouraging. Particularly the most severe application of the companys brands has been in the taxi segment in counties like Dubai where the temperature goes up to as high as 50 degrees Celsius and the car bonnet temperature going up to 70 degrees Celsius. Also taxis run on average 70-80,000 km in six to seven months in these countries, he said.
In that segment the feedback was that EXLAN and ABMEX batteries were doing very well whereas other battery brands had trend to fail within six months, the CEO/Director said.This is mainly because of the quality and the consistency of the performance of our batteries. We have checked some of our batteries that have completed more than seven months and the usage of more than 80,000 km used in taxis and found that they were in very good condition and we expect the batteries to easily perform perfectly for over one year.
The overseas distributor wants to project this battery with a one years warranty and ABMis prepared to provide this guarantee to their dealers in Dubai which will change the game in the taxi segment having more penetration, the Director/CEO, said. Ramachandran expressed optimism of a good future in the Dubai market for their brands EXLAN and ABMEX in the future.
He said they were doing well in Singapore and the distributors in Myanmar were very happy with the performance and all these achievements have been made competing in a very price competitive export market. It is not that we go with a very cheap product in terms of price but by offering new technology, quality and consistency in performance and providing one years guarantee against six months guarantee we get a better premium, he opined.
Ramachandran said they were also doing a lot of cost reduction activities by adopting Kaizen methods in their production line under the supervision of the newly appointed Kaizen committee and that has helped immensely in cost reduction.
The CEO disclosed that they will be venturing into two new areas this year by exporting batteries to the African and Pakistan markets and last year they had made a breakthrough in the motorcycle battery market in Sri Lanka by entering it with their own products.
Among the significant achievements has been the drastic reduction in warranty claims from 7% three years ago (2013/14) to 2.4% and this has helped them increase their market share which went down to 45% has now reach the 60 %penetration, with a year-end target of 65%, he said.
He said with the good feedback they have been able to convert dealers of competitors into their fold and have been able to introduce new products with different warranty terms to the market.
They have also strengthened their service network and battery replacements were done quickly when required and this service applies to other brands as well.
A new website was also been formulated that will give firsthand information of their products and troubleshooting solutions to customers and function as a user guide, he added.

Subscribing to the Rights Issue, IB Growth Fund (IBGF) together with their ultimate parent company Islamic Development Bank (IDB), have increased their shareholding to 29.9% of the Bank, showing strong confidence on the Banks future and the countrys economic progress and future prospects, despite Sri Lanka being a non-member country of the IDB. Commenting on the successful rights issue campaign, the Banks Chairman Osman Kassim said The oversubscription of the Banks Rights Issue signifies the confidence our shareholders have in Amna Banks journey and we are really honoured and grateful to have their support and commitment. This capital infusion will take the Bank to greater heights
Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said, I am very optimistic of our future and look forward to the excitement and challenge as we enter our next phase of growth.

Anuradhapura undergoes acute water shortage
A few irrigation tanks in the Anuradhapura district contain water at present even though district boasts 2,449 tanks, sources from the Agrarian Services Development Department said.
The district counts a population of 893,000 and 300,000 persons receive drinking water from the Tissawewa, Thuruvila, and Nuwarawewa reservoirs.
The Water Supply and Drainage Board indicates that if the water capacity of the Nuwarawewa tank goes down to around 6,000 acre feet, providing drinking water will be a major issue as the water available at that level get mixed with sediment and other waste.
The Mahaweli Authority has released additional water to the Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks.
Although the government agent Anuradhapura and WSDB (NCP) have asked the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to release 300 acre feet of Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa, so far they have not responded.
The Mahaweli water from the Kalawewa cannot be sent directly to the Nuwarawewa. It should come via the Nachchaduwa tank but it has to be filled to a larger capacity so as to get released the water.
Therefore, the public are requested to use the pipe-borne water from Nuwarawewa, Thuruvila and Tisawewa economically without wasting the water for unnecessary tasks like car washing, the Government Agent RM Wanninayake said.

Bangladeshs Fizz on target for Australia, says Walsh
DHAKA AFP July25, 2017 Bangladesh pace bowling hope Mustafizur Rahman is on track to return to form when Australia visit next month, fast bowling coach Courtney Walsh said Tuesday.
The 21-year-old, known as Fizz, created a sensation with 26 wickets in his first nine one-day internationals. He burst onto the international scene in 2015 with back-to-back five-wicket hauls against India.
But surgery on his left shoulder last year forced a lengthy layoff and raised worries about his future after he took just 13 wickets in 18 international since returning.
At the Champions Trophy in England this summer, Mustafizur managed only one wicket in four matches even though Bangladesh reached the semi-finals against India.
I noticed he was falling away a little bit in England. We have been trying to get him to be more upright and balanced so that he can pull through, Walsh told reporters. We are also trying to get back his pace to where it used to be and get him a little bit closer to the stumps.
He knows what needs to be done as well. I have to give him credit because he is eager to get out there and practise. The Caribbean great, who joined the Bangladesh coaching team last September, said he did not want to change Mustafizurs bowling action.
I wouldnt say he will have a new bowling action but we are trying to get him more balanced at the crease and get him a bit closer to the stumps, he said.
Last couple of days, he has been close to what he used to be. He is heading in the right direction. Australia are scheduled to start a two-Test Bangladesh tour next month and Mustafizur is expected to spearhead the hosts pace attack.

BMS retains Red Bull Campus Cricket National title
Business Management School (BMS) recorded a thumping 9-wicket win over Saegis Campus in the final of the Red Bull Campus Cricket National 2017 and defended their title at the P. Sara Oval Stadium in Colombo last Saturday.
Put into bat first Saegis were given a torrid ride by the BMS before they were shot out for 100 runs, inclusive of five runs through the Energiser Over, with 17 deliveries remaining. The titleholders on the other hand wasted very little time to race to victory and retain their silverware, with 56 balls to spare.
BMS opener Geshan Wimaladharma, who claimed two wickets earlier on, laid the foundation to a thumping win as he guided his side with a blistering knock of 46 runs off 25 balls. Wimaladharma hit four boundaries and four sixes before falling as the only BMS victim of the final at 66.
Wimaladharmas partner, Hashan Dumindu, had very little role to play when he was on crease, but accelerated soon after the loss of his partner. He remained unbeaten on 29 off 26 deliveries and hit two fours and a six. Sadeera Samarawickrama, who was in fine form throughout the competition was 17 not out when BMS reached the winning post. Samarawickrama faced 14 balls during his knock and hit a four and a six.
Earlier on, put into bat first, Saegis were made to struggle from the very beginning as they went on to lose wickets at regular intervals. Janith Liyanage bowled only one over and claimed three wickets, off a hat-trick before BMS sealed the deal.
National cap Wanindu Hasaranga and Wimaladharma claimed two wickets each while seamsters Ranitha Liyanarachchi, Koshan Danushka and skipper Dinuk Wickramanayake picked a wicket each. We are proud and humbled to have achieved our goal of representing Sri Lanka for the 2nd time at the Red Bull Campus Cricket World finals in September. We also owe a lot to Niroshan (Dickwella) for being with us right throughout this tournament despite his commitments to the National team, said BMS skipper, Dinuk Wickramanayake.

For the first time in Sri Lankan medical history, a leg from a brain dead individual, has been attached to another at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. The operation took place on Monday (24). At present less than 10 such operations have been done around the world.
A year ago, a 32-year-old man had to have his leg amputated just above his knee as a result of an accident.
In the meantime, a 52 year old man who lay brain dead due to a brain haemorrhage and presented himself as a likely candidate for the young mans leg, Anuradhapura Teaching Hospitals Vascular and Transplant Surgeon, Dr. Joel Arudchelvam said.
The young man had given consent to the surgery and the family members of the brain dead individual had given their consent for the amputation.
The operation was headed by Dr Arudchelvam together with surgeon Dr Amila Ratnayaka, Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Nuwan Wijesinha, Anaesthetic Dr Levan Kariyawasam, a nursing team and support staff. All members of the team work at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital.
When attaching an external organ to a patient, the donors external as well as internal specifications have to be similar.
Their blood groups, as well as their skin colour and other physical features have to match, explained Dr Arudchelvam.
The nerve endings of the attached leg is now functioning well and the young man is in good health and currently recovering at the ICU at the hospital, he added. The 52-year-old mans kidneys too has been donated and the two kidneys were sent to the Kandy General Hospital on Wednesday.
They are to provide new life to two patients suffering from kidney failure.

Britain to ban sale of all diesel and petrol cars and vans from 2040

As part of a government strategy to improve air quality, Britain is to ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040 amid fears that rising levels of nitrogen oxide pose a major risk to public health.
The commitment, whichfollows a similar pledge in France, is part of the governments much-anticipated clean air plan, which has been at the heart of a protracted high court legal battle.
The government warned that the move, which will also take in hybrid vehicles, was needed because of the unnecessary and avoidable impact that poor air quality was having on peoples health. Ministers believe it poses the largest environment risk to public health in the UK, costing up to 2.7bn in lost productivity in one recent year.
Ministers have been urged to introduce charges for vehicles to enter a series of clean air zones (CAZ). However, the government only wants taxes to be considered as a final resort amid a backlash against any move that punishes motorists.
Poor air quality is the biggest environmental risk to public health in the UK and this government is determined to take strong action in the shortest time possible, a government spokesman said.
That is why we are providing councils with new funding to accelerate development of local plans, as part of an ambitious 3bn programme to clean up dirty air around our roads.
The final plan, which was due by the end of July, comes after a draft report that environmental lawyers described as much weaker than hoped for.
The environment secretary, Michael Gove, will be hoping for a better reception when he publishes the final document on Wednesday following months of legal wrangling.
A briefing on parts of the plan, seen by the Guardian, repeats the heavy focus on the steps that can be taken to help councils improve air quality in specific areas where emissions have breached EU thresholds.
Measures to be urgently brought in by local authorities that have repeatedly breached EU rules include retrofitting buses and other public transport, changing road layouts and altering features such as roundabouts and speed humps.
Reprogramming traffic lights will also be included in local plans, with councils being given 255m to help accelerate their efforts. Local emissions hotspots will be required to layout their plans by March 2018 and finalise them by the end of the year. A targeted scrappage scheme is also expected to be included.
Some want the country-wide initiative to follow in the footsteps of London, which is introducing a 10 toxic T-charge that will be levied on up to 10,000 of the oldest, most polluting vehicles every weekday.
Sources insisted that while the idea of charges were on the table, there was no plan to force councils to introduce them, and that other measures would be exhausted first.
They hope the centrepiece of Wednesdays strategy to be put forward by Gove will be the plan to ban diesel and petrol sales completely by 2040, in line with Emmanuel Macrons efforts across the Channel.
The French president took the steps to help his country meet its targets under the Paris climate accord, in an announcement that came a day afterVolvo said it would only make fully electric or hybrid cars from 2019 onwards.
That decision was hailed as the beginning of the end for the internal combustion engines dominance of motor transport after more than a century.
Prof David Bailey, an automotive industry expert at Aston University, said: The timescale involved here is sufficiently long term to be taken seriously. If enacted it would send a very clear signal to manufacturers and consumers of the direction of travel and may accelerate a transition to electric cars.
Britains air quality package also includes 1bn in ultra-low emissions vehicles including investing nearly 100m in the UKs charging infrastructure and funding the Plug in Car and Plug in Grant schemes.
There will also be 290m for the national productivity investment fund, which will go towards the retrofitting, and money towards low emission taxis.
The report will also include an air quality grant for councils, a green bus fund for low carbon vehicles, 1.2bn for cycling and walking and 100m to help air quality on the roads.
The strategy comes amid warnings that the UKs high level of air pollution could bebe responsible for 40,000 premature deaths a year.
A judge had said the governments original plans on tackling the issue, which included five clean air zones, wereso poor as to be unlawful. The government had been asked to present a new draft policy to tackle air pollution from diesel traffic before the election.
The government was then called to court to explain why it had made a last-minute application late last Friday to delay publication of a draft policy to tackle air pollution until after the election.
James Eadie QC, representing the government, said the policy was ready to be published but it would be controversial and should therefore be withheld until after the election.
If you publish a draft plan, it drops all the issues of controversy into the election  like dropping a controversial bomb, he said, adding that it could risk breaching rules about civil service neutrality and lead to the policy being labelled a Tory plan.
However, judges said the government did have to publish a draft plan with the final version needed by the end of July.
Mays draft contained few concrete proposals and did not specify the cities and towns where polluting vehicles might face charges, the level of any charges or the scope or value of any scrappage scheme.
Instead, the plan puts the onus for action on local authorities: Local authorities are already responsible for improving air quality in their area, but will now be expected to develop new and creative solutions to reduce emissions as quickly as possible, while avoiding undue impact on the motorist.
Analysis in the documents showed increasing the number of CAZs from the current six planned to 27 would make by far the greatest impact in cutting pollution and provide cost benefits of over 1bn. The CAZ policy would cut more than 1,000 times more NO2 than a scrappage scheme, even if that scheme required old diesels to be replaced by electric cars.
But it required local authorities to exhaust all other options before introducing CAZ charging for diesel vehicles such as removing speed bumps and retrofitting buses.
At the time Thornton said: The plan looks much weaker than we had hoped for. The court ordered the government to take this public health issue seriously and while the government says that pollution is the largest environmental risk to public health, we will still be faced with illegal air quality for years to come under these proposals.
The coalition government had already set out a vision for almost every car and van to be ultra-low emission by 2050  a move which the government acknowledged would require almost all new cars and vans sold to be near-zero emission at the tailpipe by 2040. So it is unclear to what extent the new pledge will further boost Britains ability to achieve air quality requirements.
ClientEarth, the campaign group that has successfully pursued the government through the courts over the UKs air pollution crisis, gave a cautious welcome to the announcement but said ministers must take action now to tackle the UKs air pollution crisis.
The government has trumpeted some promising measures with its air quality plans, but we need to see the detail, said CEO James Thornton. A clear policy to move people towards cleaner vehicles by banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars and vans after 2040 is welcome, as is more funding for local authorities.
However, the law says ministers must bring down illegal levels of air pollution as soon as possible, so any measures announced in this plan must be focused on doing that.
London mayor Sadiq Khan has been calling for tougher measures to tackle air pollution which kills 9,000 people a year in the capital.
A City Hall source was sceptical about the governments announcement.We need to look at the full details but what Londoners suffering from the terrible health impacts of air pollution desperately need is a fully-funded diesel scrappage fund  and they need it right now.
Areeba Hamid, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: The high court was clear that the government must bring down toxic air pollution in the UK in the shortest possible time. This plan is still miles away from that. The government cannot shy away any longer from the issue of diesel cars clogging up and polluting our cities, and must now provide real solutions, not just gimmicks. That means proper clean air zones and funding to support local authorities to tackle illegal and unsafe pollution.

Cabinet nod for Hambantota Port lease
The Cabinet approved the proposal to lease out the Hambantota Port to the China Merchants Company (CMP), Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Ministry of Ports and Shipping, Minister said that the terms of concession agreement is for 99 years in which Sri Lanka will have 30 percent ownership and CMP will have 70 percent ownership. He added that agreed investment value was US$ 1.12 Billion.
The Minister said the proposed agreement will be presented to Parliament today (26) and a debate on this has been scheduled for Friday (28).
The agreement will be signed on Saturday after the debates,he said.
Two separate Sri Lankan companies would be formed to deal with administrational and commercial operations of the Port. Hambantota International Port Services Company (HIPS) will undertake the management of port services such as port security, navigational services, pilotage, anchorage, provision of aids to navigation, dredging, widening, emergency responses and pollution control services. The majority equity of this company will be vested with Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) will hold a share of 50.7% and CMP 49.3%.
Commercial operations will be handled by Hambantota International Port Group (Pvt) Ltd (HIPG). The majority equity of this company would be vested with CMP and SLPA will hold a share of 15% and CMP 85%.
Minister Samarasinghe said CMP had agreed to sell SLPA a further 20% equity within a period of 10 years.He added that SLPA has the right to purchase all shares upon expiry of 70 years or transfer majority of 76.8% in the company HIPS and a shareholding of 60% in the company HIPG to SLPA in 80 years at USD 1.
Minister further said CMP had agreed to make a royalty payment based on cargo throughput and maximum dividends would be payable on profits derived.
The Hambantota Port was constructed with an investment of Rs 193 billion through commercial loans obtained by the Sri Lankan government and the annual loan repayment for SLPA is around Rs 9.1 billion.
Investment of USD 600 Million is required to equip the container terminal and make the port fully operational. The annual loan repayment commitment operations from November 2011 and as at end of 2016 the accumulated loss was over Rs 46.7 billion. After the agreement is signed, the Treasury board would take the responsibility of loan repayments, therefore Rs 9.1 billion would be remained with the SLPA and they can use for development activities, he said.
Of the 1,574 hectares of land area of the port only 1,115 hectares will be enlisted to the lease agreement.
Despite gazette notifications issued in 2008 with the land area of 1,574 hectares as Hambantota Port limits, a land area of only 1,115 hectares has been identified to be leased to the companies, which carry out port management, the Minister said.
He added that the Ports and Shipping Minister has the right to appoint a Port Regulator. Besides, the sole responsibility and authority in relation with national security is with the Government of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, overall port security, customs handling, immigration and emigration activities are carried out by the Sri Lanka side deploying local personnel.
According to the agreement Chinese stakeholder cannot use the port as a military navel base. If a foreign ship especially a naval ship will call over at the port, the permission should be obtained from the Sri Lankan Government.
The transaction will be subject to all applicable laws of the country such as Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act, Merchants Shipping Act, Customs Ordinance, Immigration Regulations, Licence of Shipping Agents and other applicable National Laws and relevant International Treaties and Conventions, the Minister added.
Minster Samarasinghe said that once the agreement is forwarded to the parliament, new proposals for the agreements are welcome aiming to fine tune the agreement.
Minister noted that the Government never sells the port even if certain people level baseless allegations. Minister highlighted that the agreement is a Win  win situation for the both parties.
I was instructed and ordered by the President at the Cabinet meeting to make sure that the port is not going to be sold he added.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about the employees, the Minister said that within six months efficiency and diligence of the employees will be looked at to decide whether to retain them or not. He added that the employees who get removed will be paid a VRS based on labour laws of the country.
The Minister further said that barring trade unions with political agenda, the others have agreed with the revised agreement. SLPA Chairman, Dr Parakrama Dissanayake said continuous losses were threatening the survival and continuity of SLPA.
If we take off the car carriers which were forced to shift from the Port of Colombo to Hambantota, the number of ships handled in 2015 was only 19 and in the year 2016 was 14 and from January 2017 to June only 10 ships, he said.
Samarasinghe said the transactional value will remain at USD 1.12 Billion as per frame work agreement, however only $973 will be received by the Treasury, with the remaining $146 million will be pumped to the Hambanthota Port as investment, Minister said.
Out of the $973 million, 10% will be payable immediately after signing of the agreement, with another 30% to be paid within three months. The remaining 60% is to be paid within the next 6 months..
This agreement is a win-win situation for both parties. We were able to negotiate the share holding to increase Sri Lankas share. When I took over negotiations there were no reference to royalty payable to the Ports Authority, it only included dividends. The new agreement includes royalty payments. We have also been able to ensure that no amendments were made to the Port Authority act, which was a huge hurdle for us, the minister said.

Cement Marketing Lanka to introduce HITEPOZZO fly ash product to market
Cement Marketing Lanka Limited situated at Biyagama Road, Kelaniya, will introduce Hitepozzo, a value added fly ash product and a substance used to improve the durability and quality of the concrete and is coming to domestic market.
Chairman, Ramiah Ramanadan said that Hitepozzo is partial cement replacement in ready mix concrete/mass concrete application. During the chemical reaction in concrete, the Hitepozzo will react with the free excess Lime and will make the ideal free lime into useful Calcium silicate Hydrate which will provide additional strength to the concrete. The chemical reaction is shown in below
Hitepozzo is produced by careful selection, beneficiation and classification and processing of material at our modern plant with latest technology. It helps the concrete to reduce Heat of Hydration, Micro Craking and improve soundness.
Due to spherical nature of processed Hitepozzo and reduction of un burnt carbon during processing in our factory, Hitepozzo will help to reduce water requirement in concrete, will increase pumpability of the concrete and reduce the friction of aggregate during concrete.
Addition of Hitepozzo in the concrete will improve impermeability of concrete which will lead to increase strength and durability. This impermeability will avoid Carbonation ( Shrinkage in concrete), Sulpahate Attack and Steel corrosion.
Due to high durability and Strength, Hitepozzo is very popular in the cold condition.
At this juncture, he said that Hitepozzo is available in different grades based on particle size distribution and as per the International Standard such as BS EN 450 (BS 3892 1)/ ASTM C 618 Class F and sizes available from 2% retention on 325 mesh to 34% retention on 325 mesh as per the International standards. It is widely used in mass construction to speed up the building process.
It is suitable to mix directly with produced cement in manufacturing Blended cement. It is also used as performance improver in manufacturing of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), roofing sheet, Brick manufacturing, Hollow Block, Paver Blocks and Tiles as well.
He Very glad to inform that  Our company was established in September 2012 and we work only with leading material suppliers of Indian Company and our products are used by most of the principal development and construction groups operating in the region.
Hitepozzo comes in 1 to 1.5 MT HDPE Jumbo bags, 50 Kg Bags and Bulk tankers. The product is now accepted by both local and international construction companies and there is a new demand to introduce a mini pack so that it could be used for residential building purposes as well.
He said that some of the big projects in Sri Lanka that uses Hitepozzo, they are Altair Project in Colombo, Colombo Lotus Tower, Colombo Port Expansion Project, Orion City Project, Maga Head Office Project, Labor Department , Access Tower, Narahenpita, the Outer Circular Highway Project, (Kaduwela to Kadawatha), Upper Kotmale Hydro-power (UKHP) Project, Extension of Southern Expressway Project (Matara to Beliatta) and other projects.
Some of the companies that use Hitepozzo are China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation and Aviation Industry Corporation of China, China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation, MAEDA NISHIMATSU, Japan, TAISEI Corporation, China, Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd, Maga Engineering, China Harbour Engineering, Shapoorji Pallonji Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Access Engineering Plc, Sierra Readymix (Pvt)Ltd and many more.

Get rid of coins
It is astonishing to observe that when figures appear in quotations, annual reports etc they are stated up to the cents column. This is not material at all. At present Rs 1 has no value and even beggars do not accept charity if it is less than Rs 10. This is a fact. Further the cents column makes the figure column lengthy and also distorts the figure appearing in the report.
It will be better to state figures to the nearest rupee or even thousand rupees with proper notes and explanation at the top. For example instead of quoting 26,616,846.80 (as appeared in a recent quotation) it should have been stated as Rs 26,616.847 or to the nearest thousand. Figures more than a million could be stated to the nearest thousand. Blindly following procedure serves no purpose. Information should be in precise form for better presentation. Auditors should note this and advise the clients accordingly. Bills and invoices also could be raised to the nearest rupee so that cash settlement is easy.
All coins up to Rs 1 may be withdrawn by the Central Bank from public circulation with due notice. Necessary legislation should be passed. Cash boxes can then accommodate more coins of higher denomination. This may be applied to Rs 2 and 5 coins later if necessary.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) unions vowed to continue with their strike as discussions with the government reached a deadlock yesterday.
President of the CPC General Employees Trade Union Asoka Ranwala speaking to the Daily News said they would engage in continuous strike action until their demands are met.
The Unions launched their strike as of 12 midnight on Monday (24) in protest of tendering the Cabinet paper to lease out the Hambantota Port Oil Tank to the China Merchants Ports Holdings Company Ltd. (CMPort).
Cabinet yesterday had approved a new Concessional Agreement between the Chinese company and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority(SLPA).
This will grant CMport 70 percent and the SLPA 30 percent stake in the Hambantota Port. The Agreement is to be put for Parliamentary approval on Friday.
We will not stand down this time. We want a written assurance that the oil tanks will remain with the CPC, stressed the union leader referring their earlier strike against an agreement to lease out oil tanks in Trincomalee.
The Unions in the meantime were promised a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena last night to come to a settlement but the meeting was not granted as the unions refused to call off the strike before they met the President,
The President had asked that we come for discussions once we call off the strike. But we informed the Ministry Secretary that we were not asking for negotiations, we are asking that our demands be met, said Ranwala.
As the unions refused to back down, the President had promptly informed them that he would not discuss matters with a Union on strike.

Decades of distinction
I pen this article to chronicle the forty-year political journey of visionary, unselfish, outstanding, and charismatic gentleman politician par excellence, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He was born as the second son of Esmond Wickremesinghe and Malini Wickremesinghe on March 24, 1949. He has three brothers and one sister. He received his primary and secondary education at Royal College, Colombo, and graduated from the University of Colombo. He got married to Maithree Wickremasinghe, a Professor of English at the Kelaniya University, in 1995.
Ranil Wickremesinghe is truly a leader of the new independent era. He was elected to Parliament in 1977 General Election from the Biyagama seat at the age of 28, having worked in the Youth League of the UNP from his university days. As the youngest politician of Sri Lanka at the time, he held the post of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs under President Jayewardene. Very soon, in recognition of his exceptional talents and unique capacity for work, he was appointed to the Cabinet as the Youth Affairs and Employment Minister. Later on, he was given the portfolio of education. Then in 1989, as a seasoned legislator, he was made the Leader of the House under President Premadasa. He also served as Industries, Science and Technology Minister.
Nationwide achievements
From 1977 to 1994, during the 17 years that the UNP was consecutively returned to power, Ranil Wickremesinghe, as a dynamic young politician, had a crucial impact on the development of the country. He is still considered to be the best Education Minister of the country owing to the radical educational reforms he initiated in the 1980s aimed at the qualitative improvement of school education (with a special focus on English, Technology and Computer skills) and the Education Administrative Service. He energised the young people in Sri Lanka with creative, motivational as well as skill development programmes through youth clubs (Yovun Samajas) and youth camps (Yovunpuras).
Later on, as Industries, Science and Technology Minister, he was responsible for Sri Lanka's second round of economic liberalisation that commenced in 1989 with the focus on financial de-regularization and industrial promotion in rural areas through infrastructure development and the institution of industrial estates. As the MP for Biyagama, he dramatically developed his electorate to become a modern model suburb with brand new carpeted roads, electrification schemes, water and sanitation projects, schools, community centres and other infrastructure inputs. He also established the Biyagama Free Trade Zone to provide employment for thousands of young men and women in a range of industries.
Prime Minister ofthe country
Ranil Wickremesinghe holds the record of being sworn in as Prime Minister for four times in the countrys history (May 1993, December 2001, January 2015 and August 2015) whilst Dudley Shelton Senanayake and Sirimavo Bandaranaike had been appointed three times. It is important to note that Wickremesinghe possesses experience performing his duty as Prime Minister under three different executive Presidents. First under D B Wijetunga, next under Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and currently under Maithripala Sirisena.
During his tenure as Prime Minister, he has achieved quite a few milestones. The most remarkable achievement was during the crucial period of war. Then the country was facing numerous problems due to the brutal war. He took a bold step to sign a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE that is still being considered a breakthrough in defeating the cruel terrorist outfit. In every term as Prime Minister, he has contributed a yeoman service to the country.
Moreover, in the present national coalition government under the President Maithripala Sirisena, he is playing a major role in several aspects especially the constitutional reforms for the prominent issue of the country as they pledged in their election propaganda. He also takes remarkable steps to the countrys economy, education, foreign affairs and trade as a whole.
Commitment and interests
Outside politics, Ranil Wickremesinghe is the Chair of the Dhayakasabha of one of Sri Lanka's historic temples, Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, and a patron of Gangarama, Walukarama and the Weragodalla (Sedawatte) temples.
He has written and spoken widely on Sri Lankan history, Buddhism and world politics. He is an avid reader - devouring books and web articles/news related to regional politics, international affairs and world history on his cherished iPad. He is interested in cutting-edge developments in all fields of knowledge globally and locally.
He appreciates indigenous Sinhala music, western classics and opera as well as Bollywood songs. Ranil Wickremesinghe enjoys native and international cuisine as well as travelling to places of historical interest with his wife.

Detection machines to inspect sugar containers
The Government would import detection machines to inspect sugar containers as a solution to the smuggling of cocaine into the country in sugar containers, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the Police Narcotics Bureau and the Organised Crime Prevention Division would be combined to form a new division under a senior DIG to investigate these incidents.
He said he would seek the permission of the National Police Commission to join the two divisions.
The minister made these observations while responding to a question raised by JVP Leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake over the last week detection of a haul of cocaine inside a sugar container.
Minister Rathnayake said investigations have revealed that the Government had no connection with smuggling cocaine in sugar containers. The Government wonder as to how and why cocaine is smuggled into the country in sugar containers. He said the Navy, the Customs and the Police Narcotics Bureau have conducted raids to nab drug kingpins.
Minister Ratnayake said the Government has found checking each sugar container a cumbersome action. The delay in releasing sugar containers from the Customs could create a shortage of sugar in the market, he said.

Diagnostic kit to detect dengue in the market by year end
A low cost diagnostic kit that could quickly detect dengue will be introduced to the local market by the end of this year, a researcher at Industrial Technology Institute Dr. Maheshi Atapattu said. She was addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department.
She said early diagnosis of dengue is important since many deaths from dengue were due to the delay in seeking treatment. Patients come to hospital only when they are in the critical phase. Most patients who are suffering from fever neglect their disease considering it a normal viral fever and do not undergo a blood test, she said.
The diagnostic kit which has been developed by using bio technology and nano technology can quickly detect dengue soon after the initial fever starts. This diagnostic kit will be available in the market at around Rs. 200 and it will have the same features of a pregnancy test which is done by using a strip. The test is executed by immersing the proper end of the strip in urine. The result is readable within a few minutes, Dr Maheshi said.
This diagnostic kit has been developed during a research conducted by the Molecular Medicine Unit of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya supported by the Department of Parasitology and Sociology of the University of Kelaniya, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the University of Colombo, Anti Malaria Campaign and Dengue Control Unit of the Ministry of Health, Western Province Health Department, Industrial Technology Institute, Institute of Nano Technology and National Institute of Fundamental Studies.

DIMO delivers Mercedes-Benz Actros 6x4 Prime Movers
Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) recently delivered a fleet of Mercedes-Benz Actrostrucks to Melwire Rolling (Pvt) Ltd to help with their most critical operations.
The first three of a total of five trucks were delivered to P. Muruganandhan, Director of Melwire Rolling (Pvt) Ltd by Ranjith Pandithage (Chairman and Managing Director of DIMO). All units are 6x4 Prime Mover Semitrailer Tractors, used extensively in steel haulage. Incidentally, this was the first fleet of Actros Trucks to be sold in South Asia using Daimler Financing.
Rajeev Pandithage (General Manager  Mercedes-Benz Sales), Shamal Fernando (Business Unit Manager - Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles), Titus Peries (Manager  Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicle Service) and Devendra Rajaratnam (Service Advisor for Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles too were present at the handover.
In order to be able to offer a vehicle that is optimal for long-distance transport both today and in the future, and in view of the constantly increasing demands where comfort, economy, driving dynamics and variety are concerned, Mercedes-Benz decided to completely redevelop and rebuild the Actros. In order to make the new Actros a highly economical truck it has been equipped with many innovative and consumption-reducing features, and with particularly frugal engines. The overall economy of a truck is determined by many factors. Some cannot be influenced. But others can: thus, for example, alongside the innovative, cost-reducing vehicle technology deployed, services which are perfectly aligned to the new Actros also ensure that you can positively influence cost factors such as consumption and repairs and maintenance as well. Giving an even more holistic profitable solution.
With a fleet of powerhouses ranging from small-scale tractors to large-scale haulers, the Actros has also come to symbolise the fusion of intelligent design and unhindered performance, extending from the smallest to the most ambitious operations involving construction, haulage and transport. The Mercedes-Benz Actros boasts of a capacity of 33 tons, along with a 12,000 cubic centimetre, 313 horsepower engine.

Dollar falls to more than year lows on delayed Trumponomics
The U.S. dollar fell to levels seen more than an year ago with President Donald Trump failing to deliver on tax cuts and infrastructure spending, analysts said.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, traded at 93.904, declining from levels above 95.00 traded in the previous week, CNBC reported.
A lot of people came into this year expecting a big stimulus from Trumponomics, potentially a big tax cut, infrastructure, Richard Clarida, global strategic adviser at Pimco said.
And of course, we havent got the tax cut, infrastructure is down the road and Congress is squabbling over health care. So some of the folks who really thought this would be a gangbusters year have been disappointed.

False fears should not be raised about OMP: SB
False fears should not be raised about the Office of Missing Persons(OMP) which does not have prosecutorial powers, Minister S.B.Dissanayake said at a media brief held at Sethsiripaya yesterday.
Minister Dissanayake also said the main objectives of the Office of Missing Persons is to search and trace missing persons, clarify the circumstances of the disappearances and facilitate their families to cope with numerous practical and psychological issues they have been suffering for.
However, Minister Dissanayake said if any criminal evidence is unearthed while tracing the disappeared, any concerned party has the freedom to use the information to seek legal action against the enforced disappearance.
Minister Dissanayake pointed out that setting up the Office of Missing Persons will protect the reputation of Sri Lankas military forces which has been questioned by international human rights organisations following the end of thirty years war.
The Minister said the Office of Missing Persons will look into all the disappearances of soldiers reported during the war period. He said there are 5,101 missing soldiers at present.
The families of these soldiers dont know what happened to them and they have not received any compensation.
They are not able to receive the pension facility as well.They do not even have a death certificate, he pointed out.
Minister Dissanayake also said many of the reported disappearances include the LTTEers who were killed in action. He pointed out these deaths should not be included in the missing persons category if the individuals have been involved in terrorist activities.
Minister Disanayake also highlighted that there are many disappearance cases where the said victim is staging out a disappearance. These people stage their disappearance and most conveniently live in foreign countries. They even raise funds for terrorist activities.
The Office of Missing Persons can reveal such persons and their misconduct, he added.
Minister Dissanayake also expressed his disapproval of the way in which former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying to raise fears in the minds of the public,the Maha Sangha and the Security Forces regarding the Office of Missing Persons.
He pointed out it was ex-President Rajapaksa who welcomed foreign examiners to participate in the Udalagama Commission and Paranagama Commissions which also dealt with missing persons.
Commenting on the series of protests launched against SAITM, Minister Dissanayake said the private medical college will not undergo any changes regarding its administration. He also said the government will employee the service of medical officers attached to military forces in case the GMOA continues to take trade union action against SAITM.
Minister Dissanayake also pointed out that trade unions should not take trade union action against government policies.
They should fight for their rights not against government policies,he said.

A large number of representatives from UK government authorities, international organizations, non-governmental bodies and private sector businesses joined the UK-edition of the Global Ceylon Tea Party, which was hosted by the Sri Lanka High Commission in London on July 6 in close collaboration with the Colombo Tea Traders Association and Sri Lanka Tea Board.
In her welcome address, Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Britain, Amari Wijewardene, highlighted the valuable role played by James Taylor, the Scottish planter, who pioneered commercial plantation of teas in the island 150 years ago and the overall contribution made by the British in the subsequent development of the tea industry.
She also placed special emphasis on the world-wide recognition gained by Ceylon teas due to their premium quality and distinctive flavors.
Addressing the gathering, Ian Gibbs, Chairman of the International Tea Committee stated Sri Lanka had been an active player within the global tea industry, making a substantial contribution as a leading producer and exporter of black teas. He also said that Sri Lanka had been in the forefront as key exporter of value-added teas to the world.
Honorary Sri Lanka Tea Ambassador in the UK, Mike Bunston also spoke on this occasion. He presented a detailed account of the history and the gradual evolution of the Ceylon tea industry over the last 150 years. He said that the industry, which started with just 19 acres of tea plantation, had come a long way with many achievements. He also pointed out that the industry should take effective measures in addressing the challenges it had encountered in the current times if Sri Lanka was to retain its prominent status in the global tea industry.
Speaking on behalf of Finlays Colombo Limited, one of the sponsors of the event, Sathyani Rajapaksha, Procurement Manger of the company, stated that Finlays was very happy to join the tea party in London as there was a long-established relationship between the UK and the Ceylon tea industry.
Guests enjoyed the evening with a wide variety snacks & sweets and freshly brewed Ceylon teas, representing the seven agro-climatic tea growing regions in the island.

GOODNESS GRACIOUS SOPHIA LOREN!
Sophia Lorens mother is Romilda Villani and her Father is Ricardo Scicolone. Her Grandma is Luisa. They were Italians and more conversant in the French Language, Sophia was brought up under Luisa than her own mother. She taught her how to move in society, etiquettes and all good manners. Mostly playing the piano.
Sophia was born on September 20, 1934.
When she was a teenager, MGM Studio was looking for an actress with the resemblance of the famous actress Greta Garbo, the famous movie star at that time. Sophia was given many tests and was selected to take part in minor roles. She was invited to go to America, to Holywood, but her mum did not allow her as they thought America is on the other part of the world. She was recognised in her teens at the Cinecitta studio in Rome.
Evasive father
During the courting period of Sophias mum and Ricardo, Sophia was conceived. When this was announced, Ricardo did not want to marry Romilda and he evaded her. But with Luisas interference, Sophia was given the surname Scicolone, which was agreed by Ricardo just unwillingly. After the birth of Sophia Ricardo stayed with the wife about a week, but as Ricardos mother refused to accept Romilda as their daughter-in-Law, Ricardo left. Then Romilda and Sophia were deserted and Lucia lovingly opened doors for the baby and the daughter. Then Romilda started earning by washing plates in houses and hotels and Lucia earned by piano lessons to keep their home fires burning. Lucia, when the penniless and husbandless mother and the infant entered the house, opened a bottle of brandy, poured into three fancy glasses and said cheers to the newborn.
After few weeks the Grandma felt that Romilda did not have enough milk to feed, called Zaranella (a famous milk producer) to provide milk to the infant on the promise that beef will not be sold by the family after killing the cows and the bulls. Then the infant was down with a heavy cough, and the doctor instructed that they must leave the busy city and live in the mountain area where the child gets fresh air. The moving did the child good and her growth developed.
Due to insufficient funds Romilda, went to meet her unwedded husband Riccardo who welcomed her and spent days enjoying outings. One fine day, Romilda complained to her mum that she was pregnant again by Riccardo. This time Riccardo refused to give his surname to the second child. She was born in 1938 and her name was Maria Villani. She refused to attend school due to the humiliation thrust upon her for having a blank in the section where the Fathers name should depict in the Birth Certificate.
Sophia being a child with no love properly from the mum, and no dad around, became backwards and shy in school. Due to the economic crisis at home, she was very thin and her nickname was Toothpick.
Dangerous ammunitions
Problems arose when the war broke in the city, Rome. The Germans invaded Rome and their houses and everything got destroyed by bombs. Earlier Sophia thought when a rain of explosives fell from the sky, it was a fire display during a church festival. Little did she realise after the bombs destroying their buildings, hospitals, churches and all that they are dangerous ammunitions.
The Government asked everybody to creep into nearby caves and tunnels when the siren rings. So it was a case of running to the tunnels about 10  15 times a day which was a frightful flee. In the nights they slept in the tunnels, there was disturbance with mice and cockroaches.
Also, each time when they hear a train, they had to run out from the tunnel. Many things took place inside the tunnel. Women gave birth to babies, ladies cooked rice in the darkness, men were gambling, quarrels and fights, robberies but all had to live inside the tunnel as there was no other remedy.

Govt will ink Htota Port deal - Eran
The government will go ahead with singing the agreement to lease the Hambantota Port to Chinese companies irrespective of protests in the streets, said State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne. Several people have misunderstood the whole Hambantota Port deal, he alleged.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 which kicked off yesterday at Cinnamon Grand he said that the deal is not only about leasing a non productive port in Hambantota to a Chinese company but it has multi pronged benefits.Firstly the deal would bring in almost US $ 400 million foreign exchange to Sri Lanka within the first year of operation and this amount would increase to US $ 2.1 billion subsequently.
Since independence successive governments have neglected Moneragala and Hambantota districts and with the Hambantota deal economic benefits would directly trickle down to people in these areas ushering economic prosperity.
He said similarly Trincomalee Port too would be developed with assistance from India, Japan and Singapore and this area too would see an economic transformation.
The minister said that in addition several meaningful steps were been taken and Sri Lanka is now heading in the right direction.
Dr. Harsha De Silva, Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Development said that the port city development was now on track and currently 45% of reclamation has been done. We are confident that piling could start next year and the proposed financial centre would be the main draw and the project would open out several investment opportunities to both local and foreign investors.
He however said that Sri Lanka has badly failed in the export sector and business establishments should seriously look at more exports. Only IT and appeal exports have diversity, he pointed out. He also said that Sri Lanka has to pay Rs 4.5 trillion as debt serving this year.
Governor Central bank Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that anti dumping bill, trade adjustment pack and several economic reforms were been formulated and implemented soon to make Sri Lanka more attractive to investors and also entrepreneurs.
The Governor further said that with the regaining of the GSP Plus and access to China, India and SAACR region, Sri Lanka has a readymade market of over 3 billion people and no other country has this kind of advantage.

Hayleys Groups Alumex, Hayleys Agriculture expand Puritas Sathdiyawara
Continuing to expand and create a positive impact on the nations growing CKD concern, the Hayleys Groups Puritas SathDiyawara endeavour has now extended its clean drinking water project with two more Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants.
One plant was recently installed in Meegassegama, Thalawa, sponsored by Alumex PLC The second plant was installed in Pahala Kedithokkuwa, Nochchiyagama, sponsored by Hayleys Agriculture, where in addition to the RO Plant, a mixed cultivation of fruits and moringa was also initiated with the expertise of Hayleys Agriculture, in the one acre land owned by the CBO (Community Based Organization) of Pahala Kedithokkuwa.
Both villages were also gifted with a knowledge hub, each consisting of computers with internet access and a library.
These projects are the second villages which both Alumex and Hayleys Agriculture have committed to, thereby further strengthening their long-term pledge to this cause.
Speaking at the event, Managing Director of Alumex PLC, Rohan Peris commented, This is the second SathDiyawara village which we have adopted. As part of the Hayleys Group, we strongly believe in how Puritas SathDiyawara has benefitted these marginalized people, and we have seen firsthand, how providing clean drinking water to CKD afflicted areas has resulted in reduction and reversal of the illness. This encourages us to continue investing in this cause to save more affected lives as well as the lives at risk.
Addressing the gathering, Jayanthi Dharmasena, Deputy MD of Hayleys Agriculture stated that Hayleys Agriculture is committed to uplifting rural livelihoods of the community, and that this initiative is an extension of their holistic CSR strategy.
Rizvi Zaheed, Managing Director, Hayleys Agriculture commenting on the project, stated, While this is the 2nd RO plant which we have commissioned, we have also added to the initiative by supporting the livelihood of the villagers by sharing our expertise and knowledge on agricultural best practices to support them with the cultivation of fruits and moringa on an acre of land. We will continue to support SathDiywara which is our Groups flagship CSR project.
Each village was fitted with a Centralized Water Treatment plant, including a Plant house, an RO treatment system with a capacity of 10,000 litres a day and water storage cum distribution tower. And a water distribution and delivery mechanism consisting of two wheeler tractor pulled bowser (of 1, 000 liters) and 10 docking stations of 1, 000 liters each.
Elaborating further, Managing Director, Haycarb and Puritas, Rajitha Kariyawasan added, Since 2014, SathDiyawara has grown to become a highly sustainable and long-term endeavour which has reaped very clear results. We now provide over 30,000 people with 130,000 litres of drinking water a day. Our single-minded focus lies in eradicating CKD.
Speaking on the initiative the Community Based Organisation (CBO) Secretary of Meegassegama, Thalawa, Wijerathne commented. This gift of life which we have received today signifies a renewed hope for our future. While CKD is a huge concern with more and more CKD patients being diagnosed in our villages, we have also suffered through the severe lack of quality drinking water. We have to travel miles and miles to collect water, which to most is just a basic amenity, but to us is a luxury which we only dreamed of.
Commenting on the commitment to clean drinking water, the Chairman of the Hayleys Group, Mohan Pandithage said, We have visited a large number of villages in the North and North Central provinces, working at the ground level to identify the most severely affected villages.
Each project is sponsored by a Group Company, and to-date the Hayleys Group has invested more than Rs. 56 million in this initiative. It consists of formalized water distribution network through a bowser and multiple docking stations throughout the village to ensure all villagers have equal access to purified water.

## Title: Is the herbicide Glyphosate safe

Is the herbicide Glyphosate safe
It was reported in recent issues of several local newspapers that a four-member cabinet subcommittee has been appointed to study a cabinet paper that seeks permission for a limited use of glyphosate (often known by its original brand name, Roundup) in the plantation sector. The cabinet paper apparently had been submitted on the basis of a report by a committee appointed to make recommendations with regards to the pesticide and insecticide policy to the ministerial committee on economic management. This review of the decision is to reconsider the existing ban on glyphosate, a widely used chemical weedicide, to boost dwindling tea crops by cost-effective removal of overgrowing weeds in tea lands.
The request by the plantation management to control weeds in their tea plantations efficiently by chemical means, as had been done in the past before the ban, in order to resuscitate the dwindling tea industry, particularly in the mountainous watershed areas of the country, is understandable from their short-term economic perspective. However, at a time when the Government is committed to sustainable development, in which the costs of the overall negative impacts of health aspects all-round (using internationally accepted precautionary principle in the absence of concrete evidence, as yet) also need to be given its due consideration in an era of moving towards an all inclusive Sustainable Development and Green Economy in the longer term.
Rethinking tea 150 years on
Perhaps, this may be an ideal juncture, at a time the Sri Lankan tea industry is celebrating its 150 years of existence, to re-examine their economic development strategies in the light of the impact of their current plantation management systems on ecosystem services such as soil and water conservation, nutrient cycling and maintenance of soil fertility etc. and also their commitment to sustainable eco-friendly agricultural development. If these eco-friendly measures are taken into consideration by the tea plantation industry, it will help to get premium prices with lesser amount of lands used for tea and using lesser amount of labour which is already an issue in the plantations. With respect to cash crop agriculture as a whole, there needs a complete revamp of the present day agricultural and tree crop cultivation systems, particularly in our mountainous watershed areas.
On the other hand, it is also a national obligation of the Sri Lankan scientific community to monitor long-term impacts of the current land use pattern that requires continuous use of chemical weedicides, pesticides and insecticides in tea, vegetable and other commercial crop cultivations in the watershed areas.
Coming back to the issue of revision of the current ban on Glyphosate, a number of scientific reports are emerging in the international literature both for and against its use in controlling weeds which the ministerial subcommittee and/or their advisors should be looking at before making their decision with far reaching impact.
How safe is glyphosate
One of such excellent appraisals of recent origin is from two scientists, Dr. Vijay Paul and Dr. Rakesh Pandey from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute who have made an exhaustive review of the literature available on the safety of glyphosate - [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] in the journal, Current Science Volume 112, No. 1, January 10, 2017 (Journal Impact Factor 0.843 in 2016/17). This article may be downloaded from the web to get scientific details (http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/112/01/0011.pdf) some of which I wish to highlight for the general readership.
Glyphosate is one of the most common and largest selling herbicides worldwide, having first registered in the US in 1974. It is a water-soluble, systemic (absorbed through leaves and also roots) and broad spectrum (non-selective) herbicide. It inhibits the biosynthesis of several amino acids by blocking an enzyme in these amino acid biosynthetic pathway in plants as well as in microorganisms (that include beneficial bacteria in the human gut and those in the soils that contribute to maintain soil fertility), but not in animals including humans.
The aforesaid Indian article quotes several international scientific publications which report that continuous and long-term exposure to glyphosate is responsible for a multitude of modern human diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary edema, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, infertility, cancer, Alzheimers disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinsons disease, prion diseases, lupus, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, neural tube defects, hypertension, glaucoma, osteoporosis, fatty liver disease and kidney failure, celiac disease and gluten intolerance.
Another recently reported adverse impact of glyphosate is severe depletion of serum Mn and disruption of bile acid homeostasis and in this way glyphosate can promote autism, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, anxiety disorder, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease, renal lithiasis, osteomalacia, cholestasis, thyroid dysfunction and infertility. It further states that all the above conditions can be substantially explained on the basis of defective regulation of Mn utilization in the body due to glyphosate.
Additionally, glyphosate contamination has contributed towards the increase in chronic and acute kidney failure, pancreatitis, different types of cancers, various disorders, especially to newborns, not only in humans, but in animals as well. A study published in 2013 reports that the incidences of above diseases/conditions are also rising in many countries with the rise in the use of glyphosate on core/edible crops. Having used glyphosate world over for several decades, its possible health impacts are becoming increasingly evident in scientific literature.
On the basis of these increasing scientific evidence, the World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen in 2016. However, a later statement issued by the experts from the U.N.s Food and Agricultural Association (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) completely overturned their earlier decision and stated that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. The European Chemicals Agency in early 2017 has given an all-clear certificate, concluding that it is not linked to heightened risk of cancer in people.
This debate on the safety of glyphosate continues to rage as to whether it is associated with a heightened risk of cancer or whether it has the potential to disrupt hormone function and other associated disorders. Some researchers claim that the safety standards used to evaluate glyphosate in the US were prepared more than 30 years ago and based on out- of-date science and may not be able to address the full complement of potential hazards associated with long-term exposure to these chemicals which are now surfacing worldwide. Consequently, these safety standards need urgent review as they may be failing to protect public and environmental health, these researchers claim.
There are several other important issues that have not been adequately addressed by both groups of scientists. One such issue is the use of so called inert ingredients that are mixed with glyphosate - the active ingredient- in the preparation of the weedicide mixtures for commercial purposes. These may be even more potent and more harmful than the active ingredient -glyphosate. However, these mixtures being regarded as commercially sensitive formulations by the manufacturers and are therefore, not available for public scrutiny. As such, their chemical composition is not appearing on the label of the product package, according to expert scientists. Consequently, proper scientific investigations should examine the effects of these commercial formulations, as well.
Glyphosate resistant weeds
One of the more serious ecological consequences emerging from the repeated use of glyphosate (or any pesticide, herbicide or insecticide, for that matter) over a long period of time is the development of glyphosate resistant weeds. At least 15 species of weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate in the U.S., and resistant weeds are spreading around the world, according to the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds. Once an important weed-control tool, glyphosate is now unreliable, even for farmers who have never planted genetically modified crops.
Please see the following reference for more details: http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/i37/Rocky-Road-Roundup.html
This international debate will, no doubt, continue to protract for decades (as in the case of cigarette smoking and cancer debate) due to confrontational approaches taken by vested interests as seen in the readers comments on articles on the web. But the Sri Lankan scientific community following the Indian initiative mentioned above, should avoid getting entangled in these verbal diatribes and instead should accelerate long-term interdisciplinary studies already initiated on the health and environmental impacts of improper use of agrochemicals in our own agro-ecosystems, particularly those in the watershed areas. In this regard, an interdisciplinary study of land use (or mis-use) patterns in a the upper reaches of a river basin or in a sub-basin, at least, and an economic valuation of the ecosystem services they offer (or they deny) may be in line with our compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, the SDG Target 15.3 which states that by 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts. As a necessary extension, such studies currently being done in traditional lowland cascade (Ellangawa) systems need to be expanded further.
Such projects not being of mega-scale may not appeal to most politicians and as such, would not get the priority green light for implementation although we are committed to a green economy in this Blue-Green Era.
However, robust science coupled with traditional wisdom continued over many generations with a proven history of starting small and ending big rather than the other way around would no doubt, prevail at the end, in this era of sustainable development.
We hope that the ministerial subcommittee would not only look at this problem in a short-term sectoral development perspective, but in a holistic manner in accordance with the national obligations to international agreements safeguarding health of humans and the environment of this island nation already burdened with many a man-made cataclysms.

India to bat first: Pandya, Gunathilaka debut

Virat Kohli, India's captain, chose to bat in the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. He said the pitch looked hard, with a good covering of grass on it, and expected it to be good to bat on initially.
India handed Hardik Pandya a Test debut, picking him ahead of Rohit Sharma at No. 6, to give them an extra bowling option alongside two frontline quicks in Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav and two spinners in R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. There was no place in their XI, therefore, for the left-arm wristspin of Kuldeep Yadav, who picked up a first-innings four-wicket haul on debut in India's last Test match, against Australia in Dharamsala. With both M Vijay (wrist injury) and KL Rahul (viral fever) out of the reckoning, Shikhar Dhawan and Abhinav Mukund made up their opening pair.
There was a debutant in Sri Lanka's line-up too, Danushka Gunathilaka pipping Dhananjaya de Silva to take the place of their injured full-time captain Dinesh Chandimal at No. 4. Nuwan Pradeep, meanwhile, came back to lead the pace attack after missing the Test match against Zimbabwe earlier in the month with a hamstring injury. He replaced Suranga Lakmal.

India's Dhawan dominates in first Sri Lanka Test

Opener Shikhar Dhawan hit an unbeaten 64 to give India a steady start on the first day of the opening Test against Sri Lanka in Galle today.
The 31-year-old left-hander put on 88 for the unbroken second wicket with Cheteshwar Pujara (37 not out) as the visitors reached 115-1 after electing to bat.
Dhawan, who sat out India's last 11 Tests, negotiated the bowlers with confidence, hitting eight fours in his breezy 78-ball innings.
While Dhawan was in the thirties, Asela Gunaratne dropped a catch at second slip and hurt his already heavily strapped left wrist.
Medics rushed to attend to Gunaratne, who could be seen writhing in pain before walking off the ground.
Dhawan, whose last Test century came at Galle when India toured in 2015, reached his fourth Test fifty off 62 balls.
India went on to lose the Test two years ago but won the remaining two matches to seal the series 2-1.
The Indians got an early jolt when Dhawan's opening partner Abhinav Mukund edged Nuwan Pradeep behind to wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella.
Mukund, who opened the batting after Lokesh Rahul was ruled out with viral fever, made 12.
India handed a Test cap to all-rounder Hardik Pandya and Sri Lanka brought in debutant Danushka Gunathilaka.

## Title: Jaffna shooting leaves unanswered questions

Jaffna shooting leaves unanswered questions
The week practically began with the shocking news of an attempt on the life of a senior judge in Jaffna. High Court Judge Manickavasagar Illancheliyan escaped the assassination bid on Saturday night in Jaffna after an unidentified man snatched the revolver of one of his personal protection officers and opened fire. The Police officer (SI Sarath Premachandra, a native of Chilaw) who was critically injured in the line of duty in the shooting incident in Nallur died at the Jaffna Hospital. The main suspect has now surrendered to Jaffna police.
Many websites and television stations carried the emotional video clip where Judge Illancheliyan was seen bowing to his bodyguards wife and then breaking down before being escorted away. Incidentally, many commented on websites that this was a fine example of unity and reconciliation in practice  his Sinhalese security officers were like brothers to him and had served loyally him for over 15 years, even during the height of the conflict.
Judge Illancheliyan is widely known as a fearless professional and has presided in many high profile cases. Currently, the highest profile case handled by him, as part of a three-judge Trial-at-Bar is the rape and murder case of Sivaloganathan Vithya, a young Jaffna student in May 2015. This is the first time that a Trial-at-Bar is being conducted in Jaffna, which saw much unrest after the case came to light.
In a rather curious turn of events, the abortive shooting came just days after the arrest of former Central Province DIG Lalith Jayasinghe in connection with the above case. Jayasinghe, who was SSP Jaffna when the incident took place in May 2015, is believed to have helped one of the main suspects to flee the country. The Trial-at-Bar is continuing in the meantime with enhanced security to the courtroom and the three judges.
The Judge and the Police differed in their accounts on the intended target of the shooter. The Judge said he was the target of the assailants, but the Police said the three men involved in the incident were intoxicated and grabbed the pistol on impulse. Police said their initial investigations had revealed that the shooting has not been pre-planned and they had apparently not known who was in the car. The shooting has thus left many unanswered questions which the investigators have to resolve swiftly.
President Maithripala Sirisena was the first to condemn the shooting, followed by the TNA. Although the motive was not exactly clear, the next person to comment on the incident was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who said the Government should be extra careful because this is how the LTTE began in the 1970s.
Black July
President Sirisena instructed the IGP to fully investigate the incident. The Government was swift to contain any fallout from the incident, knowing that July 23 marked the 34th anniversary of the July 1983 communal riots that eventually led to a protracted conflict. The anniversary of the event drew international attention. Issuing a statement on the anniversary of Black July, the Canadian Prime Minister welcomed international efforts underway to achieve long term reconciliation and peace for all Sri Lankans. As we pause to reflect on the dark days of the Sri Lankan War, we must continue to work to heal the wounds of all those who suffered. Canada welcomes international efforts underway to achieve long-term reconciliation and peace for all Sri Lankans, but we reiterate the need to establish a process of accountability that will have the trust and the confidence of the victims of this war, the Canadian Premier said.
Sri Lanka has moved beyond these dark days and the conflict itself, but there are individuals in both the North and the South whose only salvation is ethnic disharmony and strife. They will leave no stone unturned to inflame ethnic passions and gain political mileage. The Government must keep an eye on these individuals and protect law and order in the North and elsewhere at all costs, especially at a time when concrete moves are being made to ensure reconciliation and lasting peace.
This is not the first time that judges have been attacked by gunmen. High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya was fatally shot by assassins on November 20, 2004, on the orders of a drug lord whose case he was hearing. In fact, this brutal murder of a judge led to the very establishment of the Judicial Security Division (JSD) of the Police in 2005. Quick thinking by the JSD officers assigned to protect Judge Illancheliyan helped save his life.
Former President Rajapaksa figured in another controversy over the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) which was signed into law by President Sirisena last week. The Parliament passed the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill in August 2016. The Act allows the Sri Lankan Government to set up an Office on Missing Persons to help several thousands of families of missing persons across Sri Lanka to discover the fate of their loved ones, and the circumstances under which they went missing.
The establishment of the OMP allows searching and tracing missing persons, identifying appropriate mechanisms, submission of recommendations to take measures on missing persons, protecting the rights of missing persons and relatives, identifying channels that missing persons and their relatives can collate data related to missing persons obtained by government institutions and centralize all available data.
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake stated the Office will come under the purview of the President himself, pointing out that it was just a step in the process of transitional justice followed by the Government. MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose Joint Opposition has opposed the OMP on the basis that it would hunt down Security Forces members, wrote to the Mahanayake Theras on the OMP that it is one of the several institutions that the Government has agreed to set up to deal with the past in terms of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1 of October 14, 2015, and its purpose is to feed information to other mechanisms. He says after the Government postponed the debate on the Bill to give effect to the International Convention against Enforced Disappearances, ministers of both the UNP and the SLFP were trying to justify that proposed law by saying that it will apply only to the future and not to the past. He said the enthusiasm of the UNP, the SLFP group in the Government, the TNA and the JVP to pass laws designed to punish members of the Armed Forces and the political authorities that gave leadership to the war are evident.
However, just over 25 years ago, it was Rajapaksa himself who sought foreign intervention to address human rights violations by the then Government at the height of the JVP insurgency. He was known as a passionate activist against enforced disappearances. He made several speeches on this topic in Parliament and sought to go to Geneva (to the UN Human Rights Commission) with supporting documents when he was stopped at the Colombo Airport.
On October 25, 1990, Rajapaksa told Parliament: I took the wailings of this countrys mothers. Do I not have the freedom to speak about them It was the wailing of those mothers which were heard by those 12 countries.
On December 4, 1989, he thanked the Government for permitting the ICRC to enter the country, and asked that the UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances and Amnesty International be also allowed to visit Sri Lanka. On October 25, 1990, he said, We asked the donor countries as to why conditions cannot be imposed when giving aid. That was the request we made. It is what has been fulfilled today. If the government is going to deny human rights, we should go not only to Geneva, but to any place in the world, or to hell if necessary, and act against the government. The lamentation of this countrys innocents should be raised anywhere. On January 25, 1991, he said: We went and told donor nations to cut these, and to tell this Government to protect human rights of the people of this country. Today, Rajapaksa is one of the staunchest opponents of any kind of foreign intervention in matters pertaining to the conflict.
Foreign investments
The Joint Opposition has even opposed some foreign investments in Sri Lanka, the Hambantota Port among them. Ironically, it was the brainchild of former President Rajapaksa himself. But the JO had opposed Chinas involvement in additional investments in the area. It was revealed yesterday that the Cabinet cleared a revised agreement for its Chinese-built southern port of Hambantota.
Hambantota is part of its modern-day Silk Route across Asia and the Chinese indicated the willingness to develop 15,000 acres (23 sq miles) to develop an industrial zone next to the Port. Under the revised agreement, two companies are being set up to split the operations of the port and allay concerns that the Port will not be used for military purposes. Hambantota which has oil bunkering facilities is already being used as vehicle transhipment port.
Incidentally, oil is one of the most precious commodities imported by Sri Lanka, whose refineries are not at their peak right now. Oil sales are handled by the duopoly of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Lanka Indian Oil Company (Lanka IOC). Long lines of vehicles were seen outside filling stations yesterday after CPC workers announced a strike. With motorists fearing that the fuel stocks would run out, queues were inevitable. Addressing a media briefing, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Unions Collective said that the trade union action is taking place to win three basic demands. Among the major demands are the acquisition of Trincomalee Petroleum tanks complex to the Petroleum Corporation, acquisition of Hambantota Port Tanks Complex to the Petroleum Corporation and modernisation of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery. The trade union collective earlier launched a strike on April 24 and the strike was called off after the government promised to meet their demands during discussions with the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The other trade union more well known for strikes, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) also threatened to strike over what it called the attempted white van abduction of the Convener of the Medical Students Activists Committee, Ryan Jayalath. However, the GMOA decided to call off the planned strike after talks with Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka.
Attempted abduction
The GMOA presented eight demands: all details pertaining to white van used in the abduction attempt on Ryan Jayalath should be disclosed to the public, the authorities should reveal the identity of those who arrived in the van to abduct Ryan Jayalath, those that gave the order and any other connection between the police and those that came in the van, legal action should be taken against all those who arrived in the van, assurance from the Government that incidents such as the attempted Ryan Jayalath abduction will not be repeated in the future.
Police, however, said they came for a legitimate arrest. Since the officers were from the CID, they are not required to wear uniforms, Police said. The Colombo Crimes Division informed the Chief Magistrate of Colombo on Monday that they have been obstructed in their duty while attempting to arrest Convener of the Medical Students Activists Committee, Ryan Jayalath. Police have informed courts that steps will be taken to arrest those who obstructed them in carrying out their duties. Permission was also sought to obtain video footage of six media institutions to carry out the investigations. Members of the JVP, Front Line Socialist Party and representatives of the GMOA were present at the time of the incident.
While the Police may have had its reasons for coming in an unmarked van to arrest Jayalath, for many people it was a grim reminder of the infamous white vans of the previous regime. In fact, newspapers even coined a term for an abduction by a white van  white vanning. One of the main promises of this Government was ending that culture of white vanning and abduction. It is disappointing to see a repetition of such an incident under the present Government, however legitimate and correct the Police may be. It would not have been that difficult to find an official Police jeep, even if the officers were dressed in civvies. This type of incident can create a wrong impression about Sri Lanka in the eyes of the international community especially in the light of allegations of torture etc by sections of the law enforcement authorities. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, a staunch opponent of the white van culture, and many other Ministers have condemned this incident.
The GMOA had earlier given an assurance that it would not strike given the magnitude of the dengue crisis which has so far claimed around 300 lives. Meanwhile, the Government is using its good offices to get international help for the dengue eradication effort.
Australia has already come forward to help. Sri Lanka has partnered with Monash University and the Australian Government last week to breed mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia, a low risk naturally occurring bacteria, to control the spread of dengue.
JO politics
The project will be part of a comprehensive programme by Australia to assist Sri Lanka effectively to control the seasonal vector borne disease which has hit the country hard and gone out of control due to a combination of factors. This common bacterium prevents the dengue virus being replicated in mosquitoes and therefore transmitted between people.
The bacterium has a similar effect on other viruses such as Zika, Chikungunya and Yellow Fever. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was in the country to sign the agreement with Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake in this regard.
Amidst all these issues, the biggest battle yet to be faced by the Government concerns keeping the National Unity arrangement intact as there is speculation that some SLFP MPs are about to cross over to the Opposition. Joint Opposition National Organiser and MP Dullas Alahapperuma claimed that the Government will lose its two third majority of the Parliament within two weeks, without elaborating on how this would happen. He has urged SLFP and UPFA Ministers in the Government to resign and join the JO while admitting that not all ministers would pursue this option. Minister Nimal Siripala countered this claim, saying toppling the Government would only be a pipe dream. Many people in the Joint Opposition have been dreaming of toppling the Unity Government and forming a new one. It will only remain a dream. They could dance in any which way they want to but, this government would continue till 2020. If there is to be a change there needs to be a two-thirds majority, he said.
The JO saw trouble in its own camp after UPFA MP Roshan Ranasinghe distanced himself from JO politics.
This has led some to speculate that some JO members would join the Government, effectively nullifying any defections from the Government to that side. Meanwhile, former President Rajapaksa said no political party will contest the upcoming Local Government elections under his leadership. Speaking to journalists in Kandy, Rajapaksa said he had no intention of forming a separate party to face the polls but added that he will extend support on an individual basis for those whom he prefers, irrespective of which party they represent. It should be noted that Rajapaksa is not officially the leader of the Joint Opposition or the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Flower Bud party), but is recognised as their de-facto leader. The coming days will prove decisive for both the Government and the Joint Opposition, with plenty of manoeuvres under way in the political landscape.

JLanka, Trina Solar to boost Lankas energy sector
Sri Lankas pioneer and leader in Solar PV Systems and Next Generation Energy Technologies JLanka recently hosted the worlds leading Solar company Trina Solars Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APAC-MEA) Regional Marketing Manager Grace Ge.
Being the premier solar solutions provider in the country with a longstanding reputation for quality and unmatched service in the industry, JLanka Technologies has maintained close trade relationships with Trina Solar over the last 7 years.
As part of its commitment to source the cutting edge of solar technology to the local market, JLanka officials accompanied the Trina Solars APAC-MEA Regional Marketing Manager Grace Ge to industrial customer Solar Photovoltaic sites developed the company. Since Inception in 2010 to date JLankas solar installations have generated over 20MW of electricity powered with Trina Solar panels, which is inclusive of its annual contribution of 21GWh of energy to the Sri Lanka national grid.
This visit marks a milestone in Trina Solar partnership with JLanka being a distributor of their solar panels. Trina Solar official highlighted that as of 2015 they produced 4.55 GW of crystalline modules, retaining its position as the number 1 solar solutions producer in the world.
Speaking on the visit Grace Ge said that Trina Solar is now focused on expansions to global markets and as such has maintained a close partnership in Sri Lanka with Solar companies such as JLanka Technologies.
The relationship has enabled Trina Solar to ensure that their products are marketed, installed, maintained and serviced with quality on par with international levels. Grace Ge during her visit took initiatives aimed at building customer awareness, trust and understanding of JLanka-Trina solar solutions to domestic industrial sector.
Sri Lanka has a larger potential in the booming Solar Market and we are committed to help and support with our technologies to our partners in providing quality Solar Products to both Households and Industrial sectors. Grace said.
According to Trina Solar Officials Solar panels significantly reduces monthly electricity bills and dependence on the power grid. This energy independence protects against rising electricity costs and volatile fuel prices. With analysts forecasting continued increases in electricity rates, solar remains a cost-effective solution and long-term investment in the future. Studies have also shown properties with solar systems sell up to 20 percent faster and at a 17 percent premium compared to homes without such systems. A solar installation makes your property more attractive to buyers, increasing its resale value. Unlike energy generated by fossil fuels, solar doesnt release harmful carbon dioxide (CO2) emission.
Sustainable carbon-free energy solutions such as solar are crucial to slowing the pace of climate change and preventing further damage to the environment.
Further the availability of equipment and relevant technology for larger projects has been a success due to the strong partnership that JLanka has with Trina Solar as a global partner, while the Sustainable Energy Authority of Sri Lanka too has selected JLanka to install a Solar PV Net Metering System at the Hambantota Solar Park.

Kohli tells India to show Sri Lanka whos number one
Galle: Two years ago Virat Kohli's India started a series in Sri Lanka as the team almost anyone could beat, on Wednesday they take to the field in Galle as the team to beat.
India may have been nervous last time, but now Kohli says the side has come full circle with "no massive areas of concern" as they seek to strengthen their hold on number one Test nation status.
Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli takes part in a practice session at Galle International Cricket Stadium in Galle on July 25. AFP
Two years ago, India had not won a series in seven attempts. They lost the opening Galle Test and it was an electro-shock. They won that series 2-1. India have since been embroiled in near chaos off the field -- the governing body put under Supreme Court administration and a coach forced out by clashes with the captain -- but near domination in competition: 13 Tests played, 10 won, two drawn and just one defeat.
Kohli said Tuesday that he wants a definitive end to the drama over the departure of Anil Kumble as coach and a winning start to the new era with Ravi Shastri.
"We have spoken enough about these issues and it is something that we are not focusing on at all now," the skipper Kohli said.
"We are just looking forward to the cricket now and in this series to showcase our skills and have consistent performances, which we have had as a side ever since we started our climb back in the rankings."
Kohli said Sri Lanka can expect a different start and that India can dominate Tests for years to come. They are expected to defend their top Test ranking in South Africa, England and Australia in the next year.
"It's pretty different sitting here two years after that particular series," Kohli said of the last Sri Lanka games.
Those Tests were "very important in us coming together as a team in believing that we can win a series and not just matches. So that was the beginning of that mindset."
The captain added: "I think we have built a really good base for us as a team to be able to do that consistently over the next few years.
"We are pretty humble in our preparations and do the hard yards every game that we play.
"We have all bases covered strongly."
India have ruled opening batsman Lokesh Rahul out of the first Test with a viral fever.
Kohli said there would be no experiments with the opening lineup, which means Shikhar Dhawan and Abhinav Mukund should start the batting.
"I dont think there are any massive areas of concern for us," Kohli said.
"Weve been looking to fine-tune smaller areas during the course of the game, which probably people might not be able to pick up."
Kohli said the onus was on the Indian players to "put us into a position where we cant lose.
"We have been able to put ourselves in a position in games, 80-85 percent of the games, where theres only one winner left.
"Thats the kind of sustained pressure that weve been able to build." AFP

Lanka can make most from its mineral resources with PPP - Wijesinghe
Sri Lanka has several rich resources but the county is not utilizing them, said Thilan Wijesinghe Chairman and Acting CEO of the newly established Public Private Partnership Unit of the Finance Ministry.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 which kicked off yesterday. Wijesinghe said although Sri Lanka has a variety of mineral resources, such as dolomite, feldspar, graphite, limestone, mica, mineral sands (including limonite, rutile, and zirconium), phosphate rock, quartzite the country have not utilized them to their full potential.
With the resources we have like Phosphate Sri Lanka can be made self sufficient in fertilizer and also export it as well. Similarly value addition could be done for several other mineral resources enabling Sri Lanka to earn high foreign exchange form these exports.
Wijesinghe said that he will look for Private Public Partnerships that would utilize the full potential from these minerals. He said that PPPs should also focus on the agriculture sector to see more value addition and have more forex generated from agriculture.
Recalling the past era where he headed both Board of Investments and other government bodies he said that during that time Sri Lana Telecom was privatized which transformed the IT sector of the country. For the first time I initiated the Board of Investment to give Rs. 30 million as seed capital to start the SLITT campus.
He also said that there are several sleeping government institutions that need to be turned around soon and these too would be revived under PPP. He said that PPP model works well and the best example is the SAGT terminal which is now a great success.

Lankan Youth Commonwealth Games squad return today
The Sri Lanka squad which took part in the Youth Commonwealth Games in Nassau, Bahamas will return to the country on Wednesday morning after a 35 hour flight from Bahamas via Miami, USA and Qatar.
The Lankans failed to live up to expectations winning only two silver medals through Kyle Abeysinghe in the 100 metres freestyle event and 50 metres freestyle event.
The Secretary of the Sports Ministry Dr. D. M. R. B. Dissanayake said that the Lankans competitors got the much needed foreign exposure by taking part in the games and in consultation with Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera he hoped to form Youth pools for all sports and give them the necessary training to improve the standard of youth Sports in the country which would help Sri Lanka to produce medal winning sports stars for the 2020 Olympics.
Although Belfast, Northern Ireland, was due to host the 2021 Youth Commonwealth Games the Government of Northern Ireland is not willing to host the games due to financial problems.

Lest we forget
July, for Sri Lanka, has hardly been propitious, with, most associating the month as that portending disaster or calamity. This hoodoo, linked to July, is amply given expression locally by the term Jooly hathai, which goes to demonstrate the ill boding that the month of July has come to be associated with. And not without reason. July was the month in which the country witnessed its two worst conflagrations and carnage in recent memory - the anti-Tamil riots in 1958 and Black July of 1983. The nascent terrorist movement in the North also first emerged in the month of July in 1977 with the killing of Inspector Bastianpillai whose mutilated body was dumped in an empty well in Murunkan. But it was the incidents in July 83 that surpassed all conflagrations that was witnessed in post Independence Sri Lanka in scope and intensity.
The fateful landmine in Thinnaveli, that killed 13 soldiers, was to change the entire political and ethnic landscape in this country forever, the consequences of which we are carrying to this day. A miniscule minority of the majority community took leave of their senses, momentarily, and went on a mindless orgy of murder and arson while the country's political leadership looked on, and, some said, with tacit approval of the mayhem unleashed on a defenceless community. The entire country was literarily on fire for one whole week, with politicians too egging on the mob in their mad rampage. Sri Lanka was to pay dearly for the mindless acts of a few, with the country ostracized internationally, and the economy, that was taking off after a long period of stagnation, in tatters, with a mass exodus of Tamil professionals such as doctors, engineers, accountants, architects etc, adding to the woes. The blackened image of the country also fatally affected the tourism industry with travel bans to Sri Lanka slapped by many countries.
But what hit the country worst was the fillip this gave the terrorist movement which won mass recruitment into its fold but also turned the LTTE into a conventional army in the way of training and arms supplies from abroad, making the outfit morph into an organisation that was capable of fighting the military on virtually equal terms.
The pogrom also gave India a free hand to interfere in the affairs of this country, ostensibly due to the kinship of the Tamils of Sri Lanka with South India but in reality to make JRJ, who was flirting with the USA, to fall in line. In furtherance of this, an Accord was foisted on the country in the name of devolution of power to the North, which also saw the merger of the North with the East and for the first time since the exit of our colonial masters an alien army known as the Indian Peace Keeping Force set foot in the country which in turn added fuel to the smouldering embers of terrorism in the South.
The full scale war that was sparked off by Black July is mercifully over but the legacy and fallout is still haunting the country and with new dimensions added. The country is today swamped with issues and problems that could directly be traced to the three decades old conflict triggered by the barbarism of a few. As a result, the country has gained a dubious honour of coming under international spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Various busybodies are today poking their noses into the affairs of the country and we have the international community represented by bodies such as the UN insisting on mechanisms and guidelines on matters such as human rights, which, though, we have to comply with as a civilized nation, would certainly not have come to pass but for the mindless action of a few.
It is time that the country makes a reappraisal of things and the leaders ensure that no repeat of the unfortunate incidents of over three decades ago revisit us that has set back the country economically and has brought complex problems to our doorstep. Any hint of incitement to communalism should be nipped in the bud and rabble-rousers severely dealt with. We say this because there is today a tendency for politicians to appeal to the baser instincts of the public as a means of taking a shortcut to power. The current constitution making process have given ammunition to the strident voices to whip up nationalist sentiments, paving the way for another conflagration and put the country into the international dog house once more. For such elements the lessons of history does not matter but the goal of savouring power.
Already we see hatemongers, some even in saffron garb, attempting even to whip up religious hatred and sow the seeds of discord with their incendiary comments. It is incumbent also on the Tamil politicians not to provide ammunition to these hostile elements and to be moderate in their conduct and demands. What is needed is a healing of wounds and living in brotherhood.

Living with Edward Conze
As far back as 1969, I remember the moment when I met a certain BBC World Service Producer who came to see me. I still remember what she told me.
Dr Edward Conze has come all the way from Washington to launch his latest on Buddhist studies. If you wish to see him and participate in one of our radio programmes, this may be a good chance that you should not miss.
As I was listening, I was wondering who Edward Conze is. But I faintly remembered his first work, titled as Buddhism publishedin 1951.
Entire life
Although I was not inclined to participate in any of the programmes, I wished to see what was happening as scheduled by the BBC World Service when my friend left me leaving the invitation extended to me, I went on doing the necessary homework about the German writer Edward Conze, who seemed to have dedicated his entire life to Buddhist studies gaining a PhD from the University of Cologne in 1928. Since gaining such qualifications, he proceeded to study Indian and European Comparative philosophy at the Universities of Bonn and Hamburg.
Having left Germany, he held several university positions as a lecturer and researcher in Buddhist Studies. The work authored by Dr Conze, which is with me now, is titled as Buddhist Scriptures, compiled in 1959. His other works include Buddhist Wisdom Books (1958), Buddhist Thought in India (1962) and Thirty Years of Buddhist Studies (1967). The launch on the part of the BBC World Service marked the occasion as menti
oned above. Dr Conze was speaking generally about Buddhist studies and its significance.
I think this is a notable contribution from a German-born English researcher, devoting several salient factors of resourceful insights. At the outset, he does not attempt to demarcate the Buddhist teachings into country-based sectors. Instead, he initially classifies the standpoint of the Buddha as a teacher. He attempts to trace the important factors that lead him in search of the truth of the existence and what he revealed as his own findings as different from other teachers.
He tries to compare the textual material as well as the material drawn from word of mouth as passed down the centuries as Buddhist myth and legend. From this point onwards, the scholar enters the aspects of mindfulness, where the moment of illumination happens to be the aspects of meditation. He uses the term secluded meditation as a means of perceiving oneself cut off from external disturbances, which make a person involve in outer activities. He points us to the practice of introversion. This is followed by the progressive steps of secluded meditation.
Simpler interpretation
Though the subject of secluded meditation had been an area in discussion in various other religions, the work Buddhist Scriptures deals perhaps for the first time, the benefits of the same in simpler interpretation. Conze states how meditation makes the thoughts one-pointed and softens the mind. Then he deals on how the same procedure when cultivated, generates gladness or delight, makes one venerable, makes one worthy of homage etc.
In this manner, Conze underlines 28 advantages of meditation. His main source of information is cited as the dialogues that ensued between the King Milinda and Venerable Nagasena Thera as cited in Milinda Panha, a Pali text. The material for the source has been culled from the original texts like Paticcha Samuppada and other Suttas. As Conze states, meditation differs from ordinary behaviour. It implies a withdrawal from all outward activities and objects, which he denotes as an extreme introversion, which is held to open up a new world of reality beyond the ordinary pattern.
Dealing with various facets of the concept of Zen, Conze states that it could be regarded as a form of teaching meditation. Zen stems from the Sanskrit term dhyana or the deep form of concentration, which is also a form f meditation. Sitting in meditation according to Zen teachings I named Za-Zen. Defining the term, the Zen masters have pointed out that it is outwardly to be in the world of good and evil, yet with no thought arising in the heart. As such, this is sitting (Za), inwardly to see ones own nature and not move from it. This is meditation (Zen).
Conze too emphasises the need on the part of creative artiste to be meditators in order to achieve the highest form of a creative process. He cites one example of the painter known as Tanyu, whose work exists even today at the Myoshin Temple. This is the story of the time when he painted the great dragon on the ceiling f the main hall of the temple, the dragon which was his masterpiece and today is one of the art treasures of the world. At that time it is said that the Master of the Myoshin Temple was the celebrated Zen Master, Gudo, famous as the teacher of the emperor.
Dragons tail
The emperor had heard that the painter Tanyo had drawn dragons were so realistic that when a ceiling on which one had been painted fell down by chance, some said it had been caused by the movement of the dragons tail. Proceeding from Zen, Conze comes to the area of wisdom (pragna). It is termed by Conze as the crown of all Buddhist endeavours. It is an attempt to penetrate to the actual reality of things as they are in themselves. Once again in the context, the questions of King Milinda are cited.
In order to elucidate the teachings pertaining to wisdom, several Buddhist sources both from the Theravada and Mahayana are quoted. Samyutta Nikaya, the Heart and Diamond Suttas are traced. In his work on Buddhist Scriptures, Dr Conze makes references to other fellow scholars such as D T Suzuki, Christmas Humphreys and Rhys Davids. The references are made to illuminate certain areas of the Buddhist teaching formulae such as faith, vigour, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom and the illusory nature of the world.
Professor Edward Conze left a whole legacy of Buddhist vision for the posterity summing up his work on such as areas as birth, suffering, mindfulness, rebirth, karma and the possible birth of future Buddhas. Wherever possible, he uses versification of Pali stanzas. The glossary of technical terms as enveloped in the work enhances a reader to find more meanings alluded in the text.

Maldives Parliament shut for security reasons
THE MALDIVES: The Maldivian government Tuesday defended its controversial deployment of troops to block opposition legislators entering parliament, saying the move was part of security measures undertaken for a visiting dignitary.
On Monday President Abdulla Yameen ordered troops to evict legislators and prevent the impeachment of his speaker, the opposition said, in the latest turmoil in the honeymoon islands.
Yameen's office said in a statement that the legislature was shut as part of tight security measures undertaken for the country's 52nd anniversary of independence on Wednesday and an incoming VVIP visit.
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will be the chief guest at the celebrations during his three-day visit starting Tuesday, the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo said.
The special measures taken by the security forces at the parliament building on 24 July 2017 were to ensure the security and safety of the premises, as mandated by the... constitution, Yameen's office said.
The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) said several MPs broke through a cordon only to be pepper sprayed and evicted from the Parliament building on Monday.
The country's exiled main opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed called the eviction illegal.
Earlier in the day, parliament's gates were padlocked by members of the armed forces and MPs were prevented from entering the parliamentary compound. The opposition this month secured enough support from government defectors to begin impeachment proceedings against the speaker, in a bid to wrest control of parliament from Yameen before presidential elections next year.
However, in a statement Tuesday, the parliament secretariat said the impeachment was declared invalid and the next sittings will be on July 31.
The first attempt to impeach the speaker in March sparked chaos when Yameen ordered troops to enter parliament and remove dissenting opponents by force. The political turbulence has seen the international community, including the United States, urging the Maldives to safeguard democracy. The opposition coalition, led by Nasheed, wants to defeat Yameen at elections next year but faces an uphill battle.
All their key leaders are imprisoned or have fled to avoid a lengthy crackdown on dissent under Yameen's leadership.
The instability has dented the Maldives image as a tourist paradise. Nasheed became the Maldives first democratically-elected president in 2008, but was narrowly defeated by Yameen in a controversial 2013 election run-off. In 2015, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison on terrorism charges that were widely seen as politically motivated. - AFP
