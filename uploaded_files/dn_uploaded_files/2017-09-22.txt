Seylan income Saver  introduces for corporates  and employees
Reiterating its commitment in adding value to the citizens of Sri Lanka, Seylan Bank introduced the Seylan Income Saver, a novel proposition devised for corporates and employees to offer a wide array of benefits for savings account holders and their fixed incomes.
Seylan Income Saver encompasses a two in one offering that includes the Seylan Income Saver payroll, a service that offers corporates to automate their salaries in real time to employees accounts and the Seylan Income Saver service which is the only account that values salaries and all other fixed incomes with a multitude of benefits.
Commenting on the launch Tilan Wijeyesekara, Deputy General Manager- Retail Banking at Seylan Bank said The Seylan Income Saver service was conceptualized to fulfill the aspirations of both corporates and employees alike. This proposition will enable companies to transform its traditional way of depositing salaries to a faster and efficient salary upload system. Therefore, employees will experience fast and convenient transactional solutions with multiple benefits that not only value their salary account but all other fixed incomes as well.
A saving can be enjoyed for corporates that enroll with Seylan Payroll and enjoy special interest rates for credit packages subject to business volumes. Companies under Seylan Payroll are eligible to obtain a business credit card, which can be used to carry out safer and faster business transactions.
Seylan Income Savers will receive free Mobile and Internet banking services coupled with the opportunity to win gifts and rewards from Seylan Sure rewards scheme, a benefit scheme designed to offer special gifts for occasions such as weddings, during birth of a child, and in the event of passing the grade 5 scholarship exam, O/L with 8 As and A/L with 3 As.

Allianz ranked No.1 insurer in Dow Jones Sustainability Index
Allianz Group has taken the leading position among all rated insurance companies in the latest Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).
Allianz has been one of the most sustainable companies in the insurance industry ever since 2000. Since then, the company has been an integral part of the investment universe of the well-known Dow Jones Sustainability Index. DJSI ranks companies according to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, assessing their sustainability strategy and performance. We are extremely proud of this result, said Oliver Bte, Chief Executive Officer of Allianz SE. We started with the integration of ESG factors into our business early on and have continuously improved. We also set ambitious goals for the coming years and would like to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Sustainability rankings such as the DJSI are important tools for Allianz to provide investors and stake-holders with transparency about the strategies and performance of corporate responsibility.
The DJSI is the worlds best-known sustainability index. Only the most sustainable companies of the 2,500 Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index (DJGTSM) are included. With this methodology, the DJSI combines the approaches of classical equity indices with purely ecology-oriented indices.
As a responsible investor, Allianz is also using sustainability ratings to manage its own funds and sustainably oriented investment products (SRI), which it offers to its asset management customers.
Since 2016, Allianz has published its group-wide ESG integration approach to provide ratings agencies, non-governmental organizations and other experts with a detailed overview of its ESG integration processes and guidelines.

The Art of Muhun
Juliet Coombe gets curd creative after learning the secret to making Tissa Buffalo curd
Tissa has been famous for producing thick creamy curd for thousands of years. The name curd is traditionally used in the in the Indian Sub continent to refer to yogurt. Some Kataragama pilgrims stop in Tissa to buy curd pots as an offering and others to refresh themselves before going to the holy of holies. However I have gone to Tissa to learn first hand how to make my own pot of this Greek style thick lush yogurt that is the perfect way to start ones day or end it with a treat by adding a splash of treacle.
The paddy culture
As the fruit bats fly overhead across the lake, to hang out in Para Mara trees, we set off in a safari jeep to learn about Tissas historic curd-making process, first hand in an exciting half day experience. Driving past Tissa Temple, reflected in the paddy fields filled with water, watching one small boy fly a kite as buffaloes trundled across the road in front of us, was almost biblical if it werent for the fact that this is a deeply Buddhist town.
We turn off onto a small track and head to a scenic rural area called Polgahawelana, Debarawewa, Tissa. Here adorable baby buffaloes were playing in their cattle skips waiting to be taken to their mothers for milk, which is partly a trick to get the herd of buffalos lactating so the curd producer can collect the creamy milk in a silver churn that is carried on the back of their singer bikes with only coir ropes to secure them.
After having a go at milking and making everyone laugh at how little milk I managed to produce, we return to the curd producer, Ajits family home for tea where we learn, over a cup of Ceylon Pekoe, how
on average each buffalo female produces two to three liters of milk each morning. Farmer, Ajit Siriwardhana collects 24 liters on average each day and returns home on his bike to his wife Chandralatha, who has prepared a wooden fire and huge pot with a ladle ready for the fresh milk. The milk is boiled and ladled for forty five minutes as she keeps pouring it back into the pot, while kindling the fire, until the buffalo milk starts to curdle, forming a skin on the top to show it is ready. Then she pours it into empty terracotta clay pots. While this is happening the amazing EKHO Safari Hotel naturalist guide Samarth Udugampala, who worked with Galle Wildlife Conservation society as a wildlife research officer, takes us on a fascinating village walk to learn about the paddy culture, village life, the trees that are important for medicinal purposes, and how Kaduru has a double purpose if mixed with other things. Its seeds can help cancer patients, but can also be used to commit suicide, often in the village where a love affair has gone tragically wrong.
Great cooking secrets
As you walk along the edge of the paddy fields learning about rice production you will also see many types of wildlife from lizards, like the monitor, to rat snakes. You will enjoy some of the 245 species of butterflies like the Lemon Migrant butterfly and Plain Tiger, as in the dry zone. Udugampala explains how useful the coconut trees are and how everything can be used from the husk for rope, to the stem for roofing material, the milk to make the curries, and the flower for making the local whisky toddy. I learn how the villagers also burn the husk in the morning and evening as a natural mosquito repellent, and in the kitchen use coconut husks as firewood. The husks can even be used as bowls if they are a nice shape and are polished for sambals to be served in. Along with naming the plants there are fun activities, such as touching the sleeping grass that curls in your hands and is used as traditional medicine to help the nervous system. The villagers live with nature and you will see many interesting insects, frogs and the Purple Swamp Hen. Bird watchers will love this trail as you might also see Green Bee Eaters, Little Egrets, Intermediate Egrets, White Breasted Kingfishers, Common Kingfishers, Green Imperial pigeons, and/or Spotted Dows. If you enjoy this traditional nature walk then consider the early evening bird watchers boat trip at 3.30pm, on the Tissa Tank, leaving from the hotel private platoon.
After the walk through the village you will sample, on the veranda, the butter top curd, set over eight hours and usually sold for 160 rupees a pot to buyers who come to their home in the evenings. On average Siriwardhana makes 18 pots daily from 12 milk collecting buffalo. Interestingly, hybrid cows produce milk twice a day in the morning and evening. As part of the experience you will try the curd with locally produced treacle. Interestingly in the old days to pasteurize the curd they would wash the curd pot with the pee of the buffalo but today they use a little bit of the old curd for the new pot of fresh curdled milk, which is called Muhun in Sinhalese.
Passing through picturesque paddy fields, we return to the hotel where we learn how to make cheesecake and delicious desserts with the master chef, so you can see for yourself how this ancient tradition is now being used in diverse exciting new ways. This cooking class takes place in the air-conditioned dining hall overlooking the five hundred year old banyan tree. Here the chef will share some of his great cooking secrets and let you have a go at being curd creative. But take care, as whatever you produce will be served with your lunch. One tip if the rice and curry are ever too hot, have a spoonful of curd, as like sugar it will neutralize the chili and quickly cool you down.

Bomb-affected Hollioake would  return to Kabul in a heartbeat
KABUL Sept 21: Former England captain Adam Hollioake says he would return to Kabul in a heartbeat despite feeling the blast when a suicide bomber blew himself up just yards from a Twenty20 tournament in the Afghan capital.
Hollioake, who is coaching one of six teams in Afghanistan's domestic Shpageeza Cricket League, heard a loud bang three overs into the second innings of the match between his Bost Defenders and rivals Mis-e-Ainak Knights on September 13.
I thought it was a big firecracker or something, the Australian-born Hollioake told AFP this week as his players warmed up for their semi-final match.
But then when we had the after-effect... I could feel the vibration of the blast go through my body.
When I saw a couple of the players... actually sprinting off the pitch I realised it was serious. Three people including a policeman were killed and five others were wounded when the suicide bomber detonated himself at a police checkpoint just outside the Kabul International Cricket Stadium where hundreds of spectators were watching the game.
No one inside the cricket ground was wounded in the attack claimed by the Islamic State's local Khorasan province affiliate and play was only briefly interrupted, highlighting how depressingly familiar such assaults have become in the war-weary country.
It was one large blast so I didn't feel like we were under attack but obviously I didn't know so I had to be cautious, said Hollioake, who had been in the changing room with his substitute fielders, assistant coach and manager when the attack happened about 100 metres away.
The explosion on day three of the tournament rattled foreign players, coaches and commentators unused to such attacks and some left Afghanistan in fear of their safety -- including the three foreigners playing for the Bost Defenders.
But Hollioake decided to stay after receiving assurances from Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that security for the foreign visitors would be tightened.
I didn't want to just walk out on the job, said Hollioake whose younger brother Ben was tragically killed in a car accident in the Australian city of Perth in 2002, cutting short his own international cricketing career.
At the end of the day the security worked. Hollioake credits the explosion for galvanising his players who had been struggling in the early matches of the 12-day tournament.
We weren't doing so well before that, we lost all our international players, but the local players have stood up and we've lifted our game, Hollioake said.
Now we find ourselves in the semi-final. Despite his close encounter with the sort of deadly violence that has killed record numbers of Afghan civilians this year, Hollioake said he would love to come back to help Afghanistan where cricket is making a stunning revival.
The country was catapulted into the elite club of Test nations in June and made their landmark Lord's debut the following month.
I think within 10 years these guys could be top six in the world, they've got that much talent, he said.
I really believe the talent and passion is here in this country.

## Title: Call to increase dumping price to rethink recycling

Call to increase dumping price to rethink recycling
A Dutch expert in Waste Collection and Treatment has suggested that the government increase the price of dumping and incineration of waste if people are to pay attention to recycling.
The Dutch expert, Ko Poppe, who addressed a workshop on Trends and innovations in recycling: opportunities for Sri Lankan Green entrepreneurs, organized by Lanka Social Ventures this week, said opportunities in the recycling business would open up if not recycling waste was made more expensive.
Netherlands which has a land area twice as small as Sri Lanka, has a population of almost 17 million and thus has had no choice but to recycle its waste. By 2013, it had managed to recycle 51 percent of its household waste with over 700 companies being involved in the process.
Forays into the recycling business have also been motivated by the Dutch government making it compulsory for all producers to pay for waste that cannot be recycled, said Poppe.
He stressed that if recyclers pursued efforts to segregate and create high quality recycled material, they could easily fetch a high price for their goods.
Sri Lanka recently issued a ban on the four types of plastics such as lunch sheets, shopping bags, polystyrene boxes and polythene used for decorative purposes. According to the Central Environment Authority (CEA) Project Director Bandula Sarath, this was a measure to add value to recyclable items such as plastics.
In November, the government also decreed that all household waste needed to be segregated prior to collection.
Although we have issued the ban, we have given companies a grace period until January 2018. Thereafter, we will take legal action against those who use banned plastics, said Sarath.
He added that the CEA was not attacking the plastics industry and that it had only targeted these four plastics which at present had no value attached to recycling.
Since the ban, supermarkets have started to issue low density polyethylene (LDP) bags instead of the high density polyethylene (HDP) bags, and Sarath sees this as satisfactory though not ideal. LDP is more expensive. So the incentive for recycling is there compared to HDP. So it is a step forward, he said.
While the polythene ban has helped stir some interest in the recycling industry, incentives to invest in recycling businesses are slow to come.
The CEA has stated that the government spent Rs. 15 million on washing plants in Colombo and Gampaha for recyclers and has formed a network of over 140 recyclers around the country but recyclers complain that there was no proper distribution network for their goods and an established collection mechanism.
Paper recyclers at the event complained that most of the paper was imported to India rather than recycled locally. Furthermore, there no finance for companies in the recycling field.
Poppe estimated that at least 1 million Euros would be needed to establish a recycling plant. He added that the money will come if the demand for such services is dire.
At present, however, it is still cheaper to send waste to landfills than recycle it.

Call for value-added products for bulk exports
Wewili Sawiya launched:
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake stressed the importance of substituting value-added products for bulk exports to meet foreign market needs.
The minister was addressing the launching ceremony of Wewili Sawiya, the official newspaper of the Plantation Ministry at the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL), yesterday.
The newspaper is a joint collaboration of the Plantation Industries Ministry and the ANCL.
Minister Dissanayake said Sri Lankas plantation sector must move forward with value added exports under Sri Lankan brands. Around 60 percent of the products exported from Sri Lanka is in the form of bulk. Another 40 percent are exported as value-added products.
The minister said Sri Lanka has been able to diversify export products and markets but that value addition was not enough. Therefore, the ministry has taken measures to encourage value added exports from Sri Lanka with the intention of increasing the production of value-added exports up to 60 percent from the countrys total exports.
As the second largest foreign exchange earner of the country, the plantation sector comprising tea, rubber and coconut, continues to play an important role in the national economy. During the second quarter, Sri Lanka could be able to enhance the production of tea, he said.
Receiving the best price for local products in the international market is not enough to achieve expected goals in the plantation sector. We should improve the production and the quality of the products as well, said the minister.
He stressed the importance of finding new market opportunities without depending on textile and plantation sectors.
We should focus our attention on the countrys intellectual property, he said.
Although the country invests a large amount of money on education, we have not yet been able to get the maximum use of this investment, he added. Plantation Industries Ministry Secretary J. A. Ranjith and ANCL General Manager Abhaya Amaradasa also addressed the gathering.

CBKs volte-face
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has taken late President J.R. Jayewardene to task for introducing the open economy to the country. Speaking at a function to commemorate the late minister Hector Kobbekaduwa, in Kandy, CBK said, J.R. ruined politics after coming to power in 1977. He had thrust an open economy on the country.
Rather late in the day, for CBK to now lament on the repercussions of the open economy, one would have thought. Besides, she had ample opportunity to reverse the JRJ policies. She was Head of State of the country for a full eleven years, and there was nothing, or no one to prevent the Executive President from doing as he/she pleases. She certainly did not need a second invitation to turn things around and revert back to the economic policies of the SLFP of yore, of state control, as against the laissez-faire free for all market economy, introduced by the Old Fox.
But, even CBK, with her socialist bent, and her strong anti capitalist views, acquired during her student activist days in Sorbonne, knew that the country had too far gone on the road of the new social and economic order, spawned by the market economy. She was also too shrewd a politician to jettison a system that replaced the era of ques, shortages and stagnation, which saw her mothers government booted out in the most ignominious fashion. She also was well aware that the UNP lost the election in 1994, chiefly due to that government becoming moribund, after a long 17 year rule and not due to peoples opposition to the open economy.
Besides, the new economic order had become a fait accompli and there was no turning back, which reality was accepted by CBK, herself, when she declared, during her campaign, that she would continue with the open economy by giving it a human face, whatever she might have meant by it. On winning the election, she also famously proclaimed that, she, who had been a good socialist, would now be a good capitalist.
And, true to her word, she went about the business of taking forward the open economy with the zeal of a convert, which she really was. The privatization programme was continued in a manner that would even have made the UNP blush. Nay, she outdid the UNP in this respect. The Shell Company which was shown the door by her mother was invited back to set up business in the country. Not only that, she retained the economists, professionals and experts who served the UNP to propel the market economy. A. S. Jayawardena the Central Bank Governor, under the UNP, continued, unscathed by the regime change, and personages who may sound alien with the SLFPs culture, such as musician Alston Koch was got down from down under to head the newly carved out Southern Development Authority, along with the likes of Navin Goonaratne, who had strong affiliations to the UNP, though subsequently estranged from the party.
CBKs dalliance with the new political, social and economic culture, inherited from the UNP also drew the remark aanduwa vamata signal dala dakunata haravanawa (the government is signalling to the left and turning to the right) from parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma, a strong left of centre politician, from the south.
However, to Chandrika goes the credit of transforming the SLFP from a retrogressive, xenephobic and isolationist political party to what it is today where the blues have largely succeeded in shedding its backward, frog in the well existence to an entity that is in tune with the modern world and the international economic trends and ramifications.
The much reviled open economic policies of JRJ had come to stay.The SLFP has come of age and has assimilated with the new order. Even Mahinda Rajapaksa, for all his nationalist and socialist rhetoric, had come to terms with it, and continued with the system, entering into public/ private partnerships with foreign entities, welcoming foreign capital, though, now, hurling abuse at the UNP for selling the country.
It was only the other day that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recalled that it was J.R. Jayewardene who was among the first Asian leaders to introduce an open economy. India and China picked up from us and has today become not only economic giants but also military superpowers, after adopting the open economy, the Premier noted.
Speaking at the J.R. Jayewardene 111th birth anniversary commemoration, the PM said; He (late President Jayewardene), was bold enough to do so in 1977, just a few months after coming to power. Later China, India, South Korea, Vietnam etc, opened up their economies, after studying developments in Sri Lanka. Special representatives came to Sri Lanka to study how we brought in foreign investments, he said. The Premier also said, most Asian countries achieved economic development, but Sri Lanka could not yield the best results due to terrorism, which plagued the country.
It is hoped that, with terrorism now a thing of past, the country will make up for the lost opportunities and surge forward in all spheres.

China raises bullet train speed
CHINA: China on Thursday increased the maximum speed of bullet trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line to 350 kilometres (217 miles) per hour, six years after a fatal accident led to a speed cap.
The speed limit had been reduced to 300 kilometres per hour after 40 people died in a high-speed train crash near Wenzhou in July 2011.
The acceleration cuts the 1,318-kilometre (819-mile) Beijing-Shanghai journey to 4 hours and 28 minutes, saving passengers nearly an hour.
Starting on Thursday, a total of 14 trains were running between Beijing and Shanghai at the higher speed daily, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
These trains are so popular that the tickets for today already sold out a week ago, Xinhua cited Huang Xin, an official with the China Railway Corporation, as saying.
The connection between the two metropolises is one of the country's busiest, carrying more than 100 million passengers a year.
China's high-speed rail network is the largest in the world, and seen by Beijing as a symbol of the country's advance.
But the expansion -- which has cost hundreds of billions of dollars -- has seen a series of scandals and widespread allegations of corruption, with accusations that safety has been compromised for speed.
In 2013, former railway minister Liu Zhijun was given a suspended death sentence for taking 64.6 million yuan ($10.6 million) in bribes. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. - AFP

WORK OUT FOR THY SALVATION WITH DILIGENCE
It seems discernible to the rational minded Buddhists in particular and the non-Buddhists in general that it is high time to turn to hermitage Buddhists order to safeguard Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka from Buddhists masquerades. Knowingly or unknowingly to the chief prelates, a substantial portion of the Sangha order is involved in nefarious activities bringing utter disgrace to them. The other day, a scoundrel wearing saffron robes that we venerate was caught red handed form is leading some innocent people to earn a quick buck promising them to find employment in Japan.
Some monks are engaged in black arts on a large scale putting huge advertisements in the national press. They appear before the courts for committing the offences of child abuse and sexual harassment. If a thorough survey is conducted, many a glaring instance of gross violation of public decency could be found. At present, more and more monks are reaching very closer to mundane life and their dress code makes the difference. This blatant truth is put under the carpet by people to save the skin from the monks because the political power of the ruling party is always in their hands. The die is cast.
I very recently visited a monastery in Tissamaharama to offer alms in the morning. We spent the previous night there and I had a whale of a chance to observe their way of life. Even though my good parents had accompanied me to such places in my childhood, this is the first time I had the firsthand experience of seeing their exemplary composure with my naked eyes.
Once I had a student at my GELT classes by the name Rex Tharanjan. He entered the Faculty of Science of the University of Ruhuna and later I came to know that at the completion of his degree programme he had ordained in a forest monastery. The Buddha preached us after rationally understood the world to work out for thy salvation with diligence. The aforementioned science graduate ascetic epitomizes true monkhood in my view. I heard from her sister that he discourages visiting him even by his family members.
It is quite palpable to me that our monks are thoroughly disgusted and sick of the status quo of the country now. They have to devote much of their time to advise the government and the general public on each and every matter of mundane existence ranging from cricket even to geology and road engineering. I heard some enthusiastic inventors get advice and blessing from monks even for rocket science. This situation is truly troublesome for them. Some monks are forced to read their horoscopes by laymen. So, they do not have time to work on the temple tea lands for temple expenses. The time for Buddhists activities and spiritual liberation of the laymen and their own have to be lengthened for the betterment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.
Our dunderheads do not allow our monks to contribute constructively for the uplift of religion. Since independence, our saffron robed venerable monks left no stone unturned to come out of this treacherous bog of spiritual decay. Yet, the monks at hermitages have been rendering a yeoman service for the emancipation of the true Buddhists. They are doing it under trying conditions.
A larger slice of the annual allocations for Buddhists activities could be channeled towards hermitage development and encourage our monks to find refuge in them without involving in breakneck undertakings of the blathering politicians. Their usual way of tilting windmills and dragging the sacred Maha Sangha to mundane matters could be avoided.

Cloudless Blue Skies hit the shelves
The wait is over! Aditha Dissanayake, best-selling author of 'Somewhere in the Green Hills' and the winner of the H.A.I Gunetilleke Award 2016, is back. Her new novel, 'When a Cloud Left the Sky' published by M.D Gunasena will be released this Saturday, 23rd September 2017 at around 11.30 in the morning at the Colombo International Book Fair.
Ive been working on 'Cloud' for three years, and Im so excited to share it with readers this September, says Aditha. This is my attempt to chronicle life after the war in Sri Lanka. The setting is Galle, my hometown. So, while the story is fictional, it is also quite personal.
The first chapter, however, begins in New York  immortalizing a young Sri Lankan writer, seated on a bench in Washington Square Park, NY, USA. As you read on, you will realize the story unfolds simultaneously  moving between nights in New York to mornings in Sri Lanka  until finally, the characters meet in Unawatuna, Galle.
Among the central characters are Orinth who dreams of writing the perfect novel, Kanishke who wishes to bring ethnic harmony to his country now recovering from the ravages of war while Sanith just wants to live in peace in the place he calls home. Over the time span of four months, their lives are destined to meet in quite unforeseen ways, under the dark clouds of a turbulent past.
Aditha Dissanayake brings to this story all the warmth and power of insight that characterized her first novel, 'Somewhere in the Green Hills' and her collection of short stories, 'My Mind is Made Up, I'm Afraid its You'. 'When a Cloud Left the Sky' is filled with the magic of her writing, capturing with heartwarming clarity the moods of men and women of different races - in peace, in war, in love.
An author, columnist, and translator, Aditha has a BA in English (Hons) First Class, from the University of Kelaniya. She has studied journalism at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of the New York University, USA, was a lectuere at the Dept of English, University of Kelaniya and the Features Editor of the Sunday Observer, before she decided to become a fulltime writer.
If you have read and fallen in love with her previous books, here's a chance to go through the same process all over again.

Constitution formulated within a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka: Sampanthan
The process of formulating a Constitution for the country is being done within the firm framework of a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka, said Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan yesterday.
He also said that the successful conclusion of this Constitution making process on the basis of an acceptable reasonable and substantial national consensus would bring about a firm finality to this issue and Sri Lanka would perpetually be a united, undivided and indivisible country in keeping with the basic and Supreme Law of the country, and on the basis of the free will and consent of all its people.
He made this observation following Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes presentation of the Interim Report of the Steering Committee before the Constitutional Assembly met in the Main Chamber of the House of Parliament.
We as parliamentarians are engaged in the process of making a Constitution - the basic Supreme Law for our country, on behalf of the people,the Opposition Leader said.
This is being done within the firm framework of a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka.
This is the framework within which the Constitution will be evolved and which all of us will voluntarily acknowledge and accept. The successful conclusion of this Constitution making process on the basis of an acceptable reasonable and substantial national consensus would bring about a firm finality to this issue. He said that Sri Lanka would perpetually be a united, undivided and indivisible country in keeping with the basic and Supreme Law of the country, and on the basis of the free will and consent of all its people.
He also said that Sri Lanka which is inhabited by the Sinhalese,Tamils, Muslims,Malays,Burghers etc is a functional democracy, in which several political parties function. He added that while the two main political parties have alternatively formed the Government, other parties too have played their own role.
No Constitution has thus far been framed for Sri Lanka on the basis of a substantial bi-partisan consensus amongst its different people in particular the Tamil people, or on the basis of such bi-partisan consensus between the two main parties and other political parties, Opposition Leader Sampanthan said.
The present exercise in Constitution making presents the first such opportunity.A Constitution based upon such a reasonable consensus, would give the Constitution, a legitimacy and credibility.
He also said that this would bring the Constitution out of the realm of political expediency and give the Constitution a character which would create the ideal of a Sri Lankan identity and a Sri Lankan nation.
We have not been able to achieve this in the 70 years since independence, the Opposition Leader said.
He also said since 1987-1988, the Constitution making process has been a continuous process. He added that the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was the first time when power sharing arrangements between the center and the Provinces, however weak, were incorporated in the Constitution. Sampanthan also added that ever since then, successive Presidents and Governments have come up with greatly improved proposals that could bring a final resolution of the national question. During President R. Premadasas term there were the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee Proposals, during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas term there were the August 2000 Constitutional proposals brought to Parliament with Cabinet approval, the Opposition Leader said.
During President Mahinda Rajapaksas term there were the proposals formulated by the Multi Ethnic Committee of Experts appointed by him, and the Report of the All Parties Representative Committee headed by Prof. Tissa Vitharana, submitted to President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Sampanthan added that there was substantial consensus,around all those proposals, though for various extraneous reasons, they could not be incorporated into the Constitution.
He added that this process could be termed as a continuation of earlier processes, taking place in an altogether different environment, with every possibility of success, if all are reasonable and committed not to miss this opportunity. Reasonable and acceptable Constitutional arrangements recognising their identity and dignity have been a long standing goal of the Tamil speaking People, said Opposition Leader. There are many such arrangements the World over. Consequences of non-resolution have had diverse ramifications on the Tamil people and the whole country; educated qualified Citizens of this country particularly Tamils and Sinhalese have left this Country and taken residence abroad depriving this Country of a great deal of talent; the reputation of this Country has been greatly tarnished internationally having an adverse impact on the Country and its future in several ways; We need to salvage our reputation and win international respect.
The Opposition Leader also said that the countrys economy has been greatly handicapped and has been left behind in the economic field, while other Countries in the region have progressed steadily enabling the Citizens of those Countries whose standard of living was lower than us to enjoy a much higher standard of living than we have in our Country, expenditure of vast sums on Defence has deprived us of substantial resources for development in several vital areas, contributing to backwardness.
All these factors make it imperative that we create for our country, a new future, based upon a new supreme and basic law and that we jointly endeavour to succeed in the fulfillment of this sacred task, Opposition Leader Sampanthan said.

DP World to buy Dubai Maritime City for $405 mn
DP World DPW.DI, one of the worlds largest port operators, has agreed to buy two fellow state-owned maritime companies from its parent for $405 million.
DP World will acquire Dubai Maritime City owner Maritime World for $180 million and Drydocks World for a capital injection of $225 million from Dubai World, the port operator said in a statement on Monday.
Dubai World, the state-owned conglomerate which agreed to a $25 billion debt restructuring in 2011 after it was hit by the global financial crisis, is the majority owner of DP World, Maritime World and Drydocks World, according to its website.
The transactions are expected to close before the end of the first quarter of 2018, DP World said.
The agreement comes amid a regional dispute that has seen the United Arab Emirates (US), and other Arab countries, cut ties with Qatar, including closing access to its ports.
That has meant that DP Worlds flagship port Jebel Ali, the regions largest, is no longer handling cargo destined to and from Qatar which is instead being shipped direct to Doha or through other regional ports.
DP World said Dubai Maritime City, a commercial and industrial park located next to its Port Rashid, would offer an alternative to the Jebel Ali Free Zone which it also owns.
The port operator also said that Drydocks World, the Middle Easts largest ship repair yard, would be integrated with its maritime services unit P&0 Maritime.

Teacher in Charge, Sudarma Senanayake Gamage, pointed out that drama is the most conducive way to help students gain an understanding about what the world demands from you. She stated that we live in a society that is knowledge oriented. You need to understand exactly how things work or you will be left behind. Knowledge is one of the most powerful things you gain through drama.
More than taking part in competitions and getting placed, what we want is to help our students develop 21st century skills through drama. By working as a team they build up skills of collaboration and communicative skills, and when they get exposure doing different types of Dramas like Russian Dramas, Anton Chekhov and English Literature like Shakespeare, they will improve their English Language skills and their personality. At the same time they will improve their leadership skills. Today in this globalized world, we talk about developing partnerships with other countries. And I believe specially through drama, even though our students do not get the opportunities to visit those countries, and get first- hand experience in being with those people, through drama they get that exposure. They learn about other cultures, traditions and history. So doing drama is not only for competitions but it is basically for the improvement for their overall personality and skills. Ultimately they will be very confident global citizens, said Gamage.
She stated that as a teacher, she also learns a lot by working with these boys. I would also like to thank my fellow teachers R.H. Priyadarshani, Surangi Alwis, Samankanthi Gamage and Geethanjalie Werradekara. As teachers we have a good rapport with these students by working with them, and the best part is developing very good relations with the boys. There is a good team spirit amongst the drama club members, said Gamage.
The Drama Club functions at three levels as Senior, Junior and Primary levels under the guidance of a team of dedicated English teachers. So the seniors help the juniors to develop their dramatic skills and English Literary skills. The best reward is seeing our seniors take up the mantle and guide those who are younger to them.
Acquiring knowledge
President, W. S. P. Rasula Yadithya stated that meeting people can do wonders for your life. When you meet people you learn from them. Everyone has a story to tell. You start to look at things from different angles. You acquire knowledge. Drama is the best platform to learn about behavior. You are able to better relate to people. You understand that there is a world out there that you may not be perceptive about. When I first started, there were some workshops that explored not only drama, but poetry and English as well and about Shakespeare himself. This helped us develop our skills in English such as speaking and correct pronunciation. It helped develop our coordination and improved our team skills. When we look at what we can learn from drama, the stage becomes a microcosm of real life. That is what we gain from drama. When doing drama we learn about other people and their characteristics and our lives have changed, Yadithya said.
Yadithya stated that practicing is an experience of its own and are so much fun. His favourite drama was Macbeth where he played the character of Lady Macbeth. Understanding those archaic words of Shakespeare was so interesting. It was so memorable to me. There is a really dark side to Lady Macbeth and I portrayed it! Learning to show these complex emotions was really enriching to me, he added.
There is a certain science in enacting these roles. You have to understand what is going on. Even when you are walking there has to be a certain purpose to it. You should know what you mean when you have to say something. It was Lady Macbeth who actually convinced Macbeth to kill Duncan. So this play could be a warning that there are people like Lady Macbeth in society. So we can gain something from reading this play, Yadithya explained.
Real life copies
Vice President M. M. Sasmitha,spoke about trust. You need to trust the man next to you. You need to back him up and he has to back you. You cannot have weak links in the chain.Doing Drama helps develop team spirit and teaches students how to work as a team. It especially helps to develop presentation skills like getting up on stage and overcoming your stage fright. Learning Shakespearean language helps develop your speaking skills because we become acquainted with the culture and literature. When working as team we get to know the strengths and limitations of others. We are in focus and we want everything to work perfectly well, Sasmitha said.
Sasmitha played the part of Caesar and the betrayal of Brutus required Sasmitha to show complex emotions and required some special acting. Life is a journey and drama helps you take that first step. Life is a book and drama helps you turn the first page, Treasurer, P. H. Channuka Devnindu said adding that the learning is what most impresses him about drama.
It helps you develop your leadership skills. You learn how to face problems by taking that first step. It is interesting, because through drama you see real life copies of the characters in the drama. So there are certain similarities between the characters I have encountered in dramas and in real life, Devnindu added.
Not afraid
Secretary, T. Pamesh Uralagamagestated that drama provides you with something that is priceless which is not being afraid to speak. You learn how to develop that charisma. You learn how to develop that boldness. You learn to tune into what other people are going through. It makes you are more empathetic person. At the start there was that initial stage fear. But when we practice hard and continuously it automatically develops your personality. You are not afraid to go up to anyone and speak, you are not afraid to go up there on stage and speak. We are all a team and we know each other, Uralagamage said.
There is no time for shyness in this world. Every moment you spend being shy your chances of living a good life diminish.
When you start off the main problem is being shy. When doing drama you are not afraid and you can face anyone. There are subtleties in dramas that you need to master, Uralagamage added.
A good opportunity
Assistant Secretary, M. Mecci Nassimrevealed that a combination of attitude and perception is gained through drama. We live in the 21st century. We live in a world that expects so much from you. You need to have a positive attitude. You need to be able to adapt to this global village we live in. And along the way you meet lifelong friends. Doing drama gives you a good opportunity to learn about the ways of this globalized world. Doing drama does wonders to your proficiency in English. When doing drama a friend you make is a friend for life. Through cooperating with everyone we learn about each other. We understand each other, Nassim said.
He stressed that the arena, which is the stage is the best way to rid oneself of stage fear and drama helps the boys to showcase their talents. Believe it or not, talking to others and stage fear are the two things that terrify people in our society. One of the ways to manage this situation is to dive in to drama. I sort of like Julius Caesar. That play interests me. It enlightens us on Leadership qualities. It shows the difference between those days and now, Nassim pointed out.

Emirates catering - how food and beverage adds value to the inflight experience
There's five hours to go for the departure of Emirates flight 654 from Dubai to Colombo and Jane Zdrojewski, Operations Manager at Emirates Flight Catering, checks the Flight Preparation Monitoring Board. All meals are ready on schedule for this flight.
This is one of the myriad tasks a total of 4,500 staff at flight kitchen EKFC1, which is dedicated to Emirates flights, undertake every day to ensure high quality cuisine, route- specific menus and the bottom line - food safety, for passengers.
The ISO certified, US$ 159 million Emirates Flight Catering is the largest airline catering facility in the world, producing over 185,000 meal trays a day.
Emirates Flight Cateringhas another flight kitchen - EKFC2 - which caters to others airlines and to the lounges. In all, Emirates Flight Catering has 10,500 staff.
On an average day, EKFC1 produces a total of 185,000 meals, while EKFC2 caters to 125 airlines, producing a total of 28,000 meals.
In the very competitive airline industry, Emirates is particular about catering to the tastes of its different passengers and has regional catering managers, who together with a concept team visit their different destinations to create route-specific menus.
Emirates' cosmopolitan crew, which include some 135 nationalities, also give valuable inputs and convey passenger feedback, all of which ensure high quality cuisine, says Jane.
There are two menu cycles each month, she says. Meticulous planning means that appetizers, main course and desserts are matched. April is a key month for menu changes as it is the start of the Summer holiday season when schedules change.
Emirates standard for inflight meals is called the 'Najm standard' ('Najm' means 'star' in Arabic). Details of each part of every meal are compiled into a specifications manual, the 'bible' of the flight kitchen, which is strictly adhered to and constantly checked for compliance with the Najm standard, says Jane.
At EKFC1, three days' stocks are held in the Food and Non-Food storage sections. Food would include juices, water, biscuits and more while Non-food would store toiletries, slippers, children's toys and the like.
Production is where meals are prepared for batches of flights.There are hot and cold kitchens. Emirates is one airline that prepares meals from scratch and so has its own bakery which bakes all the bread, muffins and pastries and more.Starting from scratch also means that 50,000 fruit salads are meticulously prepared everyday in the cold kitchen, Jane says.
The hot kitchen has different sections for the different regions, such as Far East, Arabic and Continental.
Bulk food is then sorted into individual meals in the Dishing Room.
A key factor is ensuring food safety is temperature. So once sorted, the food goes into a blast chiller for 30 minutes to cool it to 5C so it can be refrigerated in cold rooms a floor below, at Airside Logistics, which is tasked with ensuring food and non-food items get onboard.
Airside Logistics is so designed that all goods are stored along one side while the opposite side has wide doors which open on to the ramp. The doors are large enough for trucks to back up so carts can be loaded. Every flight has three doors, one each for First, Business and Economy Classes.
Non-food items are loaded first and then food. Food is transferred to convection ovens on meal carts before uploading onto the aircraft. All carts have stickers with the flight number, Class and other details.
Timing is also a key factor in ensuring there are no delays on account of catering. Loading into the aircraft galley begins two-and-a-half hours before departure and finishes an hour before departure. After going over the check list with cabin crew, the flight handler and his team return to prepare for the next departure.
Jane Zdrojewski reads the Flight Preparation Monitoring Board
The central procurement department overlooks suppliers for its flight kitchens, each of whom has been carefully selected to ensure they can deliver the required volume at the required quality. Suppliers are selected only after Emirates catering management team has visited and evaluated premises for food product and hygiene standards. Spot checks on suppliers also ensure they adhere to the airline's standard.
The flight kitchens also cater for special meals such as kosher, Hindu, low sodium, gluten-free, largely based on the IATA list.
Under Emirates Flight Catering, two other facilities are included: Food Point and Linen Craft. Food Point is an offsite food facility with a production capacity of 40 million meals a year while Linen Craft is the largest industrial laundry in the Middle East with a throughput of over 200 tons of linen and 10,000 pieces of garments a day.
EKFC has a dedicated Environmental team that recovers recyclable material from the inbound flights. An average of 1.73 million kgs of aluminium cans, wastepaper and cardboard, glass bottles, aluminium foils, plastic and 420,800 litres of used cooking oil are collected annually. Emirates, which is constantly expanding its route network, plans to add a third flight kitchen next year. (MM)

Government to act against adoption racket
There had been many baby farms in Sri Lanka:
Sri Lanka is to launch an investigation into the adoption fraud following claims that thousands of babies had been sold to foreign nationals in the 1980s.
Sri Lankas Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, said the government would set up a DNA databank to enable children adopted abroad to search for their biological parents and other relatives and vice versa.
In an interview for a television documentary to be aired in the Netherlands on Wednesday, Minister Senaratne acknowledged the existence of illegal baby farms in Sri Lanka in the 1980s. Children were either bought or stolen before being sold to westerners for adoption, the programme makers allege.
There were a number of baby farms back then, Senaratne said. They collected the babies there and sold them to foreigners for adoption.
Senaratne said it was the existence of such facilities that prompted the Sri Lankan Government to suspend inter-country adoption. The rules were altered after a high-profile case involving the discovery of 20 newborn babies and 22 women held in prison like conditions following a Police raid in 1987. The number of adoptions by foreign nationals subsequently plummeted.
The makers of Zembla, a Dutch current affairs programme, claim that the records of Sri Lankan children adopted in the Netherlands during the 1980s were widely falsified.
A series of interviews with doctors, brokers and those involved in adoption schemes in Sri Lanka paints a grim picture of a racket involving the abduction of newborns from hospitals.
The abducted babies were allegedly handed over to acting mothers, who pretended to be the biological mothers, before the children were sold for adoption.
More than 11,000 babies have been adopted by western countries from Sri Lanka in the 1980s, the programme makers said. While 4,000 ended up in the Netherlands, others went to the UK, Sweden and Germany, claims the documentary.
We will have to set up a special agency where parents and children could have their DNA tested.
One woman told the programme that she was informed that her baby had died shortly after birth at a hospital in Matugama, but that a family member saw a doctor carry the infant out of the hospital alive. Another claimed that someone connected to the hospital had paid her to pretend she was the childs biological mother. She said: They asked me to act as a mother. Then they gave me 2,000 rupees.

I Was Wrong..!
Last night while watching George .C. Scott acting as a New York cop in an old movie my thoughts went back many decades when dad had taken my brother and me to see the movie Patton. I hero worshiped the General as he won battle after battle for the allied forces.
What a man! I thought to myself, I wish I could be as courageous as him!
But the movie ended on a rather tragic note and I remember how sorry Id felt for Patton who finally fell because of his arrogance.
Why I asked my dad and he told me another story about the same general during World War II days.
Patton once accepted an invitation to dine at a press camp in Africa. Wine was served in canteen cups but, obviously thinking he was served coffee, Patton poured cream into his cup.
As he stirred in sugar, Patton was warned that his cup contained red wine and not coffee.
Now, General Patton could never, never be wrong could he
Without hesitating he replied, I know. I like my wine this way.
And he drank it!
Bob, said my wise dad, It is dificult to admit mistakes. It is hard to admit when we are wrong. Three of lifes most difficult words to say are, I was wrong. But they are also three of the most powerful words we can utter. Saying I was wrong breaks down barriers between people. It brings estranged people together and it creates a climate where intimacy and love may flourish. You may be surprised at how positively many people respond to the words, I was wrong!
I remembered Patton and I recollected my fathers words last night as I saw George C Scott again.
A television commentator Don Shula tells of losing his temper near an open microphone during a televised game with the Los Angeles Rams. Millions of viewers were surprised and shocked by Dons vulgar words. Letters soon arrived from all over the country, voicing the disappointment of many who had respected the coach for his integrity.
Shula could have given excuses, but he didnt.
Everyone who included a return address received a personal apology. He closed each letter by stating, I value your respect and will do my best to earn it again.
Don Shula won the respect of his viewers once again by admitting that he was wrong in what hed done.
I hear my dads words coming to me across the great divide, Bob, there are two ways to gain respect: One is to act nobly and the other is, when you fail to do so, to make no excuses in admitting you were wrong..!

Iconophile at Saskia Fernando Gallery
Iconophile, an exhibition of paintings by Sujeewa Kumari will be held at Saskia Fernando Gallery, 41, Horton Place, Colombo 07 until October 3.
Sujeewa Kumari deals with notions on social identity and women in a post-colonial context. In her works she addresses de-realized memories, cultural images and artistic styles which immerge as complex terms in tension between the local and global. She works with paintings, digital photography video, and performance art.
Through the imagery within my male/female poetic drawings and paintings I explore an intimate inner landscape grappling with my own nostalgia, displacement and psychological transformation. These works act as both psychological and archival visual representations, she said.
Sujeewa Kumari was educated at the Institute of Aesthetic Studies at the University of Kelaniya, and completed her MFA at the Dutch Art Institute in the Netherlands, where she explored her experimental spirit as a female contemporary artist.
Within her early body of works the artist expresses her point of view as a woman in Sri Lanka, focusing on her female identity in the contemporary art scene and society based on her experiences, and her research on the concept of post-colonial identity discourse.
Objects I have collected that represent home have become part of my personal archive.
These materials, be it family footage, collected photo albums, magazines, nostalgic objects, friends and anything that is very personal to me, they are pieced together in these works.
Through these symbolic references often in combination with the female form, I explore the wider notion of freedom, Sujeewa Kumari added.

Inflation increases to 7.9% in August
Issuing the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), for the month of August 2017, Dr. Amara Satharasinghe, Director General of Census and Statistics said that the Year on Year inflation based on NCPI has increased to 7.9% in August 2017 from 6.3% in July 2017.
The reported increase in inflation is mainly because of the low price levels that prevailed in August 2016.
Contributions to the inflation from food group and non-food group in August 2017 are 5.3% and 2.7% respectively, whilst contributions of these two groups to the inflation in August 2016 were 1.8% and 2.6% respectively reflecting prevailed comparatively lower price levels especially in food prices in August 2016.
However, when compared to month on month changes, NCPI in August 2017 has decreased to 122.3 from 122.4 reported in July 2017. This shows a decrease of 0.1 index points or 0.1 percentage points in August 2017 compared to July 2017.
This month on month change was due to the decrease of expenditure value of food items by 0.25% and increase of expenditure value of non-food items by 0.16%.
The decrease in expenditure value of food items was due to the price decreases in rice, vegetables, fresh fish, chicken, red onions, garlic, coconut oil and chilly powder. However, increases in expenditure value in index were reported for coconuts, potatoes, sprats (dry), big onions, green chilies, limes, tea dust, banana and mangoes.
The increase in expenditure value of non food items in August 2017 compared to the previous month was due to the expenditure value increases in groups of Health, Alcoholic beverages, Tobacco and Narcotics, Miscellaneous Goods and Services, Furnishing, Household equipment and Routine household maintenance Transport, Clothing and Footwear and Education.
Further, the groups of Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other fuels and Communication recorded very slight expenditure value increases compared to the preceding month. The expenditure value of Recreation and Culture and Restaurant and Hotels groups remained unchanged during the month.

Lahore leg of Sri Lanka tour still under consideration - SLC CEO
Players will not be penalised for not going but....:
The Lahore leg of Sri Lankas series against Pakistan is still under consideration according to Sri Lanka Crickets CEO Ashley de Silva.
Sri Lanka is scheduled to play a T20 international at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on October 29 which will be the final match of their tour of UAE, but De Silva said that they would need to first assess the security situation before sending the team to play there.
We will assess the security situation whilst the tour is going on in the UAE and take a call on whether we would be sending the team, said De Silva at a media conference held at the SLC headquarters yesterday.
As planned we would be sending one of our security personnel to Pakistan at least two weeks in advance to carry out an assessment and give us a report. The time frame to take a decision on Lahore would be immediately after the Test series, he said.
The two-Test series between Sri Lanka and Pakistan commences at Abu Dhabi on September 28 and concludes in Dubai with a day-night Test on October 10. It will then be followed by a five-match one-day international and three T20 internationals, the last one of which is scheduled to be played in Lahore.
Speaking further De Silva said that the players would not be penalised if they decide not to go but added, As per the agreement signed with SLC they are obligated to. There is a contractual obligation. If they have concerns they could bring it to the notice of the management but so far no one has done so.
We will look at their security first and we will give them the assurance that nothing would happen to them if they are to go Pakistan, said De Silva.
We have already informed all the players and the officials and they are aware of it. Our prime concern would be the security of the players. If we feel that there is a security threat we will not send the team to Lahore, he said.
Sri Lanka Test captain Dinesh Chandimal said that it is a decision to be made by all the team members. One individual cannot take a decision. We will first have to first assess the security situation there and then take a team decision.
Pakistan are trying to woo back international cricket to their country after the 2009 terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka cricket team bus in Lahore that led to a complete halt of international teams touring there.
The first steps towards achieving that end took place in Lahore last week where a World XI comprising international cricket stars from several Test playing nations took part in a three-match T20I series against Pakistan.
For the first time in their history Sri Lanka will be playing a day-night Test with pink balls but captain Chandimal said that his team was prepared for it.
As a team we are in good shape the last domestic tournament we played with pink balls so most of the players have the experience of playing with it. If we can adjust to playing a Test match with the pink ball as quickly as possible it will be good, said Chandimal.
NO MATHEWS
Sri Lanka will be without their most experienced batsman Angelo Mathews for the first Test and most probably for the entire series after he suffered a calf strain and cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha said that it was an easy void to fill.
Its not easy to fill the vacuum created by Angelo but that gives the opportunity for another player to get selected to play Test cricket. We cannot say at this moment who will replace Angelo, we will have to take a decision after we go to Abu Dhabi, said Gurusinha.
Uncapped batsmen Sadeera Samarawickrama and Roshen Silva were named in the 15-member squad for the two Tests and one of them could probably take Mathews place.
The former Sri Lanka World Cup winning cricketer said that personally he would not want Mathews bowling across any format as he has a tendency to get injured when he does so.
We spoke to Angelo regarding this and asked him what his ideas are. He told us that he was keen to bowl in ODIs and T20Is but our first priority is to get him fit and play him as a batsman, said Gurusinha.
If it is my decision I wouldnt want Angelo to bowl because he can perform as a batsman for the team. We will take a call after speaking to him at the end of the Pakistan series what he really wants to do.
Head coach Nic Pothas said that Mathews got injured during training while trying to help a younger player reach a higher level on the yo-yo test.
Angie got himself injured not physically running but by trying to help a younger guy to try and get to a higher level on his yo-yo test. That itself shows you how an experienced and senior guy like Mathews helping younger guys along the way, said Pothas.
The moral of this team is extremely high and in the public domain you think because we had a tough series against a very good Indian side you dont have good morale that actually it makes the morale even stronger. Winning games at cricket builds confidence but this is a fantastic bunch of players who are all very good friends. Team morale is also a massive thing and the Indian series brought them even closer.
Speaking on the omission of middle order batsman Dhananjaya de Silva, Gurusinha who is also a national selector said, Dhananjaya is a brilliant player. He is not just left out of this squad, we have a A team tour of West Indies and we are seriously looking at building his confidence first. He should be in the national team hopefully in the next six months.

Laws usually dont favour the poor and weak
The Sykes- Picot agreement was horrendous:
The idea of states with boundaries was a colonial export:
Law is an instrument of Politics:
Prof. Alfred H.A. Soons, Emeritus Professor of International Law, University of Utrecht, academic and international jurist, visited the Island on the invitation of the Moragoda International Law Trust recently to deliver a series of lectures.
Since 2014, each year a renowned academic in the field of Public International Law has been invited to conduct workshops at the Kotelawala Defence University as the Moragoda Endowment Professor of Public International Law. The past invitees of the yearly workshops include Prof. Terry Gill of the University of Amsterdam, a specialist in International Humanitarian Law in August, 2014; Prof. Veerle Heyvaert of the London School of Economics who conducted a series of successful workshops on International Environmental Law in August, 2015 and Prof. (Dr.) V. Balakista Reddy, Professor of International Law, Coordinator M.K. Nayambar SAARC Law Center and Head, Center for Air and Space Law, NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad in September, 2016.
Taking time off his schedule during which he was to deliver a series of lectures on the Laws of the Seas, Prof. Soons spoke to the Daily News on a gamut of contentious issues with regard to International Law and its applicability in the Sri Lankan context.
Following are excerpts of the interview:
Q: Professor, the book that you had written titled The Right to Self-determination and the Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, was a fascinating read. If you could help us understand the process which as the subject matter of the book and on the crux of which was the issue of self determination
A: This is another area that is close to my research interest. The right to self determination in international law I think, is really still highly relevant in many areas of the world. Within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, it still plays a role with regard to the six islands in the Caribbean which formed part of the kingdom. We have 6 islands that still belong to the Kingdom of the Netherlands and those islands have an individual right to self determination. So its interesting that within the kingdom of the Netherlands which most of the world identifies as this country in Europe, there is still 300,000 people living in the six islands in the Carribean that are still a part of the Kingdom of Netherlands and they have a right to self determination. Their status is separate from the status of the population in Europe. I have to always explain to my countrymen that within the Kingdom of Netherlands, that we have seven units of peoples. One, the vast majority of them in the Netherlands and then the six islanders in the Caribbean, with populations varying from 150,000 to 2,000. They are individual units of self determination. This is the result of the fact of our colonial past. The Kingdom of Netherlands until 1949, was a very big colonial power. What is interesting to see is that, what you often see with states consisting of islands is that the populations of these islands go their own separate ways. Unless the populations have for a long period been so close together, they have been one social community. If that is not the case there is this need for autonomy. The Netherlands had to struggle with that as well. Its a complicated thing with the Netherlands even to explain. This obviously is a consequence of colonization and creating new societies which by colonial administrations were put together because they were very close together. It is a very obvious thing to do in a colonial perspective, but it didnt succeed. In the sense that it didnt really form one single nation, which led to this splitting up although attempts were made to prevent it. This is some sort of the general background to this issue.
Q: Sri Lanka has inherited a part of the legacy of colonisation resulting in the call for self determination by one section within the island, resulting in a long drawn out civil war. Do you see parallels 
A: One of the fascinating aspects of dealing with these issues and getting to know more about local situations is by travelling to them , is that they are ultimately all unique. Just like any person is unique, countries are unique. They are a product of history. And even though colonial times have had a big impact, if you take Sri Lanka for example, history goes back to thousands of years. But with what I spoke of on the Caribbean and the Kingdom of Netherlands, the peoples living there are relatively recent products of colonization. Thats a combination of the conquering of the Spanish, the British, the Dutch etc., and the importation of slaves from Africa which had a huge impact on the Caribbean, which it still has. You could say that most of the current population started only around the 17th century through importation from outside, which include the slaves. The traffic to the Caribbean went on and in the 20th century, because of oil refineries in some of the islands - it attracted thousands of workers from within and outside the region. On some plantations also in the British Caribbean island, no slaves were imported, but migrant workers from India were imported to work in Sugar Cane fields. So in the Caribbean you may have many people of Indian descent. You also have Chinese families living in these islands. So populations which are now units of self determination under the UN decolonization rules, were relatively recently created communities.
Now when you come to Sri Lanka, you get a totally different picture. These are ancient communities which have developed over thousands of years and in addition what you have to keep in mind always is that the European notion of states, as the main subject of international law for a number of centuries now, since the 17th century. The Europeans in their colonization of the rest of the world, exported their notion of the state in the European sense. This meant relatively clear boundaries. You could live on one side of the boundary or the other side of the boundary, but that made a huge difference because people on one side of the boundary you would be a subject of State A and on the other side a subject of State B.
I think that in Africa and in Asia, the notion of state was completely different in varying degrees. Perhaps in India, you also had the notion of boundaries, but in most parts of Africa and Asia, the belonging was to a community. The community had local rulers and superior rulers and may have been an ultimate ruler. But the communities under their local ruler often changed their loyalties or had loyalty to two competing super rulers far away. They paid tribute to the two superior rulers to keep the peace and after awhile, they may have changed their loyalty to another, without really fixing limits and boundaries.
So the Europeans when fixing the boundaries tended to look at rivers or mountain ranges as a nice boundary. But for the local people in Asia and Africa, rivers were not boundaries, the rivers were used by the same people of the same community. They used the two sides of the river. When the Europeans decided they had colonies and that they needed boundaries between the French, the British, the Dutch, the Portuguese, etc., they often used rivers as a boundary. So they split the same community of people in two as a result, even though they were one people and one nation.
What I understand of Sri Lanka is that you have different peoples - Sinhalese, Tamils, Moors and some others. The Tamils are one people which has ethnic, cultural, religious ties with mainland India. But I suspect that the same applies to the Sinhalese people. I understand that Sri Lanka has always been a separate kingdom in competition or cooperation with different nations such as India.
Q: Yes. Just as you explained the working of the pre colonial nations
A: Yes this is my limited understanding of Sri Lanka. I have only superficial knowledge about her. But Sri Lanka appears to be a State which includes in an ethnic sense, several peoples and that means you have a majority or a few majorities and minorities. One of the minorities predominantly lives in a particular geographic area. I have no idea of the quality of how these communities lived together in pre-colonial times. During colonial times, you had the colonial power governing the entire area who dictated how living together should be and how they must live together. Usually, the call for self determination starts with the call for more autonomy and equality in civil and political rights. But the more the minority is suppressed or there is perceived suppression which often is not understood by the peoples themselves and is assisted by outsiders to really understand the nature and degree of relations and as to the actions of the majority are suppression or not. Perception is more important than reality and it helps if you could demonstrate the understanding of need for respect of minority rights which are often cultural and religious. If it is only cultural and religious, it could be accommodated. Language could also be accommodated with no discrimination at all. But if there is a social economic feeling of not being well looked after, then we often see conflict. You can see what happened in Ireland for example, where the religion and social economic issues took to the fore even among ethnically the same people. It was the social cultural differences which have developed over the centuries which ultimately took to the fore.
If you dont take care of those concerns by the majority for the minority, then you very often see developments of the minorities wish for autonomy expressed in ultimately violent ways. That I suspect is what happened here. I hope it will not resurface.
Q: That is a very fascinating breakdown you gave on the intertwining of these complex issues. On the same lines, the question of Kurdisthan. If one goes to Istanbul, Ankara, or Izmir any Turk would tell you that there really is no problem for the Kurds and that they are as equal as everyone else in Turkey. They will tell you that they dont see logic in what is being fought for by the Kurds. You see the same phenomenon here. When you talk to a person living in the South, they would point out to the constitution and ask you  tell me what in this document discriminates of a minority, and if you look at it, it is very hard to point out. What is your understanding of these factors
A: I am a lawyer, not a sociologist or anthropologist. Of course my specialization is in International Law which is closely related to the social sciences. Conversely, social sciences and politics play a huge role in this area of law. Sciences are sciences, but Law is an instrument of politics, which makes law different. Purely formal assurances are apparently not satisfactory. Why sometimes it is and sometimes it is not - probably only can be explained by knowing a lot about the particular history of the situation.
For example the Kurds in fact, have in the background of their minds, I think, that they were promised and for a very brief time had their own state. Many of them wished for the establishment of that state. And perhaps its from the perspective of what you dont have, do you look at what others have and feel that what you get isnt enough. As I said, all these issues are unique. The issue of the Kurds is a nice example of how unique these issues are. The people who regard themselves as Kurds, live in three or four states across these boundaries. But these boundaries across these areas were made after the first World War by the French and the British.
Q: The Skyes - Picot agreement
A: Yes. This was a horrendous legacy of colonialism. Of the way the powers of the day thought they could arrange things and rule the world in their interest. Huge mistakes in the long term by not recognizing the uniqueness of the people. Now in Sri Lankas case, I dont know enough about how autonomous in their daily lives they were in the past. And how independent they were in taking care of their economic and social needs throughout history. Was there any sort of autonomy So I would be interested in learning more about that. The Tamil militancy started in the late 1960s and what triggered that I dont know. There must have been something in their perception of how they were being governed that they were not recognised sufficiently as being a separate state. With separate wishes wanting to do things differently, than the Sinhalese majority. There must be an explanation in the background there, which I dont know much about.
I read somewhere that the Sinhalese majority thought that during colonial times that the Tamils were almost favoured by the British. If that is true, there couldve been some resentment on the part of the majority against the minority for its previous privileged position. But I have no idea to what extent this is true.
Q: To give you a bit of perspective Professor, it was the elitist of the Sinhala and Tamil Community who dominated and decided on the day to day decisions affecting the masses. They were supporters of the British or the colonial masters and there was also the caste and class issue which I think, played a dominant role in both the South and the North Militancy. It is all intertwined. Moving on Public International Law is seen as a fallacy, its viewed as a tool to oppress the small nations. As a jurist what is your stake on this
A: Such a general view must be immediately rectified by pointing to areas in which this is obviously not the case. For example, the right to self determination, which is a product of International Law. The right to self determination was primarily a construct of the United Nations with respect to colonized people - and it goes beyond it. So we have self determination issues in Europe. What I mentioned about the Caribbean - where they had the right to Self Determination - comes from international law. International Law provides for this and that is one example. The whole areas of Human Rights law and International Humanitarian Law where the individuals rights are recognized are also made certain now. Although Human Rights Law is a rather recent construct, international humanitarian law - the law applicable during armed conflict is centuries old. It is an area of international law today, which you cannot just do away with and say it is in the interest of big powers. That is complete nonsense.
But at the same time of course in many respects, International Law like any law, is a reflection of power configuration at any moment. In many countries there are a lots of law that are either enacted by Parliament or enacted by an authoritarian system, but many laws are established and adopted which favour particular interests. Usually they dont favour the poorest part of the population. Look at what is happening in the United States. Big economic interests have much more chance of being heard and accepted and their interests represented in national legislation over the weak and the poor. This happens in any society. So it cannot be a surprise that in international law which developed over centuries, which is in fact the Public Law of Europe, exported all over the world and since developed, is a reflection of this. However, the newly independent states since the developments following the Second World War to this area of law have made a significant impact on International law. Where not only the rich and powerful have had a say. So the law cannot only be regarded as representing the interests of the strong.

Leonardo DiCaprio pledges $20m to tackle climate change

Leonardo DiCaprio has announced his foundation will give out $20m (15m) to tackle the effects of climate change.
The huge sum will be spread between more than 100 organisations supporting wildlife protection, marine conservation and climate change programmes.
It will be the largest amount ever donated by the Oscar-winner's foundation, which has given out around 60m since its was set up in 1998.
"We are proud to support the work of over 100 organisations at home and abroad," DiCaprio said in a statement before attending a climate change conference at Yale University.
"These grantees are active on the ground, protecting our oceans, forests and endangered species for future generations - and tackling the urgent, existential challenges of climate change."
The grants cover six areas: climate change, wildlife and landscape conservation, marine life and ocean conservation, innovative solutions, indigenous rights and the California climate change program.
"Our challenge is to find new ways to power our lives, employ millions of people and turn every individual into an advocate for clean air and drinkable water," DiCaprio said.
"We must demand that politicians accept climate science and make bold commitments before it is too late."
The areas targeted by the grants include Somalia, Kenya, the Amazon and the United States.
Last year, the actor met with Donald Trump to discuss climate change and how green jobs could boost the US economy.
After the meeting, the actor gave the then President-elect a copy of his documentary Before The Flood, which Trump promised to watch.

Let truth re-echo like the sting of wasps
Recently a JVP gasbag who has entered the Assembly through the kitchen door, not with a mandate from the people, threatened to topple the government using SAITM, as a scapegoat. The white coats with rusty scalpels, coming from all directions, threatened to topple the government by paralyzing Colombo, which ended in a fiasco.
An elderly and formally retired SLMC big shot, an incarnate of Donovan Andree the impresario, who craved for publicity, admitted he too will join the bandwagon to topple the government.
Despite the noise, the government will complete its term and return for another. There is no other way to stop the return but capture the bastions and fortresses of Jaffna, Trinco, Batticoloa and Borrella. As at today they stand impregnable. That is the lesson of history. When the incarnate of Hitler was riding shotgun, none of these individuals or groups raised a whimper on the day the Chief Justice was dethroned, or when an editor of a prominent newspaper was murdered at high noon on Galle Road, or when scores were abducted in white vans, or when top administrators who took over from the CCS, described as a gentleman's career, did not choose to die resisting, or flee from dishonour, but lived submitting, a poignant line taken from Pericles funeral oration after the Peloponnesian War, found in my Notebook.
Contract for Central Expressway
The hypocrites now assert that the present regime is corrupt to the core and point as an example the contract for the Central Expressway calling it a highway robbery simply because the contract was given to the Japanese without competitive bidding, which in my view is a device engineered by the wretched of the earth, to swindle.
The highway robbery epithet brought to mind an event that took place when as a 14 year old athlete, travelled to Kandy by bus, accompanied by the senior athletes, to participate in the Central Group Meet on the Asgiriya Grounds, to qualify for the Public Schools Athletic Meet at the Oval, in Colombo. The Bedford did not leave Kurunegala via Potuhera, the proposed entrance to the new highway but via Mawatagama.
Half way up the Galagedera Pass the engine had enough and displayed its anger with a steaming radiator, forcing the driver to stop the engine and the passengers to dismount. The regular traveller, who knew the script, scampered and returned with boulders to keep behind the wheels to prevent the bus rolling down the incline back to Kurunegala. The conductor ran somewhere and brought a bucket of water and quenched the thirsty engine. When the bus grudgingly limped into Kandy, a journey that took about 5 hours, it was late in the evening.
The De la Salle Brother in charge of the contingent took us to the Gym of St Sylvesters College; an arena that had witnessed many a fight for the Stubbs Shield and reminded you will be staying here for the night and left. After he left the other athletes also left saying they will be staying with their relatives, leaving me alone to fend for myself.
St Sylvesters was famous for producing Stubb Shield boxers like Bulner who routinely turned his opponents into pulp and there was nothing in the Gym but the paraphernalia associated with boxing, punching bags, gloves and the ring. I believed in ghosts then, and do believe in them now, even though it is not necessary for Satan to arrive in mufti, in an helmet with full face mask, since Lucifer has conquered given the crap about same sex marriage and abortions.
So I trembled, fearing a ghost of a Stubb Shield boxer, who had lost his bout, might creep and strangle. I had with me a basket of food, a blanket and a pillow. Placing 3 benches together, enjoyed the food, covered myself and praying to God to protect me from ghosts, both boxers and handlers, slept. Dawn had broken when I woke and got ready go to the Asgiriya Grounds with the other athletes, who had arrived after spending a restful night in the comfort of their relations.
High tech nightmare
The grounds were a revelation. Compared to the Annite ground which was an abandoned paddy field and alert whilst trotting not to be gored by enraged wild buffaloes. Asgiria was immaculate, designed to break records. The athletes who stayed away enjoying hot water baths, wholesome food and massage toned muscles, were eliminated. Only one senior athlete qualified coming third in the hurdles. Myself, a product of fire and brimstone, running bare foot on the damp ground, qualified, smashing the records of the sprints for juniors, and surpassing the times set by the seniors, stunning the high brows of Kandy.
Those were days where travel was primitive, exacting and trying. If there is technology to travel comfortably to a destination, what harm in spending extra resources to achieve that objective.
It is a miracle humans have stepped forward to construct the expressway which is a high tech nightmare. After the bus stalled climbing the Pass I was shivering outside because it was bitterly cold and covered with mist and looking down the precipice was hit by vertigo.
How many Japanese engineers and workers will lose their lives during the period of construction God bless them. Squabbling over a few rupees makes us so ungrateful and miserly. Human life cannot be measured in rupees and cents. Spend a few more coins and get the project completed and reduce the travel time from Kurunegala to Kandy to 2 hours, that is, if you are the owner of a souped up Alfa Romeo sports. But for simple folks like you and me, reducing the journey time, even by a fraction, is a blessing.
Copy the Communist Party of China. The party is inviting primarily Japanese investors to turn their sleepy villages into thriving cities, attracting millions of tourists, topping 100 million in 2015. China and Japan, even though at each other's throats in politics, are bedfellows in economics. India is copying China, inviting Japan to build a bullet train in the state of Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Modi, at a cost of 17 billion dollars, compared to the cost of the Central Expressway, just a tip the wealthy give to bell boys. No bids were called, the contract, just like the Chinese, simply given to the Japanese, masters and experts of bullet trains and roads linking destinations with tunnels.

## Title: Mevan Pieris - King of Swing
## Supertitle:

Mevan Pieris - King of Swing
Cricketers of the caliber of Henry Siri Mevan Pieris who hailed from S. Thomas Mt Lavinia are not made they are born once in a life time. And to this category belongs this lanky all rounder who any captain in world cricket will dearly love to have in his team.
Pieris not only used the willow and the ball or brawn to showcase his skills, but above all used his brilliant brain that had cells not only for cricket, but also for academic success.
Success in the game
From a very early age Pieris showed a love for the game and had it in his genes to become an outstanding all rounder. Being a batsman or only a bowler was not sufficient for him. The bottom line for him was to be an all rounder and contribute in every aspect of the game for his school, club and country and also be a Captain Marvel.
Pieris achieved all this by dint of some hard work, dedication, determination and above all commitment and discipline. That captaining the country eluded him was a travesty of justice. Had he had the opportunity of captaining, he would have joined that illustrious band of international captains whose stints were writ with outstanding success.
Pieris was unlucky not to have been in the big game after Sri Lanka entered the Test arena. He was one of the greats during the pre Test era. After showing his capabilities in school he entered the University and later enrolled with the Sinhalese Sports Club and continued his stature in the game and it was not long when national honours came his way.
Memorable wickets
Pieris played for the country from 1970 to 1975 and many were the memorable wickets he captured, big innings he played and showed his brilliance on the field and clever captaincy cricketing brain he showcased. In school he was right arm medium paced, but once in Uni he took to bowling fast with a longer run up and his pace was tremendous.
He could make the ball talk when it came to swing bowling  in and out  and was rightly tagged the King of Swing. He could get the ball to rise disconcertingly from off a good length and batsmen feared to face him, especially on the mat. He was equally menacing on turf wickets. Pieris captained the university in 1970 and by example led them to win the Division 1 league championship.
During his career he shone like a beacon and had among his victims, illustrious batsmen of the class of Sunil Gavaskar, Zaheer Abass, Dough Walters, Greg Chappel and Keith Fletcher. Playing against Madras captained by former Indian off spinner and latter international umpire Srinivas Venkataraghavan, Pieris also showed the batsman in him scoring twin half centuries and taking five wickets for 55 runs. An admirable all round performance.
Victory from the jaws of defeat
In this game Madras required eight runs for victory with Sikh Satweder Singh blasting away on 87. Singh was a prey to Pieris and he helped turn victory from the jaws of defeat and for his wonderful effort the huge crowd present ran on to the field carried him off the field. Seldom are cricketers honoured this way.
Pieris outstanding efforts were rewarded when he was picked to play for the country in the first World Cup in England captained by his school team mate Anura Tennekoon. In the match against Australia at the Oval he sent down 11 overs of high class seam and swing bowling and was rewarded with the wickets of Greg Chappel and Doug Walters.
After successful first season in school cricket he achieved the dream of every Thomian or Royal cricketer to play in the Battle of the Blues. Pieris achieved this dream when he played in the victorious Thomian team that beat Royal in 1964 by 8 wickets.
Played three sports
At University in addition to his prowess at cricket he also won colours in tennis and hockey. Having to do a lot of studying at the University it is amazing to note how he found the time to indulge in two other sports and succeed. Pieris later captained the Sinhalese Sports Club in Sara Trophy cricket and his memorable knock was the century he made against the Colts.
It is a pity that he could not captain the country in cricket. Had he done so, he would certainly have been classed with the best captains produced in world cricket. In addition to his excellence in sport he had an outstanding academic career. Pieris in addition to his prowess in sport was also a brilliant academic.
He is highly qualified in Polymer Science, holds a BSC form the University of Colombo. MS(c) and MBA from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura and FPRI (UK) and holds a Masters Degree in Polymer Chemistry and Business Administration. He can rightly claim to be the most qualified cricketer here and abroad which is great for the game and the country.
He was also a knowledgeable journalist and an efficient Radio cricket Commentator. He was eloquent on any subject and I deem it an honour to have got to know him and play against him in Sara Trophy cricket. He was a gentleman we all ought to know.
It is a pity that Sri Lanka Cricket did not have the fortune of having Pieris in its administration. Had he served SLC he would have contributed immensely with his experience and knowledge and the countrys cricket would have attained great heights.
Pieris is married to Dr. Nirmala an UNID Consultant. They are blessed with a son Nilanka who played and captained STCML in 1995. Their daughter is Dilani a Chartered Accountant. Pieris is also an unsung sports legend.

Miracle Reliable Sealants launches  MR Seal all purpose penetrating sealer
Miracle Reliable Sealants, has launched the all new MR Seal all-purpose penetrating sealer a penetrating waterproofing solution available in the market that acts as a preventative measure against the deterioration process.
MR Seal could be applied on tile grout, bricks, concrete, blocks, pavers, stones, rugs, carpets, leather, wood and timber, while preserving the original condition and increasing the lifespan for years to come.
MR Seal makes tile grout, marble, stone, leather and even wood surfaces resistant to most common spill-related stains, soiling, discolouration and efflorescence, adding years of extended life and value.
The solvent based Do-It-Yourself self applied sealer does not require any special tools or repairmen and can save you a lot of time, money and frustration when cleaning, said Abarna Thaventhiran, Managing Director at Miracle Reliable Sealants Pvt Ltd.
MR Seal sealers imposes no danger to humans, animals, materials or the environment and meets the most stringent regulatory requirements internationally, she added.
Miracle Reliable Sealants recently launched their website to serve their customers better. www.mrseal.lk
Unlike water proofing paints, MR Seal does not form a surface film or membrane coating. Instead, the sealant absorbs deep into the substrate, internally filling the micro-pores without the need to remove or replace the concerned surfaces. While other water-repellent sealers or the common acrylic-based sealers have to be reapplied every other year, MR Seal is an economical solution in the long-run even before considering all the labour.

MOL joins Swan LNGs FSRU project in India
Japanese shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines has signed agreements with Swan LNG for a stake in liquified natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal project in India.
As stipulated in the deal, MOL will be taking care of the long-term operation/maintenance of a floating, storage and regasification unit (FSRU) and provision and long-term operation/maintenance of a floating and storage unit (FSU) that will serve as the core receiving facilities in an LNG terminal to be developed by Swan Energy Limited in Gujarat, India.
The main facilities of the terminal, to be located in Jafrabad, Gujarat State, will comprise a FSRU tank of 180,000cbm capacity and a FSU of 135,000cbm -145,000 cbm capacity in addition to a breakwater, jetty mooring and accompanying onshore facilities.
Moreover, MOL said it would invest in Swan LNG and participate in many facets of the project as a technical partner. The terminal, with a projected capacity of 5 million tons a year is slated to start operation in early 2020.
The FSRU serving this project is being ordered and owned by Swan Energy through its subsidiary, and MOL has an option to participate in the FSRU joint ownership. The option is exercisable any time before the delivery of the FSRU from South Koreas Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), MOL said.
The move is in line with MOLs aspirations to promote the FSRU business and greater presence in the LNG market, being one of the worlds largest LNG carrier operators and the only Japanese FSRU owner and operator.
As explained, the deal fits within MOLs initiatives to pursue vertically integrated businesses that are not limited to transportation in the LNG business, in addition to the expansion of the LNG business in the growing Indian market.
This will be Indias first new-building FSRU project.

Museum of stuffed gophers
A small town overrun by gophers has turned the infestation into a top tourist attraction - by stuffing the rodents and putting them centre stage in a bizarre museum.
The Gopher Hole Museum, in Torrington, Canada, has 47 different exhibitions showing the furry animals mocked up in all sorts of surreal situations celebrating the town's history and events.
The strange displays were the brainchild of one of the residents who wanted to boost the tiny hamlet's failing economy while simultaneousness solving the problem of a plague of gophers.
After a government grant and 18 years, the museum boasts over 70 stuffed minute mammals, attracting thousands of visitors each year.
There are gophers dressed up as train inspectors, native Indians, firemen, ice hockey players, gas attendants, blacksmiths, fishermen, hairdressers and even a bank robber.
Photographer and blogger, Raymond Walsh witnessed the curious exhibition, and shared the bizarre pictures on his website Man On The Lam.
My favourite was the campground scene - it's tough to beat a dead gopher in a bikini, said 44-year-old Raymond, who now lives in Muscat, Oman.
Most people who I've shown the pictures to think they're cute, in a macabre kind of way. There have been a couple of folks who think it's disgusting, but for the most part the reaction is pretty positive.'
After town elders floated the idea in 1996, Canadian officials granted the money to build the small structure and have attracted around 6000 tourists per annum ever since.
And they didn't stop with the museum, all 11 fire hydrants in the town are painted to resemble Gophers and a 12ft high Gopher sculpture can also be found.
With high street shops closing down, British towns facing rat infestations may want to take note.

Need for secondary leadership for Education Ministry
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed Education Ministry officers to take measures to build a second tier in the ministry which is capable of taking up challenges in the education sector.
The Education Minister has pointed out the need to build the secondary leadership, which can take the education sector forward once the present top level officers are on pension.
He was addressing a meeting of staff officers at the ministry, recently.
The minister said there is a scarcity of capable staff officers for secondary leadership since there is no proper mechanism for recruiting staff officers to the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service (SLEAS).
However, with the mediation of Minister Kariyawasam, 852 staff officers have been recruited to the SLEAS based on the results of limited and open examinations. Moves are taken to give them a proper training including foreign exposure.
At the moment, almost all senior staff officers in the SLEAS have been recruited under a programme implemented to recruit staff officers to the SLEAS by then Education Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in 1988. Most of these officers are scheduled to be on pension within the next few years. Therefore, there is a scarcity of SLEAS officers to take the baton, the minister said.
The minister noted that all senior staff officers in the SLEAS are duty bound to create a strong secondary leadership.

Neuer injury thrusts Ulreich into Bayern limelight
BERLIN Thursday Sven Ulreich considered quitting Bayern Munich over the close season due to a lack of chances, but Manuel Neuer's latest injury has propelled his understudy into the spotlight.
Germany standout and Bayern captain Neuer is out until January after undergoing surgery on Tuesday -- his third operation in six months for a fractured foot.
The same day, Ulreich made only his eighth Bundesliga appearance in three seasons during Bayern's 3-0 win at Schalke, with Wolfsburg up next on Friday at Munich's Allianz Arena.
You feel for Manuel, the whole team is of course disappointed and we hope he comes back soon, said the 29-year-old Ulreich.
I am pleased that I get to play and will do my best to replace Manuel. The problem is that while Ulreich is a talented shot-stopper, like most of the world's goalkeepers, he lacks Neuer's unshakable self-confidence in the box, footballing ability and timing.
Both the Schalke and Wolfsburg games are mere warm-ups for Bayern's biggest test so far this season -- next week's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League group stage.
It is all a far cry from just a few weeks ago when Ulreich was eyeing the door, uttering: It's not my aim to sit on the bench as a No. 2 for the rest of my career. Now, he has Neuer's considerable boots to fill with only Bayern's third-choice keeper -- 17-year-old Christian Fruechtl -- as back up. There are three players Bayern can ill afford to lose for a long time -- primary goalscorer Robert Lewandowski, playmaker Arjen Robben and Neuer.
Ulreich, a former Germany Under-21 international, has only made a total of 14 competitive appearances for the Bavarian giants, mainly when Neuer was injured, since joining from Stuttgart in 2015.
He faces his toughest challenge next Wednesday at the Parc de Princes against PSG's star-studded 'MCN' attack -- Kylian Mbappe, Edinson Cavani and Neymar.
I am looking forward to testing myself against such a world-class team, but we are a world-class team, which I know from training, Ulreich said confidently.
The stats are both a help and a hinderance when trying to ascertain how Bayern will fare with Ulreich as their last line of defence.
They have lost only one of the eight German league games he has played over 90 minutes.
However, his lone two Champions League group stage outings were last November's shock 3-2 defeat at Rostov and a meaningless 2-0 win at Dinamo Zagreb in December 2015.
Likewise, against arch rivals Borussia Dortmund, he experienced highs and lows. -AFP

We intend to formulate a Constitution that will benefit all Sri Lankans irrespective of their cast, creed or social standing. It is a Constitution that will bring about a strong economy which would benefit all. We must take this opportunity to strengthen our democracy and build stable peace.
These are areas that we were deprived of over the past three decades. It is essential to build a strong democracy which will ensure prosperity to all, the Prime Minister said.
In order to bring in investment and generate employment that would enhance the prosperity of all Sri Lankans, a strong economy and development is essential, Prime Minister Wickremeasinghe said.
We have now been given an opportunity to build a bridge of peace expelling division and distance between the various races, which for so long had threatened economic development being held hostage by violence and volatility for so long, the Prime Minister added.
Tabling the Interim Report of the Constitutional Steering Committee in Parliament yesterday,the Prime Minister said it was a foundation for discussion. All parties were given the opportunity to include their ideas and suggestions.
We formulated this collectively and everyones ideas and suggestions have been included in this report. We have suggested that Sri Lanka should be a unitary state, the Prime Minister said.
According to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, there are power devolution suggestions included in the report and the countrys future would be determined by the agreement reached.
The Prime Minister said all members are prepared to accept a united Sri Lanka which cannot be divided. The country is currently experiencing a huge transformation in the political landscape of this country and we are travelling in a new direction, he said adding that the government supports such a change. We were battered by unimaginable hardships during the past three decades, but now for the first time we have been given the opportunity to stand on the same platform. This dedication and commitment we make to bring about peace and stability will make a huge difference to our future generations, the Premier said.
We cannot allow this opportunity to escape us. There is no room for revenge within our democracy.
The prominence given to Buddhism within our society will be safeguarded while the formulation of our new Constitution has been on the principles of Buddhism. We place our trust in the Buddhist teachings that it will guide our nation, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the government will not allow anyone to inculcate fear in the minds of the people and destroy the countrys economy creating instability and division.
We have come before you with a solution. From the North to the South we have extended support in devolving power to the provinces, the Prime Minister added.
The Provincial Councils are known as the third level of state governance. It is a blessing that these proposals have received the approval and support of the government and the opposition. We need to discuss the Presidency and the Executive further and a broad discussion is needed. This interim report is a joint effort which received the support of President Maithripala Sirisena, the Prime Minister said. A Constitutional Council was established to oversee the process of a new Constitution. Hence, we hope that this will create a positive dialogue throughout the country. This is a historical juncture that will ensure our future generations a prosperous and peaceful nation. I expect this topic to not only be discussed within the Constitutional Council but discussed broadly among the general public throughout the country, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added.
The Prime Minister pointed out that in the end it should be a Constitution that will benefit the whole country. Hence, he invited all to take part in this historical and most significant process.
The Prime Minister said since coming into power, the National Government has established democracy and ensured peace and equal opportunities for all.
We ensured the rights of all where the people can now express their views without fear of persecution. The media too has been given the freedom to criticise even the government. Today the international community too has confidence that we will establish a democratic and economically strong country. This government will ensure that through the devolution of power we empower all communities creating a close bond between the government and the people. We will not allow a handful to ruin our childrens future. This is the principle that the new Constitution will be based upon, the Prime Minister added.

O'Brien says Lions coaches'overtrained' team
LONDON Thursday Ireland flanker Sean O'Brien has criticised the coaching during this year's British and Irish Lions tour, saying the team were overtrained and should have easily beaten the All Blacks.
O'Brien, speaking to the Off The Ball podcast, said Warren Gatland's coaching team were panicking at some stages in New Zealand and that they may have cost them the tour.
The British and Irish composite side tied the three-Test series 1-1 after they lost the first game, won the second and drew the final encounter in Auckland.
I'd be pretty critical of (the tour) because I think we should have won the tour and we probably should have won it comfortably, O'Brien said.
Looking back there's a bit of frustration we didn't get it right over the whole duration of the tour... We can be proud of some of the performances we put in but I think as a player it was probably one that got away from us. O'Brien said a triple training session two days before the first Test hurt the Lions' chances. They lost the tour opener 30-15. In the first week we definitely overtrained on the Thursday and maybe the coaches were panicking a little bit about getting the information into us, he said.
And I think we did nearly the same thing on the last week... less is more sometimes on a tour like that. O'Brien scored a classic try in the first game but he said the tour was probably one that got away from us.
I think there's a lot of learnings to take from the tour in terms of the coaching set-up as well and from a player's point of view with how we dealt with things, he said.
O'Brien added: At the end of the day with the squad we had, I think we should have beaten them, 100 percent. -AFP

Ogilvy PR Sri Lanka wins top Asia Pacific award for 'Right to Information' campaign
Ogilvy Public Relations Sri Lanka succeeded in finishing ahead of 1,200 of the best award entries from across the Asia Pacific region at the SABRE APAC Awards held in Hong Kong recently.
The agencys Uncover the Truth campaign for Sri Lankas Right to Information Act won two Certificates of Excellence, a Gold Award in the Charities and Not-For-Profit category and the Best-in-Show campaign at the SABRE APAC Awards 2017. Ogilvy Public Relations Sri Lanka is the first and only PR Agency in the country to win the Platinum Best-in-Show Award, earning it the crown of the best PR campaign in the Asia Pacific awards show, which saw entries from Australia, Japan, India, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and many others in the region.
The SABRE Awards Show is the worlds largest and most sought after public relations awards competition, which recognises superior achievement in Branding and Reputation Management in North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), South Asia and the Asia-Pacific regions.
The SABRE Awards is hosted by The Holmes Report, the authoritative voice of the global public relations industry, dedicated to proving and improving the value of public relations by providing insights, knowledge and recognition to public relations professionals.
This campaign for Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) focused on educating the Sri Lankan public on the Right to Information (RTI) Act, which came into effect on February 4, 2017, after nearly two decades awaiting parliamentary sign-off. The PR campaign titled Uncover the Truth, was executed in partnership with the Neth FM radio station and its online channels, to promote the Acts usage among the public.
The Uncover the Truth campaign beat out four other Platinum-nominated campaigns for Best in Show. Last week was a proud moment for all of us in Ogilvy Asia Pacific. Thank you, team Sri Lanka for making us so proud, said, Scott Kronick, Ogilvy Public Relations President and CEO for Asia Pacific. Speaking on the win, Irvin Weerackody, Chairman, Ogilvy Group Sri Lanka, said: Once considered a stepchild in the marketing world, Public Relations is now a potent tool in marketing and of course in championing public service initiatives.
Ogilvy PR has been tremendously successful in the use of best practices in PR in crisis management and strategising public service campaigns over the last few years.
The campaign for the Right to Information Act is such an example, and a landmark campaign.
Apart from winning the Platinum award for the best in Asia Pacific, the Uncover the Truth campaign draws attention to a new law in Sri Lanka that forced disclosure of information held by public authorities and has given hope to the relatives of victims of human rights violations, and many others.
It was hailed as a great example of a public service campaign by Paul Holmes, Founder of the Holmes Report and Chairman of the SABRE Awards, in light of a recent controversial PR campaign done in South Africa to incite racial tensions.

Over US$ 40 bn for Western Megapolis
The proposed Megapolis project covering the Western Province would be major driver of economic growth not only for the Western province but to the entire country, said Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka.
Speaking at the ADB Asian Think Tank Development Forum 2017 in Colombo he said that the economic contribution of the Megapolis region will be higher than the countrys average GDP.
Minister disclosed that the total investment cost of the Megapolis project would be in the excess of round US$ 40 billion expanding for around 12 years. Government contribution to equity in such very high capital intensive projects would be minimal and is not in a position to be the major funder for these developments. We have identified over 100 privately funded projects worth around $10 billion, he said.
Ranawaka said that the government wants to offer most of these opportunities to the private sector and get them involved in financing critical urban infrastructure as its own equity contribution would be limited.
It is imperative for the government to integrate the private sector to ensure stable financing and projects would be mainly in the form of public-private partnerships. The PPP model would be applicable to these projects, he said.

Pakistan batsman Khalid Latif banned for five years
Spot-fixing inquiry:
Pakistan batsman Khalid Latif has been banned from cricket for five years for his part in a spot-fixing ring.
A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) tribunal handed down the punishment after finding Latif guilty of all charges at a hearing on Wednesday,
The PCB has been conducting a long-running investigation into corruption in the Twenty20 Pakistan Super League.
Latif, 31, has played five one-day internationals and 13 Twenty20 internationals for Pakistan.
He was fined one million Pakistan rupees (7,020) after being found guilty of fixing or taking a bribe to underperform, failing to disclose corrupt approaches and soliciting players into corrupt acts.
Fellow Islamabad United batsman Sharjeel Khan was also banned for five years last month, with two and a half years of his ban suspended.
Spot-fixing is where the outcome of a particular passage of play is pre-determined, as opposed to fixing the outcome of a match.
All-rounder Mohammad Nawaz and seamer Mohammad Irfan have also been sanctioned as part of the inquiry after they failed to report suspicious approaches.
A number of other players have also been questioned or suspended while the inquiry is carried out.
Britain's National Crime Agency provided the initial intelligence that led to the PCB investigation.

Parliament
Executive Presidency with certain powers should exist
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party is of the view that the Executive Presidency with certain powers should exist to protect the sovereignty, defence and unitary status of the country, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said.
He was addressing a press conference held in the Parliamentary Complex along with the SLFP government members.
The Minister said the SLFP joined the Unity Government to achieve several objectives. "One was to change the electoral system. We were able to change the electoral system of the Pradeshiya Sabhas and Provincial Councils," Minister Silva said.
He said the SLFP made constructive proposals that no other party made to the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly. "One such was that the subjects of a ministry should be included in the Constitution," he said.
State Minister Dilan Perera said President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa pledged during the Presidential Election that they would change the electoral system. He said the change of the electoral system would fulfil the wish of 11.9 million people who voted for them.
Ministers S. B. Dissanayake and Dayasiri Jayasekara participated.
Executive Presidency should be abolished: Anura
The Executive Presidency should be abolished through the new Constitution to guarantee vibrant democracy in the country, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said.
He was expressing his views after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the Interim Report of the Steering Committee to the Constitutional Assembly in the Main Chamber of the House.
MP Dissanayake said the JVP had a different view over the Constitution. He said they decided to support in formulating a new Constitution as they maintain that it should be changed. He said the electoral system should be changed. "It should be done through a new constitution and not by any other means," MP Dissanayake said. "The Executive Presidency should also be changed," he said.
He said the 1978 Constitution was designed to polarise power around Executive Presidency. "19 amendments were made to the Constitution since then," MP Dissanayke said.
He said the sovereignty of the people, national defence and the people's rights should be guaranteed and the racism should not be tolerated through the new Constitution.
Empowering women is vital for sustainable development
Sustainable development is not possible without empowering women, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage yesterday said.
The Deputy Minister made this observation commencing the second reading debate of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Development Bill.
She said the commitment of all, irrespective of gender differences, was vital to bring about sustainable development.
Sustainable development is impossible without empowering women. The Government is taking great measures to empower women. We cannot expect Samurdhi benefits alone would develop the countrys economy. By empowering women, we can strengthen the family unit. We need to give women their rights such as land rights. Every ministry should contribute to sustainable development, she said.
Minister Gamage said that even climate change has an impact on sustainable development. We need to find solutions to climate changes. A special programme was launched in this regard in 2016-2017. The commitment of the people, parliament and the ministries is vital. A special board has been established, she said adding that she wished that by 2030 that the Government would be able to resolve the issues in the health sector and eliminate poverty and bring about sustainable development.
Prominence for Buddhism will not change: Ganeshan
The position guaranteed for Buddhism would not be dwindled in any way in the new Constitution, National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganeshan yesterday said.
He made this observation yesterday after the heated exchange between government members and Dinesh Gunawardena when the latter charged that the new Constitution is attempting to remove the rightful place given to Buddhism.
MP Gunawardana raised the issue after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the Interim Report of the Steering Committee to the Constitutional Assembly in Parliament.
"I am not a Buddhist," Minister said. "But we don't want to dwindle even a bit of the position guaranteed for Buddhism in the Constitution. We have not made any decision at the Committee," he said.
New Constitution will deprive Buddhism of its rightful place: Dinesh
A heated exchange took place between government members and Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday, while the latter charged that the attempts being made through new Constitution to deprive Buddhism of its rightful place and the rights of the 54 JO members.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and MP Ravi Karunanayake interrupting Gunawardena refuted the allegations. They said that the prominence given to Buddhism would not be compromised in any manner.
Gunawardena said the interim report presented by the Prime Minister after months of work and the ideas and views of many of the parties should be included to it, which was of prime significance. The Joint Opposition, the SLFP, JHU, EPDP and the TNA have submitted proposals. I state that there are many disagreement and disparities between the proposals submitted by the Prime Minister and those submitted by the various other parties. In the constitution making process, this committee has still not had the opportunity to represent the broadest public opinion to the committee. This is an attempt to bring out the ideas of a few ignoring of the majority representing the masses, Gunawardena said.
He said the Prime Minister suggested that the peoples views should be sought. He said the people does not mean the NGO personnel. The people are the people of this country. These are the issues that have been highlighted in the 14 points presented by the JO. A unitary state should prevail. This cannot be a comedy of errors that has differing meanings in English and Tamil no matter who attempts to do it. Hence this report is a series of comedic errors which I do not want to spell out at this point. We as a party respect all communities be it Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims and we speak and understand all three languages. We represent the views and aspirations of all these communities. We respect parliamentary democracy," he said adding that he represents 54 MPs of the opposition.
Today, he said, democracy and the electoral system were killed. Having done that, we are now talking about a democratic electoral system. He said the rights and democracy of the 54 MPs representing the views and rights of the people of this country were beheaded. Gunawardena added that while Prasanna Ranatunga and himself are in the Steering Committee, they were deprived of their rights.
Six sub-committees were appointed but these sub-committees had completely rejected the proposals of the 54 JO members. He said a constitution or a bill could not be formulated by denying the ideas and suggestions of the 54 MPs of the JO.
He said the JO would not allow the Sambuddha Sasanaya to be destroyed. He charged that the Speaker continued to deprive him of his opportunity to express his views and denies him the opportunity to speak on behalf of the 54 JO MPs.
Mano Ganesan said the steering committee had at no stage made decisions but only presented proposals. He said that not a single word was changed with regard to the position of Buddhism in the Constitution.
General Election should be held under mixed electoral system: Nimal
The General Election should be held under the mixed electoral system, introduced to the Pradeshiya Sabha and the Provincial Councils, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said.
"The Sri Lanka Freedom Party is of the view that the priority should be given to change the electoral system since it was a main objective of the SLFP to set up a unity government," he said.
He was expressing views after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the Interim Report of the Steering Committee to the Constitutional Assembly in Parliament.
Minister de Silva said the SLFP discussed the report extensively. He said the SLFP suggested that 9th clauses of the Constitution should be kept unchanged. He said the SLFP discussed specially the pages from 29 to 37 in the report and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's move to allow all the parties to express their views was commendable.
"The SLFP and the UPFA supported the 19th amendment to Constitution on the grounds that the 20 amendment should be amended," the Minister said.
"The SLFP agrees with introducing a senate. We suggest that there should be 19th A and two members of the senate should be given Cabinet ministries to strengthen it," he said. "SLFP suggests that the ministerial portfolios should be limited to 30 while the deputies to 30," he said.
He said the Executive Presidency should be maintained to a certain extent for the security of the country. "The President should be elected with the votes of people of all religions and communities to build up reconciliation," he said.
"The SLFP maintains that the Prime Minister should be elected under the Westminster System," the Minister said.
Environmentalism has become green extremism: Paranawithana
Environmentalism has become green extremism where man and animal were forgotten. We have reached a point where the farmers have abandoned their villages.
We require a broad social dialogue in this regard, Skills Development and Vocational Training Deputy Minister Karunarathne Paranawithana said.
He was speaking in Parliament yesterday during the second reading debate of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Development Bill which was adjourned on March 8.
This is a historical bill for the country. Sustainable development is a topic that needs broad public debate and an issue that requires great intervention,he said.
He said that only an ideologist has ideas on sustainable development and public cooperation is at a pathetic state. We are at two extremes, trapped within the ills of consumerism. We cannot be trapped in extremes and we need to follow a middle path. If we get stuck in theory, we will never be able to find solutions to this issue. Some forget that the environment and humans are one unit. One cannot survive without the other. If we get bogged down in theories alone, we will invariably limit sustainable development to a mere theory, Paranawithana said.
Constitutional making exercise will succeed: Hakeem
The constitutional making exercise that took many opinions into account holds some promise that it would be a success, Minister Rauff Hakeem said after the Prime Minister presented the Interim Report of the Steering Committee to the Constitutional Assembly in the main Chamber in Parliament yesterday.
He said that at the same time, we now see some parties taking many positions on critical issues which show that it is not going to be an easy task.
Hakeem said it would require much more commitment to produce a single document that enshrines our democratic rights without discrimination.
Hakeem commended the work done by the steering committee in producing the interim report to the Constitutional Assembly.
He commended the Prime Minister for chairing the steering committee for several weeks to bring divergent views into some acceptable compromise.
I have been a part of the constitutional making process since 1989. I was in the all party conference summoned by the late President Premadasa and several select committees except in the Mangala Munasinghe select committee.
"What is unique in this effort is that for the first time the Prime Minister himself is giving committed leadership to prepare a new constitution for our country. All parties in Parliament participated in the process. We have given space for other parties and civil society groups to place their views, he said.
Hakeem said they were disappointed that a provision of non-discrimination was rejected by some parties. The electoral process has many views and we saw a very heated debate in the house and the vote getting delayed late into the night because of the lack of consensus. Many flaws were in the adopted process on Wednesday and I have made my point clear. The secretariat failed to include some of our observations on electoral reforms and other points that we wished to include in the report. We expect the secretariat to include them, he said.

Pindapatha to save suspects, a political game: Chief Minister
The Maha Sanghas pindapatha campaign to collect money to pay up a fine imposed on suspects found guilty by court, has political connotations, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said.
This has given use to the question whether bhikkhus showing reluctance to fend for their noon meals doing pindapatha rounds to collect money was ethical, he said.
The Chief Minister expressed these sentiments addressing the media at Hotel Topaz Kandy to announce plans made by the Provincial Trade and Tourism Department to mark forthcoming World Tourism Day celebrations recently.
Although Bhikkhus doing pindapatha rounds to collect noon meals was a usual occurrence, doing so to solicit financial contributions was a novel experience for the Buddhist public who suspected an ulterior political motive behind it, the Chief Minister said.
He said although financial contributions were collected to pay up a fine imposed on the worlds first female Prime Minister when she was deprived of civic rights, the members of the Maha Sangha never took part in it.

Real Madrid beaten by Betis on Ronaldo return
MADRID Thursday Antonio Sanabria struck deep into stoppage time to hand Real Betis a shock 1-0 win away to Real Madrid on Wednesday as the European champions failed to score for the first time in 74 matches.
Defeat leaves Real already seven points adrift of leaders Barcelona just five games into their defence of La Liga having failed to win in all three home games so far this season.
Even the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo on his return from a five-match domestic ban couldn't break Betis' resistance as former Real goalkeeper Antonio Adan produced stunning saves from Isco, Toni Kroos and Gareth Bale.
And Betis snatched all three points in the 93rd minute when Sanabria powered home a header from Antonio Barragan's cross.
Last year we won games we didn't deserve to and now it is the reverse, said Real coach Zinedine Zidane.
The league is very long, in the end we'll see how it goes but we need to be calm and we know we will have better days. It is the first time Betis have won at the Bernabeu since 1998.
It is impossible to win here without suffering, said Betis boss Quique Setien.
To win against a team like this, your goalie has to have a spectacular game and you have to have luck. Ronaldo was recalled among three changes to the Madrid side from Sunday's 3-1 win at Real Sociedad as Zinedine Zidane named his strongest available side. However, it was the visitors who made the stronger start and should have gone in front when Sanabria's goalbound effort was cleared off the line by Dani Carvajal.
Keylor Navas also produced a stunning save to tip Fabian Ruiz's rising drive over the bar.
At the other end, Adan made a smart stop to deny Isco just before half-time and Betis had to resist an onslaught after the break.
Ronaldo blazed wildly over from Bale's inch-perfect cross before Kroos forced Adan into another finger-tip stop.
The former Madrid goalkeeper's finest moment came in denying Bale in spectacular fashion 15 minutes from time, though, as the Welshman's backheeled volley was turned onto the post.
Betis were the side to finally have the ball in the net as the game entered five minutes of stoppage time, but Sanabria had strayed offside as he turned home Andres Guardado's shot.
However, they broke with purpose once more minutes later and this time Sanabria wasn't to be denied as he bulleted a header into the far corner from Antonio Barragan's cross.
Earlier, Atletico Madrid celebrated being awarded the honour of hosting the Champions League final in 2019 with an impressive 2-1 win at Athletic Bilbao to move up to third.
The visitors needed to rely on a brilliant penalty save from Jan Oblak to deny Aritz Aduriz just before half-time.
Angel Correa opened the scoring 10 minutes into the second-half by finishing off a flowing move involving Antoine Griezmann and Saul Niguez.
And Yannick Carrasco secured the three points with an angled finish from another Griezmann through ball 17 minutes from time before Raul Garcia netted a late consolation for the hosts.
UEFA awarded their showpiece event for next season to Atletico's new Wanda Metropolitano earlier in the day.
And the feel-good factor around Atletico following their 1-0 victory over Malaga to open their new 68,000 capacity home at the weekend continued with a commanding display in their fifth away trip in six games so far this season.
It is another important step for the club. Hopefully on the field we can match the growth of the club, said Atletico coach Diego Simeone.
We are making an enormous effort. We have played five games away from home and the response has been positive. Sevilla moved into second, two points behind Barca, as Jesus Navas scored the only goal of the game in a 1-0 win over Las Palmas.
Alaves remain without a point or even a goal after five games as Luisinho's winner handed Deportivo la Coruna a 1-0 win for their first victory of the season. -AFP

Regional confabs for National Export Strategy kick off in Kandy, Jaffna
Regional Consultations as part of the design of Sri Lankas National Export Strategy (NES) took place in Kandy on September 18 and in Jaffna on September 20.
The NES is being developed as a comprehensive and carefully structured five-year strategy aimed at increasing exports and generating enhanced revenue for Sri Lankas SMEs and exporters.
The National Export Strategy will focus on the development and expansion of key leading and emerging priority export sectors. The focus on some of these sectors will help to invigorate rural economies and create many new employment opportunities. This is part of the Sri Lankan governments drive to achieve a target of US$ 20 billion in exports revenue by 2020.
The NES priority sectors have been selected to ensure a balanced export expansion from visionary, emerging and mature sectors. In line with the objectives of the NES for an innovative and diversified export sector, the national stakeholders, using quantitative and qualitative information, have selected the following industries: IT-BPM, spices and concentrates, wellness tourism, processed food and beverages, boat-building and electrical and electronic machinery.
In addition, the NES will ensure that all export sectors including the mature sectors will benefit from the strengthening of trade support functions. Through wide public-private consultations, the following trade support functions (TSF) were shortlisted to achieve the NES vision and strategic objectives: national quality infrastructure; innovation and R&D and logistics. These trade support functions will aim at improving the overall competitiveness of Sri Lankas export sector.
Following the validation of the NES strategic orientations by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM), individual sector and functional strategy teams have been established.
Consultative meetings for the National Export Strategy were held in July 2017. Regional consultations are currently in progress in many provinces as part of the formulation process of the National Export Strategy.
Key regional consultations took place in Kandy to focus on the spices and concentrates and wellness tourism sectors. These regional consultations are taking place to ensure that regional requirements and specificities are fully integrated in strategic decision making.
A special session also took place on the trade information function to discuss options to improve access of SMEs to relevant and up-to-date market information. Input from local stakeholders is important to have a National Export Strategy that takes into account local challenges and opportunities. This will assist in creating vital business linkages between local entrepreneurs and businesses with their counterparts in other provinces of the island and counterparts overseas.
The consultations in Jaffna focused on the IT-BPM and Food and Beverages sectors. The event held in Jaffna also featured close consultations of public and private sector representatives from the Northern Province.
With Jaffnas position as a prominent northern city, the development of its port in the pipeline and geographical proximity to the vital markets in the south of India, the NES will take into account the potential the IT-BPM and Food and Beverages sectors can contribute to invigorating the local economy and aiding Jaffnas ambitions to become a regional trade hub. Taking into consideration concerns of local stakeholders in Jaffna was important to ensure that the National Export Strategy is truly national in its focus
The inclusively designed NES will represent the ambitions of public and private sector stakeholders for an empowered Sri Lankan export sector. In line with the governments mandate to provide equal opportunity for all, these sector specific regional consultations will help to develop policies and regulations that are truly national.
These consultative meetings were preceded by the first NES consultations which took place in April 2017 under the auspices of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, where a strategic vision for Sri Lankas export growth was agreed upon.
The National Export Strategy (NES) for Sri Lanka is being designed by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), in close consultation with key public sector institutions and private sector associations and chambers, as well as exporters and SMEs.
Technical assistance in support of this is being extended by the International Trade Centre (ITC) as part of their EU-Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance project funded by the European Union.

Residents to get Rs.6,000 mn compensation for lands acquired
Central Expressway construction:
The government has decided to pay Rs.6,000 million in compensation to residents whose lands and houses were acquired for the construction of the first and second stages of the Central Expressway.
Accordingly, 1,225 residents who were deprived of lands and houses due to the construction of the first phase and another 3,800 residents under the second stage would be granted compensation within the next few days.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella presented compensation cheques to 25 residents whose lands and houses were acquired for the construction of the first and second stages of the Central Expressway,at a ceremony held at the Ministry premises yesterday.
The Minister addressing said that many people have lost their ancestral homelands completely while several others lost about half of their lands due to the ongoing construction of the Central Expressway.
Our people have always been patriotic and we appreciate their sacrifice for the development of the country, he said.
Even when the Mahaweli development project started, many people lost their houses and lands. Many ancient temples were also submerged by the giant project. But, these people bore all these hardships by putting the country first. If the Mahaweli project had not initiated at that time, we would not have had sustainable electricity by now, Minister Kiriella said.
He said nearly 20 plots of land located from Kadawatha to Galagedara have already been surveyed and compensation paid.
We expect a significant boost to the national economy with the completion of the Central Expressway, which is to run through the Gampaha, Kurunegala, Kegalle, Matale and Kandy districts.
With the completion of the Expressway, it will enable the traveller from Colombo to reach the hill country within one and half hours.

Revolution in health sector after 2015: Rajitha
A positive revolution in the health sector in Sri Lanka commenced in 2015. During the previous regime, although there was a physical development in the health sector, there was no development in human resources, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, during the past, some patients had to wait until their fate decided whether to live or not. They died at a young age. But now patients receive drugs for life without financial limitations. The poor enjoy the free health system now, he said.
The Minister was addressing the inauguration of the second workshop organized by the Prenatal Society of Sri Lanka to educate family health midwives, in Gampaha, recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the workshop is important because the services need to be offered to grassroots level. Some doctors' organizations only have doctors' activities. They only talk about their issues and there is no way of bringing services to the people, he said.
Wrong concepts and myths spread in society due to the lack of intelligence. The productivity of society has reduced because people are not healthy. The government has commenced work to create a healthy and intelligent population, he added.

Russia tests balance of trade, politics and allies
International trade contributes nearly two-thirds of New Zealand's economic activities. Trade relationships are significant for the well-being of the country, which must find the balance among trade, politics and allies.
The crisis in Ukraine challenged New Zealand to demonstrate its balance.
Strong relationships with key emerging trade partners reduce the risks of international trade and business. Emerging economies, particularly BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China), are expected to hold a larger portion of the world economy in future.
Issues in Ukraine are not clear and are hard to understand. But they resulted in the suspension of negotiations for a trade deal with Russia and its custom union partners Kazakhstan and Belarus in a year that marks 70 years of diplomatic relations.
The UN was helpless in imposing sanctions against Russia as it is a permanent member of the Security Council. The UN needs unanimous support from all the permanent members to impose sanctions.
Political dimensions
Meanwhile, New Zealand was quick to get together with the US, the EU, Canada and Australia to impose travel sanctions against certain individuals in Russia.
Foreign Minister Murray McCully says these sanctions are symbolic. When Australia threatened Russia with comprehensive sanctions, ambassador Vladimir Morozov stated any restrictive measures of the Australian government will inevitably have a boomerang effect on Australian exporters.
In an ideal situation, countries may separate trade and politics but those always interact and interfere.
Perhaps a key objective of New Zealand's foreign policy is gaining the membership of the UN Security Council. That may require strong recognition of the UN charter by New Zealand. In addition, the defence agreements signed in 2012 between New Zealand, the UN and the US may have further pressurised New Zealand to go with the pattern. In other words take collective actions with the like minded countries.
Trade factors
New Zealand would like to represent a more neutral approach in the UN but the recent incident shows New Zealand became a part of the pattern generated and led by the US and EU. This may go against New Zealand's positioning of independent foreign policy.
New Zealand began negotiations for a trade deal with Russia and its customs union in November 2010. Though there was a good progress in negotiations, Trade Minister Tim Groser returned in March from Moscow indicating the pause in talks was temporary.
In 2013, merchandise trade between New Zealand and the Russian custom union was more than $820 million.
During past five years, trade has increased more than 100%.
Imports from Russia were over $590 million and exports were over $230 million. Imports and exports have grown 204% and 23% respectively during the past half a decade. New Zealand mainly imports fuel from Russia, while key exports consist of dairy, meat and fish. Russia was the 23rd largest trading partner of New Zealand in 2013.There are not much services trade and investments between the countries.
Statistics indicate New Zealand can live without Russia. However, Russia is the world's fifth largest food importer, particularly beef, butter, cheese, grocery and dairy products.
It is an ideal fit for New Zealand exports. Most importantly, Russia is a key emerging economy. Out of BRIC, New Zealand has China already on board and negotiations with India.
The Ukraine situation creates doubts about future New Zealand-Russia trade and challenges the need to have key emerging economies on board. In addition, Russia may not be an easy market to deal with. New Zealand exporters may find it difficult to adapt to Russian business practices.
A trade agreement will help look into these areas at the governmental level to increase the safety and legitimacy of business ties.
However, trade agreement will not solve all the problems. New Zealand and the Russian Custom Union were negotiating a comprehensive deal. In addition to trade in goods, the agreement considers trade in services, investment, people movement, intellectual property rights, institutional issues, dispute settlement and other issues such as government procurement and environment.
Role of allies
It is clear New Zealand is focusing more toward Asia Pacific for its future trade. All the trade agreements are with Asia Pacific countries. Many of these countries did not show any aggression toward Russia over its handling of the Ukraine issue. Perhaps they are giving little bit of time to see the developments or to find a middle path.
There are advantages of having allies. Working together increases the bargaining power, provides leverage on political ideologies and security measures.
The EU has greater bargaining power due to its market size. It can influence other regions with its political ideologies. Also, the EU holds a considerable level of world's military power. Allies may also be useful in difficult situations such as the EU's attempt to rebuild the economies of Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain. In that context having allies is beneficial. If New Zealand manages to complete a well designed Trans-Pacific Partnership, then its members may receive a similar bargaining power in terms of international trade such as or even above the EU's.
However, nations may have to compromise national policies to satisfy its partners. They may also need to be involved in activities that are not directly relevant to their country's interest but to some influential allies' interests.
New Zealand's involvement in both world wars and the deployment of New Zealand forces in Afghanistan are examples of allied actions. Also, allies can change their interest. The UK's shift of focus from the Commonwealth to the EU created negative consequences for countries such as New Zealand.
In this globalised world, almost all the countries find it hard to reach a balance among national interests, international business and international relations.

Sangakkara hits eighth ton of season
LONDON: Kumar Sangakkara continued his remarkable form with an eighth County Championship century of the season for Surrey against relegation rivals Somerset.
Sangakkara hit 119 not out as his side ended day two on 328-6, a lead of 59.
The Sri Lankan, 39, now has eight centuries and three half-centuries from his 13 innings this season and tons in his last two innings.
Mark Stoneman (51) and Ollie Pope (50) also hit half-centuries, while Peter Trego took 4-53 at The Oval.
Trego had Stoneman caught behind and dismissed Rory Burns (43), Ben Foakes (23) and Sam Curran (17), but Sangakkara's innings means the visitors are facing a large first-innings deficit.
Sangakkara is set to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the season but averages 124.45 and is Division One's leading run-scorer with 1,369 runs.
His 189-ball knock against Somerset has included 15 fours and a six, and has helped Surrey collect three batting bonus points from the five available so far.
Somerset started the match sixth, 13 points behind third-placed Surrey, but both sides are one of five that could join Warwickshire in being relegated from Division One.
New champions Essex were bowled out for just 76 by Hampshire but fared better after following on at the Ageas Bowl.
Essex were 33-5 overnight and Hampshire chose to make them bat again after the efforts of Kyle Abbott (6-20) gave the hosts a first-innings lead of 178. The visitors' total was the second-lowest in the Championship this season.
Second time around, Dan Lawrence (78 not out) and Ravi Bopara (52 not out) added 127 together as Essex reached 208-3 at the close, leading by 30.
Hampshire began the penultimate round of fixtures fourth in Division One and only 12 points above the relegation zone, although any fears of them dropping into the second tier are likely to disappear if they can inflict a first loss of the season on Essex.
South African pace bowler Abbott reached 50 Championship wickets this season with his two scalps late on day one and he added four more to his tally on the second morning, including Simon Harmer and Neil Wagner, both trapped lbw in successive balls.
By then Essex had avoided the potential ignominy of posting the lowest total in this season's competition, passing Gloucestershire's 61 all out against Kent at Canterbury in April.
Relegation-threatened Yorkshire just missed out on a third batting bonus point, but still gained a first-innings lead over Warwickshire at Headingley.
The Tykes, who began the game one point clear of the bottom two, looked in further bother when, despite Adam Lyth's 62, they slumped to 179-6.
But Tim Bresnan (47) and Matthew Fisher (37) helped them reach 296 - a lead of 77 over the already relegated Warwickshire.
The visitors then closed on 49-1, with debutant Liam Banks unbeaten on 22.
Lancashire seamer Tom Bailey claimed match-figures of 10-98 as the Red Rose county were left a target of 221 to beat relegation-threatened Middlesex.
On a second day which saw 16 wickets fall at Lord's, the visitors lost their lower order quickly to be bowled out for 165 in their first innings. But Bailey's second-innings' 5-44 helped skittle Middlesex for 152 with only Sam Robson (58) resisting.
Lancashire reached 46-1 at stumps, needing another 175 for victory.
Middlesex will be without England paceman Toby Roland-Jones for the rest of the game after he pulled up with a back injury on Tuesday. But their first-innings score of 233 remains the highest in the match and the surface has provided plenty of assistance to the seamers.
Middlesex, the 2016 county champions, started this penultimate round of fixtures in a five-way battle to avoid relegation from Division One and would have been hopeful of setting a bigger target for their opponents.
Northants all-rounder Rory Kleinveldt took a career-best 9-65 to give his side an excellent chance of victory in their game against Nottinghamshire.
In a match Northants need to win to stay in the promotion hunt, Kleinveldt took the remaining five Notts wickets on day two to bowl them out for 151.
Richard Levi then smashed 115 as Northants made 270 in their second innings with Ben Duckett unable to bat.
Set a target of 314 for victory, Notts reached 33-2 at the close of play.
A fine innings of 96 not out from stand-in opener Benny Howell helped Gloucestershire to a solid 161-1 in reply to Glamorgan's 442 all out.
Kiran Carlson, 19, was last out for 191, falling just short of becoming Glamorgan's youngest-ever double-centurion. But Howell made the most of a flat pitch as he moved smoothly within six runs of a career-best score. Bad light halted play at 16:15 BST, cutting 25 overs from the second day.
Graham Clark's unbeaten 73 ensured Durham closed just 25 runs behind Sussex on day two at Chester-le-Street.
Tom Latham (77) and Cameron Steel (73) also hit half-centuries but both fell to seamer Ollie Robinson (4-69) as Sussex took four wickets in the afternoon session. Clarke and Carse were unbeaten when bad light stopped play with Durham 321-6.

Saying sorry maybe a selfish act
When you cancel or reject plans with someone, saying "sorry" is the proper thing to do.
Your reasons maybe valid or maybe you didn't want to follow through. However, the polite thing to do is to apologise.
But a new study has found that saying those two little words can make a person feel worse and rejected, even though you feel better in the process, the Daily Mail reported.
The rejected individual feels obligated to forgive even if their feelings are do not match, according to researchers at Dartmouth College.
The goal of the study was to determine how a person reacted to being rejected.
1000 participants had to find different ways to reject a person named 'Taylor'. The team then requested volunteers to evaluate how hurtful each response was.
The results showed 39% of volunteers stated they were sorry when they rejected an invitation, which increased feelings of hurt. Scenarios like lunch particularly made volunteers feel worse. In a second experiment, the team wanted to understand whether feeling rejected would make one seek revenge. 135 participants met face-to-face after they had been rejected by a volunteer.
"We know that people often don't want to admit that they have hurt feelings, so in some of the studies, we looked at how much people wanted to seek revenge," study's lead author Dr. Gili Freedman told Daily Mail. "As predicted, rejections that contained the words 'I'm sorry' led to worse outcomes than rejections without apologies; participants allocated more hot sauce."
Even though an apology may have good intentions, researchers believe it could also be a selfish act, the report revealed. "It is possible that rejectors may feel better about themselves if they apologise," Dr. Freedman told the Daily Mail.

SBI Japan to acquire 20% of Wealth Trust Securities
SBI Holdings, Inc. based in Tokyo and provide investment products, primarily Sri Lankan bonds, through its subsidiary, SBI SECURITIES to the Japanese Market plans to acquire 20% of Wealth Trust Securities(WTS) .
WTS is a licensed primary dealer in government securities appointed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, with direct access to both the primary and secondary government securities markets, and has the ability to participate in the issuance of local and foreign currency-denominated bonds.

WTS possesses a broad customer network that has been built through long-standing operation as well as an exemplary research department which publishes market reports in the leading newspapers in addition to providing its customers with in-depth and prudent market analysis.
The SBI Group intends to collaborate with WTS to promote Sri Lankan government securities and corporate debt as high yield investment instruments to Japanese investors through SBI SECURITIES.
The Sri Lankan Bond market is showing aggressive growth from its relatively small scale which heralds an optimum time for SBI to enter the market.

Second heart transplant abandoned
consultants tug-o-war in kandy hospital:
The second heart transplant planned at the Kandy General Hospital was abandoned at the last minute yesterday due to a tug-o-war between consultants not to remove the beneficiarys heart. This situation has arisen even after the heart was harvested from the donor and fixed to a machine pending the transplant.
The consultant surgeons who were prepared to perform the surgery were inconvenienced after the anastheticians declined to take up the responsibility in the event of removing the receivers heart. This situation arose even after the heart was harvested from the donor and attached to a machine.
The donors heart was removed from a youth who was declared brain dead.As the doctors gave up the procedure the donor heart which was fixed to a machine stopped beating
A body of a youth who was declared brain dead, had been brought from the Intensive Care Unit of Polonnaruwa General Hospital under the close supervision of a group of consultants on Tuesday night for the heart transplant. This youth who sustained serious injuries following an accident was later declared brain dead by the doctors and his relatives agreed to donate his organs to suitable beneficiaries.
The relatives of the beneficiary said that their patients were not given food and she was fully prepared for the surgery during the past few days.They said that three anaestheticians have not given consent to perform the surgery at the last minute. Consultant anaesthetician of the hospital Jagathi Perera said that he was not aware of this surgery I was told by the Hospital Director over the phone to apprise all anaestheticians about this surgery.Then only I came to know that a heart transplant is to be carried out in the hospital again," she said.
The life of the beneficiary whose heart function dropped to 10 per cent is in danger due to this situation. However the doctors at the hospital succeeded in transplanting kidneys, and a spleen to three patients.

Should monopoly and cartelisation  in the shipping industry be allowed
Sri Lanka has a long history in shipping and has been the centre of trade in the Indian Ocean.
"It is a very well-known fact in the trade that few shipping agency houses are benefitting by having many shipping agencies with them", an exporter said.
In order to prevent cartelization, anti-competitive behaviour and monopoly happening within the trade it would be wise for the government to look into the matter urgently.
The monopoly behaviour of such a shipping agency houses would be dangerous to the Government of Sri Lanka as it can control the freight rates and pressurise the Sri Lanka Port Authority to reduce tariff rates in order to benefit their interest.
They would also be in a position to dictate freight rates to the exporters of Sri Lanka and prevent competitive behavior.
Cartelisation and anti-competitive behaviour is already seen in the industry Cartelisation are disadvantages to the Sri Lankan exporter as they do not enjoy the best possible and competitive freight rates in the industry for their exports and exporters would agree that the need for competition is vital.
It also would be the fact that for example if these shipping agency houses have a certain stake in any private bank, there wont be anyone stopping them from dictating to the exporter to open up Letter of Credits from that bank therefore bringing in foreign exchange to that bank only and not having an even spread in the banking sector for foreign currency distribution.
The Sri Lankan exporter should be safe guarded by this practice which is currently happening in the trade.
The need for an anti-competitive Council or regulatory authority to monitor monopoly behaviour in Shipping is a must in order to see this industry to not fall into the hands of individuals or companies with hidden agendas.
Competitive behaviour and fair practice of shipping activities in the industry will benefit the Sri Lankan exporter to obtain competitive and fair freight rates for them and create competition among all shipping lines in order to secure cargo for their individual shipping company.
As Sri Lankas economy is centralised on exports competition is vital to see that the industry improves without competition and fair practice by certain individuals and companies will have devastating effect on Sri Lanka and its economy.
It would be wise for the Government of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Shipping together with Director Merchant Shipping and Sri Lanka Port Authority to take up this matter and fully regulate the monopoly and cartelization behaviour of these few shipping agency houses, by having a balance of the trade.
Regulation could be brought into limit one main-line (Container/Car Carrier), Regional Line and one feeder operator with anyone individual or company and preventing anti-competitive and monopoly behaviour.
This also promotes a balance in the shipping trade which will prevent one individual or company trying to use their position as a monopoly to influence the trade.
It is also the question that if FMC (Federal Maritime Commission) of USA, anti-competitive authority in the European Union, Monopoly and Competition councils and authorities around the world are monitoring this situation elsewhere in this trade, why is this fact not taken up in Sri Lanka

Snow leopards exit extinction
I was thrilled to learn that for the first time since the Equator Prize was launched by the United Nations Equator Initiative in 2002, an NGO from Pakistan has won the prestigious award for this year.
Every two years, the Equator Prize showcases from around the world community efforts that strive to relieve poverty through conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity.
The Baltistan Wildlife Conservation and Development Organization(BWCDO) is amongst the 15 organisations from across the world that will be awarded the 2017 Equator Prize.
BWCDO is working on the ground in 17 villages in Baltistan to protect endangered snow leopards through insurance schemes and financial compensation against livestock losses that result from snow leopard attacks.
They will receive their individual $10,000 award money in a high-profile ceremony to be held in New York on September 17 after a week-long summit during the 72nd United Nations General Assembly.
Before he left for New York, I spoke to Ghulam Mohammad, the General Manger of BWCDO. Our NGO started working back in 1999 in Skardu with the local villagers on snow leopard conservation, he told me.
He credits Dr Shafqat Hussain, Associate Professor of Anthropology at Trinity College in Connecticut, US for establishing Project Snow Leopard in 1999 which successfully introduced a community-based livestock insurance scheme in one village in Baltistan.
That scheme later spread to 17 other villages in the region and in recognition for which, Dr Hussain also received the Rolex award for the environment in 2006.
He is the one who decided to give incentives to the local farmers to save the snow leopards who attacked their livestock, Mohammad said.
Since 2007, Project Snow Leopard has been incorporated into BWCDO and Dr Hussain continues to serve as the chairman of the board of directors of the organisation.
In this mountainous region, local farmers have a meager annual income of around $500 on average. Therefore, an attack by a snow leopard on a farmers livestock threatens the entire familys livelihood (a snow leopard can kill up to 20 or 30 goats at a time).
In the past, farmers killed snow leopards after their herds were attacked. Now, damages are paid after verification through joint decisions between BWCDO and the Village Insurance Committees established for this purpose. Now, when a farmer loses livestock, he informs the Village Insurance Committee and BWCDO. This needs to be done within five days of the attack so that it is possible to visit and verify the claim.
The committee members then inspect the place where the livestock was killed to verify whether it was a snow leopard or a wolf attack. They look for any pugmarks and wounds on the dead animals  for example wolves usually eat from the stomach of their prey, whereas snow leopards attack the neck.
Once a claim has been verified by the committee, they inform BWCDO. Payment is made to the farmer by cheque. These payments are made from funds that have been collected from farmers premium payments and from BWCDO donations (25% from farmers and 75% from donations).
The actual predation rate is about 2% of the total herd. This means that 2% of the total value of the herd needs to be raised through insurance premium to cover the risk.
Since the farmers are too poor to cover the entire risk from their own premium payments, BWCDO subsidises the premium payments to the tune of 50-80%.
Therefore, if the total worth of 10 goats is Rs 100,000 (that is, on average Rs 10,000 per goat) and the total loss rate is 2%, it means that ideally the villagers should generate Rs 2,000 from their premium.
This means that each goats premium is Rs 200. But BWCDO subsidises this and farmers end up paying only Rs 50-100 per goat. The Village Insurance Committee collects the premium payment from the farmers once a year.
BWCDO has further helped farmers by assisting them in making around 50 predator-proof corals (solid constructions of stone and wood which create a periphery around lifestock) and providing them training on improved herding techniques and livestock vaccination. They have also helped them construct water pipes, pony tracks and protective walls.
These are small interventions but in these tough areas where we work so hard in the short summer seasons, they have proven to be very beneficial to the communities, Mohammad said.
The communities living in these remote mountains are poor and BWCDO supports them with these important infrastructural projects as an incentive, and to encourage them to support their conservation goals.
Helping the villagers reduces the burden of losing livestock to snow leopards and makes them more willing to coexist with the animal.
BWCDOs work has certainly won over the trust of the communities and created economic incentives for farmers not to harm the snow leopards.
The elusive snow leopard is an iconic species of this region (Central and South Asia) and prefers to live atop mountain forests and high altitude pastures.
Conservationists say snow leopards have been threatened by poaching, retaliatory killing by farmers, declining prey species, shrinking habitats, and climate change.
According to Mohammad, there are only around 300 to 400 snow leopards surviving in Pakistan today. Dr Hussain, who has been studying snow leopards for almost two decades now, says that although more research is needed, it seems that the snow leopard population in Pakistan has been stable over the past 15 years.
We have now a pretty good idea about how the snow leopard population is doing in Pakistan, thanks to advanced technology such as camera trapping and genetic tests on faeces left by snow leopards.
I would say that 80% of these snow leopards in Pakistan are to be found in Gilgit-Baltistan  which means that about 80% of the snow leopards in Pakistan are found here  while the remaining are in Khyber Pakhtunkwa and Azad Jammu & Kashmir, pointed out Mohammad.
Experts say the habitat range for snow leopards extends over nearly two million square kilometres, involving 12 countries in Central and northern Asia, including Pakistan.
Last month, scientists and leaders from the 12 countries who host snow leopard population gathered for the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Programme (GSLEP) at the Snow Leopard Forum in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan to address conservation challenges.
According to Dr Tom McCarthy, the Snow Leopard Programme Director for Panthera, the global wildcat conservation organisation, "Experts from each country within the range were asked to come up with the best estimates of snow leopard population by country and the total was between 7,400 and 8,000 animals. This figure is higher than what was previously thought.
Pakistans newly-appointed minister for climate change, Mushaidullah Khan, also attended the meeting. The minister is currently the chair of GSLEPs steering committee.
According to the global protection programme, 20 landscapes of snow leopards shall be protected by the year 2020. Pakistan is included in these landscapes.
BWCDOs work at the grassroots level is an excellent example of how partnering with local communities can lead to feasible solutions to preserve wildlife and local livelihoods, which in turn can protect landscapes.
It really is a big honour for us to win the Equator Prize. Our confidence has grown tremendously, Mohammad told me. There were over 800 applications from 120 countries around the world and only 15 were chosen in the end. The recognition of our work is a remarkable feat.

Sri Lankan apparel makers seek concessions to import labour

Sri Lankas Deputy Minister for National Policies and Economic Affairs Harsha de Silva recently said the nations apparel industry is seeking government concessions to import labour from regional economies, such as Nepal and Bangladesh, to tackle shortage of skilled labour.
Thousands of jobs are vacant in the apparel sector in the industrial zones, he said.
 The Deputy Minister, however, expressed doubts over thesustainabilityof the apparel industry, even if it was allowed to import labour.
Though the sector has served Sri Lanka reasonably well for the past several decades, it will have very limited scope to move forward unless it upgrades itself to the next level by focussing on high-tech and designer apparel, he said. Only a few Sri Lankan companies have invested in such high-end technologies at present.
 Labourers are not keen to take up low-level jobs in the apparel industry, the Deputy Minister added.
He was speaking at a seminar on US Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) organised by the Sri Lanka-USA Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
 Some other sectors, such as shipbuilding, construction and plantations, have also shown interest in importing labour due to the same reason, but protectionist elements are resisting such attempts, according to a Sri Lankan English-language daily

## Title: TOWARDS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE

TOWARDS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE
Article 25(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.
Universal healthcare is the means by which this right could be fully ensured. States Parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are obliged to take adequate measures to ensure this goal.
Sri Lanka has achieved considerable successes in healthcare. It has eradicated many diseases including Malaria, filariasis etc. World Health Organization (WHO) has commended Sri Lanka on its successes. But it has no universal healthcare. Though there is free healthcare it does not reach everyone.
In 2014 Sri Lankas health expenditure comprised 56 percent government health expenditure and 44 percent private health expenditure. Out of the private expenditure on health 96 percent was out-of-pocket expenditure. Thus the boast of politicians and bureaucrats about healthcare being totally free is a myth.
Resource mobilization
As regards reaching universal healthcare it is often said that we cannot afford it as we are a poor country. However, no attempt is made to achieve it even in the long term. However, it is a fallacy. Nobel Laureate and renowned economist Amartya Sen says it is an affordable dream. He further says: a number of poor countries have shown, through their pioneering public policies, that basic healthcare for all can be provided at a remarkably good level at very low cost if the society, including the political and intellectual leadership, can get its act together. There are many examples of such success across the world. They include Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Japan et al.
Institute of Policy Studies gives three critical gaps in our healthcare financing, viz., (i) inadequacy of resource mobilization, (ii) allocative inefficiency in the distribution of healthcare provision outcomes amongst the population and (iii) weakness in financial management (Sri Lanka State of the Economy 2016).
Health Master Plan (2006  17) pointed out that total health expenditure should increase when life expectancy at birth increases. Accordingly it should be at least 5.8 percent of the GDP. In 2012 it was 3.1 when the global average stood at 8.6 percent.
Politicians often quote selected absolute statistics and show selected visuals of isolated development projects to hide these deficiencies. It is in such instances that Mark Twains satirical comment There are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies and statistics seems appropriate.
There is much to be desired in countrywide resource allocation  both manpower and material. For example, there is excess allocation in Colombo compared to the peripheries. Often newly acquired machinery and buildings lie idle due to lack of necessary staff.
In its development plans the government should take a more people-friendly strategy aimed at attaining universal healthcare in the short term. In this respect priority to preventive over curative medicine should be the state policy. It is by such a strategy that countries such as Cuba have overcome financial constraints and reached universal quality healthcare.
Public-Private-Partnerships
In its strategy for health sector development the Government seems to give priority to Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs). No mention is made of developing the existing public health care facilities.
It should be stated that the State is responsible for providing total health care of adequate quality to all people. At present around 95 percent of inpatients are served by the public sector while only 45 percent of outpatients are served by the private sector. Hence, it is obligatory to develop this sector if equity in health care is to be maintained and developed.
Contrary to the claims of politicians and officials public perception of the health care system is poor. They complain of shortage of staff, medicines and laboratory facilities as well as in public relations.
Over the years budgetary allocation for healthcare has fallen behind even world average. In 2012 per capita government expenditure on health was US $ 34 while the world average was 615.
The inefficiency in administration and financial management worsens the situation. When millions are pilfered or wasted on worthless ego-building exercises it was found impossible to buy a pet scanner for the only Cancer Hospital in the country. So much for the best health service in the world!
Though PPP is not new to the health sector in Sri Lanka much care should be taken in deciding upon projects since Sri Lankan private sector is unwilling to take risks in unexplored areas and would like to depend on the State for many privileges. In every instance government should evaluate which is more profitable  spending on PPP or developing the State sector.
Incidentally the governments liability is to assist all systems of medicine practiced in the country including Ayurveda and Yanani et al. The goal should be to develop an integrated healthcare system, affordable and accessible to all people irrespective of their financial potential.

Trials behind closed doors
Sir Desmond Lorenz de Silva QC needs hardly an introduction in the legal fraternity. He has earned reputation as a prominent British lawyer, and former United Nations Chief War Crimes Prosecutor in Sierra Leone. Sir Desmond of Sri Lankan and Anglo-Scottish origins was knighted by the Tony Blair government and made a privy councillor by David Cameron when he headed the inquiry into alleged links between the security services and assassinations in Ulster during the Troubles. Sir Desmond also headed the Advisory Panel of International Lawyers advising the Sri Lankan Government on the Geneva UNHRC matter.
Sir Desmonds autobiography titled as Madam Where Are Your Mangoes was launched at the Vijitha Yapa bookshop at the Crescat Boulevard recently. The book is available at any Vijitha Yapa Bookshop.
He was born in Ceylon during World War II, and went on to become a distinguished and high-profile jury advocate. The memoir stands alone as an authoritative account which provides access to extraordinary cases, covering over half a century of practice in the courts of England, the Commonwealth. It is also a revealing portrait of Britains post-war social, political and cultural landscape and a testament to the unparalleled importance of the rule of law in society. De Silvas own reminiscences are complemented by a series of stories relating to his most colourful cases by the Evening Standards veteran court correspondent Paul Cheston. The book was released officially in London on September 20.
The books title refers to a misunderstanding by one of the QCs colleagues when the hotel they thought they were staying in during a trial in Sierra Leone turned out to be a brothel.
Published by Quartet Books, the autobiography describes how he teased the Pope in the Vatican and innocently asked Lord Archer in an Old Bailey lift whether the author, on trial for perjury, was going down.

Wants FM to summon Myanmar Ambassador, hold debate
Muslim Congress raises concern for Rohingya people:
The Muslim Congress of Sri Lanka (SLMC) yesterday called on Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana to summon the Myanmar Ambassador in Colombo to share their concerns with the Government of Myanmar, urging an immediate end to violence against the Rohingya people, in the interest of peace and stability in the region.
SLMC leader in a letter to Foreign Affairs Minister requested for a debate or session in Parliament, suo moto, to explain the position of Sri Lanka.
The full letter:
Not a single day passes without the international media as well as the human rights community reporting on the crimes being committed against the people of the Rakhine Province of Myanmar.
The unfortunate plight of the Rohingya people has been staring squarely in the face of humanity for a few years now, with his intensity at unprecedented levels in the last few weeks.
When crimes against humanity are perpetrated against a people on the grounds of race, religion, language, or ethnicity, or on any other grounds, which appear repugnant to human conscience, it is our collective duty to do all that within our power to help bring an immediate end to it, ensure amelioration of eh conditions of persecuted people, and to work with partners in the region and the world to facilitate their peaceful living including return and resettlement in safety and dignity, with guarantees of protection and non recurrence in the future. It is our strong belief that Sri Lanka, under the National Unity Government, is in a position to demonstrate initiative and or leadership in ensuring such a positive outcome through peaceful means.
We would like to propose in this context that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs:
Summon the Ambassador of Myanmar based in Colombo to share our concerns with the Government of Myanmar, urging an immediate end to violence against the Rohingya people, in the interest of peace and stability in the region.
Offer relief and rehabilitation assistance to the affected people through international agencies;
Issue a public statement demonstrating its clear interest in addressing the situation faced by the Rohingya people and ensuring the situation faced by the Rohingya people and ensuring peace and stability in the region;
Call a debate or session in Parliament, suo moto, to explain the position of the Government of Sri Lanka urging for non-violence and peace building in the Rakhine Province of Myanmar.
In our well considered view, the Government of Sri Lanka is well-placed to undertake all of the above measures as a country progressing on the path of reconciliation, non-recurrence and peace building, an committed to the pursuit of peace and stability in the region which remains critical to the realization of is vision of a harmonious, inclusive, sustainable Indian Ocean, as part of its Vision 2025.
We would encourage the Government of Sri Lanka, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to initiate the above measures and demonstrate commitment and leadership at the earliest.

Yadav hat-trick gives  India big win in 2nd ODI
Kolkata: Kuldeep Yadav's maiden hat-trick and a fluent 92 by Virat Kohli helped India cruise to a 50-run win over Australia in the second one-day international in Kolkata on Thursday.
Yadav once again combined with fellow wrist spinner Yuzvendra Chahal to dismiss the visitors for 202 in 43.1 overs while chasing 253 and earn India a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.
Pace spearhead Bhuvneshwar Kumar struck early after removing the two Australian openers including David Warner for one in an inspired first spell that lasted six overs.
Skipper Steve Smith, who made 59, and Travis Head then forged a 76-run partnership as the duo tried to steady the innings by counter attacking the Indian bowlers.
But the introduction of spin once again proved troublesome for the visitors with leg-spinner Chahal sending back Head, for 39, and then the big-hitting Glenn Maxwell, for 14.
Maxwell, who looked threatening with two sixes during his brief stay, was stumped by wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni who was quick to clip the bails off.
Smith though carried on the good work to register a gritty 50 in his 100th ODI but the delight was short lived after he fell to paceman Hardik Pandya. Yadav, plying just his ninth ODI, then turned on the heat with his triple strike in the 33rd over that spelt doom for the visitors.
He got Matthew Wade, Ashton Agar and Pat Cummins to become only the third Indian after Chetan Sharma and Kapil Dev to ever record an ODI hat-trick.
Marcus Stoinis remained unbeaten on 62, but his valiant knock came too late in the day as Kumar wiped up the tail.
Earlier a fine batting effort by Kohli made India post 252 all out in 50 overs after the hosts elected to bat first at Eden Gardens.
India depended on a 102-run second-wicket stand between Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane, who made 55, to start strongly before the Australian bowlers struck back.
Fast bowlers Nathan Coulter-Nile and Kane Richardson claimed three wickets each. There was also a bit of drama in the 48th over of the Indian innings when Pandya was caught off a no-ball, but Smith ran him out only to see the batsman walking off the ground following a slight drizzle.
Smith and company tried to argue with the on-field umpires for their run out call but in vain.
The third match is scheduled for Sunday in Indore. AFP

ZIM steams back to profit
Israeli shipping company ZIM posted a sharp improvement in its business results for the first quarter of 2015 recording a non-GAAP net profit of USD 35 million, compared to a USD 4 million loss in the last quarter and a USD 53 million loss in the parallel quarter in 2014.
The operating cash flow in Q1 2015 amounted to USD 54 million compared to a USD 23 million in the parallel quarter of last year, ZIM said.
The continuing improvement of our business results stems directly from the comprehensive initiatives the company advances, implementation of the business plan which focuses on opening new lines in profitable trade areas and seizing business opportunities, as well as improves operational efficiency, enhancing customer relations and the sharp reduction in fuel prices.
At the same time we see the continued stagnation of the global economy and the volatile fuel prices, and we are taking steps to face these challenges, said ZIM President and CEO Rafi Danieli.
ZIM introduced additional sailings from Asia to US East Coast and announced the inauguration of a new line, the ZIM Seven Star Express (Z7S), connecting South China, South East Asia and the Indian sub-continent with the US East Coast via the Suez Canal and back.
The Z7S, with one of the best transit times between South China, Vietnam, Singapore and Colombo, will be operated exclusively by ZIM, and will deploy 10X5,000/6,500 TEU vessels, the company said.
The company carried 560,000 TEU containers in Q1 2015, reflecting a 0.5% decrease compared with the previous quarter and 8% decrease compared with the same quarter in 2014.
ZIM said that most of the decrease was a result of terminating the service from Asia to Northern Europe and withdrawing from trades which are not part of the companys business focus. As a result of the reduced volume of containers carried, the total revenues in Q1 2015 were USD 792 million, compared to USD 813 million in the previous quarter and USD 867 million in the same quarter of last year.
The average freight rate per TEU amounted to USD 1,251, no change from the previous quarter and an increase of 3% compared to the same quarter of last year.
