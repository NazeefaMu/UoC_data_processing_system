Singer Under 19 Division 1 first round-match roundup
Lasith shines in Maris Stellas triumph
Lasith Croospulle, one of the all-rounders who performed creditably during the last school-season at U19 level for De Mazenod, making yet another useful all-round contribution helped his new school Maris Stella collect first-innings points over St.Joseph Vaz, Wennappuwa in one of the Group D matches of Singer U19 D1 Tournament 2016/17 concluded on Tuesday at Katuneriya-Sebastians ground.
Put into bat, Joseph Vaz scored a modest 172 with Dananjaya Perera (48) and Anjana Rukmal (43) making top contributions with the bat before Lasith Croospulle-led batting helped Maris Stella gain a healthy first-innings lead of 70 in their reply. Joseph Vaz in their second innings batted more confidently to reach 205 for eight at close on the back of two good scores from first innings top scorer Dananjaya Perera who made 94 in his second effort and a useful 65 from Madushan Ranatunga. Lasith Croospulle following his 67 with the bat collected a match-bag of seven wickets to finish with a good all-round performance for Maris-Stella.
St. Jospeh Vaz College, Wennappuwa: 172 in 59.3 overs (Dananjaya Perera 48, Anjana Rukmal 43, Madushan Ranathunga 26, Lasith Croosepulle 3/28, Sachindu Kolamabage 2/14, Sanka Poorna 2/16) & 205/8 in 65 overs (Dananjaya Perera 94, Madushan Ranatunga 65, Lasith Croosepulle 4/67, Pasindu Madawa 4/60)  (8.27 points)
Maris Stella College, Negombo: 242 in 67.5 overs (Lasith Croosepulle 67, Kevin Perera 47*, Sadeesha Perera 48, Ashan Fernando 25, Madushan Ranathunga 3/47, Dananjaya Perera 2/42, Kanishka Nanayakkara 2/53)  (13.92 points)
Harin and batsmen carrySt. Aloysius to top of group C
St.Aloysius College, Galle further strengthening their position in Group C surged to their second innings-victory within their group beating Moratu Vidyalaya by an innings and 40 runs on Thursday. It was their second comprehensive win after they beat Gurukula by an innings and 34 runs in their opening group game this season. After a tremendous batting display, with four of their top order making fifty-plus scores, a dominant bowling effort by Harin Weerasinghe with a 10-wicket match-bag helped Aloysius become a team to be reckoned with in their group collecting a good 46.23 points from just two matches out of eight fixed within their group. Nishantha Madhushka scoring a solid 76 helped Moratu make a reasonable 163 in their first innings, but their woeful batting in the second innings cost them the match by a wider margin.
Moratu Vidyalaya: 163 in 72.5 overs (Nishan Madhushka 76, Isuru Udayanga 24, Harin Weerasinghe 4/48, Kavishka Dilshan 3/35) & 80 in 32.3 overs (Harin Surasinghe 6/21) - (3.43 points)
St. Aloysius College, Galle: 283/4 dec. in 58 overs (Ashen Bandara 67, Gimhana Ashirwada 65, Navindu Nirmal 59*, Niluksha Dulmina 53, Hareen Weerasinghe 30*) - (22.33 points)
Ushan and Nadeeshan bowlDharmasoka to a nine-wicket win
Ushan Nimantha and Kavindu Nadeeshan accounting for 13 of the 20 wickets to fall in Gurukulas two innings at a cost of just 97 runs made the task of their batsmen easy as Dharmasoka chasing just 31 runs to win the match outright got home in just under five overs to win the match by 9 wickets collecting useful 20.68 points. Ambalangoda schools Ravindu Roshantha (71) and Kasun Madhuranga (43) batting with a tremendous composure extended a great support to their bowlers in achieving this morale-boosting victory. Though Gurukula lost this match, the single-handed effort of Udara Ravindu with the bat was the most promising batting effort in this match as Udara missed out on centuries in both innings by just 5 and 14 runs and he was very unfortunate as he could turn neither of his efforts into a century which would have been thoroughly deserving . Gurukulas fate in this match would have been a different one had another batsman of Udras caliber been in Gurukula lineup to support him.
Gurukula College: 180 in 58.2 overs (Udara Ravindu 95, Asintha Malshan 21, Kavindu Nadeeshan 3/13, Ushan Imantha 2/13) & 135 in 47.1 overs (Udara Ravindu 86, Ushan Nimantha 5/43, Kavindu Nadeeshan 3/28) - (5.9 points)
Dharmasoka College: 285 in 65.5 overs ( Ravindu Roshantha 71, Kasun Madhuranga 43, Kaveesh Kumara 24, Subash Lasanga 39*, Sachintha Chamith 4/92, Pruthivi Roosara 35/2) & 33/1 in 4.1 overs (Kaveesh Kumara 21) - (20.68 points)
Debian Buyzers ton gainsfirst-innings pointsfor St.Sebastians
Last years one of the joint-champions of U19 D1 Tournament, St.Sebastians College, Moratuwa scoring an imposing 340 with the help of Debian D Buyzers entertaining 129 collected vital first-innings points in their group match against Richmond College, another key-team in this tournament, after their bowlers led by Tharusha Fernando and Praveen Jayawickrama reduced Richmonds first innings to 220 in which Dhananjaya Lakshan and Kamindu Mendis made the bulk of scoring. However, Richmond following on with a first innings deficit of 120 came back strongly to amass 262 for seven thanks to Kamindu Mendiss match-saving century and force a draw in the end.
St Sebastian College, Moratuwa: 340 in 60.1 overs (Debian D Buyzer 129, Tharusha Fernando 83, Nuwanidu Fernando 31, Sandun Mendis 3/117, Thaveesha Abhishek 2/28)  (15.15 points)

Two tons by Sahan Suraweeraand Sammu Ashan pilotAnanda to an innings-win
Sahan Suraweeras 118 and Sammu Ashans 106 pushed Ananda to a huge 377 for four in just under 61 overs after Ananda won the toss and took the first lease on a typical batting track at Wesley ground before Ananda bowlers, Sammu Ashan and Dileepa Jayalath sharing 17 of 20 wickets to fall in Wesleys two innings bowled Ananda to a three-innings win as runs accumulated by Wesley in their two innings were not sufficient to make Ananda bat for the second time.
Ananda College: 377/4 dec. in 60.5 overs (Sahan Suraweera 118, Sammu Ashan 106, Dushan Hettige 89, Asel Sigera 51*, Kavinda Dissanayake 2/107)  (24.77 points)
Wesley College: 153 in 32.3 overs (Sakunthaka Liyanage 52, Shamod Athulathmudali 33, Thilina Perera 20, Thisuraka Akmeemana 25, Sammu Ashan 5/66, Dileepa Jayalath 3/28) & F/O 214 in 65.2 overs (Thisuraka Akmeemana 45, Helitha Bambarenda 48, Movin Subasinghe 51, Sammu Ashan 3/78, Dileepa Jayalath 6/86)  (4.67 points)
Trinity crush Dharmaraja by an innings
A run-feast by Trinitians amassing 422 for six in just 72 overs with Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth and Hasitha Boyagoda both scoring centuries made things difficult for Dharamaraja when Trinity recorded a huge innings and 118-run victory over their town-mate in one of the U19 D1 group A matches ended at Asgiriya on Saturday. After batsmens heroic act, Trinity bowlers led by Thisaru Dilshan capturing an 8 for 31 in Dharmarajas first innings restricted Dharmaraja to a paltry 90 in the first innings and a stubborn 214 in the second to win the match with ease collecting as many as 25.22 points.
Trinity College, Kandy: 422/6 in 72 overs (Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth 136, Hasitha Boyagoda 109, S Percivel 51*, Niwantha Herath 4/66)  (25.22 points)
Dharmaraja College, Kandy: 90 in 29.5 overs (Niwantha Herath 30, Thisaru Dilshan 8/31) & F/O 214 in 65.4 overs (Deshan Gunasinghe 70, Udantha Amarakoon 47, Gihan Vitharana 33, Mohammed Shuib 3/21, Thisaru Dilshan 2/23, Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth 2/29)  (4.54 points)
Shashikas ton highlight ofDSS 9-wicket triumph
DS Senanayaka recording a comprehensive win in their opening Group-fixture whilst inflicting Anuradhapura their second outright defeat collected useful 20.96 points when they handed Anuradhapura a nine-wicket defeat in one of the U19 D1 Group C fixtures concluded on Friday at DCA ground, Anuradhapura. After Shashika Gamage with an unbeaten 137 and Vihan Gunasekara a brisk 51 set the tone for DSSs early dominance with a first innings score of 306 for six in just 52 overs, DSS bowlers led by Muditha Lakshan did the rest forcing Anuradhapura to follow on with a first innings deficit of 172. However, Anuradhapura batsmen in a well improved batting performance after following on scored 209 with Sandaru Madhushan top scoring with 78 to make DSS bat again. DSS needing just 39 to win romped home with nine wickets to spare.
DS Senanayke College, Colombo: 306/6 dec. in 52 overs (Sashika Gamage 137*, Vihan Gunasekara 51, Shehzad Ameen 46, Dasun Himasha 25, Muditha Lakshan 24, Maduranga Sri Chandrarathna 2/108) & 40/1 in 5 overs  (20.96 points)

Charana bowls St.Josephs out for 23, seasons second lowest total
St. Josephs rebounding in an amazing fashion after they were bowled-out for this seasons second lowest total of 23, scored 315 for nine in their second innings as Dineth Madurawala finishing with an unbeaten 144 deprived Thurstan of an easy outright chance. It was Thurstans Charana Nanayakkara who finished with a match bag of 11 wickets destroyed Josephs first innings picking up eight wickets of Josephs first innings for a mere 11 runs whilst Jehan Daniel completing a five-for did well with the ball for St.Josephs. Thurstan winning first innings points collected a total of 15.02 points
St Joseph College: 23 in 13.5 overs (Charana Nanayakkara 8/15) & 315/9 in 120 overs (Dineth Madurawala 144*, Shewon Fonseka 44, Pahan Perera 42, Jehan Daniel 21, Sandaru Dias 4/51, Charana Nanayakkara 3/76)  (8.88 points)

A dominant bowling effort by Deshan Fernando and Roshitha Senevirathne sharing all 10 wickets between them at 5 apiece followed by Krishan Sanjulas blistering 253, seemingly the highest individual score this season steered De Mazenod to a first-innings win over Maliyadewa in one of the U19 D1 group D matches that ended in a tame draw at De Mazenod ground on Friday. Dananjaya Premarathnas half century and Damitha Silvas all-round effort including a five-for with the ball all were over shadowed by the bowler-roasting 253 of Krishan Sanjula.
Maliyadewa College: 167 in 41.3 overs (Dananjaya Premarathne 51, Damitha Silva 27, Supun Sumanarathne 26, Deshan Fernando 5/39, Roshitha senevirathne 5/42) & 210/8 in 70 overs (Dulaj Ranathunga 47, Dilshan Kollure 28, Pavithra Liyanage 26*, Damitha Silva 24)  (8.77 points)
De Mazenod College: 322 in 77 overs (Krishan Sanjula 253, Damitha Silva 5/92, Dilshan Kollure 2/17 )  (16.72 points)

Radwanska, Murray bag China Open titles
Beijing: Agnieszka Radwanska beat Johanna Konta in straight sets to take the title at the China Open in a chilly Beijing Sunday, denying the Briton her biggest career crown.
The third-ranked Pole -- who cruised through the tournament without dropping a set -- sealed her second title in Beijing with an ace for a 6-4, 6-2 win.
The victory was Radwanska's 20th career crown but there was more on the line for Konta, 25, who was making a bid in the Chinese capital for what would have been her second and biggest title.
Despite the loss, by reaching the Beijing final Konta has amassed enough points to break into the top 10 -- the first British woman to do so since Jo Durie in 1984.
When the new leaderboards are released Monday it will be the first time since computerised rankings were introduced that a British man (Andy Murray) and woman are ranked in the top 10 at the same time. Konta, usually a solid baseliner, repeatedly pushed to the net as she tried to shift the match momentum in her favour, but it was a risky strategy that cost her 29 unforced errors.
"Against a player like Agnieszka, who is basically a human wall, you definitely do try to look to get the upper hand in any way possible. I felt I was going to try on that avenue," Konta told reporters after the match.
After dropping her serve twice in each set, Konta made a bid to even the scoreline in the second, pushing Radwanska to two break points in the sixth game.
But the Pole -- nicknamed 'The Magician' for her ability to conjure up shots -- shot a forehand down the line to save her service game.
"Whenever I felt I could have got a little bit of a foothold in the match, she took it away from me," Konta said.
Konta held her next service game with a forehand dropshot which Radwanska redirected wide.
But the world number three then served for the title, firing her only ace of the match straight down the line for her third Premier Mandatory title, one rung down from a Grand Slam.
"I think that was a perfect timing," Radwanska said of the ace.
"I was thinking about that serve, where I should go. I just changed my mind when I was tossing the ball. So another good choice."
It was the second time the pair have met after Radwanska beat the Briton in a two-hour, three-set battle in Cincinnati in August.
Murray downs Dimitrov in easy straight sets
Andy Murray of Britain hits a return against Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria during the men's singles final at the China Open tennis tournament in Beijing on Sunday. AFP
Beijing: Andy Murray beat Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets to win the China Open on Sunday as he closes in on Novak Djokovic's number one ranking.
The world number two did not drop a set as he romped through the tournament to claim his fifth title of the year and 40th of his career with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) win.
The victory moves Murray 1,000 points closer to long-reigning world number one Djokovic, with the chance of taking the top spot by year-end. Murray broke Dimitrov's serve in the opening game of the match, putting the 15th-ranked Bulgarian on the defensive and pushing him to make 21 unforced errors in the opening set.
In the second set, both held their serve through the first four games until Murray broke Dimitrov at 3-2.
It looked like the Scot would serve for the championship but the unseeded Bulgarian won the next 11 points, breaking Murray to love.
Pushed to a tiebreak, the Scot immediately seized back control, taking the first point of the decider on Dimitrov's serve.
Murray stormed through the tiebreak, dropping just two points to claim his first title in the Chinese capital.

Kohli, Rahane lead Indias dominance against NZ
Indore: Skipper Virat Kohli recorded his second double-century in Tests as he and Ajinkya Rahane helped India post a crushing 557 for five declared against New Zealand at Indore on Sunday.
The visitors were 28 without loss at stumps on day two of the third and final Test, with Martin Guptill on 17 and Tom Latham on 6, trailing by 529.
The hosts, who started the day on 267 for three, rode on the 365-run fourth-wicket partnership between Kohli (211) and Rahane (188) to flatten the New Zealand bowling.
Kohli, who scored his maiden 200 against the West Indies in July, registered his career-best Test score Sunday with a dominating display. The batsman, who resumed the day on 103 in his 48th Test, scored runs all around the park with 20 boundaries during his 366-ball stay at the crease.
Overnight partner Rahane was also in blazing form, also posting a career-best score in his 29th match after completing his eighth Test century.
Rahane had to face a barrage of bouncers in the morning session from the New Zealand quicks, with one of the short-pitched deliveries from Matt Henry hitting his helmet.
But the incident only seemed to strengthen his resolve and his marathon knock included 18 fours and four sixes.
The partnership was India's best for the fourth wicket, surpassing the 353-run stand between Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman against Australia at Sydney in 2004.Off-spinner Jeetan Patel finally broke it by trapping a tired Kohli lbw as he tried to whip away the turning ball but missed the line completely.
Kohli, 27, the only Indian captain to score two double hundreds, was given a standing ovation by the capacity crowd at Indore's Holkar Stadium, which is hosting its first Test match.
Rahane continued to frustrate the New Zealand bowlers, but finally ran out of steam and was caught behind off Trent Boult. He was also given a rousing send-off.
Rohit Sharma (51) and Ravindra Jadeja (17) then added some quick runs with an unbeaten 53-run stand for the sixth wicket.
The in-form Sharma, who hit three fours and two sixes during his 63-ball knock, struck his third half-century of the series as India gained firm control of the match.
Jadeja though was guilty of giving away five runs after being penalised by the on-field umpires for running on the pitch while taking his runs.
Jadeja was warned twice by the umpires before the officials took the extreme step of deducting the runs as New Zealand started on five no loss in their reply.
New Zealand bowlers Boult and Patel shared two wickets apiece after the visitors were put in to field by India on Saturday.
India have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series but are looking to complete a whitewash against the tourists. AFP

Australia fall to South Africas back-up bowlers
Port Elizabeth: South Africa rested three of their frontline bowlers but continued to dominate Australia as they won the fourth one-day international by six wickets at St George's Park on Sunday.
Kyle Abbott led what was effectively South Africa's back-up bowling attack as Australia were bowled out for 167, the lowest total of the series.
South African captain Faf du Plessis made 69 as South Africa secured their fourth successive win with 14.3 overs to spare.
It left Australian captain Steve Smith having to contemplate the prospect of a 5-0 series defeat going into the final match in Cape Town on Wednesday.
"We don't want a whitewash so well have to turn up and play," he said. Smith said he was disappointed with the batting performance.
"The wicket maybe wasn't as good as the others but 250 was about par."
Having clinched the five-match series by winning the first three games, South Africa rested fast bowlers Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada and leading spin bowler Imran Tahir.
They were replaced by Abbott and spinners Tabraiz Shamsi and Aaron Phangiso. Man of the match Abbott admitted that he felt nervous before the game, having not been part of the first three matches.
But he bowled both Australian opening batsmen inside the first three overs and finished with four for 40. Unorthodox left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi took three for 36 and orthodox left-armer Phangiso picked up the last two wickets at a cost of 17 runs.
On a slow pitch, which offered some seam movement and uneven bounce, Abbott bowled a full length and made the ball deviate in both directions.
He bowled Aaron Finch with the third ball of the match and then bowled David Warner with the first ball of his second over. He struck another crucial blow when he was brought back into the attack and had Mitchell Marsh caught behind for 50, ending a 62-run sixth wicket partnership with Matthew Wade.
George Bailey was leg before wicket to Dwaine Pretorius as Australia slumped to 12 for three.
It became 49 for five when Shamsi deceived Australian captain Steve Smith and Travis Head, trapping them both leg before, in the space of three balls. AFP

Mortaza sinks England as Bangladesh level series
Dhaka: Skipper Mashrafe Mortaza starred with bat and ball as Bangladesh outplayed England by 34 runs in the second one-day international to level the three-match series 1-1 in Dhaka on Sunday.
Mortaza hit 44 off 29 balls after Mahmudullah Riyad top-scored with 75 off 88 balls, leading Bangladesh to 238-8 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.
Mortaza then brought his bowling skill into play, picking up 4-29, including three wickets in his opening spell that left England tottering at 26-3.
England couldnt recover from the position before they were all out for 204 runs in 44.4 overs, despite the best efforts by captain Jos Buttler, who scored the highest 57 runs for the visiting side.
Taskin Ahmed dismissed Buttler leg-before thanks to a television review after his initial appeal was turned down by the on-field umpire. Taskin had earlier removed Jonny Bairstow for 35 to end his 79-run fifth-wicket partnership with Buttler as the duo attempted to revive Englands innings after the initial damage.
Buttler hit Taskin for three of his seven fours in one over before the bowler came back strongly to finish with 3-47.
I think we were a bit tentative about it (the run chase) as a side, said a disappointed Buttler after the match.
We wanted to come out on the front foot and take it on. We thought that was chaseable. We bowled well up front but it was a good wicket and 240 was attainable.
Bangladeshs victory was not ensured until Mortaza came to his third spell and removed Jake Ball (28), who shared 45 runs for the 10th wicket with Adil Rashid (33 not out) to raise the prospect of a dramatic England win.
It wasnt much of a total but we could defend, said Mortaza, who also won the man of the match award.
If you look at the other match, to come back was really professional, he said, referring to the first match when Bangladesh came close to chase down Englands 308-9 before losing their way. Earlier Mahmudullah led Bangladeshs stop-start batting when he came to bat at number four after Chris Woakes struck twice in his opening spell.
Bangladesh were in trouble once Woakes, who finished with 2-40, removed openers Imrul Kayes (11) and Tamim Iqbal (14) in his successive overs to leave the hosts at 26-2.
Ball, man of the match on Friday with five wickets on debut, kept up the pressure when he bowled Sabbir Rahman for three. Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim put on 50 for the fourth wicket to steady the innings before Ball struck again.
Rahim, who made 21, top-edged the paceman to fine leg where Moeen Ali took a superb catch.
Bangladeshs woes were compounded when star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan departed for three after gloving a delivery from Ben Stokes down the leg side to wicketkeeper Buttler. AFP

Fans dream comes true after sight restored
Dacca: Blind from his infancy, 19-year-old Bangladeshi cricket fan Samiul Islam finally had the opportunity to see his favourite team in action on Sunday after his eyesight was restored following an operation funded by a reality TV show.
Hailing from a poor labourers family in northern Sherpur district, 180 kilometres (112 miles) from Dhaka, Islam was brought to Mirpur stadium in the capital to fulfil his dream of watching the Tigers play after his eyesight was successfully restored.
A reality show named Shwapno Dekhe Chokh (Eyes see the dream) funded Islams treatment in cooperation with international charity Sightsavers.
Islam, who lost his eyesight when he was only six months old, said he endured a harsh childhood filled with bullying and neglect due to his blindness.
But despite the disability and hardships, he fostered a love for cricket and listened carefully to the commentary during matches.
I use to listen to commentary on the radio and TV. Whenever there was a big match I would go before the TV set. I could not see the game, but for sure, I could hear the commentary and feel the thrill, Islam said.
When asked by the donors what he wished to see first after his operation, Islam said he would love to watch a Bangladesh cricket match live.
Today my dream came true, he told AFP during the second one-day international between Bangladesh and England.
I could see some of my favourite players like Shakib (Al Hasan) and Tamim (Iqbal) play in front of my eyes. AFP
