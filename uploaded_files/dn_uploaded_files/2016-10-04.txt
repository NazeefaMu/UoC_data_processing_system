Andy Murray keen to depose Novak Djokovic as world number one
London Sunday: Britains Andy Murray says overtaking Novak Djokovic as the worlds top-ranked player is a big motivation for him for the rest of the 2016 season.
The Serbs mixed form this year means Murray, 29, has a chance to claim top spot for the first time in his career.
On Wednesday, Djokovic pulled out of next weeks China Open in Beijing with an elbow injury.
Trying to reach number one is a goal, said Murray, who plays Italys world number 94 Andreas Seppi in round one.
Ive never been [top]. Its something I would like to do for the first time, which is maybe more of a motivation for me than some of the guys that have been there before.
But I want to just try and finish this year strong from a personal point of view. Its been my best season to date, and I want to try to finish it as best as I can.

Arsenal count lucky stars after fortunate win
Arsene Wenger admitted Arsenal were lucky to come away with a narrow 1-0 victory over Burnley after a disputed injury-time winner took them within two points of the Premier League summit.
Burnley were left frustrated after defender Laurent Koscielny scored from a corner deep into stoppage time, as the ball rebounded off his hand and over the line.
Despite the controversial finish, a fifth consecutive league win moves Arsenal up to third, two points behind leaders Manchester City who surrendered their 100 percent start in a 2-0 defeat to second-placed Tottenham Hotspur.
I was fuming because we played the short corner at the end of the two added minutes, said Wenger.
I was asking why didnt we take the direct corner I didnt see it go in, but Ive been told that we were fortunate to get the goal.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche cut a frustrated figure after the defeat, which left his newly promoted side 14th in the table. Its a frustrating way to lose because the goal is handball and its six seconds over the allotted two minutes of injury-time. It might not sound a lot, but it was to us, said Dyche.
Despite the defeat, there are a lot of positives for us to take. We kept Arsenal to very few real chances, so I was pleased defensively. Arsenal went a record ninth game unbeaten in all competitions and Wenger described it as a big win after Citys defeat to Spurs.
Its a big win because City lost, said Wenger, adding: We were five points behind them going into this game, and when you get a chance to move closer you cant miss it, so we have to be pleased with the way we kept going to finally get the win. The veteran French boss made just one change from the side that beat Basel in the Champions League mid-week, and conceded his players looked jaded at times as they struggled to overcome a Burnley team which is adapting well after to life back in the top flight.
We came through what was a big test against a very motivated side, he said. Our legs were not as dynamic as recent games and we made some technical mistakes. AFP

Two women from a farming village about 100 kilometers from the countrys capital were raped within one year by a court judge presiding over cases which involved their husbands as accused parties. They have gone to Judiciary Services Commission, the BAR Association and to the president of the country to seek justice. Those institutions and people were non-responsive to their complaints. Angered husbands of two women swear revenge but their efforts to avenge the judge are futile. An editor of a leading alternative newspaper publishes the story of one of the women.

Nevertheless, 14 years later, today, the editor and the two women are still waiting for justice to be served. In year 2014, a filmmaker embarks on a journey to unearth these events and searches for the root causes of this ongoing injustice.

Mirror Cricket
Harping back to my cricketing days in England, the month of March heralds, The Spring and this glorious day, the first truly beautiful day of spring. You can feel the adrenalin surging through your veins. For, as Tennyson so sagely wrote (and was subsequently misquoted), in the spring a young mans fancy turns lightly to thoughts of cricket. The World is waking up after the long winter, and so are you. You stare out of the window, dreaming of battling half-centuries and instinctive diving catches at deep gulley. /
Bright sunny March days is one of Gods cruelest tricks for they promise so much and deliver so little. From within it all looks so inviting. But should you make the mistake of venturing outside with thermal long johns and four pairs of socks, you will surely suffer the consequences, as local authority workmen have to be called to chip you from the pavement.
Playing cricket therefore is out of the question, unless you fancy a new carrier as an ice sculptor. So confused by the deceitful gleam of the chilly March sun, you grab your trusty ruler and you play the first of the thousands of forward defensives in front of your bedroom mirror. /
All things considered, its remarkably easy to time the ball with a ruler. Suddenly you hear a distant rumble and you are at the crease, padded, helmeted ruler in hand, as Curtly Ambrose storms in from the horizon and the Sabina Park crowd bay for Anglo Saxon blood. Typical that the sights screen should be too low at that end. How are you supposed to see the ball coming out of your hand But then you can blame yourself if he is a little fired up. You shouldnt have hit his last ball for four. Three slips and two gullies wait as he roars in towards the crease. He bowls. You can barely see it, its viciously swift, but hang on, its a little short----------and wide--------- and luckily the pitch has eased a little this morning, and you are seeing the ball like a base ball, so you rock back, watching it all the way to the sweet spot, and you dont feel a thing, and it rockets away to the point boundary. A huge cheer from the crowd-they love a good contest. The man down there did not have a chance. You glanced round. Richie Richardson is shaking his head in despair. They had the match virtually won before you came in. You must feel sorry for him. But dont get cocky. Your fifty may be on the board, but the team needs a big hundred from you. Concentrate dont relax for a moment. Ambrose is back and this time he over pitches and you lean effortlessly into the ball-zing. Lots of red marks ,on the centre of your bat today. Whoosh through extra cover, past the fielders outstretched hands, and straight into the advertising hoarding before you finish your first run. And all this after you dismissed Brian Lara with your first ball of the day. Man of the match man of the series---------
Then you wake up, and its March again. Richie Benaud is always droning about light bats, but perhaps someone should tell him how potent a well balanced ruler can be in the right hands. Its just a shame you are not so fluent holding a real bat. Mirror cricket has these advantages and more over the normal game. There is little chance of injury. I have fantasized a complete test match in little over twenty minutes. Cricket may be realer than real life, but never underestimate the power of imagination. In real life I am a deeply pedestrian right handed batsman, slow of reaction, limited of shot (forward defensive) and liable to get out for one. In the mirror I am a dashing left hander, not unlike David Gower, elegant and unflappable. Once the real cricket season starts, the unstoppable momentum of real life failure renders all such fantasies impossible. Only in March can you enjoy so vivid and productive a cricketing carrier. Only in March can you dream that you have taken 6 for 34 on the following morning of a Test against Australia, and then wake up deliriously happy at four oclock in the morning, convinced for five or even six seconds that it actually happened. /
And you potter cheerfully about digging up rank smelling old kit from wherever you buried it for environmental reasons last September.
My own favorite ritual is the cleaning of the box, which has almost certainly lain untouched for months at the bottom of the miniature ecosystem otherwise known as my cricket bag. This small and undistinguished implement is going to protect my reproductive organs for the next five months, so it seems only fair to keep in good nick. Lovingly I soap it and rinse it, perhaps adding a layer of Pledge for that all weather shine. You can overdue it of course: one year I used so many different detergents and fluids on it that the damn thing started to melt.

Sketch of the greats
Sweet, slight and sincere maybe three words which pop into your mind when you have finished watching Richard Tannes Southside With You. The gentle, rose-tinted movie comes at a time then its protagonist Barack Obama is getting set to step down from his seat after serving his country for a long span.
Centered on the divisions in American society, Southside With You casts an optimistic view towards what might be in store. A fictional re-creation of Barack and Michelle Obamas first date, the movie is a venture down memory lane for the couple who have created history.
He is from Hawaii and Indonesia. She is from Chicago, the South Side. He is going to Harvard Law. She has been there, done that, and is now practicing law. With all this taking place in the background, you can see where the story is heading.
Happy ending
Most of the details of the Obamas early life has become well known news. In fact Baracks side of the first date is more widely known, since he recounted it in his memoir The Audacity of Hope. However through Southside With You Michelles experiences and reactions to the event are now in the spotlight. Though a happy ending is evident, Tannes script invests itself more in Michelles psychology - including her tightly wound sense of propriety, rooted in her efforts to fit in at institutions where shes one of few black women in attendance. Worried about how their relationship might look to others, Tika Sumpter plays Michelle with her guard up, often deflecting Baracks attempts to flirt with terse dialogue.
One of the drawback of the movie is that Tanne seem to think that the Obamas are invincible. In his eyes they can do no wrong and has only admiration for them.
Viewers get the sense of the couple as two intelligent, idealistic people simply getting to know each other. Comments like Michelles You definitely have a knack for making speeches, naturally sets the course for the White House. It is too obvious!
Gentle confidence
Another set back is that at times the movie tends to be too cute. However as soon as you get this feeling, the director draws back and adds some depth into the tale to cut off this feeling. One such example lies in the moment when Michelle asks Barack if hes thought about a career in politics, he replies maybe, with a shrug, taking another drag on his cigarette.
The story opens with Michelle talking about Barack to her parents, while he tells his grandmother about Michelle. Shes his adviser at the firm where hes a summer associate. Barack soon expresses his romantic feelings towards Michelle. She thinks their dating would be inappropriate. Still, he perseveres with gentle confidence, chipping away at her defenses with searching disquisitions. A park-bench lunch and a visit to an art show follow.
President Obamas fans will find something to enjoy in this slightly stilted yet oddly fascinating account of the Harvard law students first date with the woman who would eventually become his wife. Though it is just a few minutes long, the movie manages to capture the moods and essence of the two figures during the crucial stages of their lives which shaped them to make history together.
The background visuals are stunning. The city in all its splendour is captured artfully by the team.
Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter make a matching couple. They dish out a decent performance as Barack and Michelle Obama.
Southside With You maybe a small scale romance but it has a big heart. This is a perfect choice for a first date.

Ton-up Babar Azam anchors Pakistans series win
Sharjah Sunday: Fast-rising Babar Azam cracked a second successive hundred to guide Pakistan to a dominant 59-run win over the West Indies in the second one-day international in Sharjah, gaining an unbeatable 2-0 lead in three-match series.
Azam's brilliant 126-ball 123 formed the cornerstone of Pakistan's imposing 337-5 which also featured half-centuries from Shoaib Malik and Sarfraz Ahmed.
West Indies finished on 278-7 from their 50 overs with Darren Bravo hitting 61 and Marlon Samuels scoring 57. The final match will be in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
It was a wonderful team effort, said Pakistan captain Azhar Ali.
We needed a good partnership after losing two early wickets and Azam and Malik gave that to us with pace and wisdom.
West Indian captain Jason Holder rued his team's bad bowling.
I think we didn't bowl as well as we would have wanted and in the end 330-plus was too much for us, said Holder.
West Indies needed to improve on their best chase of 285 against Pakistan which came in 1993 at this same venue, but Pakistan's varied attack kept them at bay.
Bravo added 89 for the second wicket with Kraigg Brathwaite (39) after Johnson Charles was removed for two in the second over by Mohammad Amir.
Bravo hit three towering sixes and five boundaries off 74 balls before he was smartly run out by paceman Hasan Ali who knocked over the stumps at the non-striker's end after the batsman aimed for a quick single.
Samuels also tried his best during his 52-ball 57, spiced with four boundaries and two sixes, and added 67 for the fourth wicket with Denesh Ramdin (34) before fiery pace bowler Wahab Riaz (2-48) removed both in successive overs. Kieron Pollard, playing his 100th one-day international, made 22 and Holder, who scored 31 not out, found the going tough as West Indies needed 121 in the last 10 overs and 87 in last five.
Earlier Azam anchored Pakistan's highest one-day total against the West Indies, beating the 307-8 they made at Perth nine years ago.
Azam added 169 for the third wicket with Malik who missed his ninth one-day hundred by 10 runs, scoring an attractive 84-ball 90 with six hits over the fence and three boundaries.
It was another dominating batting display by Pakistan, with Azam and Malik shredding the West Indian bowling at will, and Sarfraz Ahmed finishing it with 47-ball 60 not out.
Azam reached his second one-day international hundred with a single off Carlos Brathwaite, waving his bat and bowing down in delight.
He was finally caught off paceman Alzarri Joseph at long-on in the 46th over.
Malik was also ruthless as he reached his 38th half-century off 55 balls before hitting three successive sixes off left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn, one went out of the Sharjah stadium.
Azam and Malik steadied the innings after openers Ali (nine) and Sharjeel Khan (24) fell in the space of three deliveries with the total at 40. Ahmed, who hit seven fours, helped Azam add another 73 for the fourth wicket as Pakistan added 97 in the last ten overs and 55 in the last five. Joseph and Holder took two wickets apiece.

United States beat Europe 17-11 to regain Ryder Cup
The United States dominated the final-day singles to win the Ryder Cup for the first time since 2008, beating Europe 17-11 at Hazeltine.
Trailing 9-6 after the first two days, Europe looked set for a Medinah-style comeback when they led in seven of the 12 singles matches.
But the hosts turned the tide, Patrick Reed defeating Rory McIlroy in an epic tussle for the first of seven US wins.
Ryan Moore beat Lee Westwood on the 18th green for the decisive point.
Ryder Cup 2016: Best shots of singles
It was a particularly sweet victory for US captain Davis Love, who was in charge four years ago at Medinah when Europe won despite being 10-4 down on the second afternoon.
For Europe, who failed in their bid to win the Cup for an unprecedented fourth successive time, Darren Clarke will come under the sort of scrutiny associated with a losing skipper.
Captains picks Martin Kaymer and Westwood played on Saturday afternoon despite poor first days, while three rookies - Matt Fitzpatrick, Chris Wood and Andy Sullivan - played in only one session before the singles, the latter not seen after Fridays foursomes.
However, Clarke could have no control over the Americans superior putting on Sunday, the whitewash the US handed out in the first foursomes or the fact that all 12 of the US team delivered a point while four Europeans drew blanks.
Ding dong battle between Rory McIlroy & Patrick Reed
The tussle between Reed and McIlroy, the first of the 12 matches, was most eagerly anticipated not only because it pitted both teams animated talisman against the other, but because it was deemed likely to set the tone for the rest of the day.
It exceeded expectations on a raucous, emotionally charged front nine of the highest quality.
At one point, both men were five under after the first eight holes, each playing to the ravenous crowd - Reed bowing, McIlroy cupping his ear and shouting I cant hear you.
The highlight came when McIlroy holed a 60-foot birdie putt on the eighth and, when Reed followed him in from 25 feet for a sensational half, the two shared a fist-bump.
But that was the signal for the quality to drop and a McIlroy bogey on 12 followed by a Reed birdie on 16 left the American two up with two to play.
McIlroy managed to take it down to the last, but Reeds approach to five feet was enough to seal victory and begin the United States march to only a third Ryder Cup win since 1993.
Mickelson and Garcia lead supporting cast
Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia both carded nine-under rounds of 63.
Behind the opening match, Europe were making inroads - Henrik Stenson beat an out-of-sorts Jordan Spieth 3&2, Rafa Cabrera-Bello again impressed in beating Jimmy Walker 3&2 while Belgian Thomas Pieters became the first rookie to register four points with a 3&2 win over JB Holmes.
And, in an incredible battle between Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia, the Spaniard somehow managed to claim a half in a classic battle.
The left-handed American, playing in his 11th Ryder Cup but looking for only a third US victory, was inspired, putting his way to 10 birdies.
Garcia, though, nervelessly putted for birdie on both the 17th and 18th after seeing Mickelson hole to ensure the match ended all-square - taking into account concessions, both men carded nine-under-par rounds of 63.
Europes lower order overwhelmedRyan Moore
Ryan Moore was a wildcard pick and was embraced by Davis Love after sealing the winning point
Clarke had front-loaded his singles order, hoping his most in-form players could reduce the deficit and provide the sort of momentum that those at the bottom of the card could feed off.
His plan worked to a degree - by taking three points from the first five, Europe at one point cut the deficit to 10-9.
But Europes final six, including four rookies, were overwhelmed, taking just a point between them.
Moore needed only to deliver a half but took his match with Westwood on the final green, after being two down with three to play, sealing the Ryder Cup when three matches were still on the course.
When it was all over, the US had their biggest margin of victory in 35 years.
We have been kicked around - what they said. Europe captain Darren Clarke on BBC Radio 5 live: I wouldnt have changed anything. I have spoken about this already to my vice-captains and we were confident. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but even with that we wouldnt have made any changes.
USA captain Davis Love on Sky Sports: We have been criticised for eight or 10 years for not coming together. We have been kicked around for so long. You keep losing and you feel like you have to do something different. We all said we are going to do whatever it takes. USA vice-captain Jim Furyk: We have had our struggles and Europe has got the best of us over the past 20 years - these guys played beautifully all week. It is easy to put pressure on yourself but this group did an amazing job and were looking to the future.
USAs Jordan Spieth: We did this for the captain, he had a tough go four years ago. The Europeans put up an unbelievable fight. Im blessed to be a part of this incredible team and hopefully a change in the future of the Ryder Cup. AFP
