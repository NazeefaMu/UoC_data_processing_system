Good Governance ushered in era of freedom
During the past regime, people lived in fear while nodding to the misdeeds of politicians and their henchmen. But after the good governance government was established, people could enjoy their freedom sans barriers, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a steering committee meeting of the Dambulla electorate held at the Dambulla main bus stands trade complex auditorium. Dambulla, Galewela and Pallepola Divisional Secretariat members participated.
Dissanayaka said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was established by late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike on solid policies. Therefore, no person could destroy the party. Since its inception, numerous issues had emerged, and though the obstructions vanished, all dissidents rejoined the party as they knew that they had no future. Therefore, those who were levelling various allegations to our party, will return to us again in the near future, he said.
He said the Rajapaksa regime had wasted public funds to distribute sarees, clocks and other items among people during the last Presidential Election, with the intention of deceiving their voters.

It really is coming home: English hometown pride on show
SHEFFIELD, Tuesday: Football fever is sweeping England as its young team prepares for a World Cup semi-final showdown against Croatia, and nowhere more so than in Sheffield, the proclaimed birthplace of the modern game.
Around 150 miles (240 kilometres) north of London, the city has a rich football history that continues today.
Three players in the current squad -- quarter-final goal-scoring hero Harry Maguire, defender Kyle Walker and forward Jamie Vardy -- were raised there.
The English flag, known as the St George's Cross, is omnipresent, flying from flats, cars and businesses throughout the formerly industrial so-called Steel City.
"It makes us feel proud of Sheffield knowing they come from here," said Fitsroy Turner, 43, a construction worker.
Even a local priest is getting in on the enthusiasm, sporting a waistcoat -- which England manager Gareth Southgate has made famous by wearing for every match -- during Sunday mass.
For the first time in this tournament, the local council will show Wednesday's semi-final on a 43-square-metre screen in the city centre with room for up to 10,000 fans.
The city will be celebrating its local heroes at the fan-zone under the banner "Made in Sheffield", Richard Eyre, its head of major events, told AFP.
Software developer Jonas Bezzubovas, 24, said every England victory so far had been marked by hours of revelry, but Wednesday promises to be the biggest yet.
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime match," he said.
"I feel like the heat and the football have gone to people's heads -- it's been madness here," he added, referring to weeks of uninterrupted sunshine that has been warming usually rain-sodden English spirits.
'IT'S COMING HOME'
England's progress into the latter stages of the World Cup has been accompanied by ever-increasing chants of "It's coming home" -- the country's resurrected theme song from the 1996 European Championships it hosted.
In this part of the world, home means Sheffield.
FIFA, world football's governing body, recognises Sheffield FC -- formed in 1857 and now playing in the eighth tier of English football -- as the oldest club on the planet.
Apart from the three Sheffield-born players, four more members of the current England squad have connections to the city or surrounding county of Yorkshire.
"Sheffield is immensely proud of its footballing heritage," said Mary Lea, a local cabinet member for culture, parks and leisure.
"Across the city, pubs and clubs have been packed into the early hours celebrating England's successes.
"For Sheffield it really is coming home."
Even the brass band that plays the national anthem and classic songs during the matches in Russia is from Sheffield.
'DIFFERENT FEEL'
Billy Hawsham, 63, maintains the rough-edged public housing complex in the neighbourhood where Kyle Walker grew up. He recalled his son playing alongside the local hero at youth level -- and the England player hitting golf balls over low-rise tower blocks as a kid.
Hawsham credits the laid-back ethos of the Yorkshire-heavy squad with helping to create "more euphoria this time than in any other tournament.
"There's a different feel to it with this younger side and no superstars," he said of the current crop, compared to past teams featuring the likes of David Beckham and Wayne Rooney.
Howard Holmes, a 71-year-old youth worker turned coach who helped discover Walker, said he was not surprised the region was producing talented players given its football pedigree.
"You're right at the fulcrum of where football started," he said at the pitch-side offices of Football Unites Racism Divides (FURD), the empowerment organisation he founded in 1995 just south of the city centre near the historical home of Sheffield FC.
RIVALRIES PUT ASIDE
In a city where bitterness between its two biggest clubs -- Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United -- can turn violent on derby day, locals have welcomed the unity around England. "It's nice to see the rivalry put aside," said Simeon Briggs, who manages a booming bar in the centre next to Wednesday's planned big screen site.
In nearby Mosborough, where Harry Maguire hails from, his local pub has turned its car park into a fan-zone decked out with two large screens, flags -- and plenty of beer on tap.
David Hoyland, 47, the general manager of the British Oak Alehouse, said the pub -- where Maguire's parents are still regulars -- does not usually show football but is making an exception.
He estimates around 2,000 fans packed the place on Saturday to see the team advance past Sweden, sinking 3,000 pints and hundreds of cocktails in the process.
Reflecting the swelling local pride, Hoyland added: "Someone came by Sunday and said it was the best day of his life."  AFP

SL can gain more from BRI with effective negotiations
Sri Lanka can gain more from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) if the Lankan authorities could effectively carry out the negotiations with Chinese counterparts, Managing Director, Hairong Investments International Pvt Ltd, Sri Lanka, Dr. Palitha Kohona said in Colombo yesterday.
He said, through BRI China would invest over US$ 6 trillion in infrastructure development mainly in Asian and African regions and Sri Lanka should carefully negotiate with China. Kohonas company Hairong is into promoting local business and investment opportunities. Hairong Investments is also looking at promoting Sri Lanka and is planning to host the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Conclave 2018 (SEIC), a Business Matchmaking event - at the Sri Lanka Embassy premises in Beijing, on September 18.
Around 50 Sri Lanka companies are expected to participate in this event and areas of business interests in this event include ICT, hotels and resorts, tourism, transport and aviation, oil refining, industrial, digital, banking and finance, manufacturing, energy and infrastructure.
He also said his company is looking at building a large convention facility in Sri Lanka which would be beneficial to woo the BRI MICE market to Sri Lanka.
Speaking at an event at the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) he said Sri Lanka has a good bargaining power due to its unique geographical location which is in the key route of BRI.
He said already Pakistan has been successful in getting US$ 56 billion infrastructure investments through BRI while for the first time after 40 years African countries too are gaining. A world bank report has mentioned that African economies are growing and BRI is the key to it, he said.
Dr. Kohona said already over US$ 6 billion Chinese investments are in Sri Lanka and more could be obtained. He said China is here for business and this message should also be passed on to the people concerned.
President NCCSL Sujeewa Samaraweera said they will continue to increase business links with China and businesses with China would continue in the future as well.

20th Amendment gazetted
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution handed over by the JVP to abolish the Executive Presidency was published in the Gazette on Monday as a Private Members Bill.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath, under whom the Bill was gazetted, said that he is ready to present the Bill for the first reading in Parliament next week. The Bill has been gazetted after the approval of the Attorney General.
Under the proposed 20th Amendment, the President will be appointed by Parliament, instead of being elected through a vote of the people. The President will continue to be the Head of State and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, but he will no longer be the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. The proposed 20th Amendment will be implemented only after the current term of office of President Maithripala Sirisena.
As per the draft bill, the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers will be the Prime Minister. The Presidents powers are distributed among the Cabinet, Prime Minister, Constitutional Council and independent commissions.
However, the President will continue to have the powers of appointing the Governors of Provinces as provided under the 13th Amendment. The Presidents power to appoint ambassadors and high commissioners and grant pardons will be subject to Cabinet approval as per the proposed amendment. It will also remove the Presidents power to prorogue Parliament.
The 20th Amendment also requires the President to seek Cabinet approval when granting a Presidential pardon. The number of Presidential staff should also be approved by the Cabinet. The President, once elected by Parliament, cannot hold any position or membership of a political party during his or her tenure.

Athlete couple celebrates Golden wedding and rekindles memories
R. M. Chandradasa (77 years) and K.G.G. Menike (69 years) are considered the longest competing athletic couple with international fame todate in Sri Lanka. They celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on July 11. Their marriage on July 11, 1968 was marked with a remarkable wedding photo, where the two athletes were dressed in sports attire and exchanged two cups.
In celebrating their golden jubilee wedding anniversary, the couple was featured in a similar photograph after 50 years attired in their athletic outfit.
Representing Ratnapura district Chandradasa and Menike have won many accolades at national level and went on to bring glory at international level as well. Chandradasa in his late 70s and Menike in her late 60s still compete in the Masters athletic events and most recently they shone at the Masters Athletics Championship 2018 worked off at the Sugathadasa Stadium and qualified to represent Sri Lanka at the forthcoming World Masters Athletics Championship in Spain.
The national selection event saw many foreign athletes contesting, but Chandradasa and Menike proved their mettle. The athletic couple owns the only athletic museum in the country, the Javana athletic museum where they have displayed all the memorabilia they received in their long sporting careers.
As before Chandradasa and Menike will not be able to compete in Spain due to financial issues even though their performance at the national event carries hopes of them being medal contenders.
Chandradasa holds the Sri Lankan record in age category 75-80 mens 100m which he established in 2017 with a timing of 16.3 secs. He also created the same age category Sri Lankan record in the mens 80m hurdles event last year, clocking 19.1secs. Menike holds the Sri Lankan record for age category 65-70 womens 100m (16.6 secs) which she established last year and also holds the same age category womens 200m record with a timing of 36.70 secs established in 2016.
In the recently concluded Masters Athletic Championship, Chandradasa won the age category silver medal in the 80m hurdles and bronze medal in the 100m events to qualify for the big event in Spain. Menike won the gold medal in the 100m event.
Chandrasena has a 66-year sporting career while Menike has been in athletics for the past 54 years. The couple hopes to engage in athletics as long as they are capable, but sadly remembered that they have lost many chances to bring glory to Sri Lanka because of financial constraints. Their biggest aim is to construct the Javana sports museum at the government allocated premises near their residence in Kuruwita. At present they are using part of their residence as the museum.
Even though Government has allocated a place, the construction work is at a standstill. We hope the sports authority will take necessary steps to accelerate the construction work of the museum as we both hope to witness our brainchild, the Javana museum has a proper premise before we die, said Chandrasena.

Bacteria contaminating Rajangana reservoir
Resulting from the unwarranted utilisation of chemical fertiliser containing Nitrogen and Phosphorous, the water in the Rajangana reservoir is rapidly contaminating. The colour of the tank water is changing to green and a foul odour is emanating from the tank. It is learnt that the users of the tank have become sick, in addition to a negative effect on the fish population.
Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake, visiting the Rajangane reservoir site accompanied by officials, gathered first-hand information about the matter. Irrigation Director General Mohanaraja, Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director Prannade Silva joined the minister. The minister instructed officials to take prompt action to investigate into the water contamination issue and take action to revive the reservoir containing 86,000 a.f of water.
Senior lecturer Wasanthasena Welianga of the Biological Studies Department of the Rajarata University said the infection of a bacteria called microcystins is the cause for the contamination and the colour changing of the Rajangana tank water. The bacteria prevent sunlight from entering through the water into the interior which dwindles the oxygen quantity in the water. This leads to the destruction of fish and aquatic plants in the water, originating a bad odour sans oxygen. The waste being disposed of by the bacteria affects the nervous system and liver of humans. The bacteria are about 3 billion years old.
The main cause for bacteria spread is the overuse of chemical fertiliser containing Nitrogen and Phosphorous, Dr. Welianga said.

Beautiful bondage of a notebook
Once the American poet of Grass Leaves fame, Walt Whitman, pointed out the notebook writing led him to recreate poems and short creative sketches. I was reminded of the comment on re-reading the volume of notebooks written by William Somerset Maugham (1874  1966) titled as A Writers Notebook first published as far back as 1949 and consequently in 1967.
The series of notes as jotted down by Maugham covered the period of his most active writing career between 1892 and 1944. A reader may visualise how an English writer had spent his whole life dedicated to writing in the middle of his various journeys around the globe. Maugham was educated at Kings School in Canterbury and at Heidelberg University. Though he was destined to become a medical professional attached to St Thomas Hospital in the UK, he was nevertheless given a stronger and more sensitive and captivating profession as a writer of fiction.
Notebook pages
It is recorded that his first novel Lisa of Lambeth (1897) won him over to letters. This followed his greatest work in fiction Of Human Bondage (1915) discussed by the then critics as a masterpiece. As he notes in the pages of his notebook, Maugham was not aware of the number of plot outlines he has written down concentrating later to allow the way for short stories and plays.
He notes that he had preferred to write play scripts in the first instance, but the demand and circumstances made him more attached to short stories, long stories and full-length narratives. His general books are fewer in number.
He notes that his theatre career had ended with a play titled Sheppey in 1933. The pages of the notebooks show the interest he had taken to jot down his varying forms of thoughts reminiscences and creative visions on paper. It is noted that Maugham had been the English writer who had been instrumental in this introduction of some of the Russian writers like Anton Chekhov, Turgenev and Dostoevsky. This is not as a result of learning the original language but as a result of appreciating the works that had emerged from Russian into English. On reading the Notebooks one gets the impression that the writer had been delving on themes such as love, death, suffering and decay.
He emphasises the decadent nature of the commercial dealings and some of the pseudo-philosophical ways of the so-called elites. This too underlines the need for a better living condition, despite the animosity of human groups especially in the middle of world wars. He notes the need to learn more and more on human cultures in order to bring about peace and harmony between countries. Having visited countries like Singapore, Malaysia, India and Burma, Maugham underlines the general factors observable in the cultural norms that transcend the narrow barriers of the way they are governed by the colonial rulers.
Writers advice
At times, Maugham tends to be humorous in his jottings.
This is just an example.
Once a lady who had a son of a literary bent asked me what training I should advise if he was to become a writer; and I judging by the Inquirer that she would pay little attention to my answer replied: Give him a hundred and fifty a year for five years and tell him to go to the devil. I have thought of it since and it seems to me it was better advice than I imagined.
Maugham in his notebook underlines the different types of writers whom he had met over the years, their mannerisms and temperaments. This is followed by the types of friends and well-wishers whom he had encountered during his visits to various parts of the world. He, in one instance, notes that I think I have been more than most men conscious of my age. Then states:
My youth slipped past me unnoticed and I was always burdened with the sense that I was growing old. Then he adds:
Because for my years, I had seen much of the world, and travelled a good deal, because I was somewhat widely read and my mind was occupied with matters beyond my ears, I seemed always older than my contemporaries.
Psychological altitude
As a reader, I felt that long before the concept of positive thinking as a popular psychological altitude emerged, Maugham had sensitively captured some of the areas linked into same in his diary entries I wish to lay down a few sentences of such international altitude in the following:
By imagination man compensates himself for his failure to get a complete satisfaction from life. Eternal necessity forces him to renounce the gratification of many of his most radical instincts but renunciation comes hardly to man; and baulked of his desire for honour, power, love, he cheats himself by the exercise of fantasy.
The reader too finds the varying types of creative backgrounds and the sources of inspiration of the creative writer Maugham over the philosopher Maugham. He seems to pass a certain judgement over his life in the following manner:
I have been asked on occasion whether I would like to live my life over again. On the whole, it has been a pretty good life, perhaps better than most peoples, but I should see no point in repeating it.
All in all, the Writers Notebook by Maugham is quite resourceful and inspirational. As such, it is true to say that this is a fascinating glimpse into the life and mind of the man who wrote some of the greatest novels and short stories of this century.

Best places to see elephants
Kaudulla National Park
Located ~200km northeast of Colombo, Kaudulla is Sri Lankas newest national park. Its home to over 200 elephants and is part of the elephant corridor between Minneriya and Wasgomuwa National Parks.
I was fortunate enough to visit and saw the hugest herds of elephants Ive ever seen! Easily 200. Even greater in number the elephants I had seen in Tembe Elephant Park in South Africa and Etosha in Namibia!
Its hard to describe the feeling of seeing so many of the second largest land mammal on earth. Only the African elephant is larger. And so close. You could hear the grass-roots ripping from the ground as they pulled it out and wrapped it in their flexible trunks Pure magic!!!!!
Best Time To Visit Kaudulla:
The population peaks between August and December. But the best time is in August and September. Kaudulla Reservoir, located in the park attracts the elephants during the dry season. This is referred to as The Gathering as they make their pilgrimage to Minneriya. But, you can see elephants the entire year.
Minneriya National Park
Minneriya is located just over 180km northeast from Colombo. Its most famous for an event referred to as The Gathering, in which hundreds of elephants make the trip during the dry season (July to early November) to an ancient reservoir.
This migration has happened for centuries and sounds spectacular!
Udawalawe National Park
In the opposite direction from Kaudulla and Minneriya is Udawalawe, ~180km south-east from Colombo. I was supposed to visit this park for a day, and had already booked a guest house, but changed my plans instead for an extra day at Yala National Park. I loved my time at Yala, so I cant say that I regret my decision, but Im sorry I missed my chance to visit Udawalawe. This park isnt known for its beauty, but in my opinion the ~250 resident elephants more than compensate.
The park is quite small, and much of the landscape is open. The elephants are drawn to the Udawalawe Reservoir. Youre virtually guaranteed to see elephants here. We also include it in our Sri Lanka Wildlife and Cultural Highlights Tour. In addition, we time your visit around feeding time so that can see elephants up close. Theres nothing that will get you saying awwww faster than watching hungry elephant calves gobble up their lunch.
Anna, who had the awful experience of visiting the elephant orphanage on her first trip to Sri Lanka, had a much different experience at Udawalawe:
On another trip to Sri Lanka, we visited Udawalawe National Park. It was one of the best wildlife experiences Ive ever had!
We drove through the park with a jeep and saw so many healthy elephants  many families with baby animals, which was really cute. Our driver made sure to keep a healthy distance tot hem and not disturb them.
We watched elephants feeding on trees, bathing in a river, sleeping It was such a great experience to see them living in their real habitat. Id love to go back to Udawalawe!
These are certainly not the only places you can see an elephant in Sri Lanka, but they are your best chances of seeing the largest herds. At Udawalawe youre almost guaranteed to see elephants.

Scandalous murder and sensational trial 112 years ago - Part I:
Birth of Uncle-Nephew Politics
On that fateful night of December 5, 1906, 22-year-old Francis Dixon Artygalle, one of the wealthiest men in the island, heir to lions share of the Artygalle inheritance, was talking to a visitor at the Pettah residence of C P Dias, the Principal of Wesley College and City Father. A gunman standing behind shot him at point-blank range. Being rushed to hospital in a critical condition, causing great public interest and excitement he succumbed to injuries on the following day.
The serious nature of gruesome murder compelled Dowbiggin, the Superintendent of Police, Colombo [later eighth IGP] to personally handle investigations. History of Ceylon Police- Part two[A C Dep ex DIG]: Had Dixon Artygalle survived, he would have been the brother-in-law of the first Prime Minister, and uncle of second, third and eighth Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka.
Scandalous murder; and sensational trial 112 yrs ago- Death of Dixon Artygalle and birth of Uncle-Nephew Politics, is the true story of emergence of Senanayakes, Kotalawalas and Jayewardenes in Sri Lankan Politics, the source that initially financed their activities, and also the concealed hostility, enmity and rivalry for preeminence among the three families that formed the upper crust of the United National Party hierarchy for many decades that commenced during the time of this saga and reached its peak in 1952, enduring up to the end of last century.
John, a smart police officer
Madapatha in Salpity Korale is a tranquil eco-friendly getaway from the city, overlooking and cuddled up in the serene waters of the Bolgoda lake or lagoon with plenty of lush. Artygalles residence is located in the hamlet Colammune on the banks of this largest inland waters in the island just 20 km south of the city of Colombo. In the late 19th Century, precisely on April 1, 1886, when John Kotelawala from Madapatha in Piliyandala joined the Ceylon Constabulary [how the police were known then] as a Constable/Clerk, the OICs of the majority of Police stations were Seargents. John was a smart police officer who rose to the rank of an inspector within a few years, a privileged position enjoyed mostly by the Britishers. At that time in colonial Ceylon, most of the high ranking officers in all other institutions too were Whites.
Naina was a notorious but powerful gangster who ran several gambling dens in the city, and no police officer dared disturb his activities. As reconstructed in the stage play Nainage Sooduwa, Kotelawala had gone to the infamous gambling hideout of Naina disguised as a gambler to apprehend the big boss and became a hero after he successfully raided all his dens and put Naina in jail.
Kotelawalas and Artygalles
Wickremesinghe Mudali of Raigam Korale helped King Rajasinghe to wage war against Portuguese in the 16th Century on the Kelani banks. During Dutch rule, they shunned Wickremasinghe name in preference for the name of the village Kotelawala as they became Christians to pacify the invaders and receive titular gains. However, they soon reverted back to Buddhism. 20th Century Impressions of Ceylon: Arnold Wright-
After one and a half centuries, the Kotelawalas shot back to the limelight with the appearance of Don Manuel Kotelawala an inhabitant of Undugoda, Bandaragama. He had two sons; DA, the father of our Policeman Kotelawala, Grandfather of Sir John the third Prime Minister and Justin Kotalawala the Insurance tycoon and great-grandfather of business magnate Lalith Kotalawala and world-renowned Economist late Dr. Gamini Corea. The other was Muhandiram DC who left the village to settle-down in Badulla. Sir Henry Kotelawala, who represented Uva in the Legislative and State Councils in the 1920s and 30s was his son. JCT [Jack] Kotelawala, the popular LSSP Parliamentarian of the 1950s and 60s, the only Marxist in the dynasty was the son of Sir Henry. He and Sir John Kotalawala who occupied seats across the well of the old parliament in the 1950s were second cousins.
Arrack renter turned wealthy landowner from the same village was Colamunne Walawwas Mudaliyar Don Charles Gemoris Attygalle [1834-1901], the late father of slain Francis Dixon. He was made Mohandiram in 1885 and propped up Mudaliyar in 1900 by the colonial government. Artygalle had four children, three daughters and the only son Francis Dixon. Starting from humble beginnings and having made his initial capital by working in plumbago mining and planting,
born in Salpita Korale in 1834. He worked for the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens at the age of 12. At 18 he was sent to Hakgala gardens. He also supplied plants to European planters and businessman. He started his first Graphite mine in Kahatagaha.--20th C. Impressions of Ceylon-Arnold Write
Geromis Artygalle tried his hand in highly profitable Arrack renting too. Later he branched into Coconut, Rubber, Tea and Cinnamon as a landowner who amassed a colossal wealth owning over 10,000 acres of plantations and a few plumbago mines that included the famous Kahatagaha in Dodangaslanda.
The tale that comes through grapevine for generations in the village of Colamunne, Madapatha relates how our young policeman John in his early thirties had been carrying on a covert love affair with the Walawwas eldest girl, the 22-year-old Alice Elizabeth, a stubborn damsel who did not heed the advice of the affluent parents to give up the relationship with the vivacious police officer. However, a few months later Artygalles, the dominant family in the Salpiti-Korale was not only constrained to give the girl in marriage to her choice but with a dowry of an enormous wealth that included 2,058 acres of rubber and coconut estates plus one-fourth share of Plumbago Mines.
The reason for the surprise change instance is not clear though the grapevine reveals that the young mans courage and wits made him hire a middle-aged maid attached to the walawwa to convey a courteous appeal to the Artygalles which was met with unceremonious rejection. Artigalles uncompromising attitude put John in a blocked situation, in which he had no choice but to fight. He possessed an ability to feign and wait for a proper moment, like how he conquered Naina, by methodically working out a strategy, then move tactically and attack.
On a peaceful night when the entire village of Colamunne was asleep including the occupants of Artigalle mansion; the picturesque environs of the mansion was sparklingly illuminated by the flickers of the silvery radiance of moonlight, that even entered Alices bedroom through window panes.
At this hour of dimness, our young Romeo got an idea to take a moonlit stroll around the precincts of Walawwa, which steadily advanced until he became sneaky enough to find his way to the sleeping spaces of the mansion and in to the arms of his Juliet wishing let this night be forever. It was a pledge of life in the gloom, made under the heat of the cold night; a sense of love and fondness springing from the heart especially for the young lady. Kotalawala believed he had laid a solid foundation for a prosperous and healthy future for himself as he scooted down the slopes an hour later, and out of the sprawling locality of Artygalles, a happy and contented man.

Michael Ondaatje on The English Patient
The book that offered freedom
On Sunday night, Michael Ondaatje stepped on to the wide stage of the Royal Festival Hall in London. He found a lectern and, white head bowed, reached into his pocket for a small piece of paper. It began with a small night conversation between a burned patient and a nurse, he said. I did not know at first where it was taking place, or who the two characters were. I thought it might be a brief novella  all dialogue, European-style, big type.
The audience laughed. Because what actually turned up, of course, was The English Patient: 300-plus pages about four people inhabiting the mined rooms of a remote Italian villa at the end of the second world war; four very different people who meet in damaged solitude, who talk (there are a lot of night conversations), who love, whose histories, revealed in vivid flashes, become a taut, outraged meditation on the idea of war, of nationalism and of prejudice; a meditation that slips between spies and explorers, Suffolk and the Egyptian desert; the Punjab and Womens College Hospital, Toronto, as easily as the sapper, Kip, slips into bomb craters to defuse bombs.
The English Patient shared the Booker prize with Barry Unsworths Sacred Hunger in 1992, has been translated into 38 languages, and in 1996 became an Anthony Minghella-directed film winning nine Academy awards, and grossing $231m worldwide to date. By Sunday night it had been shortlisted for the Golden Man Booker 50: the best Booker winners of the last 50 years, arrived at by decade. Ondaatjes competition was VS Naipaul, for In a Free State (1970s), Penelope Livelys Moon Tiger (80s), Hilary Mantels Wolf Hall (2000s), and George Saunders Lincoln in the Bardo (10s). And, after a public vote, The English Patient won.
Upstairs, in a room with long views of a Thames blurry with heat, Ondaatje accepts congratulations and a glass of white wine, please. My first in months. He has one of the most recognisable faces in literature: pale eyes sharp in a wide, tanned face, a halo of white hair and beard. He is gracious, quick and thoughtful, but also well-defended, steely and distracted; aware of friends waiting to celebrate with him downstairs, he talks faster and faster, and eventually simply stops.
What an extraordinary afterlife the book has had. Well, it already had a second afterlife with the film, right And that was a bolt of lightning that I wasnt expecting. And then this  suddenly redoing the whole thing again. Another horse race, you know He laughs. Though both were a fillip, really, on what the first prize gave him, which was the most precious thing: Freedom. I had been teaching for many, many years up to that point. Teaching full-time, in fact, and trying to write a complicated novel, and that had become too much to manage. I thought I was going to lose it  and I had quit my job. I just needed to finish the book. It was a bet. Which could not have come off more handsomely.
Time Capsule
Penelope Lively, in her speech earlier in the evening, had mused about how different a person she was, at 85, from the one who in her mid-50s had written Moon Tiger. What did Ondaatje think of the self who wrote The English Patient (which he has not reread since it was published) Well, I still like him. More interesting, he thinks, is the way in which each book hes written is like a time capsule.
When he was writing The English Patient, between about 1985 and 1992, there was an argument going on in Canada about nationalism and integration. They didnt want Sikhs to wear turbans if they were policemen and stuff like that. That was in the air. The striking thing is how contemporary his concerns  how to release oneself from the imposition of nationalism; how to rediscover ones essential individuality or true, often artistic allegiances  now feel. Contemporary, and somehow, in a harsher time, impossibly idealistic.
Ondaatje is fond of a quotation from John Berger: Never again will a story be told as if it were the only one. It is a moral imperative, isnt it Especially in current western politics, which seems so determined to cancel the multiplicity of viewpoints from all over the world, or at least to pretend that they dont exist. Oh, absolutely. The Berger quote is very interesting because its a political statement, but its also an artistic statement.
So wasnt the ending of The English Patient, in which the Sikh Kip (whose relationship with the Canadian nurse, Hana, Ondaatje describes as being like continents meeting) drops everything and returns home when he hears of the bombs falling on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a failure of nerve A reimposition of the nationalisms dissolved through the rest of the novel, where, as Kamila Shamsie put it: Ondaatjes imagination acknowledges no borders
They cant overcome, says Ondaatje, who remembers that he found the last pages of The English Patient sad to write. It is too difficult for most people; and for Kip, especially, who in the nuclear glare sees suddenly that they would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation.
In Warlight, published only last month, Ondaatje refers to a subplot of greyhound smuggling up the Thames as a vast mongrelisation of pedigree dogs; it could equally apply to the kitchens of the Criterion, in Piccadilly, where his teenage character Nathaniel finds himself working; to London restaurant kitchens today; to Ondaatjes ideal of the world  and to Ondaatje, too. Born in what was then Ceylon, he is of Dutch-Tamil-Sinhalese descent. His parents, tea planters, separated when he was about seven, when his mother moved to England; he would, decades later, in Running in the Family describe in both funny and heartbreaking prose his fathers eventual lonely death from alcoholism.
He was cared for by his chaotic, dramatic, but loving extended family, then aged 11 sent, alone, on the three-week boat voyage to England. It was only when his grown children were appalled by it that he realised it might be unusual, and a good story (it became the scaffolding for 2011s The Cats Table, about a boy called Michael, to whom the same thing happens). He went to Dulwich College in London, where Ondaatje was nicknamed Kip  a reference to kipper grease.
He has just given a talk at Dulwich, in fact, about Warlight and I saw three or four people I hadnt seen since I was a teenager. Suddenly Im getting emails to Kip all the time. Thats how they remember me. In The English Patient, Kip is perfectly happy with his nickname, until the nuclear bombs fall, when all at once he realises: His name is Kirpal Singh, and he does not know what he is doing here.
Did acquiring a British moniker ever make Ondaatje feel similarly alienated Yeah  well, it is strange. But he doesnt remember the name affecting him (it didnt feel insulting) and although he has previously said how much he disliked England, he is more mellow about it now. I went through school with a lot of irony. I just realised that this is  a different place, with a different set of rules, and values, and tastes. Not that its bad, but I had to adapt to it  and it happened fast.
Childhood ignored
In Running in the Family he describes his impetus for memoir as a feeling that he had slipped past a childhood I had ignored and not understood. Is that what hes been doing in his fiction, too  trying to understand his childhood Yeah  and I think thats probably true in pretty much most of the books, I think. Perhaps. I think its possible, in retrospect. I think maybe Ive done it now. Ill leave childhood alone.
He eventually found his own freedom by leaving again  for Canada, where his brother Christopher already lived, and university. (Christopher, also, is a writer  and a hugely successful businessman, a philanthropist and a bobsledding Olympian.) I wonder if it was easier to write from there. His reply is instant. I dont think I would ever have been able to write if I lived in England. Because there was a mythology. In the 50s, to say you were a poet  John Keats was a poet, or Shakespeare was a poet  it had a lot of gall. Ted Hughes and all those guys hadnt even emerged yet. That happened 10 years after I left.
In Canada he met young writers, was published by small presses unfazed by novels that read like poems, and vice versa. He taught, he became an editor himself  at the literary magazine Brick, from which he only stepped down a year ago, after 30 years. And now he has returned, to be crowned by the British reading public the best of the Booker 50. In his thank you he listed novels that missed out on the Booker but that he thought should get a mention  by JL Carr, William Trevor, Barbara Pym, Alice Munro and Samuel Selvon. He thanked small presses everywhere, and Minghella, who is no longer with us but I suspect has something to do with the result of this vote. Theres a knowingness in the laugh he gets from the audience this time, too.

Boston Devices installs compact incinerator at Japanese, Korean Embassies
A compact garbage incinerator, one of the latest methods to waste management, was installed at the Japanese and Korean Embassy premises recently.
This incinerator disposes the waste collected daily from the Embassies in an environmentally friendly manner. A number of people, including the Embassy staff, were present at the occasion.
The incinerator was introduced to Sri Lanka by Boston Devices (Pvt) Ltd, which is one of the fastest growing Environmental and HVAC service providers in the country. Similar devices are being used in many state and private hospitals, factories, tourist hotels and other establishments in Sri Lanka, Manjula Navaratne, Managing Director of Boston Devices (Pvt) Ltd said.
The incinerator, which uses Japanese technology, burns waste at temperatures above 1000 degrees Celsius. This enables complete combustion and minimizes the emission of hazardous gases. The amount of ash, left by the process, is also minimal.
The incinerator does not release noxious gases like dioxins and purines. An additional benefit of using these machines is that it produces steam and hot water. The incinerator requires minimal amounts of fuel and uses the gasification process to completely combust waste. The machine can be operated using a small amount of kerosene and there is no need to treat or sort waste prior to disposal.
The system which can be efficiently operated after a brief training can complete a combustion cycle within an hour.

CEA in Rs. 35 mn waste disposal drive for Kataragama pilgrimage season
The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) in cooperation with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has introduced a garbage disposal project ahead of the annual pilgrimage to Kataragama.
Funded by a Rs.35 million contribution from the JICA, the scheme combines new and old practices of reducing polythene and other solid waste during the largest influx of visitors to Kataragama, when waste is four times higher than during any other time of the year.
CEA Chairman Chandrarathne Pallegama said that this project has three pilot sites, in Kurunegala, Ratnapura and Kataragama.
Use reusable, non-plastic containers or wrapping for the items you bring to the sacred city. Make this perahera the opportunity to think over the waste that is polluting our environment, he said.
Pallegama said that the public should be informed to minimise plastic waste and to dispose of such waste separately to facilitate recycling.
Every year, a huge number of visitors come and worship God Skanda during the festival season. They offer their prayers to the God, while dirtying the town that embraces the God, said Moneragala District MOH Director Dr. P.D.K Adikari.
The solid waste management scheme aligns well with this years theme for Suriduni Kataragama 2018 which is surakimu sobadhama, or protect the environment.
Under the scheme, a new landfill site is already under construction in Kataragama, which considers the environment on multiple levels. The site uses locally available materials, like an expansive clay lining that protects the soil underneath. It also has gas removal and leachate pipes to prevent unexpected fires and groundwater pollution. An electric fence will be installed around the site to prevent wild elephants from eating waste like plastic, which is harmful to their health.
As in previous years, checkpoints will be established to collect plastic and polythene bags and containers from visitors. Plastic bags will be replaced by fabric bags donated by various organisations and dignitaries, including the Rotary Club, Sri Lanka Environmentalist Society, Kale Resort hotel, the Chief Incumbent of the Kirivehera, and Swadeshee.
The scheme classifies solid wastes more specifically by sorting materials for both recycling and compost. The Clean Tomorrow, for the City of God Skanda project directed by the Kataragama Pradeshiya Sabha has already led successful efforts to separate biodegradable from non-biodegradable waste.
This July, the Pradeshiya Sabha will begin implementing a project to separate recyclable from non-recyclable waste, separating glass bottles, hard plastic, paper and cardboard from general waste. These materials will be sold to recycling factories and recycling dealers. Despite the efforts of Kataragamas Pradeshiya Sabha, soft plastics such as grocery bags and lunch sheets remain difficult for the organisation to collect and process.
Outside the jurisdiction of the town, the Perahera Committee has taken the initiative for the management of waste in the Sacred Area around Kataragama Dewale.

Croatia hopes it has finally found a team to better 1998 heroes
ZAGREB, Croatia, Monday: Croatias first World Cup semi-final for two decades has revived the memories of the countrys football highpoint and raised hopes that Luka Modrics side can go one better than their legendary predecessors.
After a dramatic win on penalties against Russia, Croatia will play England on Wednesday in front of 80,000 people in Moscows Luzhniki Stadium for a place in the World Cup final.
In 1998, Croatia, which had emerged from a bitter independence war only three years earlier, made its debut at a World Cup finals.
With a team featuring Davor Suker, Zvonimir Boban and Robert Prosinecki wearing blues shirts with a distinctive red and white chequerboard pattern, they beat World Cup giants Germany 3-0 in the quarter-finals in France, sparking delirium at home.
Although Croatia went on to suffer an agonising 2-1 defeat to host nation France in the semi-finals, they beat the Netherlands 2-1 in the third-place playoff.
Nicknamed the Fiery Ones, that team has stood as an example to their successors ever since.
Now, finally, there is a team ready to join them in Croatian footballs pantheon of heroes. Robert Prosinecki, a member of the 1998 squad, told AFP: I would so much like that they be better than us.
1998 will never be forgotten and should not be, but I would love it if eventually the 1998 Fiery Ones can be moved aside so that we can talk not only about 1998 but also a bit about 2018, the former Real Madrid player said.
CONFINED TO HISTORY
The coach of the 1998 side, Jaroslav Ciro Blazevic, told AFP that for a long time he did not want any other team to match his players achievements.
Until five or six years ago I was bit vain, and in a way glad that in 1998 we set the bar so high that it was difficult to even contemplate, let alone jump over it.
But now ... I pray and I would give anything in the world that this squad eventually confines us to history. That in future we talk about them, said Blazevic, now 83, and known in Croatia as the coach of all coaches.
The penalty shootout win against hosts Russia in the quarter-finals on Saturday seems to have gone a long way towards achieving that.
Weve been always returning to the 1998 team.... putting a new burden on Modric and his team. Until last night, when all the pain was removed and when we finally experienced a revival of 1998, the Sportski Novosti newspaper said after that match.
Squares packed with red-and-white painted fans, stalls selling football jerseys and flares, and drivers blaring their horns, people hugging and singing -- scenes reminiscent of 1998 are all around as the country of around four million people lives and breathes football.
We are glad that this generation experiences its own 1998, that they can see live what football euphoria looks like ... at least we will not have to explain it to them on YouTube any more Sportske Novosti said.
During the group stage in Russia, coach Zlatko Dalic said it was difficult to compare generations when events were separated by a 20-year gap.
We have nice memories from France, our players did a great job ... We want to get close to them, although it is difficult to repeat this endeavour, but we will try, the 51-year-old told reporters.
Two days before the clash with England he sounded more confident. We respect everyone -- England, Belgium, France. But none of the three squads is better than us!
On Wednesday, his team has a chance to write a new page in Croatias football history.
Former international Mario Stanic remembers perfectly the defeat to eventual winners France in the 1998 semi-final, although he would rather not.
In three days we went from top to bottom, emotionally, Stanic, 46, told AFP.
For me it was the utmost low, since I knew we were a step from making history and we failed.
But Stanic said he did not want to compare his team with the current one.
We had our story, they have their own.
Thank God for this generation which has managed to get to a semi-final and justify Croatias status as a football superpower... at least a small one, the former Chelsea midfielder said.  AFP

Dancers brightness
The role of personality in dance is an important factor. In any dance form, whether it is a modern dance form, folk dance form, fusion dance form, a classical dance, or even if it is a ritual dance form to some extent, the personality plays an important role. For dance body and personality are the part and parcel of the art. In any dance form, the body is an instrument.
Make-up enhances the personality of the dancer. Hence maintaining the figure is an important factor for dance. Each dance form has its unique make-up and distinctive costumes. Most of the oriental classical dance forms, folk dance forms and ritual dance forms have their old age links, traditions and historical background and religious affiliations. To enhance the personality of the dancers they should put suitable makeup, despite their natural beautiful features. It is very much needed for the classical dance artists. Any performing artiste, whether it is a dancer, drama artiste, teledrama artiste, or silver screen artiste the personality plays an important role.
Character necessity
However, for drama artistes, teledrama artistes, or silver screen artists, the selective role and the makeup factor are chosen according to the need and necessity of the character. However, the oriental classical dances, folk dances and ritual dance forms have the selective and distinctive make-up of their own. The folk dance forms and the ritual dance forms belong to Desi dance forms. That means it is confined to a particular limited Pradesh or area. Yet most of these dance forms do not gain the worldwide recognition.
The folk dances and ritual dances are mostly performed in open-air theatres. In these folk and ritual dance forms, the personality of the artists is not considered serious. But on the other hand, any classical dance form, in spite of its distinctive make-up and costumes, has certain basic personal qualities needed for a classical dancer.
The classical dance form is much more polished by numerous factors as well as by sophisticated techniques which have gained worldwide recognition. The basic attraction for these classical dance forms is the dancers personality.
Classical guidelines
Numerous ancient dance scripts still describe and provide the aesthetic values and guidelines to the classical dance forms. Among the instructions given in the ancient scripts, the quality and the duties of the teachers and the nature and the personality of the students are well defined. The professional performers are less, as compared to the stage dance performers. Today the students are mostly staging performers. Hence, the stage performers must have a suitable figure for the dance.
The type and the nature of the personality of the dance students are given in the ancient dance scripts. According to the ancient spiritual dance scripts, the dancer must be of fair complexion. The face must be beautiful like a lotus flower. She must not be too fat or too thin. As for the intelligence, the dancer should be very sharp. Further, she should have a thorough knowledge of the theory and the practical side of the dance, mainly about the Thala (rhythm), Kala (speed) and Laya (balancing the Thala and Kala) scales. The dancer should be very obedient and able to interpret the meaning smoothly through hand gestures and facial expressions.
The dancer is supposed to have a good voice and knowledge in the classical vocal music. She must cultivate and inherit such good qualities and habits such as humility. She must be polite and respect God, guru, elders and hermits.
First appearance
The first appearance of the dancer should be very attractive to the audience like a full moon with brightness.
These qualities are given in the ancient dance scripts but today one cannot expect all these qualities and guidelines given in the age-old scripts.
Unfortunately, today parents and students are involved in dance, without considering their personalities. To a certain extent, numerous pancake make-up and colour base can improve basic complexion.
However, the size of the figure cannot be changed. It is necessary that whether a dancer or dance teacher must maintain their figure throughout their life. Personality is the part and parcel of the art form.

England thrive in World Cup bubble ahead of Croatia semi-final
REPINO, Russia, Monday: As excitement builds in England in the run-up to the countrys first World Cup semi-final for 28 years, midfielder Dele Alli insists Gareth Southgates team are keeping a cool head in their tournament bubble.
Englands matches so far in Russia have attracted huge television audiences at home and wild celebrations, with affable coach Gareth Southgate and his vibrant young squad capturing the hearts of a nation.
In sharp contrast to the feverish atmosphere, Alli and his teammates are in relaxed mood in the sleepy seaside resort of Repino, 45 kilometres (28 miles) northwest of Saint Petersburg.
You are in your own little bubble when here -- training camp, coming back, getting ready for the next game. It is not until you look at social media and the internet that you realise how big it is, Alli said on Monday.
Obviously we know we are playing in the World Cup, in the semi-final. We are so focused on the games that you forget what we have done so far.
It is important that we stay like that, keep going and hopefully we achieve something to make it even more special to get to the final and win it.
Alli scored his first World Cup goal as England cruised into the last four with a 2-0 win over Sweden on Saturday.
A much tougher test is expected in Moscow on Wednesday against a Croatia side that swept past Argentina in the group stages and boasts the midfield talents of Real Madrids Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic of Barcelona.
But while many pundits and even England fans are surprised by their progress, Alli says the squad always believed they could go far.
We had to believe and we know how talented we are as a squad, he added. We know we have some unbelievable players and a great manager and everyone is clear on what we want to do. When you have such a solid foundation, you have the basics and clear understanding of what we want to do and achieve, its not a surprise that its going well for us. - AFP

## Title: Ensuring Gender Equality by 2030

Ensuring Gender Equality by 2030
Step it up for gender equality was one among the many commitments renewed at the 3rd South Asian Speakers Summit on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) implementation, convened by the International Parliamentary Union (IPU) and Sri Lankas Parliament in Colombo, July 11-12, 2018. Accounting for 39.4 percent of Asias population (almost half of this population consisting of women), and projected GDP increases, South Asia is one of the most fastest growing regions on the planet. Ironically, it has declining employment rates, largely affecting women.
South Asia ranks secondlowest on the 2017 Global Gender Gap Index. Womens mean labour force participation rate is 40 percent and national parliamentary representation ranges from 5.8 to 29.5 percent. This is quintessentially grounded in gendered roles and norms privileging men in the public sphere of governance and economy over women in the privacy of domesticity, where womens unpaid care work mediates the low value of all their work and relative exclusion from development. Private and public violence against women and girls is pervasive, demonstrating male power and control.
Addressing this has normative womens rights imperatives embedded in commitments to international instruments and the SDGs. The latters twin-focus on gender goal 5, and mainstreaming gender across other goals promotes sustainable human development. Analysis suggests that South Asias overall GDP gain from closing gender gaps in economies would approximate 25 percent; womens unique socially-determined resources enhances inclusivity of political and socio-economic decision-making and company profits; eliminating violence against them establishes humane, safe, productive societies.
Indian Parliamentarians
Effective parliaments are markers of democratic and accountable governance. In their legislative, oversight, including budget-oversight and representative functions, parliaments are striving to improve SDG implementation and thus leaving no one behind. For instance, 29.5, 27.7, 20 and 21 percent of Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan parliamentarians respectively, are women  among the highest in South Asia, following electoral quotas. 33% of seats in Nepals Constituent Assembly were reserved for women. The knock-the-door campaign led by Jan Sahas, supported by UN Women, saw manual scavengers visiting homes of Indian Parliamentarians urging response to their dire needs.
Parliamentarians raised these in subsequent sessions, leading to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, covering Indias 600,000 scavengers, 95 percent being women. Following reform of the election law in 2016 (further amended in 2017) by the Sri Lankan parliament, providing 25 percent quotas for women in local government, women's representation increased from 1.9 percent to almost 25 percent in the February 2018 elections.
Constitutional reform process
The constitutional reform process initiated in Sri Lanka resulted in a Public Representations Committee Report on Constitutional Reforms, incorporating CSO-UN Women submissions recommending equitable representation of women at all decision-making levels, quotas at election nomination and in Parliamentary Committees, among others.
The Sri Lanka women parliamentarians caucus supported by UN Women prepared a separate submission to the Constitutional Assembly, submitted by the Minister of Women and Child Affairs. Indian Parliamentarians across party lines facilitated by UN Women have been discussing the annual Union budget from a gender perspective immediately after release. Parliaments must transcend bottlenecks to implementing a gender agenda that will address the lack of women parliamentarians, dearth of political will and expertise, the importance of adherence to party discipline, and other inadequate policies, operating procedures, gender-based mechanisms, discriminatory attitudes and inadequate links with womens CSOs and constituencies.
Existing good practice must be enhanced to ensure a critical mass of influential women parliamentarians through electoral gender quotas and strengthened gender capacities of all elected representatives. This involves taking account of womens and mens different concerns, from various marginalized groups - even in neutral terrains like infrastructure or macro-economics. It needs tailored CEDAW-compliant interventions informing all stages of policy and legislative processes, including budget allocations, revenue generation and their gender impacts.
Policies and operating procedures should call for: gender mainstreaming in all Parliamentary work and functions, parliamentary plans, establishing parliamentary committees on women and girls with formal remit, institutionalized links with gender advocates and constituencies to source information, explore violations and press for redress. Gender caucuses across sex and party lines and intentional engagement with male champions, technical gender units in Parliament can strengthen the gender agenda.
Finally rules or lack thereof, on sitting hours, child-care, respectful conduct in-session would further enrich womens participation.

He says that he was able to survive in the battle field in Afghanistan when his mates were massacred one by one by enemy forces due to the strength of the Buddha Dhamma as he fought with the fire arm in one hand and the book of Buddhist stanzas on the other while chanting pirith.
Since the utter and senseless devastation caused to valuable human life and property bought mental frustration he decided to renounce worldly life of luxury and enter the sasana.

Eran calls for increase in entrepreneurs
Sri Lankan entrepreneurs have dropped to 2.68% of its population and urgent steps should be taken to increase this number, State Minister for Finance and Media, Eran Wickramaratne said.
Speaking at the Shippers Council annual general meeting in Colombo on Monday, he said in contrast there are 19% of entrepreneurs in Vietnam and this number is over 20% of the population in Malaysia. He said that in China 7.5% of the population are entrepreneurs, and that Sri Lanka too should produce more entrepreneurs than professionals. Entrepreneurs create wealth, jobs and most importantly a better future for the country.
The Minister said that its the entrepreneur and not the bank that takes a risk when making an investment and hence they should be supported and somebody must shoulder their risk.
Its with this intention that the government came up with a program to support new and also existing ones to assist them with credit facilities.
He also said that the since coming in to power the government has taken several meaningful steps to support businesses and exporters and have removed over 1,200 para tariffs.
Wickramaratne also said that there should be more foreign participation in Sri Lankan businesses which would help increase productivity. Before the liberalisation of the telecommunication sector a person had to wait 10 months to receive a phone connection but today it takes less than 10 minutes to get one. Similarly tourism sector too opened up and today there are several global hotel chains such as Shangri La which has helped enhance the Sri Lanka tourism sector.
In the same terms shipping sector too should be liberalised and foreign players in the industry should be requested to call over to Colombo.
The State Minister also said that the education sector too should have more foreign universities in Sri Lanka. Five decades ago parents wanted their child to be a doctor, engineer or a lawyer and today too this thinking pattern remains. This negative mind-set should change and there are better options for employment.
Commenting on leadership he said future leaders of Sri Lanka should be from the industrial sector to lead the country to prosperity.
I still think Sri Lanka does not have a clear vision for its country for the future and the time is now right to have one, he said.

Federer emulates Tendulkar with cricket-style shot at Wimbledon
Sachin Tendulkar was renowned for his textbook technique but he now has a competitor in tennis legend Roger Federer, who channeled his inner Tendulkar during his round of 16 match at Wimbledon.
The Swiss maestro swept away his opponent Adrian Manarinno in three sets, but it was a nonchalant flow of the racket in the third set which caught the eyes of willow-lovers.
Federer over-hit a backhand and when his opponent courteously returned the ball, the eight-time Wimbledon champion elected to display his cricket skills, with a punched forward defence, which didnt go unnoticed by Wimbledons social media accounts. The 36-year-old is more renowned for defending tennis titles than forward defences, but this dexterous left-handed shot displayed his innate sporting talent.
Furthermore, it was straight out the middle of the strings. It would a lot of chat from the slip cordon to get an edge out of this legend!
Heres to seeing Roger pull off the Dilscoop in his quarter-final.

Federer, Nadal and Djokovic face Wimbledon Centre Court dilemma
LONDON: Novak Djokovic insists it's only fair that he should play his Wimbledon quarter-final on Centre Court on Wednesday, handing the All England Club a dilemma over relegating Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal to Court One.
Despite being a three-time champion, Djokovic has featured just once on Centre Court -- against British home favourite Kyle Edmund in the last 32 -- in the opening four rounds.
By contrast, eight-time champion Federer, and Nadal, the title winner on two occasions, have played exclusively on the 15,000-seater Centre Court.
So, with two quarter-finals being played on Centre Court and two on Court One, something has got to give.
We'll see. Hopefully, said Djokovic when asked if he expected to face Japan's Kei Nishikori on the most famous arena in tennis.
The Serb went on to tell Serbian media that he deserved to be on Centre Court.
Djokovic has played twice on the 11,000-capacity Court One this year but was shunted off to the 4,000-seater Court Two for his second round clash against Horacio Zeballos.
Three times he was scheduled last on court, putting him at risk of falling victim to fading light with the burden of having to return the following day.
He managed to finish off Russia's Karen Khachanov in straight sets in the gathering gloom on Monday.
Twelve months ago, his last-16 match with Adrian Mannarino, also scheduled for Court One, was cancelled despite Centre Court with its retractable roof being available.
Djokovic had to play that fourth round on Tuesday and quarter-final on Wednesday when he was forced to retire against Tomas Berdych with an elbow injury.
On Monday, he almost fell victim to the scheduling curse again.
I heard that the organisers were planning to cancel my match if Gael Monfils and Kevin Anderson went to a fifth. Luckily for me it didn't happen, he said of the tie which preceded his clash with Khachanov.
Bizarrely, organisers decided to put a mixed doubles match on Centre Court, which was concluded under the roof after sunset.
It's what I wished for, said Djokovic when asked if he would have preferred to move to Centre Court.
Like last year, I received the information that they can't reschedule my match on the other court because of the tickets that are presold.
I guess there are other factors that play in. Wherever he ends up playing, Djokovic, the 2011, 2014 and 2015 champion, will be favourite to see off Nishikori for a 14th time in 16 meetings.
Nishikori is playing in his first Wimbledon quarter-final.
He is also the first Japanese man to reach the quarter-finals since Shuzo Matsuoka in 1995.
It's always like a big war for me, said Nishikori on facing Djokovic.
Defending champion Federer will be playing in his 16th Wimbledon quarter-final and 53rd at all Grand Slams.
His opponent on Wednesday is eighth-seeded Kevin Anderson, the first South African since Wayne Ferreira in 1994 to get to the last eight.
Top seed Federer, 36, has now won 32 consecutive sets at Wimbledon, just two behind his record run from the third round in 2005 to his title triumph in 2006.
He also holds a 4-0 career lead over 2017 US Open runner-up Anderson who has yet to take a set off the Swiss.
Federer hasn't dropped serve at Wimbledon so far but is wary of the challenge posed by Anderson whose big serving style is flourishing on courts cooked by last week's heatwave.
It's definitely helped a certain style of player, maybe the big servers, said 20-time major winner Federer.
- 'It's about being smart' - Nadal has made the quarter-finals for the first time since finishing runner-up to Djokovic in 2011.
The world number one, chasing an 18th major, will now take on Juan Martin del Potro boasting a 10-5 career lead.

First Saudi model to walk at Paris Couture Week
This week 17-year-old Taleedah Tamer opened the Antonio Grimaldi couture show in Paris. Thats a big deal for any model, but especially so for Taleedah  the first Saudi model to walk a couture runway in Paris.
Born and raised in Jidda by an Italian mum and a Saudi dad, Taleedah didnt think the world of fashion was open to her. Now shes appeared on the cover of Harpers Bazaar Arabia and has walked a major catwalk show.
When I was younger, it didnt cross my mind not to see Saudi women on magazine covers or in fashion shoots, but as I got older, I thought why do these women not look like me Taleedah said in her Bazaar interview.
And why can modelling not be done in a way thats respectful of our culture Obviously it hasnt been that prevalent to see Saudi women in this way, so being one of the first makes you representative of a larger community, and theres a lot of pressure that comes with that. When I first started modelling I never thought that Id be the first Saudi model, but it seems like the perfect time for the industry to open up. I want to represent Saudi women who are strong and beautiful.
Taleedah now plans to move to Milan so she can study and continue to work in the fashion industry  a pragmatic choice considering working as a model remains a dangerous move in Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia remains one of the most restrictive societies in the world for women (Saudi women have only just been given the right to drive and attend football matches), and the act of showing skin and wearing fashion-forward clothing is frowned upon.
There are models working in Saudi Arabia, but its rare for them to have an international platform, and are often only booked to walk in front of all-women audiences.
Earlier this year a fashion show resorted to using drones to step around restrictive guidelines, in a move that was mocked outside the country.
I know there will be Saudis that will not agree with me modeling, Taleedah told the New York Times. I respect their right to have an opinion, but also feel very proud that I am able to broaden perceptions of what it means to be a modern Saudi woman in the eyes of the world.
Take a look at some shots from Taleedahs Instagram account, and prepare to see that face everywhere. Times are changing, and were here for it.

Happiness of spiritual service
We all may have some eagerness to achieve something. We will succeed in that or sometimes fail. If we succeed in that, we will be happy, if not we will not be happy.
Whatever our desired goals, which revolve around material possessions, maybe we wont get any fruits for that. But when we wish to do something for God, whether we succeed in it or not, we will reap the fruits, the Sastras say.
Building a temple for God is described as a big service. Those who engage in that service, or helping for that in some way will be bright. If any of their ancestors are in hell, they also will be relieved from the sins they accumulated during the past seven births and achieve eternal bliss. This bliss is enjoyed in the abode of Lord Vishnu, the Skandapurana says.
Building a temple for Lord Vishnu in Colombo is a long time dream of the devotees of Kotahena Sri Sri Radha Krishna temple. This dream is slowly being realized and now they are engaged in building a temple at 188, Newchetty Street, Colombo- 13.
The Construction work is at the final stage of completion. At present the sthapathy and construction workers are very busy to achieve early completion.
The main deities in the temple will be Sri Sri Radha Krishna, along with shrines for Sri Jagannath, Baladev, Subadra deities of Jagannath Puri, Sri Gaura Nitai deity, Sri Narasimha Deity, Lord Luxmi Venkadeswar Lord Ramachandra, Lord Hanuman Anjaneya , and Lord Sri Ranganathar.
The temple will feature dioramas of all the incarnations of Lord Vishnu, Dasavathara and many of Krishnas pastimes.
His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta swami Prabhupada founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness with the purpose that he wanted all the temples built by the society should be as heaven on earth and the temples will fulfill all the spiritual education and cultural needs of everyone to bring peace and prosperity in the world. So the devotees of Lord Vishnu request all of them to engage in the spiritual service.
It is a very great opportunity to the well-wishers and devotees to contribute their part of service to the construction work as it is at the final stage of completion.
The devotees of Lord Vishnu pray for a bright future.

Horse spa pampers ponies
Look, we know life can be a bit hectic at times, but have you ever spared a thought a thought for the horses among us
Dont even try telling me youre stressed before youve been ridden around a paddock, transported down the M1 in a horsebox or had shoes nailed to your feet.
Come back to me when youve dealt with a mild Polo addiction. If you think you deserve a luxe spa experience, then your nearest horse certainly does.
Frazzled horses should get themselves to Emma Massingales home in Holsworth, North Devon, after she set up a spa for her ponies in her back garden.
The 35-year-old professional horse trainer decided to treat her animals after the recent heatwave left them feeling hot and bothered.
Albert and Ernie were treated to a mud mask and clay mask (complete with cooling cucumbers for their eyes), as well as a curl and set blow dry, a hot stone massage and a refreshing dip in the hot tub.
They even had their hooves painted with special animal-friendly clear varnish.
The weather has been so hot for them recently and I havent been able to do their normal training so I thought, what can I do with them that they will enjoy, explains Emma, of her DIY spa. Thats when I came up with the spa idea. They were absolutely loving it. I gave Ernie a clay mask and Albert a mud mask, horses love rolling around in mud so it was just an extension of that really. Although I did have to cut the cucumbers lengthways, so they were big enough for their eyes. I left the stones out in the sun to warm them up and they just lay there for ages enjoying it, says Emma.
Funnily enough the curlers did actually leave a nice wave in their manes too. A few people have asked how you get a horse into a hot tub, but I just asked Ernie to jump in and he did, Emma continues.
The only problem was he enjoyed it so much he wouldnt get out. I had to just get in there with him.
As well as making ponies feel pretty, Emma also works with troubled horses and is the first British person to have developed a language that is so well understood by horses that she can communicate with herds at any time, and carry out complex exercises and manoeuvres working as a team.
Any time spent with an animal interacting like that and doing something they enjoy is beneficial, she says.
Its all about building relationships and they loved every second. I have had horses all my life, my godmother gave me my first pony at six months old, a welsh mountain pony called Minnie. Like many young girls I started riding before I could walk.

House probe misconduct of Wimal, Prasanna
The Parliament Privileges and Ethics Committee has commenced an inquiry into the alleged misconduct of Joint Opposition MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera in Parliament on July 3.
A formal complaint into the incident was made in the House by Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera on July 4 and it was referred to the Parliament Privileges and Ethics Committee the next day.
Deputy Minister Perera brought to the attention of the House that the two JO MPs with their foul language and aggressive behaviour even threatened the Chair and tried to grab the Mace. They ridiculed Parliament and that it amounts to a breach of privileges of all other MPs. He urged that a comprehensive inquiry be held into the incident and tough action taken against the two MPs as per the provisions contained in the newly adopted Standing Orders and Code of Conduct for MPs.
Parliament sources said the Committee which met last Thursday following the complaint, perused the CCTV footage of the incident.
Ministers Thilak Marapana, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Gayantha Karunathilake and UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha had attended the Privileges and Ethics Committee meeting at the Parliament complex.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also previously expressed his deep displeasure over the unruly behaviour of MPs Weerawansa and Ranaweera in the House.

Gem and jewellery industry;
Immense potential to create employment and economic benefits
The FACETS International Gem and Jewelry Exhibition organized by the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewelry Association is scheduled to be held in September.
FACETS has provided small time gem and jewelry merchants with the ideal platform to gain recognition among foreign markets, a veritable window to the world. AS a result many former small timers are now doing well and the industry representatives are upbeat on this positive trend.
Chairman of the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewelry Association, A. H. M. Imtizam said, The National Gem and Jewellery Authority (NGJA) and the Export Development Board (EDB) have played a significant role in constantly recognizing this need. Now, foreign buyers are on the lookout for FACETS and also for our special Ceylon Sapphire; the now know exactly where to look.
Talking about the forthcoming event and the gem and jewellery industry in general, he said, The gem industry has a long tradition going back to our ancient kings. It has provided a livelihood for thousands of people and is replete with stories of rags to riches. The industry continues to function under a system of profit sharing between the owner of the pit and the workers, which has been described as one of the best cooperative systems in the world. Today the industry is on par with that of any country.
Imtizam said, Sri Lanka is and has always been the source of most of the existing varieties of gem stones. The industry boasts a proud history of more than 2000 years and over the years weve shared our knowledge with many other countries including Madagascar and Tanzania.
Today we are capable of processing and adding value to material imported to Sri Lanka from foreign countries.The Gem & Jewelry industry currently utilizes a semi-automated process when it comes to production and manufacturing. Combining local and international knowledge with technology, the industry has fashioned a system that is all our own. We now also provide gem stones and jewelry designs for the watch industry. This calls for work of extreme precision and machinery of the highest standards, said Imtizam, when questioned about the current situation of the Gem & Jewelry industry in Sri Lanka.
Speaking about the major challenges the industry has faced and is currently facing, Imtizam explained the biggest challenge faced by jewelry manufacturers today is the diminishing number of goldsmiths. The lack of awareness in the jewelry villages when it comes to modern technology and machinery is also a significant obstacle in the industry.
Talking about the industrys influence on socio-economic situation, he said, The vast amounts of net foreign exchange the industry earned and its impact on the economy has been significant, not just to those directly connected to the industry, but to all Sri Lankans. The money earned by the average gem dealers now goes into the education of family members and it is heartening to see the children of gem dealers now engaging in other fields bringing about a so called social revolution in the centers of the gem trade such as Ratnapura, Beruwala and Galle.
Imtizam also said Sri Lanka boasts a true mine-to-market industry, both domestically and for export in a fascinating blend of tradition, experience and modernization. Mining is primarily done by use of traditional methods, and is small-scale by choice and design as such mines are considered to be less harmful to the environment and a more stable source of employment for more people.
Lapidary is another area in the trade where the traditional meets the modern in Sri Lanka. Centuries of experience in cutting and polishing continue alongside new technology and design models. The time-honored art of reading rough and orienting stones is integrated with the growing demand of the global market for exact calibration, well-balanced proportions and high quality polish.
Thus the Sri Lankan lapidary industry consists of a fascinating blend of high-powered techniques, utilizing some of the worlds greatest expertise in the orientation of rough, and a growing precision cutting and re-cutting sector that maintains the strictest of tolerances.
Talking about the future of the industry, Imtizam said, the industry has immense potential in terms of employment and economic benefits. The trade is ever willing to engage with the NGJA to formulate policies in this regard for the betterment of the industry and the country.

India will adopt a three-pronged strategy to check China influence
In meetings with ambassadors Suhsma Swaraj reiterated, India must continue to closely watch all Chinese activities, and advise and educate friends in the neighbourhood about how a certain kind of economic engagement with Beijing can have negative consequences for them.
India will adopt a broad, three-pronged approach to deal with Chinas increasing engagement in the South Asian and Indian Ocean neighbourhood  track Beijings activities carefully; pursue its own projects and commitments; and educate and advise neighbours on the consequences of engaging with China.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj laid out this approach at a meeting with top diplomats posted in the neighbourhood last Tuesday on the sidelines of the Head of the Missions Conference, said four officials familiar with the development. The meeting was attended by Minister of State MJ Akbar; Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale; Indias ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale; and the countrys envoys to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation countries  Ajay Bisaria in Pakistan, Vinay Kumar in Afghanistan, Manjeev Singh Puri in Nepal, Harsh Vardhan Shringla in Bangladesh, Taranjit Singh Sandhu in Sri Lanka, Akhilesh Mishra in the Maldives and Jaideep Sarkar in Bhutan.
Regional and geopolitical dynamics
Indian High Commissioner to Mauritius Abhay Thakur and ambassador to Myanmar Vikram Misri were also present.
This was a sub-set of the larger HOM Conference, a closed-door annual MEA affair. This year, multiple themes -- from the need to focus on Indians in distress abroad to deploying soft power and celebrating Gandhis 150th birth anniversary; from Indias global development assistance and cooperation to evolving regional and geopolitical dynamics - came up, said a fifth government official. Swaraj gave the inaugural address and PM Narendra Modi delivered the final keynote speech at the meeting.
It was on the sidelines of this conference that Swaraj held both individual and region-specific meetings with ambassadors posted in Europe, Gulf, African and Latin American countries, besides the neighbourhood. The idea behind the region-specific meetings is to ensure a broad commonality of approach since there are many overlapping themes; it is to understand, in a free and frank internal setting, the views of different ambassadors and if there is anything the ministry can do to help, said the fifth official.
Kicking off the neighbourhood meeting, according to the first official, Swaraj asked the ambassadors to give her a broad sense of what China was doing in each of their countries. Each envoy then spoke briefly about Beijings footprint in the country they serve.
Economic growth in the region
According to the first four officials, the broad sense in the meeting was that in Pakistan, Chinas economic and political dominance had only grown; in Afghanistan, China could not be a strategic partner but its economic and development footprint was minimal and there was room for engagement; in Nepal, while Beijings involvement had grown, PM K P Olis recent visit to China had not broken new ground and was a reiteration of past agreements; in Bangladesh, while the Chinese have made huge economic commitments, many in Dhaka were wary of the debt trap Sri Lanka found itself in; in Sri Lanka, while the government remained politically friendly to India, its economic ties with China had continued apace. In the Maldives, according to the first and second officials, the presentation focused on how there was a conscious attempt by the regime in Male to erase the Indian footprint altogether and China had gained tremendous leverage with investments, already made or in progress, in an airport, bridge, islands and port.
One ambassador, according to the third official, laid out the border context and emphasised that Beijing had given up its defensive posture and was aiming for a Pax Sinica, indicating its ambitions of hegemony. India has to recognise this and make a choice accordingly, the official said. After listening to all the presentations, Swaraj said - according to both the first and second official - that Delhis focus must not be on competing with China on resources.
Instead, she reiterated, India must continue to closely watch all Chinese activities; it must push ahead, with full vigour, its own work, and advise and educate friends in the neighbourhood about how a certain kind of economic engagement with Beijing can have negative consequences for them. This refers broadly to the phenomena of big investments in economically unviable projects with Chinese loans, which then gives Beijing both an economic and strategic foothold and traps the country.
The fifth government, official, however said that it would be wrong to read any such deliberations as policy. You must see this in the nature of an internal brainstorming meeting as a part of a broader conversation on a range of themes. The idea was to seek everyones views; it is a free-wheeling conversation. Everyone is encouraged to speak their minds. This is not in the nature of a policy directive. It is a constructive in-house engagement to understand evolving geopolitics. To interpret this as policy would be wrong.
It is important to understand that China is now explicit about its global and regional ambitions, and within that, its periphery is of high priority, said Ashok Kantha, former ambassador to China and director of the Institute of Chinese Studies.
On our response, the most important part is not to try to mimic or ape China. We dont have to be paranoid about them in the neighbourhood either. They have their own advantages and disadvantages. We need to work on our strengths and leverage those. There is extensive synergy and our inter-connectedness straddles across domains -- from physical proximity to economic ties to cultural links, Kantha said. He added: It is not a question of us educating them, but countries can increasingly see the pitfalls of going ahead with projects which may not be economically viable, without due diligence. They can see the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is not the free largesse it was supposed to be. Sri Lanka is a cautionary tale.
BRI is a Chinese initiative to expand its influence abroad by financing infrastructure projects including railways, roads and power projects, thereby opening up potentially lucrative business opportunities for Chinese companies.

Jaded Croatia look to master Modric to carry them through against England
MOSCOW, Monday: We keep hearing the same question and we give out the same answer, said Croatias Ivan Perisic last week.
Every time a Croatian player appears before the media at this World Cup, he knows a question about Modric is coming, and every time the answer reflects the admiration there is in the squad for their captain.
The 32-year-old has been outstanding in his teams run to a semi-final against England in Moscow on Wednesday, picking up the man-of-the-match award in three of Croatias five matches.
Modric has scored twice in Russia, including a fabulous goal in the 3-0 win over Argentina in the group stage, and twice netted in nail-biting penalty shootouts against Denmark and Russia.
The coolness displayed by the Real Madrid playmaker in the last-16 tie against the Danes was particularly impressive -- having missed a penalty late in extra time, he still stepped up to score another spot-kick only a few minutes later.
After once again starring as Real won a fourth Champions League crown in five seasons by beating Liverpool in Kiev in May, Modric will be almost assured of winning the Ballon dOr if he can lead Croatia all the way to improbable World Cup glory. Ive known Luka for a number of years, not only with the national team. We played at club level as well, says striker Mario Mandzukic, who played with Modric at Dinamo Zagreb a decade ago before the latter joined Tottenham Hotspur.
He deserves all the accolades he gets from the media and public. He has worked very hard to get to this point.
He is our captain, our leader, we follow him and if the team manages a great result and he gets the Ballon dOr he will deserve it, and I want it for him.
COLLECTING DEBTS
For a country like Croatia, with a population of little over four million, to be in the semi-finals of the World Cup is a remarkable achievement. There is little prospect that they would have come this far without Modric, who as a boy was forced to flee his village home after his grandfather was killed by Serb forces in the Croatian independence war.
But this is a player whose reputation took a battering at home before the tournament due to his implication in the multi-million-euro corruption trial of former Dinamo Zagreb chief Zdravko Mamic.  AFP

Kerber downs Kasatkina to make Wimbledon semis
LONDON: Angelique Kerber clinched her third appearance in the Wimbledon semi-finals with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Russian 14th seed Daria Kasatkina on Tuesday.
Kerber is bidding to win the Wimbledon title for the first time after losing the 2016 final to Serena Williams.
The 30-year-old German remains on course after booking the seventh Grand Slam semi-final berth of her career.
Kerber, who won the Australian and US Open titles in 2016, plays former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko on Thursday for a place in Saturday's final.
I was expecting a close match. We've played so many tough matches, Kerber said after she finally sealed the win on her seventh match point.
We both played on a really high level. I was just trying to stay focused on my serve. It's great to be in the semis.
She was moving me very much. I was not thinking too much about the match points. I was just trying to push myself until the limits actually. Kerber is seeded 11th and, after a week of shock defeats for her title rivals, that makes her the highest ranked woman left in the draw.
For the first time in the Open era, not a single top 10 seed has made the quarter-finals at one of the four Grand Slams.
Kerber beat Kasatkina on grass at Eastbourne two weeks ago and again she was in control, finishing off the first set with ease before landing an early break in the second.
Kasatkina, 21, was making the first Grand Slam semi-final of her promising young career and she pushed Kerber hard in the closing stages before the German finally delivered the knockout blow. AFP

Kotahena, Pettah killings related to drug wars, police say
Investigations pertaining to the Jampettah Street shooting (on July 8) and the Pettah shooting (on July 9) are being carried out under the directives of the DIG in charge of the Colombo area and the Colombo Crimes Division, said Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara.

His wife Kudu Selvy was also gunned down several years ago, according to SP Gunasekara. It is reported that the couple who were killed in Sundays shooting and Ganeshs group had a long-standing feud and police suspect that Sundays shooting may have been carried out by Ganeshs group.
Meanwhile, the Colombo Municipal Councillor who was gunned down in Sea Street, Pettah, on July 9, is said to be a person who was out on bail over two cannabis-related cases. The victim, Krishnapillai Thirubanandan alias Krishna (40) had been arrested twice previously for possession of cannabis.

Lanka, a fully developed country by 2050 - PM
Plans have already been formulated and the necessary foundation laid to transform Sri Lanka into a fully developed country by 2050, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Undoubtedly this is a challenging task which ought to be carried forward with patience and prudence by working with a group of people with divergent views, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister expressed these sentiments participating in a Question and Answer session of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Business Conference organised by the Trade and Industry Ministry of Singapore in association with the Singapore Business Forum on July 10. The large number of Sri Lankan and Singaporean Businessmen and Entrepreneurs attended the conference held at the Jan Tanglin Hotel in Singapore.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that since Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean has been clearly understood the longtime target is to develop the country into an Economic, Financial and Social Centre. Sri Lanka is taking dedicated efforts to create a society based on the export economy by inheriting new technology. Pointing out that friendship and co-operation with all countries in the world is the avowed policy of Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister added that it would strive to further strengthen friendship and co-operation with Asian counties such as India, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Korea, Japan and China.
Explaining the Economic, Industrial and Tourist Zones to be set up locally in future, he pointed out the investment opportunities available to target 9 million people living around the Expressway network linking Colombo-Kandy and Hambantota.
Singapores Trade and Industries Minister S. Iswaran also spoke on this occasion.
Here are some of the questions asked the answers given by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during the occasion.
QUESTION:- What are the plans available in Sri Lanka for entrepreneurship development
ANSWER: At the outset an entrepreneurship culture should be promoted in the country. Traditionally we have been a trading nation and that tradition is still existent in the country. There is a large group of youth entrepreneurs in the country but their main problem is finding financial basis. The countrys banking institutions are still operating with caution and traditional basis. However much the government assisted small and medium scale ventures the assistance received from Banks is inadequate. As such the government has introduced relief measures to support entrepreneurs who have launched business ventures.
Loan facilities for medium scale business ventures should be expedited. Banks in Sri Lanka should become project based institutions. The export culture should be introduced to small and medium scale business ventures.
QUESTION: What is the impact of the Colombo Port City Project on the Economy of Sri Lanka
ANSWER: The Colombo Port City Project was started for property trade development. But under our government it has been planned to transform it into a financial city. Land filling in it will be completed by next year and thereafter building construction would begin. Already several financial cities have been set up in the Indian Ocean area. As such we should think of new services to be set up there. This is a project with a 10 year plan.
The Prime Minister said during his visit to England a few weeks ago, he discussed possibilities of implementing the English laws in the financial city. Authorities in England agreed to discuss about the implementation of English laws and lend all possible support in this direction. Already plans are underway to introduce several new legislations relating to the financial city in Sri Lanka.
The first step is to institute a Financial Commission. After discussing the matter and attendant problems and issues with the Attorney General a Cabinet paper would be submitted for setting up the financial commission of the Port Financial City within the next two months.
QUESTION: How will the data collection and analysis process take place correspondent to the future vision
ANSWER: Data collection work is already in progress. An analysis in made on the impact made on the countrys economy.
Data collection and analysis will be undertaken in cooperation with other countries in the future. This will be the final step towards making Sri Lanka the economic hub of the Indian ocean the Prime Minister said. Development strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickreme who delivered the inaugural lecture at the session said the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA will provide a positive message about Sri Lankas development goals to the whole world. The government is committed to make Sri Lanka an economic hub in the Indian Ocean. The necessary internal reforms are now underway to make this possible laying emphasis on the Asian supply network and the environment would be created to link with it through export industries. For this Free Trade Agreements would be signed with several other countries.
Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage, Sri Lankas High Commissioner in Singapore, Nimal Weeraratne and Colombos Mayor Rosy Senanayake were also present on the occasion.

On Sunday the Sri Lanka A team played this side and the match ended in a nil-all draw.In a good game of football, a big hand should go to the players and the national coach Nizam Packeer Ali for an excellent display of football. The visitors too addressed the match in the same manner. It was a thrilling encounter; both teams controlled the ball well with their feet.
The 200th ranked Sri Lanka side played a tireless game showing greater ball control. The 126th placed side Lithuania too gave a good display, but the Sri Lanka defence held them from scoring. It was an action packed game of football, where Sri Lanka football lovers enjoyed a game with a foreign team after many years.

A brainchild of renowned architect, Milroy Perera, the residential apartment tower is a holistic green building which accommodates 171 apartments across 47 floors.
The planted terraces offer the building a unique character while providing many benefits: Formation of a green cover provides a natural cooling system for the entire building, resulting not only in a fresher, more relaxing atmosphere, but also less energy consumption on air-conditioning.
This blanket of trees endows the building with an innate soundproofing system. It also provides shade and buffer radiant heat. Clearpoint is also the first high-rise building in Sri Lanka to contain fully-fledged rainwater harvesting, automated drip irrigation, grey water recycling and solid waste disposal systems, as well as solar panels that can power all its common areas.
Commenting on the award, Director Engineering of Maga Engineering and Project Director, Asoka de Silva said, An exciting project from inception, Clearpoint offered us many unique design and construction challenges along the way. Some of these included the construction of cantilevered terraces on every floor, cantilevered private swimming pools on select floors, planting of endemic trees on terraces and the construction of a curved solar panel assembly on the rooftop. Our clear vision at the commencement of project and commitment from the project execution team, made this vision a reality and enabled us to complete the project on schedule and with budget. Designed and built by an entirely Sri Lankan group of professionals, the project is a testimony to the engineering and construction expertise held within the local construction industry.
Assistant General Manager and Project Manager, Saman Mahawatta said Considering the nature and scale of this unique project, meticulous planning of all salient aspects of project management, covering quality, cost, time, safety and environment was carried out. This enabled us to anticipate the complex construction and operational challenges in advance, eventually resulting in the projects timely completion and handover. Another the key challenge was to train, retain and manage the large workforce nearing 1000 to ensure smooth operations of work throughout the project. I convey my gratitude to the dedicated project team for the successful completion of this landmark building.
This award also endorses Magas investments in leading the cause of promoting green buildings in Sri Lanka as the leader in the construction sector of the country.
The company remains focused on service and product excellence and is committed to its vision of creating lasting socio-economic value for all stakeholders.

Making hay while the sun shines  sad tale of SLC
So the much hyped about Lankan Premier League (LPL) will not take place as scheduled in mid-August this year.
The news that it will not be held did not come officially from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) but from former Sri Lanka cricketer turned international commentator Russel Arnold who was the director for the tournament who tweeted: Hi Folks !!! The Lankan Premier League which was to be played in Aug/Sep has been postponed.
From the outset it was clear that Sri Lanka does not need that kind of tournament because we dont have the market like India (Indian Premier League) or Australia (Big Bash League) to sustain a showpiece T20 of that magnitude.
It was not commercial concerns that forced the postponement on this occasion but the absence of an elected or appointed body to administer cricket. This is the third time out of four attempts a T20 showpiece has been cancelled by SLC.
The current state of affairs of the countrys cricket administration which is being run by a Competent Authority appointed by the Minister of Sports is in no position to undertake such a task and Arnold has found little or no support coming his way to go ahead with the tournament.
It is no surprise that Sri Lanka cricket finds itself in such a mess today with a court injunction holding up proceedings and preventing an AGM from taking place. Even if the AGM was held as scheduled on May 31 what purpose would it have served
The same faces that had administered cricket for the past two years and brought cricket down to its knees through mismanagement would have got re-elected and continued from where they left off.
The whole crux of the matter is that there is no law in this country to punish the people who rob the SLC of its finances. The individuals get elected or appointed (as in the case of interim committees) and during their term in office make the most of the finances that SLC has and they are sent out without being questioned or brought to book as there is no law in place to punish them.
A good clear example was during the Cricket World Cup in 2011 when the interim committee headed by DS de Silva utilized SLC funds to build a cricket stadium in Hambantota and to upgrade two other stadiums in Colombo and Pallekele that eventually left SLC in the red with overdrawn bank accounts and with no money left to pay its employees or the contracted players.
For the past 15-20 years or so this has been the trend with elected and certain appointed administrations whose sole purpose of getting elected to the portals of SLC is to make money. Such incidents do not get highlighted so much in the media when the national cricket team is performing well. At the moment it is not doing so well in all three formats.
The signing of television rights and calling for tenders are two areas where the SLC is cleaned up of all its hard earned profits that come from the sweat and toil of our cricketers. There are millions and billions of dollars exchanged when TV rights are signed and when tenders are called for during tours for hotels, transport, meals etc.
It is not only the elected cricket officials who benefit but even the Sports Ministers whose interference in SLC affairs must stop. There have been several instances of Sports Ministers making a fast buck on TV deals in the past and the carnival goes on. Also there should not be interference with cricket selections or the appointment of selectors by the Sports Minister. That area has to be entrusted to the SLC to appoint their own selection committee who in turn picks the teams.
Another sad plight that has come to light is the attitude of the officials and employees at SLC. When they sit down at their desk in the mornings the first thing they think of is how they can make their next fast buck.
If all financial matters of SLC are handled by a treasury appointed official this abuse of finances will not take place and tenders will not be passed at the blink of an eyelid as it is done today.
A question that is often asked by many cricket followers is: Was head coach Chandika Hathurusinghas predecessor Graham Ford given the same freedom by SLC that Hathu enjoys today
Ford was doing all right until SLC brought former cricketer Asanka Gurusinha from Down Under and made him cricket manager of the team and then a national selector. It was after that, that things began to get awry and Ford decided to quit ahead of time.
The present court injunction that is pending is for misappropriation of funds by the Sumathipala administration. It is no secret that a lot of money is spent to buy votes ahead of elections and the present constitution does not give another candidate a ghost of a chance of winning the election. What is required is through Parliament to change the constitution of the SLC by the Sports Law which supersedes everything else. Only the Sports Minister can do it and that can happen only if he has Sri Lanka cricket at heart.

The law of the land should be promptly exercised against the persons who instigate terrorism, the National Bhikkhu Front (NBF) said.
The NBF urged the government to take prompt action against the persons who make statements on behalf of terrorists and stand for terrorism.
NBF Secretary Ven. Wakamulle Uditha Thera said that such statements which harm co-existence and the national integrity of the country can never be accepted. Moreover statements of this nature are against the Constitution of the country.
Addressing a media briefing organised by the NBF yesterday, Ven. UdithaThera said that Parliamentarians should act in accordance with the Constitution and it is illegal to make statements which clash with Constitutional provisions.
The Thera added that not only statements, but also acts which encourage terrorism and separatism are strictly condemned by the NBF. There are persons who want to bring the country to the dark era again and therefore they fuel separatism. But no one has the right to stand for terrorism which brought havoc to the country for over three decades, he said.
Speaking on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, the Thera said that the 20th Amendment is much needed to curtail the powers of the executive presidency.
It should be brought forward and it is a timely need, the Thera said.

NCE Forum on Women to the Fore in Exports on July 25
The National Chamber of Exporters, (NCE) will conduct an important Forum on July 25, 2018 at the Galle Face Hotel Colombo, with a view to support Women Entrepreneurship in business, especially exports, and also to enhance the leadership roles and performance of women who are already engaged in export enterprises.
This objective of the forum is allied with the stated policy of the Government to encourage increased participation of women in the economic development of Sri Lanka through their leadership in policy making and related economic activities. It is also reflected in the legislation that has already been enacted by the Government to ensure the participation of a minimum of 25% women in all elected legislative bodies, as well as the desire of the Government to increase the number of registered exporters from the current approximately 3500 by an additional 2000 by the year 2020, with a view to achieve national export and economic development targets under its Vision 2025 policy document as well as the National Export Strategy.
The Forum will focus on the identification of issues, both at the policy and operational levels, which hinders the participation of women in business activities and particularly in exports, with the sole aim of encouraging and enhancing the participation of women in export trade by exploiting overseas markets for their products and services, through efficient and cost effective cross border trading activities.
Women in Sri Lanka constitutes approximately 57% of the total population of a little over 21 million. However, out of the total economically active 8.5 million persons, only a little over 33% are women. As such around 70% of the labour force constitutes economically inactive women.
Women contribute to the rural economy in diverse ways ranging from small village self-help groups, to leadership roles in decision making processes at different levels. However, there are still inadequate opportunities for women to actively engage in economic development activities, although women centric programs have been organized by governments and as well as non-governmental institutions in the past.
In this regard it is noteworthy that the present Government has given priority to focus on potential women entrepreneurs and women led enterprises by providing financial and technical assistance on special concessionary terms under the Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme announced in the last budget, and which has commenced implementation this month.
It is a fact that women although in limited numbers, play an important role in business and trade, and occupy top positions in many Sri Lankan entities both in the State and Private Sector.
In this context it is noteworthy that women play an important role by providing leadership in important trade related State Institutions such as the Export Development Board, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Customs, the Department of Import & Export Control etc.; Women also occupy Senior Managerial positions in many State Institutions, in addition to their leadership roles in some private enterprises both as entrepreneurs, and occupants of key managerial positions.
This shows their potential to contribute effectively to the overall economic development of Sri Lanka given the opportunity to do so.
Although there have been some Government initiated programs in the past to encourage and facilitate women led businesses, it appears that information related to these programs have not been highlighted or have not effectively filtered down to prospective entrepreneurs, especially in the SME Sector.
In this context the Forum will highlight and elaborate the available Government assistance for women led businesses, especially women led startups, since the objective of the NCE is to encourage women entrepreneurs to focus on the field of exports as a professional career path, as well as a rewarding business.
The Chief Guest at the Forum will be Amena Arif, who is the Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is an affiliate of the World Bank.
She will address the Forum from an International perspective of the potential for women to play leadership roles in business and related fields, and the paths that are available and open to them. As such her address will add more value and depth to the Forum from a financial, and inclusive growth perspective.
The guest of honour at the Forum will be Varuni Amunugama Fernando, who is a successful Sri Lankan Businesswoman and a prominent figure in the advertising industry of Sri Lanka.
She is the Creative Head of TRIAD Private Limited and is also the Co-Founder of TRIAD as its Joint Managing Director, as well as a Group of 22 Companies with over 17 years experience in the field of advertising and related fields.
She will deliver the key-note address related to her success story, to inspire other potential women entrepreneurs.
The presentations will be followed by a panel discussion of Professional Women Panelists, who are either Leaders of their respective Institutions or achieves of excellence in their respective fields.
They comprise the following: Ramya Weerakoon - Leadership and Excellence in the Apparel and Horticulture Sector, Shamalie Wickremasinghe - Leadership & Excellence in the Confectionery Sector, Dr. Sulochana Sigera, - Leadership on Women in Management, Waruni Amunugama Fernando  Leadership and Excellence in the advertising and related fields,
Lakmini Wijesundara - Leadership and Excellence in the field of Information & Technology, Anushka Wijesinghe - Specialist on Government Initiatives to support women led enterprises. The Panel discussion will be moderated by Nisthar Cassim, Chief Editor of the Daily FT.
The target audience of the Forum are Women Entrepreneurs who are already active in the field of Exports and related services, as well as those who have the potential to become entrepreneurs in the Field of Exports and related services, especially in the small business category.
The Chamber invites all potential Sri Lankan Women Entrepreneurs, especially potential entrepreneurs in the Field of Exports, as well as those already engaged in some aspect of business, to make use of this opportunity, to learn about the assistance available to them to forge ahead in their career paths, and learn from the success stories of those who have achieved excellence in their respective fields.

New laws to curb underworld activities
Steps will be taken to curb underworld activities and various other rackets within the prison system even by bringing in new laws, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said.
Both Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale have already discussed this matter and decided to take necessary measures towards this end, said the Deputy Minister.
He stressed the importance of taking necessary measures to conduct raids by the police and the army at prisons. Deputy Minister Bandara made these observations at a media conference held at Sirikotha yesterday.
He further said that underworld activists and other racketeers become more powerful while they are at the prisons since they can easily build relationships with other racketeers.
Sometimes, we have to stop certain money transferring facilities in the future to avoid rackets within prisons since most of the racketeers easily use this facility, he added.
Responding to a statement by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa claiming that the rule of law in the country has collapsed, the Deputy Minister said that former Defence Secretary has completely forgotten history and how journalists were treated and also those who protested against the government by demanding their rights.
Refuting the allegation leveled against the government by the former Defence Secretary, Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said that a large number of raids have been conducted by the police and drug smugglers arrested and firearms seized.
Around 798 firearms and 2882 ammunitions had been taken into custody during raids conducted from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018. Around 335 firearms and 7375 ammunitions had been taken into custody during the period from January 1, 2018 to July 2, 2018.
Around 278 kgs of Heroin had been taken into custody during 29282 raids conducted in 2017.

Oh, baby!
Mum Vicky Green made history after having twins 12 days apart. Hospital doctors delivered llb 8oz son Presley Bradshaw after Vicky, 32, went into premature labour.
With twins, the second tot normally arrives within the hour but Vickys contractions stopped. Medics decided it would be better for daughter Paisley to develop inside Vicky.
Twelve days later, on June 20, they delivered the 2lbs 8oz infant by caesarean section after Vicky developed a potentially life-threatening infection. The babies hold the record for twins born the longest time apart in England. They are expected to remain in St Marys Hospital, Manchester, for several months while they develop. Vicky, who discovered she was pregnant only three weeks before Presleys birth at 26 weeks, said, I couldnt believe it when just one twin was born and the other stayed inside.
The teaching assistant, who lives with partner Darren Bradshaw, 31, in Manchester, added, It was a really strange sensation. My bump was still growing even though Id given birth. It was such a relief when Paisley was born safely too.
She went on, They are doing incredibly well and gaining weight every day. They are little fighters and the most amazing surprise any mum could have.

PAYE tax calculation to be modified
The Government has decided to grant additional relief and cash benefits to the people and modify the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax calculation, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said yesterday.
The revisions will be made by way of an amendment to the newly introduced Inland Revenue Act.
The State Minister posting in his official Tweeter account said some tweaking to the PAYE tax calculation would be made shortly to benefit mid and upper mid level executives as well as bulk of private sector. He also hinted that additional relief of cash benefits could also be expected.
He said an adjustment on vehicle benefits has already been done by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue Department.
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera speaking in Parliament recently said a series of amendments to rectify the identified loopholes of the IR Act will be presented in Parliament early this month.
Among the revisions he mentioned were the removal of 15 percent VAT on channeling at private hospitals, exemption of all savings accounts of children less than 18 years from income tax and
exemption of royalty payments upto Rs 50,000 per month from income tax.
The new Inland Revenue Act came into operation from April 1. It introduced a new income tax structure to raise the state revenue by closing existing loopholes in revenue collection.

P.M.B. ready to purchase Yala paddy harvest
Paddy Marketing Board has taken initial steps to purchase paddy harvest of Yala season in Matale district, an officer of P.M.B. said.
At the beginning of August, Yala harvesting period will begin while the paddy stores in the district are clearing now so as to store the paddy harvest reaping from the Yala season. The state guaranteed price of Nadu and samba varieties is Rs.38 and Rs.41 respectively while the private sector is purchasing these varieties for Rs.40 and Rs.45 per kilo respectively.
However, Paddy Marketing Board is taking paddy on due standard. Therefore, farmers are reluctant to sell their paddy to P.M.B. though the private sector does not care about any standard. Under this situation, farmers are eager to sell their paddy harvest to the private sector. In accordance with that, during the current season, farmers can sell their paddy harvest without any delay, officers said.

Posters against Vijayakala in North
Posters carrying several allegations against the former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran which include the alleged sale of her State Ministerial portfolio for Rs.500 million have been pasted around Jaffna.
The posters state that she had tried to protect those who raped and murdered Vidya, sold her position for Rs.500 million and it asks whether she is suitable to be a Member of Parliament.
It has been reported that the Nalei Naleimurei group has allegedly carried out this poster campaign in the Jaffna, Chavakachcheri and Kodikamam areas.
The State Minister resigned from her post in the wake of severe criticism over her remarks that the LTTE should be reawakened.

Vijayakalas controversial statement:
Principal focus where ideals clash
During the past few weeks, we have seen comments from both the North and South yearning for a more authoritarian government to regulate the countrys law and order.
Former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran created an uproar among Southern politicians when she asked that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) be brought back to ensure the safety of women and children in the North and East.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya referred the matter of Maheswarans statement to the Attorney-General and pending investigations, Maheswaran decided to resign from her ministerial post. The United National Party (UNP) appointed a three-member committee to delve into the details of her statement, following her explanation to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Maheswaran was not alone when she expressed those sentiments; Northern Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran made an attempt to justify her claim, as did Provincial Councillor Anandi Shashidharan. It appeared that most people did not recognise democratic freedom due to the inadequacies in maintaining law and order within the country.
In the South, Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter called upon former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to form a government with the help of the military in order to impose a draconian rule similar to that of the former leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler. It seemed that people were more inclined towards experiencing a disciplined society, even with more dictatorial powers established by rulers.
When Maheswaran called for the LTTE, did she honestly mean that she wanted an LTTE rule where people were killed and harassed without any justification The law and order situation at the time prevailed due to fear, and the paranoia among that prevailed among people cannot be denied. Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, the other day, said he was disappointed with the government as it had failed to deliver what was promised. Recently, he had said that he would not support the current governments re-election, if it were to fail to implement what the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) had promised the people. Is it that the people are dissatisfied with what is currently taking place in the Northern Peninsula, while comparing the rule of the LTTE with that of the present
It is noteworthy that Hitler rose in Germany following the democratic Weimar governments inability to control a worsening economic situation and the LTTE in Sri Lanka rose in part due to the failure of democratic Tamil politicians such as A. Amirthalingam, to win the rights of Tamils through democratic means.
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran said he did not think former MP Vijayakala Maheshwaran was in the wrong with regard to her statement on the LTTE.
He said that Tamil people would accept a solution based on proposals made by the previous government.
These proposals were made by the previous regime when the LTTE was in operation. If the present government says that they will not bring a solution based on these proposals as the LTTE is no more, that is wrong, Sumanthiran said.
It suggests that the government is ready to find a solution only if the LTTE was still in existence, he said.
The following are excerpts of what politicians from both the North and South thought of the situation of democracy in the country in the wake of the comments made during the last two weeks:
MP Navin Dissanayake
Vijayakala Maheswaran may lose her MP post upon the completion of the disciplinary inquiry initiated by the party. She had to resign from her ministerial position as it was considered wrong to retain it after making such a statement.
A party-level inquiry would be held and disciplinary action would be taken against her accordingly. Overall, the people in Sri Lanka always preferred a democratic government, not an authoritarian government.
Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Anunayaka Thera referred to the entry of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa; it had nothing to do with the government and does not mean that people prefer an authoritarian government.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara
In the heat of passion, the situation in the North had affected her painfully. It was an illegal statement which need not have been taken as a threat, but as a reaction considering the state of affairs in the North.
We need to see the context in which the statement was made. If she persists about the statement, then she should be prosecuted. If she had extended her apologies and repented on what she said, then we should stand in favour of her, considering the context.
It was a sharp reaction, but no offence should be taken until she says that she meant what she said.
The Anunayaka Theras statement was not acceptable to the majority in the country. He did not mean that an authoritarian government should be established through constitutional means.
Those statements were made due to lack of proper implementation of law and order. The Anunayaka Thera also wanted a person to take the matters seriously and find a solution.
It was not a threat to democracy. Majority of Sri Lankans prefer a democratic government. People are inclined to dissent on such issues and are unlikely to give up that right.
MP Dayasiri Jayasekara
People would search for alternatives when law and order is not implemented properly. We are all politicians who wish for a democratic government.
Taking the prevailing situation in North into consideration, Maheshwaran was desperate. But I disagree with her statement by all means. She broke the vow she made in Parliament when she assumed duties as one of its members.
Thirty years of war ended and we never expect Prabhakaran to return. There can be neither a Prabhakaran in the North nor a Hitler in the South; both are unacceptable.
The statements were threats to democracy and people have begun to think that only an authoritarian government would bring solutions to their problems; they are searching for a strong ruler.
MP Mailvaganam Thilakarajah
The original intention of her statement was something different. She said that in order to maintain law and order, the LTTE should return; which meant that during the the civil war, numerous social issues were controlled by the LTTE. I believe that was her original message.
I too agree that during the LTTE period, there were fewer cases of domestic violence and rapebut that was only because they threatened people. If anyone opposed them, they would have been hanged.
However, in the long run, violence cannot be stopped with more violence. Social issues cannot be solved in that manner. The LTTE were viscous, regardless of their cause. Youths committing crimes in the North and East at present, were children during the LTTE era. They learnt that violent culture from them and now, they are practising it.
If Maheswaran wishes to protect society from violence, she best promote discipline and ethics rather than stating that the LTTE should return. However, I do not believe that her speech asked for the LTTEs reemergence and another civil warthat was the interpretation made by the South. But it was the same South that wanted a local version of Hitler to surface. I do not want a Prabhakaran from the North or a Hitler from the Southviolence should not be promoted either way.
For 30 years, our countrys citizens lived under perilous circumstances. We grew up with that kind of ideology and that is why our first reaction to such a problem is to spiral back into the only thing we knew, thinking that it is the only way.
Therefore, we must change our attitudes; the countrys people, their representatives, the clergywe must all change our way of thinking.
Minister Anandhi Sasidharan
Women serving as members of Parliament, while holding ministerial positions had spoken openly on several occasions regarding the prevailing patriarchal nature in the country. I see this controversy over Maheswaran as an outcome of the male-dominated hierarchy.
The golden age for the North was during the LTTEs rule, and I do not see anything wrong in recalling the good old days. It was after the LTTE was defeated that we saw a rise in illegal activities in the country. Being the Northern Province Women and Child Affairs Minister, it is unfortunate for me to say that a woman cannot even walk safely alone on the road.
The JVP protested against the then government and took up arms to fight against the state. Now, they say that Maheswaran should apologise for making such a statement. My question is, how could they tell that to her They themselves being one of the groups who protested with violence.
Provincial Councillor C. V. K. Sivagnanam
It was an emotional statement delivered by Maheswaran; she did not mean it. Even though she did not say that she was going to reform the LTTE, being one of the ministers representing the government, it was an inappropriate statement.
Even those who had forgotten about Prabhakaran and Thileepan were now speaking about them, given what had been happening in the North. It was during such a situation that Maheswaran made the statement.
It is important for people in high positions to talk in a responsible manner. Maheswaran had to resign from her position as she spoke while disregarding her responsibilities. But I respect her sentiment.
Former MP Selvaraja Kajendren
Maheswarans statement on the LTTE resulted in island-wide arguments and discussions. The party that she represented instigated racism within the country. It was her party that began to settle Sinhala Buddhists in our lands to initiate racial tension.
By removing Karuna Amman, they weakened the LTTE. The same party continues to be a hindrance to the people in the North especially, and Maheswaran pledged to support them.
But I agree with the statement she made that the presence of LTTE would be vital to control increasing criminal activity. From 1985 to 2009, the North was under the control of the LTTEand was a time when women and children were safe and all internal caste issues were under control. That was the only reason why we repeat that women were even able to walk alone at night at that time.
With the rise of criminal activity in the North, people generally compare it with the LTTEs time period and say that it was better back then. Maheswaran would have been emotional when she made her statement, but it would not aid the Tamil community as she represented a majority party. If she was truly concerned about her people, she would have made the statement after resigning from her party.
K. Anandharasa
I am a retired principal and I move with people. As such, I consider Vijayakalas statement as an emotional outburst. She must have made that statement because even though she represented the government, she was unable to curb current criminal activities.
During the time of the LTTE, in 1987, a man was tied to a lamp post and shot dead for sexually harassing a woman; I witnessed it.
The rising numbers of sexual harassment cases in the North would have triggered Maheswarans pro-LTTE statement. Male politicians in the North rarely raise their voices against such issues. I was fascinated by Maheswarans boldness to speak on that. I think it was correct for her to resign from her ministerial position.
S. Jegabalan
I do not condemn what Maheswaran said; it was the plight of her community that made her speak in that manner. It is a fact that the LTTE was able to keep people under control, whereas the present government had failed to do so. The culture and tradition of the North was maintained when it was under LTTE rule and now, we are losing everything. That is a concern for any person in the North.
The government defeated the LTTE while calling it terrorism, but a proper system prevailed during their rule; I will not object that. Even 10 years after the LTTE was defeated, the government could fell short at uplifting the lives of the people in the North.
(Several attempts were made to contact the JVP regarding the issue. However, they were unresponsive).

From crisis to sustenance  part 33
Product development relieves great number of customer pain points
Business leaders must be innovative in managing the needs of the customer segments they serve. No company can afford to take their customers for granted. The onus is for the company to explore the most cost-effective way to be creative in delivering new products to satisfy changing customer needs.
There are 3 ways to pursue this:
1. Invention (create from scratch through research and development)
2. Innovation (improve current products or technologies)
3. Imitation (choose to use inventions and innovations that are successful)
The strategy adopted will depend on the size and strategic intention of the business. A company with limited resources may choose to imitate and customize the solution to meet its customers specific requirement with a technology that has worked. A market leader may prefer a quantum leap invention to overwhelm its customers while changing the rules of the play. A differentiator may use innovation to his product to come up with better product.
Procedure
Developing new products and services is an inherently risky process. You must plan any investment carefully and strictly control your costs. You need to plan exactly where this investment will be directed. You must justify the expenditure on every project segment. And above all, you must manage your costs at every point.
Project managers are responsible for controlling costs and allocating resources, drawing up the key parameters for the product or services specification and coordinating the product development team. In addition, they should timetable the development process and troubleshoot when issues crop up.
Before making investment decisions, consider how much your business stands to gain from a completed product or service. Weigh this against the risks you face.
There are 3 steps to be taken in the development of a new product.
1.Idea Generation
New product development is erroneously perceived as the exclusive domain of the Managing Director, or in Big companies - Research and Development team (R&D). It is not so. If a company has to launch successful products, the role and importance of marketing team have to be as important as that of developers during the product development process.
(a) Marketing should work with MD or R&D to establish clear, mutually agreed project priorities to reduce chances of failure. Left alone, MD or R&D people will have plenty of fanciful ideas to pursue and marketers will have plenty of mysterious customer needs they would like to serve. Product development finally should come up with solutions to fulfil customers needs which can be sold profitably.
(b). Marketing must give MD or R&D people timely and quality information. It is the responsibility of the marketing department to ensure that customers latest needs are incorporated in the new product.
Any product developer (whether team or individual) who listens carefully to customer requirements, will be able to play the possible solution and seek clarification from customers regarding its suitability. The loop will continue to go on till the right solution is figured out.
(c). MD or the members of the R&D team should become more customer centric and understand that the products developed by them must ultimately be accepted by the target customers of the company.
The marketing department in the organization should undertake the responsibility of passing customer related information to the MD or R&D team and ensure that either of them interacts with customers as often as possible by participating in customer visits and trade shows.
(d). There are important personality and value differences between MD or R&D and marketing. The most important difference is that while marketers are fixated on customer requirements, MD or developers sometimes want to pursue ideas which interest them. It is important for marketing to develop an informal relationship with MD or R&D department.
Few Tips
To minimize risks and allocate investment and resources wisely, you should consider a number of factors: Will your new product or service meet customers specifications How technologically feasible is the product or service Can you meet the design, resource and manufacturing requirements Are you clear about what you hope to achieve with the new product or service The clearer you are about your plans, the better you can analyze the risks involved.
A few tips may be helpful. Consult members of your team about your development plans - they may contribute insights that youve overlooked. Seek the views of suppliers and other business associates - their specialist expertise could be invaluable. Test lots of ideas at the start of a project - but make sure you stop work on ideas that dont meet your criteria before committing a lot of time and resources.
Ask your dedicated customers what they think of your plans. Consider the regulatory framework within which your new product or service will operate. Dont overlook the environmental impact of your plans. Look beyond a new product or services immediate potential and consider the longer term.
2. Matching market needs
New products and services have to offer benefits that meet your customers needs. You need to discover what these are. Market research will help you do this. Remember that although the end user of your product or service might be your most important customer, you may have to take the needs of other parties into account. For example, if you were planning a new DIY product, you would need to consider how retailers would stock it as well as how it would benefit professional decorators.
Not only must you meet your customers needs, you have to do so in a way that is better than the alternatives offered by the competition. Your new product or service needs a unique selling proposition - a feature or property that makes it stand out in the marketplace.
Before entering the market, you need to determine: How customers needs are currently met; why customers would choose your product or service rather than the competitions, both now and in the future.
3.Price right
Establishing a pricing strategy for a new product or service is an important part of the development process. You should consider pricing the moment you decide to take an idea forward as it will determine how much you can afford to invest in the project.
You will need to take the following factors into account:
Special benefits to the customer compared with what the competition has to offer. Will the price be one that customers are prepared to pay Whether or not youre first to market. Is your product or service revolutionary or are you following a market trend The selling channels you want to use, which will affect your promotional spending and distribution costs; The speed with which you want to establish your product or service; The expected lifecycle of your product or service; Whether you are covering your costs; Strategic pricing can be used to drive sales and regulate demand. See our guide on how to price your product or service.
4. Timing
There are times it does not pay to be the first to come up with new ideas. The timing is as important as the innovation itself. Good timing maximizes opportunities and profits. The classical product life cycle concept offers clues on how to exploit timing.
There are five key stages in the lifecycle of any product or service.
1. Development - At this point your product or service is only an idea. Youre investing heavily in research and development.
2. Introduction - You launch your product or service. Youre spending heavily on marketing.
3. Growth - your product or service is establishing itself. You have few competitors, sales are growing and profit margins are good. Nows the time to work out how you can reduce the costs of delivering the new product.
4. Maturity - Sales growth is slowing or has even stopped. Youve been able to reduce production and marketing costs, but increased competition has driven down prices. Now is likely to be the best time to invest in a new product.
5. Decline - New and improved products or services are on the market and competition is high. Sales fall and profit margins decline. Increased marketing will have little impact on sales and wont be cost-effective new markets are identified.
Extension
Identify where products or services are in their lifecycle is central to your profitability. Effective research into your markets and competitors will help you do this. You can extend the lifecycle of a product or service by investing in an extension strategy.
You could increase your promotional spending; you introduce minor innovations - perhaps by adding extra features or updating the design; you could seek new markets. But ultimately this only delays a product or services decline. It will just buy you a little breather.
Ideally, you should always have new products or services to introduce as others decline so that at least one part of your range is showing a sales peak.
Dedicated Team
Every potential new product or service requires a dedicated development team. In creating your team, you need to include people with a variety of skills. You may need a creative ideas person, a technical expert, a marketing specialist, someone who can source components and someone who understands the supply-chain difficulties you could encounter.
Teams also need someone in a project management role to lead, co-ordinate and motivate the members.

Rajapaksa family conflicts spilling into JO ranks - Nalin
Conflicts within the Rajapaksa family regarding the entry of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa into the political sphere has now spilled into Joint Opposition ranks as well, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, he said as it was mentioned by senior politician Kumara Welgama, Gotabhaya is a newcomer to the field of politics. Senior politicians Dinesh Gunawardane and Vasudewa Nanayakkara oppose Gotabhayas arrival since they had experienced his Hitler-like nature before 2015. MP Namal Rajapaksa has not yet made any comment with regard to Gotas arrival.
He further said that only the politicians who spread racism such as Udaya Gammanpila and Sarath Weerasekara have come forward to extend their support to Gotabhaya.

Rapid special action plan to eradicate Dengue
A rapid special action plan to eradicate Dengue was implemented in Puttalam 5th ward, during last weekend in order to prevent Dengue before it affects the general public.
This action plan was implemented by the Dengue eradication team of Puttalam Urban Council, under the guidance of the Chairman K. A. Baiz.
The Puttalam Health Medical office, the Road development Authority, the Malaria Prevention Unit and Puttalam Police have collaboratively engaged as the partners to implement this action plan.
While conducting this, the Chairman of Puttalam Urban Council K. A. Baiz directly visited this area and stayed there until the end of the plan implementation, and made orders to the relevant authorities and to the Urban Council workers. The members of Puttalam Urban Council M. S. M. Rafeek and Farwin Raja also have participated in this campaign.
The Chairman of Puttalam Urban Council K. A. Baiz said that, Many losses of lives have occurred in this area, due to Dengue. Also, due to the rainy season in Puttalam in recent days, there are much more chances for Dengue breeding too. Thats the main reason why have we started such an immediate action plan.
The officers visited all the houses in 5th ward and they explained about the affects of Dengue. Also, many places which were conducive for the Dengue breeding were identified during their home visits and were demolished.

RESCUED
THAILAND: All 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped for more than two weeks deep inside a flood Thai cave have been rescued, a Thai navy SEAL unit said on Tuesday, a successful end to a perilous mission that has gripped the world.
The 12 Wild Boars and coach have emerged from the cave and they are safe, the Thai navy SEAL unit said on its official Facebook page.
The Wild Boars soccer team and their coach got trapped on June 23 while exploring the cave complex in the northern province of Chiang Rai after soccer practice and a rainy season downpour flooded the tunnels.
British divers found the 13, hungry and huddled in darkness on a muddy bank in a partly flooded chamber several kilometres inside the complex, on Monday last week.
After pondering for days how to get the 13 out, a rescue operation was launched on Sunday when four of the boys were brought out, tethered to rescue divers.
Another four were rescued on Monday and the last four boys and the coach were brought out on Tuesday.
You have seen the rain so you might be wondering  preparation for the third operation has been under way since early morning, said Narongsak Osatanakorn, the head of the joint command centre coordinating the operation.
If everything goes right, we will see four kids and a doctor and three Seals that have stayed with the kids will all come out, he said. Four plus one coach, so its five.
The perilous rescue had gripped the world but celebrations will be tinged with sadness over the loss of a former Thai navy diver who died on Friday while on a re-supply mission inside the cave.
The first four boys to be freed were reunited with their parents on Monday night through a glass window. Public health officials would decide on Tuesday whether the second batch could see their families.
[The parents] visited them through a window due to disease control, Osatanakorn said. If the lab results are negative  no infection or any disease  they can visit but they have to wear [medical] gown, face mask and hair cap.
He said they would need to keep at least 2 metres away from their boys for at least 48 hours, until we are sure there is no infection, then they can visit them normally. No boys would be discharged for at least seven days.
Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, a physician from the Thai ministry of public health, told a separate press conference at the Chiang Rai hospital that the eight patients were cheerful.
Two boys among the first group to be freed, who he said were aged between 14 and 16, had shown possible signs of pneumonia and all had low temperatures when they arrived on Monday night.
Now they have no fever and can do their normal activities, Chokedamrongsuk said. They can have normal food but we are making sure it is easily digestible, not spicy or too strongly flavoured.
The boys had asked for chocolate spread on bread, which the hospital had provided, he said. They were still wearing sunglasses as a precaution while their eyes adjusted to the light, he added.
For the second lot of patients arriving last night, whose ages range from 12 to 14, they arrived with very low body temperature, and one of them had a low heart rate, he said.
Doctors have treated the boys and now all of them are OK and cheerful. They talk normally. No fever. Weve started giving them medical food this morning.
He said the second group of four boys would undergo detailed testing of their eyes, nutrition levels and mental health, with blood samples to be sent to Bangkok to test for any infectious diseases.
All of them have an increase in white cells in the blood, which indicates infections, so we have given them antibiotics as a precaution, Chokedamrongsuk said.
Overnight, the entrepreneur Elon Musk posted on social media that he had personally delivered a child-sized submarine to the site which he has developed to assist with the operation, but it is unlikely to play a role.
Although his technology is good and sophisticated, its not practical for this mission, Osatanakorn said after the press conference.
Osatanakorn announced the start of the latest rescue mission to applause and cheers in the local government courtyard that has become a centre for Thai volunteers and the worlds media.
The mood was in stark contrast to the glum atmosphere at the site last week, especially after the announcement of the death on Friday of the former Thai navy Seal Saman Kunan, who died while placing air tanks in the cave.
The Seals, the key force in the operation, posted on their official Facebook page that Tuesday would be a longer day than Monday. But well look forward to celebrating the success. Hooyah.

Residents of Tiththawalla, Kurunegala complain that the Saragama lake in the area has become an environmental hazard, since many irresponsible residents divert household wastage to the lake.
The residents urge the authorities to look into the issue and take steps to clean the lake and punish those who contaminate water in the lake.
The lake is maintained by different authorities from time to time and now the responsibility is on the Irrigation Department, the residents said.
Plans are afoot to convert the lake to a water tank and it is going to be smaller than the lake.
The proposed tank will reduce the beauty of the lake, the residents said.
The Saragama Lake is said to have built by King Prakramabahu of the Kurunegala kingdom.

Officials to end imported canned fish muddle:
SL to bring down Chinese suppliers
Stepping in and mediating on time, Sri Lanka has successfully turned around the issue of spoilt canned fish imports muddle following due in-depth and multi-level talks with all the key stakeholders in Colombo on July 10,
We invite a canned fish supplier delegation from China to Sri Lanka for discussions, said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen yesterday at the Ministry. Minister Bathiudeen made these observations during a meeting with all stakeholders in view of resolving the canned fish imports issue. Canned fish is a heavily used item by local consumers and an essential item in the management of the day to day cost of living. 60 Lankan companies annually import 40 million Kilos (Kgs) of canned fish for the local market. Since May 2018, no canned fish consignments from China had been received by Sri Lanka. It has been widely reported in the media that worms were detected by Lankan authorities in some imported canned fish tins to Sri Lanka and consignments were held back at the Customs and some had even ordered that it be re-exported. As a result, since February, Lankan authorities have been detecting canned fish destined for local markets landing in local ports. Both SLSI and the Ministry of Food Control Dept. under the Heath Ministry had decided that 31canned fish consignments imported from Chinese suppliers were unfit to be released to local markets due to the presence of more than 3 types of parasites in them. A prevalence of between 0-three are acceptable, but these consignments had a higher rate of parasites.
Of the 92 containers of canned fish which had arrived earlier this year, in many consignments from Chinese suppliers and 80 containers were rejected by Lankan authorities based on certification guidelines. Our authorities have done their job right, announced Minister Bathiudeen, adding: Still, the total stoppage of canned fish imports would affect our consumers, while market shortages could take place here. We wish to call the support of the Government of China to resolve this situation through amicable discussions and we are confident the Chinese authorities would support us and their own exporters who have faced this issue, to meet our health standards. As government officials, we are ready to support our importers to comply with SLSI standards. We invite a canned fish supplier delegation from China to Sri Lanka for discussions and the resolution of this issue. Thereafter, we shall send a Sri Lankan importer delegation to Beijing to finalise, Secretary of Sri Lanka Canned Fish Association Chathura Wicremanayake, agreed with Minister Bathiudeen. There are a great number of exporters in China and this happens only once in a way. The last time this happened in Sri Lanka was 22 years ago, but on the fish imported from Chile. We have been importing fish from China for the past 8 years and this is the first time this issue had surfaced. Chinese products are not bad, except on a few occasions where spoilt cans had got mixed. We believe the Chinese exporters also should step in now and show they are reliable suppliers. We believe Beijing would update its own suppliers of the changes in standards applied in Sri Lanka, said Secretary Wicremanayake.
Officials from SLSI and the Health Ministry, said that they were not against canned fish imports to Sri Lanka. We are not opposing imports, but exporters to Sri Lanka should certify the quality otherwise SPS violations could occur and our consumers would be affected, they stressed.
Chinese embassy Second Secretary Ran Xiong agreed that standards had to be maintained for the betterment of both countries and added: Letters from Trade Remedies Division wants further clarifications from the Lankan authorities. We agree to Sri Lankas revised standards, while we also call for a buffer period for our exporters to adjust. I am in discussion with our Chinese suppliers and Chinese Chambers. We are optimistic this issue could be resolved in collaboration with all local authorities and Lankan importers, stressed Xiong.

SL seeks global backing for pioneering export industrialisation master plan
Sri Lanka soft-launched an international support call for its export-led industrialisation initiative on July 5.
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is in the process of developing relevant policies conducive for export led industrialisation as envisaged in the Vision 2025 of the government, said the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen on July 5 at the Ministry office, Colombo 3.
Minister Bathiudeen, joined by his top officials, advisors and Dr Ravi Ratnayake, Secretary General of the Bridging the Gap Foundation Asia and the former Director and Chief Economist at UN ESCAP was addressing Ambassador of the Delegation of EU to Sri Lanka Tung-Lai Margue who was leading a team of EU officials to meet Minister Bathiudeen at the Ministry office.
The session was in view of Minister Bathiudeens submission of UNIDO collaborated proposal calling for assistance to support export-led industrialisation in Sri Lanka (to Ambassador Tung-Lai Margue and EU delegation at EU-SL working group on Trade and Economic Cooperation Relations).
This vision includes establishing new industrial estates and modernising new ones, Minister Bathiudeen said and added, Both developed-advanced and developing economies used industrialisation as the engine of growth and development. They adopted appropriate industrial policies and strategies to guide their industrialisation. Currently, Sri Lanka does not have such a policy document. A clear indication of this absence is the declining share of manufacturing in GDP which is stuck at 16.7%-well below South East Asian countries such as Thailand where the share is 27%. Though there were past attempts to revive industrialisation in Sri Lanka a proper industrial policy and comprehensive strategy for its implementation are yet to be developed. The importance of such a policy has been recognised in the new Trade Policy recently approved by the Cabinet. It is also the action-plan for 2015-20 of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
This is a very ambitious project. While these proposals are pro-development, it is important that they are well aligned with vision 2025 stressed Amb Tung-Lai Margue responding to Minister Bathiudeen, and added: The value chain integration suggestions here too are useful. We also suggest Sri Lanka to integrate closer with value chains of South Asian region, as a start.
Head of Asia Trade Division of European External Action Service (EEAS) Brussels Peter Bersz said that the proposals are comprehensive.
The discussions were important. We will go back to Brussels to take a closer look at the proposals and see how to respond. At this moment this is very much of a Sri Lankan internal document but we believe engaging a broader stakeholder base such as other governments, export and import companies, traders and manufacturers can enhance this even further, and this is a good and much needed start for such a level of engagement. Als this policy paper appears to be an industrial strategy too, which is another interesting aspect.
Unlike previous industry development policies, the comprehensive set of proposals submitted by Minister Bathiudeen on July 5 packs, among others, steps on increasing Sri Lankas competitiveness for production and trade promotion, formulation of intellectual property policy and on geographical indicators, consumer protection, transforming industrial estates to drive SME development for export growth, enhancing capacity and competitiveness of SMEs in export-oriented value chains and even proposals to improve national quality infrastructure.

SLSCA files objections against St. Sebastians Katuneriya
The Sri Lanka School Cricket Association (SLSCA) has informed the Colombo District Courts that the decision to suspend St Sebastian College Katuneriya from the inter school under 19 Division II cricket tournament was taken after it was revealed that the school has fielded a student in their team who did not have stipulated qualification to remain in the school as a student.
In filing statements of objections Dilshan de Silva, the Secretary of Sri Lanka School Cricket Association (SLSCA) who is named as a defendant among others submitted to the District Court of Colombo that, the plaintiffs school St. Sebastians College Katuneriya was disqualified upon being revealed that its captain was not eligible to be named as a player, as he was not a student of the college.
The said captain had not been registered to sit for the GCE O/L examination in December 2017 from the school and that the principal of the school had in writing confirmed same, whilst stating that the said school cricketer had not at all registered.
The SLSCA has informed courts that the Principal of St. Sebastians College Katuneriya is also a member of the SLSCA Executive committee and he is aware of the inquiry conducted against the college cricket team by the Association. The students have filed the case against only eleven members of the Executive committee where the full membership exceeds 100.
Previously the District Court of Colombo had issued an enjoining order preventing the SLSCA from relegating to Division (III), disqualifying them for awards and as well as taking disciplinary actions against the said team.. The said defendant further submitted to the courts that, proper representative order had not been obtained as envisaged by law and further that as per the reveal that stated above the said team had already been disqualified as per the tournament rule and that further disciplinary actions if any would be taken by the disciplinary committee of the said association.
And further it was submitted that plaintiffs are being only 7 members of such team have no locus standi to bring this action and as such the action is misconceived in law. The other defendants moved time to file their respective written objections and the court whilst granting permission same extended the enjoining order already issued until the next date.
Next hearing will take place on the 13 July 2018.

Small change, big difference
Head Prefect of Stafford Anudi Bandara never gives up. And she does this not only for herself but for others as well. Her courage is not only for herself but for others as well. Perfect Prefects features Bandara who has begun her flight to success.
Both my parents are in the field of Aviation, so it is something I am very passionate about and very interested in. In the future, I hope to pursue Aerospace engineering at the University. I think it is a very fascinating field. When we look at an aircraft we dont see the processes behind it. There is so much beyond than what you actually see. I would love to learn about the mechanics. Being born into the field I have always had this passion and interest in it. Growing up, I knew that this is what I have always wanted to do. I have learnt as much as I can through the internet and documentaries but I want to pursue this to the point of getting a degree. I admire Amelia Earhart. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. There is a lot of gender discrimination in the aviation field and I dont think that is fair at all. Certain women have been told that they are not suitable for this field and I do not think that is true. A woman or girl can do whatever she wants to do whether it is in aviation or another field because they have the capability to do it, said Bandara.
Essential management
Time management, getting prepared, planning things ahead and having a backup plan together with her Never Give Up attitude has allowed her to successfully perform the role of Head Prefect.
There is a lot you need to balance as the Head Prefect. You need to balance your studies, your extra-curricular activities and your family life. You need to learn how to balance those very well. One thing I would like to tell everyone who is trying to succeed is to never give up.
There will always be difficulties that you have to face. You need to face them with courage. I believe anyone can accomplish anything that they set their mind to. There is no limitation or restriction to what you can do. It is my parents who taught me at a very young age, that you must continue to do what you want to do and never give up. So they have always guided me throughout my life and throughout my school career, to follow my dreams and never give up when I face a difficulty, pointed out Bandara.
The Stafford motto is Strive towards the light and her education at Stafford has instilled in her core values in addition to knowledge.
Conducive environment
I have been at Stafford for 13 years and I am just about to graduate, so I can confidently say that Stafford is a very nice and conducive environment for a young person to grow up in. I remember that the Principal, teachers and sectional heads have been very supportive and have always catered to our needs. They have always listened to us and found a solution if something was amiss and have always nurtured us. Without a doubt they are very supportive, going out of their way to help us whenever they could. Our Principal is very kind and caring and always inquires about our wellbeing and she always tries to make this place a home away from home, said Bandara.
The community is something she is concerned about and she quotes Mother Teresa - We cannot all do great things but we can do small things with great love.
I would like to be a person that contributes to society and a good citizen of the country. I am very passionate about community service and volunteerism. It is something I participate in family and school. Recently I went on a trip to Bopagoda, where we donated items to a Pirivena that had been affected by the floods. Participating in those experiences gives you a lot of perspectives and it is something you do not see in everyday life. Helping people gives you a lot of happiness and you come to realize a lot of things through the act of giving, explains Bandara.
Making a difference in the world can start by doing the right thing. Anyone of us can do this. Our actions can have an impact on society. We can make that difference. Your decisions can affect others in a positive or negative way.
Unfair discrimination
There is a lot of discrimination in society these days. Every person born into this world is an equal, regardless of colour, ethnicity and nationality. We are all human beings. So discrimination is really unfair. So I would like to see all of that stop and to see everyone treated as an equal. You should care about your family, friends and people around you, and even if it is someone you do not know, you should care about the person and treat others the way you would like to be treated. Even a small change can make a big difference. If you can help a starving dog or beggar that will make a difference to that living being. When you look at the world and see people in poverty or people being bullied and beat up, it is not fair or right. They dont deserve that. People need to stop hurting others and treat everyone nicely and fairly, stated Bandara.
Parental love and care are so important for any child in this world. Our parents are the two most powerful people in our lives.
A child needs the care of his/her parents. It is really unfair for any child to be separated from his/her own parents. They look to their parents for help and support and guidance. It is said that the way a child thinks, is influenced by what they see and what they hear. If they are separated from their parents, their guiding light, the consequences could be devastating. A child should have the opportunity to be raised by his/her parents and loved by his/her parents. If a child is separated, it is difficult to watch it happen. I value my family greatly because they have always been my support. My parents and grandparents have raised me so well, giving me all the guidance I needed, explained Bandara.

Southgate hoping England can keep journey going in Croatia semi-final
MOSCOW: England manager Gareth Southgate is hoping his young team can continue breaking down barriers when they play Croatia in the semi-finals of the World Cup in Moscow on Wednesday.
We came here to enjoy our football, all the way through we have been one of the youngest teams in the tournament, the least experienced team, but we were never quite sure how far this team could go, Southgate told reporters at the Luzhniki Stadium on Tuesday.
England have made it to the semi-finals of a major tournament for the first time since Euro 96, when Southgate himself missed a penalty in a shoot-out defeat against Germany.
They have not been this far at a World Cup since the 1990 tournament in Italy, and coming to Russia they had managed just one win in the knockout rounds of a major tournament in 16 years.
The hunger in the players has been apparent for all to see. We have dealt with difficult situations in games, added Southgate, whose side have thumped minnows Panama 6-1, won a penalty shoot-out against Colombia and then beaten Sweden in the last eight.
We have made several pieces of history -- we have had our biggest win in a tournament for England, our first knockout win for 10 years, our first quarter-final win for longer, so we are just looking to keep breaking those barriers down.
It has been a really enjoyable journey and we want to keep it going. Englands only appearance in the final of the World Cup remains 1966, when they won the trophy as hosts.
We need to obviously take a lot of good things from the past in terms of 66 and what they achieved then, but it was a long time ago.
Not too many of us can remember that far back, admitted captain Jordan Henderson, who at 28 is one of the older players in the squad.

Towards 11 billion
Current estimates indicate that roughly 83 million people are being added to the worlds population every year. The global population is expected to reach 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100, according to current projections. This is nearly 4 billion increase over the current figure, but the world is certainly not running out of room. In fact, scientists say that a country such as Australia could theoretically accommodate a population of 11 billion people.
But what the world may lack by 2100 is resources that can sustain 11 billion people  water, food, breathable air, housing/shelter and other essential facilities. Add climate change to the mix  temperatures are predicted to rise by a couple of degrees by this time  and humanity will have a very complex problem on their hands. Both food and water are getting scarce - freshwater reserves are limited and so is arable land. We will certainly have to find new ways to grow food (think vertical farming and soilless farming) and get water (most countries already practice the desalination of seawater). Another challenge is to prevent food waste  especially in the Post-Harvest stage and processing stage. Above all, Climate Change must be tackled if the Earth is to host 11 billion people. A sea level rise of even 2 metres will be disastrous for many coastal cities with high populations.
Urbanization is another trend that will get worse by 2100, with 4 billion out of the total 7.6 billion people already living in cities. The creation of more mega cities in China, India and other countries will pose many challenges. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his keynote address to the World Cities Summit in Singapore alluded to this trend, referring to the inherent challenges of sustaining such mega cities.
War and conflict are creating a mass displacement of people  roughly 1 percent of the world population is refugees. Thanks to advances in medicine and science, people are living longer, with some countries having more elderly persons than young ones. This is a social as well as an economic issue.
There will be plenty of debate on these issues today, World Population Day, which seeks to focus attention on the urgency and importance of population issues. This years 2018 theme: Family Planning is a Human Right marks the 50th anniversary of the 1968 International Conference on Human Rights, where family planning was, for the first time, globally affirmed to be a human right. The conferences outcome document, known as the Teheran Proclamation, stated unequivocally: Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.
Embedded in this document was a game-changing realization: Women and girls have the right to avoid the exhaustion, depletion and danger of too many pregnancies, too close together. Men and women have the right to choose when and how often to embrace parenthood  if at all. Sri Lanka pioneered the concept of family planning in this region.
The UN has recognized several factors essential for family planning: Family planning information and services cannot be restricted on the basis of race, sex, language, religion, political affiliation, national origin, age, economic status, place of residence, disability status, marital status, sexual orientation or gender identity; Countries must ensure that family planning commodities and services are accessible to everyone; Countries must ensure that family planning commodities and services are accessible to everyone; Contraceptive services and information must be provided in a dignified manner, respecting both modern medical ethics and the cultures of those being accommodated; Family planning information must be clearly communicated and scientifically accurate; Every person must be empowered to make reproductive choices with full autonomy, free of pressure, coercion or misrepresentation.
The goal is to avoid unwanted pregnancies and abortions. We often read of incidents where mothers had left infants in toilets or shrub jungle apparently due to poverty. Some even go to the extent of murdering new-born infants. But if they had practised some form of family planning, such unfortunate outcomes could have been avoided. Likewise, many young women choose to undergo risky illegal abortions because they had no access to contraceptives or had no knowledge of them. Creating public awareness on both family planning and contraceptives for engaging in safe sex is a must. Ignorance does result in unwanted pregnancies. It is up to Governments and the media to create more awareness on these factors among both married people and other young persons.
The expanding population is a challenge as well as an opportunity. Indeed, some developed and even developing countries have a majority silver generation and a low birth rate that they actually encourage couples to make more babies with an eye on the future. Many countries are already planning for 2040 and beyond, taking into account the expanded populations and the distribution of finite resources. Several countries have legal migration programmes which seek to diversify their gene pool over the next few decades. Policymakers and scientists around the world must come up with innovative ideas to manage the population as well as the Earths resources.

Umtiti heads France into World Cup Final
Saint Petersburg, Russia tuesday: Samuel Umtiti headed France into the World Cup final in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday with a 1-0 win consigning Belgium's golden generation into another disappointment.
In a World Cup replete with set piece goals a corner again proved decisive when Umtiti timed his run perfectly to meet Antoine Griezman's delivery six minutes into the second half.
France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made a spectacular full-length save to keep the score at 0-0 at half-time in the World Cup semi-final.
Roberto Martinez's Belgium had the better of the early exchanges and would have taken the lead but for Lloris's save from Toby Alderweireld but France came back strongly towards the break.
Belgium enjoyed large amounts of possession but Umtiti's goal in the 51st minute from a corner ultimately proved the difference as 1998 champions France reached their third World Cup final.
France coach Didier Deschamps said he was delighted to reach the World Cup final and relished the opportunity to do better than at the Euro 2016 final, when France lost on home soil.
A header from Samuel Umtiti gave France victory over Belgium in Saint Petersburg.
I am very happy for my players, Deschamps said. It was hard against a very good Belgium team.
I take my hat off to my players and my staff. France lost 1-0 to Portugal in the Stade de France in Paris in 2016. Deschamps said: Finals have to be won because we have still not got over the one we lost two years ago. AFP

Vijayakala Maheswaran will lose her seat in Parliament, Agricultural Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister was participating in a blood donation programme held at the Sri Whardanarama Temple in Sitinamaluwa, Tangalle recently organised by the Mahinda Amaraweera Foundation and youths of Sitinamaluwa. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said Vijayakala made a wrong statement.
"It was unpatriotic. She has resigned from the minister post but it was not enough.
"I think she will lose her seat in Parliament. We do not tolerate terrorism. We condom her statement," the Minister said.

Religious Perspectives
VOICE OF JESUS OVER VANNI
And that voice belonged to Bishop Valence.
It fell over his worshipers in their thousands when they flocked to hear his voice rising from within wilderness of Vanni.
Over the spacious Vanni when the dew in the morning had evaporated to let the calm settle, one could hear even a pin drop in a crowd so large when Bishop Valence spoke, it was the voice of Jesus I heard. There would have been many who felt it that way.
It was a day of healing as derived from the parables of Jesus when his wondrous chosen child, moved over to replace him on earth. The church was the venue, Lord Bishop of Chilaw, Rt. Rev Dr, Valence Mendis the shepherd to thousands of believers who are spiritually drawn to him where ever he preaches.
As I stood under a shady sprawling tree away from the flow, I was baffled the way they were dressed, illuminating arabesque colour as against the rising sun in the morning. I was able to watch every devotee from a distance; men, women and children as though heading for a wedding mass.
I mused to myself. Why all this fuss
Then it dawned; it was the Sabath. These simple rural folk in their Sunday best had come to the house of prayer, dressed in what God has blessed them with.
Were they spiritually drawn or not no one knew and whatever doubt I had was blown in the air when their shepherd rose to the occasion. Said Bishop Valence in his usual eloquence to touch each and every heart about the wonders of spiritual healing:- Healing spreads over both body and mind on the believer. It is simple people like you who gathered around Jesus throughout his life on earth seeking his touch of heal and he responded with love and care. The parables found in the Holy - Bible says so. Trust in Jesus and he will hear you. You will feel the spiritual experience when you place your trust in him. Bishop Valence extended his faith, the purity and love that draws him like a magnet and the reverence with which they look up to him. Today is a day of healing he elaborated as found in Mark 5. 21. Jesus went back across to the other side of the lake. There at the lakeside, a large crowd gathered around him. Jairus, an official of the local synagogue arrived and saw Jesus, he threw himself down at his feet and begged him earnestly. My little daughter is very sick. Please come and place your hands on her so that she will get well. Then Jesus started off with him. So many people were going along with Jesus that they were crowding him from every side.
There was a woman who had suffered terribly from severe bleeding for twelve years even though she had been treated by many doctors. She had spent all her money but instead of getting better she got worse all the time. She had heard about Jesus,
She came in the crowd behind him, saying to herself If I touch his clothes I will get well.
She touched his cloak and her bleeding stopped at once: and she had the feeling inside herself that she was healed of her trouble. At once Jesus knew that power had gone out of him, so he turned around in the crowd and asked Who touched my clothes
His disciples answered: You see how the people are crowding you, why do you ask who touched you
But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. The woman realized what had happened: so she came trembling with fear, knelt at his feet and told him the whole truth. Jesus said to her My daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed of your troubles.
While Jesus was saying this, some messengers came to Jairus from his house and told him You daughter has died. Why bother the Teacher any longer Jesus paid no attention to what they said but told him, dont be afraid, only believe. Then he did not let anyone else go with him except Peter and James and his brother John. They arrived at Jairus house where Jesus saw the confusion and heard all the loud crying and wailing. He went in and said to them Why all this confusion Why are you crying The child is not dead, she is only sleeping.
They started making fun of him, so he put them all out, took the childs father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the child was lying. He took her hand and said to her TALITHA KOUM which means little girl, I tell you to get up. She got up at once and started walking around. (she was twelve years old). When this happened, they were completely amazed. But Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone and he said, Give her something to eat
Bishop Valence continued to outline these parables by explaining that Jesus as a man of authority and action as seen in his teachings, in his power over sins and forgiving his people their failure to understand his mission. He explained about Jesus ministry of healing and teaching.
This particular day of spiritual healing came easy on words for Bishop Valence being a philosopher. In the process of his delivery, he rekindled the power of faith a woman can possess; words of wisdom to a trusting woman and among the devotees present, women outnumbered men.
After his sermon and blessings, he moved over to where the crowd waited en masse and from a distance, I could barely see how they grappled to touch him which flashed in my mind how the followers of Jesus wanted to touch him and be healed.
It was reminiscent and mindful of the Bishop as its central figure, brought to life as found in the parable. Today, they were all drawn to this humble child of God who had compassion for these simple Christians.
It was the WAY and the PATH he created for me that morning as I faintly heard his beautiful voice fading in the wilderness through which I drove back, my heart filled with joy.
BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CHURCH
In the Diocese of Chilaw and sited in near-wilderness of Vanni, Angunawila, was a dot of a shrine in 1905 which dates back to over one hundred and thirteen years which is certainly a long life for a church to survive into a world of high-tech development where one could read the Holy Bible on internet. With time moving slowly and few rural folks worshipping on Sundays, it was shifted to another location in 1950. The church has undergone systematic changes.
From a humble beginning in 1905 for its survival from an area called Rajamakumara Vanni Palatha in Vanni where hundreds of priests would have preached from behinds its altar, today Rev. Fr. Maurice Anderson is the custodian of its spiritual heritage as its Parish Priest who tirelessly tends to the churchs congregation.

Where is Barack Obama
The most popular American, whose legacy is the primary target of Donald Trump, has, for now, virtually disappeared from public life.
Barack Obama was six months into his postWhite House life when Donald Trump found a new way to grab his attention. It was a Tuesday morning deep in the mid-Atlantic summer, and, feeling a world away from the Pennsylvania Avenue grind, the former president was reading the New York Times on his iPad.
The previous evening, Trump had visited West Virginia, where he spoke at the annual Boy Scout Jamboree. Addressing a crowd of roughly 40,000, who were expecting the usual talk about citizenship and service, the president uncorked a political diatribe packed with jabs at Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Washington, D.C., cesspool; reminders about the importance of saying Merry Christmas; and reminiscences of Election Night 2016 and the pundits he embarrassed. You remember that incredible night with the maps, and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red it was unbelievable. And they didnt know what to say, Trump told the Scouts. They seemed bewildered at first but before long broke into chants of USA! Adult observers were openly horrified. Three days later, the Boy Scouts leader would apologize for Trumps speech.
In Washington, where the former president still works and lives with his wife, Michelle, and his younger daughter, Sasha, Obama stewed. Ever since the shocking election, he had resisted condemning his successor directly. Early on, he would muse to senior aides in private about what it meant that the country had chosen Trump, bouncing between writing off the election as a freak accident and considering it a rejection of his own vision of America. In the months after the inauguration, Obama referred publicly to the new president only sparingly  but still more than he expected to.
He issued careful statements defending the Affordable Care Act and supporting the Paris climate-change agreement, avoided mentioning Trump by name, and largely let the resistance speak for itself.
But the Boy Scouts speech really troubled him. Kids their age are the most impressionable group there is, Obama reminded friends at the time, likening them to sponges. If the president shoves a divisive political argument at them, thats what they will absorb.
It was a very Barack Obama thing to get agitated about. Throughout his entire political career, he has attached an unusual degree of significance to storytelling, and he has often spoken of the importance of modeling what it means to be a good citizen. He had recently concluded a two-month stretch full of international travel and was just starting to settle into his post-presidency, and that week was a busy one in Washington  Republicans were zeroing in on a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The Boy Scouts speech was relatively unimportant (mostly improvised, probably something Trump would forget about within a week), but perhaps it presented an opportunity. One of the most potent tools in Obamas arsenal, as a retired president, is rhetoric. Even if he no longer enjoyed the bully pulpit, he could, if he wanted, fill the vacuum of moral leadership Trump had created and offer, to not only the Scouts but the entire country, a lesson in civics that no other Democrat is positioned to give.
But then he did another very Barack Obama thing: He decided to stay quiet.
Where is Obama It is a question much of the country has been asking over the last two years, sometimes plaintively. Come back, Barack, Chance the Rapper sang in a Saturday Night Live sketch. We all miss him, Kobe Bryant said, speaking for other athletes. Even former FBI director James Comey admitted to German interviewers this spring that he misses Obama.
Beyond the anguish is, often, simply bafflement: How did the most ubiquitous man in America for eight years virtually disappear Over the course of his presidency, Obama cast himself as the countrys secular minister as much as its commander-in-chief, someone who understood the moral core of the nation and felt compelled to insist that we live up to it. - New York Magazine

The woman who read 100 books within a month
Meet Therese, shes a business development manager living in Berlin, Germany. Last month, she managed to read over 100 nonfiction titles in psychology, politics and leadership.
It started with a bet. A colleague challenged her to read Malcolm Gladwells Outliers: The Story Of Success in two hours.
As determined as she was, she couldnt meet the deadline.
She got through the first few chapters relatively quickly but found it impossible to finish the book in the designated 2 hours. Although she lost the bet, she had an idea.
She found several websites, blogs and apps that transform books into bite-sized content. In the end, she opted for the Blinkist app. To produce quality insights from every book, she learned that they have over 100 literary experts hard at work. She was also convinced by the audio function which allowed her to listen to the learnings throughout her day.
With this cool new sidekick, Therese set a new goal for herself  she would read the key insights from 100 books in just one month. Read all about her experience in her own words below!
How many titles did you read in total
102 to be exact. It might sound like a lot, but the Blinkist packs take only 10-15 minutes to read. I read roughly 3 titles a day, mostly during commutes.
What are some of the most interesting things youve learned
There were so many! Here are the funniest ones:
I learned that if I go out with a group of friends for dinner, I should order my meal first. This will make me happier with my choice. Sounds crazy, but its true! (Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely) I havent tried this one yet, but supposedly its better for my health to put butter in my coffee instead of milk. (Bulletproof Diet by Dave Asprey)
I learned that before the onset of agriculture, women used to have more sexual freedom than men. (Sex at Dawn by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha) I can never look at trees the same way again. Apparently, they have personalities and are able to learn. This is why every tree sheds their leaves differently! (The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben)
Who is your favorite author
Thats a tough one. I really enjoyed Dale Carnegies books, theyre all self-help classics. Richard Dawkins books about the human race are also very interesting. But Im going to settle on Dan Ariely.
His book Predictably Irrational on human behavior has given me the best insights for my job yet.
