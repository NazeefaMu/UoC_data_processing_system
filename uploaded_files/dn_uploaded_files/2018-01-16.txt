JVP only political party with no corruption charges
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Propaganda Secretary Tilvin Silva yesterday said that the JVP is the only political party with no corruption charges and the people should take that matter into consideration before they cast their votes to elect members for the local government bodies.
Free from fraud and corruption has become the hot campaign slogan of most of the local government election candidates, Silva said, urging the public to identify true anti-corruption voices since most of the politicians who raise their voices against fraud and corruption are not genuine.
JVP Propaganda Secretary charged that most of the members of the local government bodies use their membership as a licence to engage in illegal practices.
He told the media, after handing over nominations, that he would urge the people to use their votes wisely and put an end to the corrupt political culture in the country.
All the political parties which ruled the country had proved that they cannot do anything to eliminate fraud and corruption.
Even the present government which came in to power promising to make a country free from fraud and corruption also engaged in massive corruption and they failed to take action against persons with corruption charges, Silva said.

Lanka could be among  top four ICT destinations
India has made tremendous progress and is ranked among the top four ICT destinations in the world. Sri Lanka with high literacy rate and high use of internet too could come into that position, said Ravi Shankar Prasad Minister of Law and Justice and Electronics and Information Technology of India.
The minister said that today India has very high data usage and will soon introduce new laws to protect its users. I see data as the next crude oil deposit which will bring in high investments to any country and we are keen to share the Indian success with Sri Lanka, he said.
The minister said today out of the 1.3 billion total Indian population close to 1.2 billion people use mobiles. Out of this 400 million have smart phones. The Minister also said that four years ago there was only one mobile manufacturing factory in India. However today the number of mobile manufacturing plants has increased to 108, he said.
Minister of Telecom and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said that Sri Lanka too is making fast progress in the ICT and mobile sector and was the first country in the SAARC region to have introduced mobile phones. We were also the first to introduce 3G, 4G and 5G too is now being tested in Sri Lanka. However the Minister said that there is lot of red tape to implement more public sector based ICT initiatives.

For a country to develop, the infrastructure in the country needs to be developed. The Southern railway extension will be of immense benefit to the public as well as tourists, he said. Minister recalled that the Southern Expressway project was initiated by the then MP Gamini Fonseka and then the former President R. Premadasa. However they could not go ahead with this project and it is now the project is being opened.
Vice President China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation Zhao Jun said that rail bars are being imported from China while concrete sleepers are being made in India.
Chairman Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau, Eng. G. D. A. Piyathilake said that this is the first time in the Sri Lankan Railway line history is being extended.
Asked why the Concrete Sleepers are not being made in Sri Lanka, he said that they did not have the time to make them in Sri Lanka and also no sub contracts were offered.
Most of the people in the area who spoke about the development said that the real benefit of the project can be achieved only when the rail line was extended to Hambantota and is linked to the harbor.

Ambanco Constructions implements steel structures at low cost
Ambanco Construction Private Limited, incorporated in 1983 carrying out conventional construction has completed over 400+ steel buildings, while delivering over 52 buildings to a single organizations.
Ambanco handles buildings from areas from 5,000 square feet to over 100,000 square feet area buildings and multi storey structures.
In 1992, the Company entered the field of steel building construction, by introducing pre-engineering buildings for garment factories, which became popular during the 200 Garment Factory programme, due to the quick construction period and low cost.
During this period pre-engineered buildings were imported and the low cost construction benefits were enjoyed by foreign investors and export oriented products manufacturing investors, as the import tax was very high where the local investors could not afford.
This made Ambanco Construction Company Management to start pre-engineering building fabrication and initially started the first factory in 1998 to manufacture purlins in Sri Lanka.
In 2002 Ambanco started pre-engineered buildings manufacturing under Waymbco (VSB) building systems. This project justified the investment with low cost and faster delivery. Waymbco (VSB) Building System provided clear span over 40m and even larger multi-span structures.
This factory could manufacture factories, warehouses, workshops with gantry cranes and other steel structure at 30% less cost of a building with conventional material that is concrete, bricks and mortar. This pioneering move made more investors and contractors to go for steel construction with iron and steel roofing.
The Companys Business development and engineering teams could assist clients from the initial sketch, to local authority approval with chartered architects and chartered structural engineers authentication.

Be the difference!
The band Wildfire is loved by its fans and respected by its competitors. It has been successful due to the fact that its band members have got the right idea about music and they have the proper temperament. The first thing that Derek Wikramanayake of Wildfire did when he was part of the original line up of Purple Rain was to listen to other bands and discover what he was up against.
Music was made in heaven and created for the angels to sing. And then it was gifted to the world we live in and its power is awesome. Yet Melodies discovered that being able to sing is not everything. Yes you have the voice and the talent, but there is much more to it. Because as Wikramanayake points out singing is one tenth of the musical experience.
DerekWikramanayake
My message to any young guy or girl who wants to enter the music industry is not to be in a hurry to get to the top. Some young people want to become a super star overnight. Just because you can sing well does not make you a superstar. To become a star you need more than that. You need to be able to communicate with people. You need that charisma. You need to be able to present yourself, said Wikramanayake.
We all know that there have been many child stars not only in the music industry but even in fields such as acting and sports who have gone wrong since it became too much for them  the fame and the added pressure and temptations that come with that fame.
You need to know how the band should harmonize. Some bands cannot do it and they are so bad. In my band, the members freely express their opinion and we are open to each ones ideas. We are very humble with each other. We are a group and unity is very important. My advice to any youngster is to know what you are up against. I always believe in being different and not like any other band. Wildfire has to be different. Dont be afraid to get advice from older musicians because you can learn from them and experience is something you cannot buy. You have to grow through experience, said Wikramanayake.
Wikramanayake has been passionate about music since he was a kid. He says that when he listens to good music his mind is at ease and free, and that he is not angry, depressed or sad when he is listening to good music. Good music does not give you a headache.
We have done a lot of concerts and foreign tours, and last year we did Australia, Dubai, Maldives and this year we have some tours coming up as well. We are an entertaining band and we love playing requests. My favorite band is Steely Dan. I also like David Bowie, the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Christopher Cross and Chitral Somapala, stated Wikramanayake.
Interestingly the name Wildfire came from a horse. There was a story about a horse called Wildfire and Wikramanayake suggested this name for the band which would one day be called Purple Rain. But Geoffrey Fernando said he wanted the name Purple Rain. Purple Rain was a good name and the band was very successful. Then when Wikramanayake formed Wildfire with Chris Dhason he called it Wildfire.
The beginning of Wildfire was in February 2000. This was at the JAIC Hilton. The person who was handling affairs for JAIC Hilton knew me and Chris Dhason. We were given a spot on Sunday. When we played on that Sunday, there were only five people at the bar. After the first break when we came back there were 15 people. When we came after the second break there were around 25 people. And then on the third Sunday from making Rs. 25,000 a night, JAIC was recording over Rs. 200,000 on a Sunday. By the third Sunday it was packed and you could not even move!, explained Wikramanayake.
The group started off with Retro Music. They did not want to play disco stuff, and instead played oldies such as the Beatles and 1960s and 1970s music.
Our music changed from Retro, to more pop music with a lot of dance and hip hop music. We started playing rock music and then alternate rock. People just kept requesting songs from us. The young ones would request alternate rock from us and we just obliged. We then built up an alternate rock repertoire. At one time fathers would bring their songs to listen to us. We found that absolutely amazing. There are different facets to Wildfire. The repertoire that Wildfire has, no other band in this country has. We have an amazing variety of music which has a lot to do with our experience, pointed out Wikramanayake.
When Wildfire started in 2000, there were hardly any live bands in Sri Lanka. They were like a breath of fresh air in Sri Lanka, because theirs was handmade music in Sri Lanka which was raw. People liked it because there was a vacuum. There was a need for that kind of music in Sri Lanka.
When Chris Dhason brought an Acoustic Drum kit to Sri Lanka, people were asking him where he was going to use it. Chris said he would use it everywhere! It was the sincerity and the rawness of the music of Wildfire that appealed to people. It is fun for me to play in the band. Making people happy through my music motivates me, and I get excited about that. That is common to all our members, and we all feel this way about our job. We look forward to going to work. For me it is the best job in the world playing with these guys. We have no stress, added Wikramanayake.
Wikramanayake also stressed the importance of learning to play an instrument well. You should know other instruments in addition to the instrument of your choice. Half way is no good. You need to learn your instrument as best as you can.

Birds eye view and bird droppings
If a little boy was asked to write an essay with a heading such as If I were a bird what would he write Depends on the boy, his experiences, his hopes and his notions of magic, I suppose. Depending on his age, he would fly to dont-go or far-away places his parents do not or cannot take him. He could watch a cricket match without having to purchase a ticket or he could just watch the world go by.
Now if one were to ask a bird and the bird was able to communicate, we might get a different story. Depending on the bird we probably would get many stories, in fact. We would find out what bird life is all about. And we might understand that canopy-world or tree-to-tree-world is not just different to ground-world but is nothing like anything we could ever imagine.
A boy writing an essay doesnt have to worry about such things. Its just nice to imagine you have wings. Flight is a beautiful thing to dream about. And therefore when you are asked what you would do if you had wings, its easy to flap the wings of your imagination and visit splendid places and witness the unimaginable.
Its different with adults. They know they dont have wings. Sure, they also have the ability to imagine. They also soar, literally and metaphorically. But then again, there are those who dont necessarily fly but are convinced they have a birds eye view of everything.
These are the know-alls. If that was all, it is still alright. The problem with the birds eye view is that from up there you tend to look down, literally and metaphorically, again. And theres many ways to look down, just as there are many ways to look up.
When we look up, say from a hilltop on a cloudless night, we get a sense of the universes enormity. And if we have some notion of maps, in particular the size of the island in a world map, then we obtain a sense of proportions. How big the universe, how large the world, how we cannot hold in our arms our island and in relation to these big things which are really very small compared to the universe, we understand how infinitely tiny we really are. Thats when we encounter humility.
Its different when we look down, not from cloud and tree-top but from a place we believe we have flown up to, way above the multitude, so high that all people and all things look like dots or smaller.
This is where we get tested. This is where we forget that if we can fly so too can others, in their own way, using the wings they have. We can all of a sudden feel we are above it all, way higher than anyone else can even imagine. Thats where we encounter arrogance.
From that point, we see flaw. We think he or she is small and we equate perceived smallness to things like weakness, inability, ignorance and stupidity. We forget, consequently, that however high we fly, we still know very little about the world, the universe and indeed ourselves.
We are not arahats. We are no saints. We are not all-knowing and all-seeing. The loser or bum that we in our arrogance so define could very well have an equal or better understanding of the human condition, although he or she may be less educated, less affluent or held less in regard. Flight has a way of blinding simply because of the fallacy of better sight.
And when you are right up there or believe thats where you are, you think it is your right to look down, to ridicule, to be condescending. We could call it bird droppings. Nothing smart about it. Nothing all-knowing about it. Just some smelly stuff. Waste, they call it.

Boosting SMEs role in exports vital- Eran
Sri Lankas plans to increase the contribution made by smaller-scale businesses to exports and lift foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2018 were both topics of conversation at a meeting held recently between Eran Wickramaratne, State Minister of Finance, and a team from Oxford Business Group (OBG).
During the talks, Wickramaratne said the budget for 2018 included measures aimed at bolstering support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as part of broader plans to hand them a bigger role in Sri Lankas economic development. The 2018 budget focuses on encouraging investments in exports. However, at the moment, a few big companies account for 90% of all earnings from international sales, he told OBGs team. It is vital, therefore, to strengthen SMEs in exports so that earnings are dispersed and the risks from exposure are reduced.
Wickramaratne added that the budget was drawn up with the aim of playing to the countrys strengths. Sri Lanka has a favourable geographical location, which allows it to act as a logistics hub between two huge markets, namely China and India, he said.
It also has a well-educated human resource base, despite its small size.
On the subject of FDI, Wickramaratne acknowledged that while FDI had fallen below expectation in the last couple of years we expect FDI to nearly double in 2017 over 2016.
Attracting FDI for key sectors, such as ICT, tourism and mining, is seen as pivotal in Sri Lankas efforts to make the transition to knowledge-based economy. I expect FDI in 2018 to register increased growth, taking account of the EUs generalised scheme of preferences plus (GSP+), the new budget and planned free trade agreements, the minister said.
OBGs representatives met Wickramaratne with work under way on The Report: Sri Lanka 2018, the global research and consultancy firms forthcoming publication on the countrys economy.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments. The publication will contain a detailed, sector-by-sector guide for investors, alongside contributions from leading personalities. It will be available in print and online.

Unwarranted respect
Some politicians are in the habit of naming various buildings, projects and schools in their names. These buildings, projects and schools built using the government funds. We are immensely thankful that the incumbent political leaders have not stooped down to such lower positions.
When naming the buildings after themselves, what the politicians shall not forget is that they are dishing out the taxpayers money. The designs are by engineers. The construction is done by the workers. Sometimes a number of workers ranging from professional engineers to labourers have died in accidents in the course of performing their duties.
But at the opening ceremonies and at anniversaries the politicians forget all this and they put their names for the projects. Only the politicians sometimes are invited for the opening ceremonies. They forget to mention the names of workers who sacrificed their lives for the betterment of the nation.
It is alright to name a building using a name of a politician, if the politician paid for the construction of the building. If the building is built using government funds it is not correct to name it after a politician.
We hope the politicians will not claim unnecessary respect and credit in the future.

Consensus between various communities vital - PM
Let us determine on the Thai Pongal day to focus on building a consensus between the communities, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
This would enable us to strengthen the shattered economy and bring about prosperity not only to the North and South but to the entire country, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was speaking at the National Thai Pongal Festival-2018 at Temple Trees yesterday.
He stressed that this event was a major national event of the country and an important Tamil festival.
The Prime Minister said as the Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly, he had been able to deliver the report of the Committee before the Constitutional Assembly with the consensus between all members of the community.
The Prime Minister added that this was the first time that such an effort had been made since independence of the country.
It had been presented without the disagreement of the members which is very good for the country, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
We have some options and it refers to serious studies by the members to find a political solution that is acceptable to all, the Prime Minister said.
He added that what they are doing at present is building a consensus and creating a climate to move towards a political solution which safeguards all cultures, religions and languages.

## Title: Consequences of the Butterfly Effect
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, January 16, 2018 - 01:00
Consequences of the Butterfly Effect
Sometimes a very small and insignificant event can lead to a huge effect later on.
Its called Butterfly Effect.
It can also lead to the creation of a new country, the displacement of twelve million people, the loss of around two million lives and permanent animosity among people who used to share their bread and ancestry at one point of time.
If we study the life of Muhammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, we will find three incidents which led to the Butterfly Effect, resulting into one of the most significant and bloodiest midnights in the world history.
To know these three small events, we will have to start with Jinnahs grandfather, Premjibhai Meghji Thakkar, who was a prosperous Hindu merchant from Kathiawar, Gujarat. He had made his fortune in the fish business, but he was ostracized from his vegetarian Lohana caste because of their strong religious beliefs. When he discontinued his fish business and tried to come back to his caste, he was not allowed to do so because of the huge egos of the self-proclaimed protectors of Hindu religion. Resultantly, his son, Punjalal Thakkar (the father of Jinnah), was so angry with the humiliation that he changed his and his four sons religion, and converted to Islam.
This was not the first incident when a Hindu had tried to come back to his religion and he was not allowed to do so by the priest class. When Islamic invasion began in India in 12th Century, many Hindus had lost their religion because of petty rules like drinking the water poured by a Muslim in their ponds, being forcibly converted to Islam or going to places outside India. When they tried to reconvert to Hinduism, the stubborn priests blocked their path and branded them as permanent dharmabhrashta.
This led to animosity in them for Hindus, and they converted to Islam and taught a lesson to those priests by killing them mercilessly. Today, a lot of Indian Muslims dont want to accept their Hindu ancestry, and the humiliation their ancestors felt centuries ago could be the reason behind it.
Nehrus remarks
Thats the first Butterfly Effect. If Jinnahs grandfather were allowed to come back to his caste and religion, Jinnah would have remained a Hindu, and he wont have used his genius in creating a new country for Muslims.
In 1929, Jinnahs wife, Rattanbai Petit, died due to a digestive disorder. He was so devastated at her death that he moved to London. He led a very private life, lived in a large house, played billiards and attended theatre. But things took a drastic turn when he heard a comment made by his arch-rival, Jawahar Lal Nehru. In a private dinner party, Nehru had remarked that Jinnah was finished.
It made Jinnah so furious that he packed up and headed back to India with the intent to show Nehru. He fired up the Muslim League, and transformed it from a scattered band of eccentrics to the second most powerful political party of India.
Thats the second butterfly effect. If Nehu hadnt made that remark, Jinnah would have stayed in London, Muslim League wont have become so powerful and India might have stayed united.
Just one year before the partition and independence of India, Jinnahs doctor, Dr. J. A. L. Patel, discovered something in the X-ray report of Jinnah which could have destroyed the gigantic efforts to create Pakistan. Dr. Patel discovered two dark circles in the report which could have upset the Indian political equation and would have almost changed the course of history. Jinnah was suffering from Tuberculosis which left him only two or three years to live at most. He pushed Mountbatten for a speedy freedom and partition of India to make sure he made the mark in history before he died. The secret of Jinnahs disease and imminent death stayed between him and his doctor, ensuring the bloody historical event.
Professional ethics
Thats the third Butterfly Effect. That grey film had the secret to block the partition, and it was stopped from coming out by a Hindu doctor who thought his professional ethics was more important than the lives of millions. Had this report become public knowledge, Gandhi and Mountbatten might have delayed the independence of India to let the gentleman die and avoid the partition.
In the movie, Gladiator, the main character, Maximus says, What we do in life echoes in eternity. We have no idea what eternal effect can come from something insignificant we are doing today. Jinnahs grandfather would have never thought that his decision to go into fish business would have impacted the lives of millions one century later.

Englands Stokes charged with affray over nightclub fight
London: England all-rounder Ben Stokes was charged with affray on Monday following an incident outside a nightclub, casting fresh doubt over his international future after he missed the sides ill-fated Ashes tour.
Cricket chiefs said they would meet in the next 48 hours to decide if Stokes will be allowed to take part in Englands upcoming tour of New Zealand, for which he has already been selected.
The confrontation in September in the southwestern city of Bristol reportedly left a man with a fractured eye socket. Stokes, 26, was suspended from international cricket until further notice by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), meaning he missed the Australia tour.
The CPS was passed a file of evidence by Avon and Somerset Police on 29 November in relation to an incident of disorder in Bristol city centre, said a spokesman for Englands Crown Prosecution Service.
Further material was subsequently received in late December. Following a review of all the available evidence, the CPS has today authorised the police to charge three men with affray in connection with the incident.
Stokes and the two other men will appear at Bristol Magistrates Court on a date to be fixed following the incident in the early hours of September 25 after England had beaten the West Indies in a one-day international in the city.
Responding to Mondays announcement, Stokes vowed to clear my name, telling his Twitter followers: I want to thank all those who have continued to support me in relation to the Bristol incident, not least my family, friends, fans and team-mates.
I gave a full and detailed account of my actions to the police on day one -- the same day as the incident -- and have co-operated at each step of the police inquiry. AFP

Govt. saved Rs.22,000 mn after debt servicing last year - Patali
The present government had saved Rs.22,000 million after servicing all its debts last year through proper financial management, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister said the countrys economy was burdened by the loans taken by the previous Rajapaksa regime and the government through proper financial management was taking the country out of this debt trap.
He said that following the defeat of the Rajapaksa regime, the people wanted an economic and a political revolution and the two main parties had formed a Unity Government to make the changes people wanted.
The Minister was addressing an election meeting at Beruwala on Sunday in support of UNP candidates contesting the forthcoming Local Council elections.
The minister sepeaking about the reckless acts committed by the past regime alleged that the three Rajapaksa brothers controlled almost 97 percent of the countrys economy by holding on to the important Ministries and creating 100 odd sub Ministries.
Unlike in the past, all powers of governance have been vested in the entire Cabinet of Ministers now.
This was a salutary change made against Feudalism family Bandyism and power hungry politics. This change for the better had been welcomed by all except a minority still running behind family bandyism, Minister Ranawaka added.
Although Mahinda Rajapaksa had claimed that Hambantota which had been a hive of development activity during his time had become a fallow land today, he wished to remind him that all infrastructure facilities which remained dormant during the previous regime were now live with activity under the present government.
These included the Rs.860 million International Conference Hall left for wasps to roost at the Rs.6000 million International stadium which did not stage a single cricket match, neglected Hambantota harbour and an Airport frequented by peacocks, he added
He also said the Rajapaksa regime while investing Rs. 1.5 million per head for the population in Hambantota had invested only Rs.45,000 per head for the population in Kandy.
Can a person who differentiated among people according to their area of residence be really referred to as Appachchie by the people,the minister asked.
He also said the Pohottuwa party will not be in existence today if there was no Constitutional impediment for the President to appoint any number of Ministers to his Cabinet.
But according to the Constitutional provisions today the President has the powers to appoint only a 30 member Cabinet of Ministers. It can go upto 45 members if there is a two party coalition governing the country. The Constitutional reforms brought about by the Yahapalana Government had pruned the powers of the President to appoint any number of Ministers arbitrarily as he wished,Minister Ranawaka added.
Arent the people feeling happy and secure about this change brought about by this government asked Minister Ranawaka.
Minister Ranawaka said a majority of Parliamentarians in the Pohottuwa party would have been in the Government if the proverbial saloon door was kept open as done during the Rajapaksa regime.
The Minister said earlier there was no restriction on the member of Ministers appointed by the Government.
Earlier the President could appoint a cabinet of 100 to 150 Ministers of he so wished. He could even appoint all 225 members of Parliament as Ministers or keep all Ministers to himself if he so desired.
The Constitutional reforms brought about by the Yahapalana Government had restricted the number of Ministries to 30 or 45 according to the circumstances and was not this a healthy change brought about to the body politic by this government he asked.
Minister Ranawaka said if this limitation was not imposed people in the Homagama area making a big hue and cry today would also have meekly joined the present government by obtaining a ministerial post.

Grown with words
English literature of this country has been a cornered subject mostly confined to an elitist class who speaks in that language. When the majority shies away from a certain language, its literature cannot reach for the upper ledges. Circumstances attendant on Sri Lankas English literature are no different.
Things are changing, thankfully. If there was a time when bookish customers scoured the bookshops for Jane Austen, Nicholas Sparks, Ian McEwan and the like, that phenomenon is witnessing a gradual about-face. Shehan Karunatilleke, Lal Medawattegedara, Vihanga Perera, Malinda Seneviratne, Elmo Jayawardane and the like have launched moving the bookshelves.
And who deserves kudos for this trend
No one in particular. But the Gratiaen Prize has played some part in that mission. The Prize has grown up over the years with a substantial amount of criticism levelled against it adding up to its maturity. What the State Literary Award, with its share for English fiction, could not achieve for years, the Gratiaen could accomplish single-handedly.
That is something that the Gratiaen Founder, Michael Ondaatje, could rejoice over especially as the Prize celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Incidentally, Ondaatjes initial source of inspiration, Man Booker Prize, celebrates its 50th milepost this year as well. Unlike the Gratiaen, the Man Booker Prize has a tough competition in Britain, of course, with a host of other literary prizes.
Why a literary prize, after all Are they an essential requirement for the growth of the literary landscape Or are they an impediment to the literary growth Whatever the answer is, we cannot control the existence of literary prizes.
Popular fiction hardly needs any market push. The classics need a push with some force. How do you differentiate between classics and popular fiction Popular fiction could not be always the pulp fiction, while classics should not be always the Jane Austen type. The popular/classics division should not bar our reading habit. But we require that to justify the literary awards, especially as both the Gratiaen and the Man Booker Prize have chosen the classical works. As for the definition of modern classical work, a hint of definition comes from an interview with Shehan Karunatilleke published in Roar.lk.
The question is posed to Karunatilleke: Speaking of Anthony Burgess, it was he who came up with this division of the A writer and the B writer. The A writer is primarily a storyteller. The B novelist is a language stylist. Where would you fall
Karunatilleke responds: Youd like to fall in the overlap. But I think Im guilty of being a B novelist, a language novelist. I do spend a lot of time crafting prose. I mean, its a difficult thing to do, and I do enjoy beautiful writing which doesnt necessarily have a plot. But the storytelling, the plot, I find harder. The beautiful sentences come easily to me. I revise all the time. Sometimes too much. Ill first write it to the end. For example, I wrote this in the morning, got to the end of it. Its a mess, but I got the main purpose of that scene down. Ill probably spend this week, as a procrastination method almost, and go back and do the editing and revising. Then Ill leave it and move on.
Sometime back in these columns, Ashok Ferrey expressed a similar sentiment with the term overwrought to describe the similar writing exercise.
Most classics are an offshoot such overwrought or overwritten exercises. They may not reach a wider audience like the popular books since the latter is more given to plots and storytelling. Thats where they need some encouragement like a literary award.
Founded by Michael Ondaatje, a Sri Lankan-born Canadian novelist in 1992, had the first award ceremony in 1993. That Ondaatje set up the Gratiaen Prize with the money he received as the Booker Prize for The English Patient is now known to almost everyone.
The Gratiaen Prize accepts printed books and manuscripts in a range of genres including fiction, poetry, drama, creative prose and literary memoir. Entries can be submitted between December 1 and 31 every year. These are assessed by a panel of three judges appointed by the Trust who are required to short-list three to five entries. The short-list event (open to the public) is usually held in April and hosted by the British Council, Colombo. A cash prize of Rs 200,000 is awarded in recognition of the best work of creative English writing.
When Tissa Abeysekara received the Gratiaen Prize for Bringing Tony Home it did not receive much public attention. Abeysekara passed away leaving his legacy as an eminent artiste but least known for his English novel. But the situation was different when his daughter, Charulatha Abeysekara, bagged the award. That was subject to the more public limelight.
The prize money of the Booker Prize was originally 21,000, though it was raised to 50,000 later in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the worlds richest literary prizes. Bernice Rubens was the first female author to secure the Booker Prize for The Elected Member. Alice Munros The Beggar Maid, shortlisted in 1980, is the only short story collection that remains to be shortlisted. Before 2001, the long list of nominees was not publicly revealed.
Whether the English language has a particular word for those who buy books but not read them or not, we are yet to know. But the language can certainly borrow a word from Japanese: Tsundoku. That is the fate usually prevalent with the classics. You buy the book for its cover and to show off the status, but hardly interested in reading. If the literary prizes will change that trend will remain a question.

Hathurusingha savours new  challenge with Sri Lanka
Dhaka: Chandika Hathurusingha on Sunday welcomed the challenge of coaching a deflated Sri Lanka back to form after their worst year in international cricket, marked by humiliating defeats and few wins.
The freshly-appointed head coach took the bruised national side to Bangladesh over the weekend ahead of their first international series of the year.
Hathurusingha said Sri Lanka have a lot to improve but he was optimistic they could turn the corner after a dismal year of losses, leadership changes, injuries and scandal for the former World Cup winners.
I am excited to take up the challenge. I am excited with the talent and skills available with my team now, Hathurusingha, 49, told reporters Sunday. A tri-nation one-day international tournament starts Monday with a contest between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.
Sri Lankas first match of the event is against Zimbabwe Wednesday, before they face Bangladesh two days later. It is familiar ground for Hathurusingha, who quit as Bangladesh head coach in the middle of their disastrous tour of South Africa to return to his native Sri Lanka.
The islanders are licking their wounds after their worst performance since 1987.
Sri Lanka won just five of their 29 ODIs, with injury and scandals also plaguing the side on and off the field.
Angelo Mathews stood down as captain in July amid the turmoil but just six months later was reappointed skipper for limited-overs cricket ahead of the 2019 World Cup.
Sri Lanka were the final team to qualify for the tournament they won in 1996.
Hathurusingha resigned as Bangladesh coach in October after a largely successful stint helping the side claim several high-profile wins and reach seventh in the ODI rankings.
He ruled out being emotionally attached to his former side, but wished Bangladesh well in the tri-nation series.
I worked with them closely and got to know them really well. At the same time, I want Sri Lanka to do well, he said.
Mathews, 30, said he was pleased to return as skipper. I never expected it, but I am looking forward to it, he said. AFP

Ferdinand
Hits the animation movie bullseye
At first glance the picture if the mammoth sized bull may seem intimidating but we soon learnt that despite his size Ferdinand has an equally big heart. Set in the beautifully animated backdrops of Spain Ferdinand relates that you cannot judge a bull by how he looks similar to the fact that you cannot judge a book by its cover.
From Blue Sky Studios and Carlos Saldanha, the director of Rio and inspired by the beloved book The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf and Robert Lawson, Ferdinand brings WWE Champion John Cena to the animation movie scene in a read role. The superstar wrestler has rendered his voice for the gentle giant of a bull. He does commendable work since Ferdinand captures your heart instantly. While other bulls are eager to show some muscle and fight Ferdinand is seem smelling flowers and giving CPR to little bunny rabbits. Such comparisons may raise a few laughs but there is no stopping the audience from developing a liking for the gentle bull.
The rest of the voice cast is excellent as well and their varying accents from Scottish to American give an interesting feeling to the tale. The characters vary in personality too. You get the three hedgehogs Una, Dos and Cuatro, Lupe, the calming goat, Angus, the bull from Scotland and a trio of prancing ponies Hans, Klaus and Greta. Enter the famous matador, El Primero, wants to fight the mightiest bull for his last final bow in the arena.
Adventure, songs, thrills and spills are scattered around the movie so there is no dull moment. Though the theme of the movie based on following your dreams is not new to the Hollywood animation world, Ferdinand still manages become a winner because of its soul stirring nature. For example though he has the opportunity to escape from Casa del Toro without raising the alarm Ferdinand still turns back because he wants to save the rest of the bulls in the ranch from the terrible fate of being slathered and having their horns put on display after facing a matador. Similarly when the rest of the bulls manage to escape on the train Ferdinand lags behind because he knows that the workers at the ranch are after him and once he is captured they would give up the chase. There is also a more serious tone in the film which delivers the timely message of being cruelty free.

## Title: JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE POWER AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, January 16, 2018 - 01:00
JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE POWER AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY
It is a feature of modern democratic life that the Courts be permitted to review the administrative power of the state, exercised by government officials and bureaucrats. Sri Lankan Courts have over the past forty years or so, advanced the frontiers of judicial review.
Judicial review is at a fundamental level concerned with public accountability. It seeks to ensure that public power is exercised according to certain well-established norms and principles. Those who wield state power need to account for their actions. It seeks to exclude the arbitrary exercise of power. Traditional scholarship drew a distinction between administrative action and judicial action.
According to traditional ideas of scholarship, administrative power could be exercised by the executive, unfettered by any prior principles of conduct. It was subject only to the accountability that Parliament exercised over the Minister concerned. In modern context, however, this argument is deeply flawed Parliamentary accountability in most cases, appears to be not very effective. It depends to a large degree on the vigour and competence of the opposition, the efficiency of the committee system and the autonomy of individual MPs. Moreover, the accountability that Parliament exercises are of a more general nature. Specific grievances are not addressed. It is important that citizens have recourse to judicial tribunals to question individual cases of administrative abuse.
Regular elections, a vibrant media, an effective Parliamentary opposition and a vigorous public opinion are some general methods of ensuring accountability. Judicial review would be a more specific method.
In a constitution founded on democracy and the rule of law, there is something fundamental and sacrosanct about judicial review.
Public power is held in trust by the administration to be exercised in a democratic manner. It is one of the tasks of judicial review to ensure that this trust is not violated. It is of the essence of the democratic State that power should be exercised according to certain principles or standards. When courts review administrative acts they consider whether these standards of conduct have been followed.
The grounds orstandards of review
The exercise of administrative power is reviewed against three sets of criteria:
Human rights standards, general principles of administrative justice and the Doctrine of Public Trust. The procedures laid down in Article 126 of the Sri Lankan Constitution are an example of the former. Courts review administrative or executive action against the human rights standards laid down in Chapter III of the Constitution. Under this Article, citizens have the right to petition the Supreme Court in cases where the rights in Chapter III are violated.
The Doctrine of public trust which derives strength and legal validity from provisions of the 1978 Constitution and other constitutional principles such as the Rule of Law highlights that executive and administrative act must have a public benefit and public purpose. The Doctrine also highlights that no discretionary power is absolute or unfettered and that it is essential that public officers are held to a high standard in the execution of their powers for the purpose for which it was conferred. The abuse of power is a violation of the trust that public has reposed in such officials by virtue of Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution and is therefore supported by the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties of the 1978 Constitution.
Under the general principles of administrative justice, there are standards of review the courts have developed over a considerable period of time. These include grounds such as the lack of jurisdiction, the violation of the rules of natural justice, an abuse of discretionary power and error of law on the face of the record. In Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service Lord Diplock re-classified the traditional grounds as illegality, irrationality and procedural defects. He also noted the emergence of the new ground of proportionality. It is also important that judicial standards do not become a fetter on progressive administrative decision making. The writ process should not be used to block enterprising and innovative administrative acts. Lord Scarman has cautioned that, although judicial review is a great weapon in the hands of judges, it should be used by judges, conscious of the constitutional context in which they function.
Judicial review
The judicial review of legislative or administrative action can have political consequences. In tightly controlled and authoritarian societies its political repercussions are even more pronounced. A decision which goes against a State Agency, government department or Minister, is often looked at as a rebuke of the government of the day.
In the area of public law, the pronouncements of the Courts have significant political repercussions. And it is also clear that the Courts are influenced by this political culture in reaching their decisions. At times political elites have reacted with hostility to judgments they have considered unfavourable. One such example is the hostility that came in the Vivienne Goonewardene Case. Two days after the Supreme Court found that a police officer had violated the rights of the petitioner, a left-wing politician; a gang of thugs stoned the houses of the three judges who participated in the decision.
Article 126 of the Constitution
Articles 140 and 141 of the Constitution give the Court of Appeal the power to grant the writs of certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto and habeas corpus. In Sri Lanka apart from an application for a writ, it is also possible to apply under Article 126 of the Constitution to challenge administrative action. To succeed in an application under this provision, the petitioner would have to establish a violation of one of the fundamental rights contained in Chapter III of the constitution. This dual system of remedies has seen an increasing use of concepts developed in administrative law in cases brought under this constitutional remedy. While the constitution now explicitly vests in the Sri Lankan courts the power to issue writs, the emergence of this writ jurisdiction has been viewed essentially as a development of the English common law.
The entrenchment of a specific remedy in Sri Lankas constitutional fabric to question administrative action, which violates fundamental rights, has resulted in Sri Lankan judges borrowing frequently from the lush and fertile jurisprudence of administrative law. In Wickramtunge v Ratwatte, an application filed under Article 126 of the Constitution, the court laid down several principles of fair conduct that a public body must observe. Many of these principles were drawn from the area of administrative law. The Supreme Court stated that a statutory public body must act reasonably and in good faith and not erode the fundamental rights recognized and declared in the Constitution.
Jayawardene v Wijetilleke, another fundamental rights application under Article 126, was a classic violation of the rules of natural justice. The person who occupied the post of Inquirer into Sudden Deaths in Gampaha was removed without a hearing. The Supreme Court held that this action violated the equal protection of law clauses in Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Court also held that the respondent had acted without legal authority. In Tennekoon v de Silva the Court quoting administrative law scholar H W R Wade, held that not providing reasons for the transfer of a police officer may deprive him of the protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Court found that the transfer was unreasonably and arbitrary and violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.
In Surendran v UGC the Supreme Court, borrowing a concept from administrative law, held that a candidate from Jaffna who sat a special advanced level examination in April 1991, had a legitimate expectation that there would be no discrimination between this examination and the advanced level examination held in August 1990.
When the UGC sought to make a distinction between the two examinations the Court held that the candidates fundamental right under Article 12(1) was violated. A similar position was taken in Gunaratne v Sri Lanka Telecom where the Supreme Court struck down a scheme of recruitment on the ground that the legitimate expectations of non-graduate clerks had been disregarded.
In Bandara v Premechandra the Court held that public officers who hold office at pleasure may be dismissed without reasons being provided. However, this does not mean that no reasons need exist. When the court (as distinguished from the applicant) asks for reasons, they should be provided. Failure to provide reasons to the court can lead to a conclusion that the act was arbitrary and therefore violated Article 12. The power that must be governed by reason and not caprice. These powers are not absolute or unfettered and should be exercised fairly. A similar view was taken the Gunaratne v Petroleum Corporation. While reasons need not be provided at the initial stage, proper reasons for administrative decision making must exist. The Court held that there was a violation of Article 12 since the Petroleum Corporation failed to justify why it had terminated a dealership agreement. The concept of reasonableness had previously been used by the Sri Lankan Supreme Court in the case of Siriwardene v Liyanage in deciding whether acts taken under Emergency Regulations violated the right to free expression guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution.
Fusion of administrativelaw concepts
The above line of cases shows that the Sri Lankan Supreme Court has not been reluctant to borrow concepts from the administrative law in interpreting Article 12 of the Constitution. In fact, the Court has borrowed freely and frequently. This fusion of administrative law concepts with constitutional ideas has substantially enriched the public law jurisprudence of this country.
The Sri Lankan Courts have also used fundamental rights to enlarge the scope of the writs. In Perera v Prof. Daya Edirisinghe the Supreme Court held that the rules and examination criteria of the University of Kelaniya, read together with article 12 of the Constitution, gave a duly qualified candidate a right to a degree.
The Court added that there was a duty on the University to award the degree without discrimination, and even where the University had reserved some discretion, the exercise of such discretion would be subject to Article 12. In the same case the Supreme Court observed that the Bill of Rights in the Sri Lankan Constitution had enlarged the scope of the writs. According to the Court it is now possible to claim relief for the violation of a fundamental right by way of a writ. The initial application would be filed in the Court of Appeal and since it involves a question of fundamental rights the matter would have to be referred to the Supreme Court for adjudication.
Natural Justice has emerged as a universal legal principle transcending almost all legal systems. Its scope and content have been progressively expanded over the past 50 years. Natural justice is one way in which the public are allowed to participate in decisions which affect their lives.
A significant limitation which existed both in the law of Sri Lankan and England was that the rule applied only in cases of judicial and quasi-judicial action. Administrative acts did not attract the principles of natural justice according to previous judicial authority.
This position, however, has been jettisoned by the courts in favour of the more acceptable position that the principle applies in almost all cases. Natural justice has been expanded significantly by imposing on administrative bodies a duty to furnish reasons.
Sri Lanka needs a considerable overhaul of its public law framework. And this overhaul will be done best through legislation. While not underplaying the role of the judiciary in developing the law, procedural changes and a new public law framework will best be introduced through legislation. The substantive grounds of review though should be kept broad enough to allow judges to develop them through the common law method.

Kohli century keeps India in touch with South Africa
Centurion: Virat Kohli led by example with a batting showcase as India stayed in contention on the third day of the second Test against South Africa at SuperSport Park on Monday.
Kohli hit a masterly 153 in Indias first innings of 307 to stay in touch in Centurion, even though South Africa stretched a 28-run first innings lead to 118 by scoring 90 for two in their second spell at bat on a storm-shortened afternoon.
India are slightly behind going into day four despite Kohlis innings and two early wickets from opening bowler Jasprit Bumrah, but they could justifiably feel that they were still in with a chance of levelling the three-match series following South Africas 72-run win in the first Test in Cape Town.
Kohli had lamented Indias poor batting in Cape Town and he could not have provided a better demonstration of how to handle South Africas four-pronged pace attack.
In a model of concentration, good judgement and occasional breathtaking strokes, Kohli batted for 380 minutes, faced 217 balls and hit 15 fours. It was his 21st Test century to go along with 15 half-centuries, the best conversion rate since Don Bradman of any batsman who has passed 50 more than 30 times.
He was last man out when he was caught in the deep off Morne Morkel, hitting to one of eight fielders on the boundary as he tried to squeeze some extra runs with his tailenders having shown they were ill-equipped to handle fast bowlers wielding the second new ball.
Morkel finished with four for 60, taking the last three wickets, including that of Ishant Sharma, who could only fend a vicious bouncer to short leg.
Kohli received minimal support from his team-mates, with Murali Vijay (46) and Ravichandran Ashwin (38) the only other batsmen to reach the twenties.
Ashwin helped Kohli add 71 off 87 balls for the seventh wicket but he lived dangerously after being peppered by short-pitched balls from Kagiso Rabada at the start of his innings.
Indias cause was not helped by two needless run-outs. Following Cheteshwar Pujaras first-ball dismissal on Sunday, Hardik Pandya started off for a risky single when he played the ball to mid-on. He was sent back by Kohli and then committed the cricketing sin of failing to ground either his foot or his bat as Vernon Philanders throw hit the stumps.
South Africas second innings got off to a poor start as Bumrah reduced them to three for two.

Lanka Ashok Leyland shows strong 3Q-2017 performance
Lanka Ashok Leyland carried its remarkable quarterly performance into the New Year with a remarkable 3rd quarter performance.
Revenue grew 52% for the first nine months of the year to LKR 11.6bn against LKR 7.6bn in 2016. While turnover is heavily reliant on vehicles sales, revenue from body manufacturing and spare parts have grown by 45% and 14% this year respectively. Gross profit stood at LKR 851.9mn, a 23% increase YoY while the gross profit margin contracted to 7.3% owing to higher unit costs of the new range of BS3 compliant improved specification vehicles. Prudent fiscal management and operational efficiency saw operating costs reduce 6% to LKR 285.6mn against LKR 302.2mn. Furthermore, net finance costs fell 87% to LKR 8.9mn compared to LKR 69mn for the same period last year. Inventory increased 59% to LKR 6.2bn on account as the company builds up a stock of BS3 environmental standard compliant vehicles with upgraded technology.
The company posted a 9 month PBT of LKR 500mn, a 97% increase year on year.
Umesh Gautam, CEO of Lanka Ashok Leyland, added that this sustained performance by the company is attributable to the brand acceptance we have and the trust we have earned in the market. The substantial rise in our inventory is in lieu of the BS3 range of vehicles imported to bring confidence to the marketto phase out existing fleets. We are absorbing the higher import cost per unit of these vehicles to reduce the burden on our customers and incentivize customers to switchover to environmentally friendlier vehicles.We are targeting to surpass LKR 15bn turnover by year end.
Complementary to our vehicle sales, revenue from spare parts and bodybuilding have also done well and we hope to unlock more value in those verticals to broad base our revenue distribution going forward. Furthermore, the company has taken a landmark decision to undertake a large-scale CSR project moving away from the type of activities weve been involved with up till now. We feel that the time is right to give back to our communities in a way that reflects the sort of ambition we have shown in our business operations.

Largest haul of seized cocaine destroyed

President, PM witness occasion:The largest haul of seized cocaine worth Rs. 16.7 billion was destroyed yesterday in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Law and Order and Southern Devlopment MinisterSagala Ratnayaka, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale, Ministers and MPs, IGP Pujitha Jayasundara and government and Law and Order officials.Pictures by Rukmal Gamage
Enforcing the governments commitment to create a drug free society, 928 kgs of seized cocaine valued at Rs. 16.7 billion was publicly destroyed for the first time in the country in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale and several other dignitaries in Katunayake yesterday. This is the largest stock of cocaine seized to date in South Asia and this is the first time that a seized stock of drugs was destroyed publicly in Sri Lanka.
For the first time, the stock of cocaine which was brought to the location from the Government Analysts Department was subjected to a confirmation check by the Dangerous Drugs Control Board at the INCEE Group premises in Katunayake.
Minister Ratnayaka said the decision to destroy the drugs that were confiscated by the authorities in public was taken during a Cabinet meeting.
Usually the general practice had been to destroy the drugs that are seized at the relevant courts after the cases had been completed and the drugs are no longer needed as evidence.
But, this is the first time such a haul of seized drugs was destroyed publicly.
During 2015, 2016 and 2017, the total value of drugs seized is Rs. 34 billion.
The value of the 928 kilograms and 229 grams is Rs. 16.7 billion. In fact Rs. 34 billion is half the annual budget of the entire Police Department, the Minister said.
This is including the salaries, capital expenditure etc.
This is a large amount and this is a clear sign of how powerful this drug business is. Generally, it is known that drugs and organised crime go hand in hand together with the weapons trade and the underworld.
However, our government is determined to break this cycle and the President and Prime Minister thus, gave orders to establish a new unit in the Police Department through a process of restructuring in order to fight drugs and related crimes. As a result the unit is functioning efficiently under the leadership of a Senior DIG,Minister Ratnayaka said. The stock of cocaine which was brought to a storage facility of INCEE Group in Katunayake was first examined and weighed in the presence of the Colombo Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.The drugs were then placed in special containers and mixed with a solution.
The liquid cocaine was then transported in a special hazardous waste disposal vehicle to its facility in Puttalam to be destroyed in its incinerator at a temperature of above 1,300 centigrades.
The whole process was carried out under the supervision of the Colombo Magistrate and the Dangerous Drugs Control Board.
The stock of cocaine which was seized by the Police Narcotics Bureau in 2016 and subsequent to court procedures, permission was granted to destroy the seized cocaine.
Accordingly, the Sustainable Waste Management arm of the INSEE Group, INCEE Ecocycle together with the Sri Lanka Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) and the Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) took the responsibility to dispose the stock of cocaine through their cement kiln co-processing for the first time in Sri Lanka.
The Minister thanked the Dangerous Drugs Control Board, Attorney generals Department, The Government Analysts Department, the Tri Forces and Police and all other institutions that assist in eradicating the drug menace.
He said the main aim of the government was to create a drug free country for our future generations.
Minister Ratnayaka noted that the government is also working with several international bodies in order to enhance the intelligence services to smash the drugs network.

Legal provisions for disabled voters
The Election Commission said there would be legal provisions for voters with disabilities to be accompanied by a person to assist in marking ballot papers at polling stations, yesterday.Any disabled voter who is unable to bring a person to assist could cast his vote through the senior presiding officer on behalf of the voter, in the presence of another officer, similar to previous elections.
Provisions exist in Section 54(2) of the Principal Act by Elections (Special Provisions) Act No. 28 of 2011 for a person who is totally or partially, visually-handicapped or physically-disabled, to be accompanied by another to assist in marking of ballot papers, the Election Commission in a statement said. The person who accompanies the disabled person should be more than 18 years of age and not a contesting candidate at the election. Similarly, the person should not be an authorized agent or a polling agent of a political party at the election. In addition, he or she should not be a person subject to any disability.
In order tobe accompanied by a person to assist as stated above, a Certificate of Eligibility should be handed over to the officers at the polling station.
The form to be used to obtain the Certificate of Eligibility can be collected from the Grama Niladhari in the area of authority of the relevant Local Authority. A specimen of the Certificate of Eligibility can also be downloaded by visiting the website www.elections.gov.lk of the Election Commission.
The visually or physically-disabled person may obtain an application form from the Grama Niladhari. The form should be completed and the Grama Niladhari's endorsement should be obtained on it and then submitted to a Government Medical Officer, who would examine the applicant and certify that he or she is entitled to be treated as a disabled person, the Election Commission further said. The disabled person should proceed to the polling station with his national identity card or any other approved identity document acceptable at the polling station and the Certificate of Eligibility certified by the Government Medical Officer, and accompanied by the person who is named to assist the voter.
The staff at the polling station, having ascertained the identity of the voter, would go through the normal procedure and issue a ballot paper to the voter. The voter would then be directed to the senior presiding officer, along with the accompanying person. It is also essential that the person accompanying the disabled voter should also bring his own national identity card or any other identity document which is acceptable at the polling station, the Election Commission added. The senior presiding officer would collect the voters Certificate of Eligibility and obtain a written statement, which is at the bottom of Part II of the certificates of Eligibility, from the accompanying person. A disabled voter cannot go to the polling station with an accompanying person if the voter does not take with him a Certificate of Eligibility. The Certificate of Eligibility would be retained with the senior presiding officer after the disabled person casts his vote.

Licence of pilot who  flew Minister suspended
The Civil Aviation Authority has suspended the licence of the pilot who had flown the civilian aircraft that transported the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and his delegation to Palali without a proper flight plan and endangered the lives of his passengers.
A newspaper report was published claiming that the Air Force had flown the Minister to Palali and that the pilot had been uncertain of the route to his destination.
However, Air Force Media Spokesman Group Captain Gihan Seneviratne denied a news item published that an SLAF aircraft had transported Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera to Palali and endangered his life due to the pilot being incapable of finding the route.
Speaking to the Daily News, Seneviratne said this news item published in a Sinhala daily on January 15 is utterly false.
On the said date no Air Force aircraft had flown to Palali. According to the air traffic control report the minister had taken a civil aircraft to Palali.
In fact it is surprising that this newspaper report had suggested that the Air Force pilots who are veterans at flying to the North were uncertain of the route.
They have in fact completed countless flights to the North and are well seasoned at transporting VIPs. This is malicious and irresponsible reporting done without first verifying facts. Also it is an attempt to tarnish the image of the Airforce he noted.
Meanwhile, the Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority H.M.C. Nimalsiri told the Daily News that a special team has been appointed to investigate this incident.
However, while the investigations are in progress the licence of the pilot concerned has been suspended.
It is not only irresponsible but it is also illegal for a pilot to fly an aircraft without following the proper procedures and a flight plan.
Not just VIPs but a pilot should not endanger the life of even a single passenger.
A pilot cannot fly an aircraft without knowing the route. This is unacceptable,he said.

Lopez to star on Will and Grace reboot
Jennifer Lopez will star in the Will & Grace reboot as herself and her Shades of Blue character Detective Harlee Santos.
The 48-year-old singer previously appeared as herself in two episodes at the end of the sixth season of the programme, as well as the premiere of season seven. In the episodes, she stated that she grew up with Megan Mullallys character Karens maid Rosario in the Bronx, and ended up singing Waiting for Tonight at the wedding of Karen and Lyle, played by John Cleese.
Jennifer was praised at the time for her comedic timing and self-deprecation, with her demands that everyone around her wear her branded jeans and Glow fragrance poking fun at her alleged diva behaviour over the years.
And now the mother of two will once again show off her funny woman skills, appearing in an upcoming episode of the recently rebooted NBC series, the air date of which has yet to be revealed.
As well as starring as herself on the episode, Jennifer will also showcase her alter-ego Harlee, known for her short curly hair, and shared a picture of herself in character on the set of the programme on her Instagram page on Wednesday (10Jan18).
Look where I am!!! Back on @nbcwillandgrace This time I brought Harlee!! #shadesofblue, she captioned the selfie, which also featured Megan, as well as show stars Debra Messing and Sean Hayes.
Will & Graces 16-episode comeback season premiered in September, and became NBCs most-watched comedy in 12 years, with 15.8 million viewers tuning in. Bosses have also commissioned a 13-episode second season of the reboot.
The original programme concluded in 2006 after an eight-season run. During that time, the show was nominated for a staggering 83 Emmy Awards, and won 16 of them, including the prestigious Outstanding Comedy Series gong.

Mustangs trophy encounters revisited by an old Thomian
The book is a valuable one as it has authentic details of the matchesand the team members. Great pains must have been taken to find out the Christian names or other popular names of the players. Outstandingperformances have been given pride of place
Shantilal Wijesundere, an old Thomian and a cricket enthusiast, has compiled a comprehensive book on the encounters for the Mustangs Trophy. I must congratulate him as he has added to a collection of material already available in relation to Royal-Thomian encounters of the longer version. The match as all cricket lovers know is played after the Big Match by the teams of Royal College and S. Thomas College. The match has been played from 1975 and the history of the matches is well presented.
Wijesundere not only covers the matches but also gives us the history of how the Mustangs Trophy came about th includes an article by one of those responsible for initiating the idea. He also gives us some interesting trivia on the shorter form of the game and the Duckworth Lewis Stern (DWS) method of dealing with shortened matches.
Many famous names are mentioned against the individual matches and it was interesting to read some messages from cricketers who participated in the first encounter. Cricket enthusiasts who are not old boys would also be fascinated to be reminded of many schoolboy cricketers who were household names in the past.
The book is a valuable one as it has authentic details of the matches and the team members. Great pains must have been taken to find out the Christian names or other popular names of the players. Outstanding performances have been given pride of place. The research which has gone into this work is commendable and should be applauded.
The record produced is given official recognition by the Principals of the Colleges giving their own messages.
The compiler intended that the proceeds of the book be used for sport activities of the two Colleges.
The book is available at the STC OBA Secretariat or the Royal College Union office.

My nose, her cheeks..!
Theres two young men, twins, whove come into my life, and as I hold either one or the other of my daughters newborns in my hands, I hear voices, Hes got your nose Bob! or Hes got his daughters cheeks! There are some who swear they look exactly like their father, and others sigh and whisper, Arent they so cute!
In fact, I must admit I joined the vanity brigade when I suddenly left the room, stood in front of a bathroom mirror and came back and announced to my wife and all in the room, I think one of them has my smile! Never mind that nobody gushed or exclaimed, Yes Bob, youre right! Its just that as I held them this morning, helping in their feed, I suddenly understood, and told the two, Whats inside dear boys is what matters!
Im not sure they understood, poor mites, hearing me growl such truths to them, but someday Im going to tell them this, you guys, you might have the smoothest smile, the cutest chin, the most fancied face, but it doesnt matter, its the inside, that does.
And maybe theyll turn to me puzzled and ask, But how would anybody see whats inside By the way it comes outside! Ill tell them.
Your calm inside can bring peace to those around you. Your sense of justice in your heart will make your friends know how fair you are. Your strong feelings of love will make you loyal to those youre close to. Its the inside my little fellows that matters.
I walk to the mirror again, and stare at it, but this time I dont look to see whether the smile is the same as that of the two little chaps. I stare at the mirror and wonder what those around me see, and suddenly Im not too happy with the man in the mirror.
I walk back to the two little fellows who look back at me. I pray, I tell them, That you face challenges as you grow up, and as you face and surmount each obstacle, determination and resolve will form your features!
I pray, I tell them, That you will learn to taste both defeat and victory, and that in defeat you will learn to bounce back and fight again, in victory, youll both learn to be gracious to those you have won over! I look at them and continue, And may your jaw and cheekbone show proudly those episodes of winning and losing, and that your mouths smile in the face of adversity!

Namals alleged money laundering case fixed for Feb. 6
A case filed against Hambantota district Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and five others for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs.30 million through Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited was yesterday fixed for February 6 by Colombo High Court.
Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon fixed the case for a calling date since the defence was yet to receive several documents pertaining to the prosecution evidence.
The four accused - Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sujani Bogollagama and Iresha Silva who functioned as the directors of Gowers Corporation Pvt. Ltd were present in court when the case was taken up before the Colombo High Court.
However, the second accused Indika Karunajeewa was not present in Court but represented by attorneys.
On a previous occasion, the High Court permitted the prosecution to proceed with the trial in the absentia of second and sixth accused in the case in terms of Section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The Colombo High Court had already served indictments on three accused regarding this money laundering case.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited on 11 counts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million in a company (Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited) owned by Namal Rajapaksa between 2013 and 2014.
It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited of Colombo 5, is providing coordinating services to SriLankan Airlines.
The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being an MP from the Rs.125 million earned through illegal means.
State Counsel Padmal Weerasinghe appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for Namal Rajapaksa. Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva appeared for the third accused.
Counsel Sampath Mendis appeared for the second and fourth accused.

## Title: Open-heart surgeries successful at Jaffna Teaching Hospital

Open-heart surgeries successful at Jaffna Teaching Hospital
Two open-heart surgeries utilising cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machines with latest technology, were successfully performed recently for the first time at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, Hospital Director Dr. T. Sathiyamoorthy said in a statement.
The surgeries were carried out by a team led by Consultant Cardiothoracic Surgeon Dr. Sithamparanathan Muhunthan. This is an important milestone in the growth of the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. It is a matter of pride that the Jaffna Teaching Hospital is now one of only four government hospitals where open-heart surgeries are being performed in Sri Lanka, he added.
A thoracic surgery section had functioned at the Teaching Hospital 30 years ago. A team under the leadership of Dr. A.T.S. Paul had performed thoracic surgeries between 1969  1970. Later, eminent consultant thoracic surgeons like Dr. Stephan, Dr. R. Natkunam and Rudra Rajaretnam, had worked at the Teaching Hospital, up to 1984.
During this period, cardiothoracic surgeries including minor heart surgeries like CMV  closed mitral valvotomy, PDA ligation, ASD closure, etc., were performed. However, modern facilities for performing the surgery by suspending the beating of the heart, were not available.
It was possible only to do minor surgeries over short periods of time by reducing heart function by cooling the body temperature (hypothermia), without stopping the heart, the Director of the hospital further said.
He said that the facility to perform surgery over a longer period, by stopping the heart completely and maintaining the circulation with the help of modern cardiopulmonary bypass machine (heart lung machine) is now available. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a technique that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs during surgery by maintaining the circulation of blood and oxygen in the patients body. The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a heart lung machine.
The cardiothoracic surgery team consists of consultant cardiothoracic surgeon, consultant anaesthesiologist, consultant cardiologist, assistant doctors, perfusionist (CPB machine operators), nurses and health assistants. Though the first consultant cardiothoracic surgeon to Jaffna, Dr. Sithamparanathan Muhunthan, was appointed over a year ago, the necessary facilities were not available to perform surgery immediately. During this period, he worked at Lady Ridgeway Hospital for children on a part-time basis and was engaged in the establishment of the operating theatre, Intensive Care Unit and obtaining equipment (CPB machine) necessary for surgery.
He also had to make arrangements to get the perfusionist and nursing officers trained, etc. During this period four nursing officers who worked here had gone to the cardiothoracic surgery units of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka and Lady Ridgeway Hospital for children and obtained 3 months further training. Health assistants were also sent to these hospitals to obtain training.
The Jaffna Teaching Hospital is a hospital functioning under the direct administration of the Central Health Ministry in Colombo. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Health Services Director General, and higher officials of the Health Ministry, have given the necessary suggestions and assistance to perform heart surgeries at our hospital, this year.
The Health Ministry is taking action to appoint a complete cadre of staff and establish a new building complex during the coming year, the director said.
The director thanked the Colombo National Hospital, Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Teaching Hospital Kandy and Karapitiya Hospital for helping to start the heart surgery in Jaffna by providing training to his team of nurses and perfusionist and for temporarily releasing two perfusionists who operate the heart lung machine.
The director went on to say though the Ministry of Health had appointed a cardiothoracic surgeon in the early part of 2017, it has not appointed separate anaesthesiologists and other doctors.
At present, only two doctors have been appointed to the unit. Despite the shortage of staff in the department of anaesthesiology at the Teaching Hospital Jaffna, the anaesthesiology department helped to perform the surgeries by end 2017.
We have been planning during the past year to construct a separate building complex with complete staffing and equipment for cardiothoracic surgery at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, he added. In the meantime, the Central Health Ministry had taken action to purchase a CPB machine worth Rs. 30 million. We will receive that machine soon.
However, until we receive that new machine, Hemas Surgical and Diagnosis which sells Terumo machines, helped initiate the surgery early in 2018 by loaning the machine they had. Only a section of the Intensive Care Unit (CT/ICU), with two beds for management of post-surgery patients, is currently available at the hospital.
Therefore, heart surgeries could be performed better when a permanent building complex is constructed.

Supreme Court determines
Presidents term  is five years
The Supreme Court has informed President Maithripala Sirisena that his current term is five years from the date of assuming office. The Supreme Court communicated its decision on Sunday pursuant to a clarification sought by the President.
A five-judge Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice K.T. Chitrasiri was appointed by the Supreme Court last Wednesday to decide on President Maithripala Sirisenas term in office.
President Sirisena assumed office on January 9, 2015 for a term of six years as per the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, but the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which was passed into law on April 28, 2015, restricted the term of President to five years.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, making submissions in the Supreme Court on Thursday, stated the provision limiting the term of the President could not be applied with retrospective effect. Any changes of the term of President would be an alienation of the sovereignty of the people, he maintained.
The Supreme Court on Thursday concluded arguments put forward in support and against the reference application forwarded by President Sirisena.
The President in a posting on his official Twitter account on Friday said he is ready to accept the decision of the Supreme Court on the duration of his term with due respect. I am ready to leave the position even today. That is true democracy, he said.
The Presidents Media Division in a brief note yesterday acknowledged the receipt of Supreme Court determination that the term of the incumbent President is five years.

Rescinding liquor gazette
The decision by President Maithripala Sirisena to rescind the gazette allowing for an extension of liquor outlet opening hours and over- the-counter liquor purchasing by women and the employment of females at liquor shops will be welcomed by most while there will be others with a more liberal bent who would see nothing wrong in the exercise. This column has been supportive of Minister Mangala Samaraweeras move to introduce a liberal liquor policy in this country, doing away with the hypocrisy practiced in this regard by all governments in deference to Maha Sangha and other clergy.
The minister had earlier spoken in favour of having liquor shops opened even on Poya days, since as is well known, liquor sales observed a spike on this day than on any other days where bootleggers had booming business. The minister also came in for heavy flak for reducing the taxes on soft liquor in his budget, by members of the Sangha and the Joint Opposition, on the grounds that this will induce non drinkers to take to the bottle. We also commended Minister Samaraweera for his way of seeing things as they are and his penchant for the unorthodox, regardless of the consequences.
However, permitting extra hours for liquor to be sold, coming as it did soon after the reduction on the prices of soft liquor, naturally has brought the members of the clergy on the war path once again. True, most of the comments we hear are politically motivated and made by monks who are Rajapaksa supporters. With local government elections looming, this also has given a potent weapon to the Joint Opposition to use against the government which fact may also not have been lost on the President. No less a personage than Mahinda Rajapaksa took up the issue of the liberal liquor policy adopted by the government, while addressing a local government election meeting supportive of the pohottuwa candidates in Kegalle. The former President accused the Yahapalanaya government of encouraging more and more people to consume liquor so that they may, in their inebriated state, forget the burdens heaped on them by the government and be oblivious to the attempts made to divide the country through a new constitution. He also blamed the government for going against the cultural norms of the country through the liberal liquor policy.
This is rich indeed coming from Rajapaksa who gave too hoots for our cultural values when he allowed night races to be held near the Dalada Maligawa disregarding the protests by the Maha Sangha. Local culture was also furthest from the mind of Mahinda Rajapaksa when he gave a red carpet welcome to Hindi matinee idol Salman Khan, who was brought down to bolster his Presidential Election campaign, while at the same time unleashing goons on a group of local artistes who were performing a roadshow in support of the Common Candidate.
The former President who is now taking a holier than thou stance on the governments liberal liquor policy also stands accused for permitting liquor outlets and Wine Stores to be opened near schools and places of religious worship, while at the same time going ahead with is his much touted mathata titha programme, which, as one wag put it, became tithata matha, at the time.
Be that as it may, extending the opening hours of liquor shops is not going to increase the number of imbibers. The habitual drinker will only make his visit to the liquor shop that much earlier if the closing time is advanced following the Presidential decree. However permitting women to purchase liquor in the open may be objectionable to most with set ideas on the role of women and the cultural place accorded to women in Sri Lankan society. Of course, there will be those who may ask what the fuss is all about, what with women now treated on par with men in the matter of employment and in all spheres of activity with two Sri Lankan women even ascending to the leadership of this country.
It is time that Sri Lanka move with the world shedding its cloak of ignorance and hypocrisy on many things that are taken for granted in the developed world. True, there has to be sensitivity to the countrys cultural mores and ingrained values in our society. However, these should not be made impediments to progress. President Sirisena who hails from the rural outback and a strict adherent to local values and customs naturally would balk at Minister Samaraweeras liberal liquor policy. He certainly would have been in an awkward position as a leader who is close to the Sangha community. Hence, his decision to stand firm in this regard is quite understandable. It would have been prudent had the minister consulted the President before taking this decision. Besides, rescinding a decision already taken by a minister would also look bad on the government as a whole and betray a lack of co-ordination. Especially so, since what we have today is a coalition government with one party holding a more liberal outlook and the other, more reticent in its approach.

At Sampath Bank, we are cognizant and appreciative of the contributions made by the countrys small and medium enterprise (SME) sector to the economy. Right from our inception, we have continued to work closely with them, serving as a trusted financial partner, confidant and advisor. Aimed at sharing knowledge and building partnerships, the Obe Diyunuwata Ape Maga Penweema seminars are part of our efforts to add value to this sector, said Shashi Kandambi Jassim, Senior Deputy General Manager, Corporate Banking, Sampath Bank PLC.
We have always sought to look beyond our own commercial interests in our interactions with all our customers and tried to understand their needs and aspirations to deliver the right financial services to them. This is true of relationship with our SME customers too. Over the years, we noticed that they have a keen interest in venturing into imports and exports. We also learned about the issues they face in this regard. While being experts in their chosen fields, they often tend to need a bit of support on some of the minor nitty-gritties related to imports and exports. We are delighted to address these areas through events like the Obe Diyunuwata Ape Maga Penweema seminars. Inspired by the response to the first wave of seminars, we look forward to engaging SMEs around the island through more such events, said Ayodhya Iddawela Perera, Deputy General Manager, Corporate Banking, Sampath Bank PLC.
The seminar in Galle is part of a series of knowledge sharing sessions being conducted by the Bank around the main regions of the island.

Shackled children found in Perris, California home

Two parents have been arrested in California after police found 13 people allegedly being held captive at their home, including some "shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks".
David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, were held on charges of torture and child endangerment. The 13 people - aged between two and 29 - were found in a house in Perris, 59 miles (95km) south-east of Los Angeles, police say.
They are all believed to be siblings.
Officers were alerted by one of the victims, who on Sunday managed to escape and call the emergency number "from a cellular device she found inside the house", the Riverside Sheriff's Department said in a statement.
The girl - who police said appeared to be "only 10 years old and slightly emaciated" - claimed that 12 of her siblings were being held captive by their parents.
Police officers later found "several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings".
But the parents were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner, the police said.
The officers were "shocked" to discover that seven of those held in the house were actually adults aged between 18 and 29.
"The victims appeared to be malnourished and very dirty," the police said.
All the victims are now being treated in local hospitals.

SLIIT students showcase innovative talents at INSYS
Five innovative teams of students at SLIIT participated at INSYS 2017  a one day symposium that gave them the opportunity to showcase their skills and clinched Merit Awards at the event.
INSYS 2017 brought together academics and researchers from local and overseas universities as well as local industrial experts to a common forum to publicize their latest research findings and exchange views and ideas under the theme of innovations for sustainable future. The symposium was organized by the Office of Research and Innovation Services (ORIS), Sri Lanka Technological Campus (SLTC), Padukka.
Among the topics discussed was the readiness of Sri Lankan industry in adapting these technologies. 
Two technical sessions at the symposium focused on Communication Engineering, Dynamics Systems, Modelling and Controls and Robotics. A workshop was held on emerging Technologies in Mobile Communications for local engineers with an exhibition of innovative product de velopment by schoolstudents and engineering undergraduates at which the SLIIT students scored with their innovations.
A team from SLIIT submitted a design for an automatic pet feeder to provide both food and water to pets even when the pet owner is not available at home to do it. This pet feeder is an IOT device controlled by an app which the owner can use to dictate the time and amount of meals that their pets will consume.The participating students were Nisal Sugathapala, Deelaka Pitagampolage, Piyumal Heiyanthuduwa, Tharindu De Alwis and Kavin Wanigaratne.

Spears sparks rumours shes engaged to Asghari
Britney Spears has sparked rumours shes engaged to boyfriend Sam Asghari, by wearing a diamond ring on her left hand.
The Baby, One More Time singer showed off her new accessory as she hit the beach in Hawaii on January 10. While Britney displayed her enviable figure in a yellow string bikini, all eyes were on the jewel on her ring finger. The diamond appeared to be a new addition to the stars collection, and comes just a couple of months after she and fitness model Sam celebrated their one-year anniversary in November.
If Britney did wed Sam, it wouldnt be the first time shes been married. Shes previously walked down the aisle twice before - once with friend Jason Alexander in Las Vegas before their union was annulled after just 55 hours, and once with Kevin Federline, to whom she was married for three years from 2004 and had two children.
She was also engaged to boyfriend Jason Trawick, from December 2011 until January 2013.
And despite her previous relationships not lasting, Britney revealed in a previous interview that the break-ups have done nothing to stop her being a hopeless romantic.
Unfortunately, I am (a hopeless romantic). Ive been through horrible relationships, but unfortunately I still believe in love, she said. And you know, I think you should protect your heart and stuff like that. But yeah, Im a hopeless romantic and I believe in love.
Britney, 36, and Sam, 23, were first romantically linked over a year ago after meeting on the set of Britneys Slumber Party music video, on which Sam played her onscreen love. Britney made the first move, asking Sam out nearly five months after they first met.

Tamim guides Bangladesh to easy win over Zimbabwe
Dhaka: Opener Tamim Iqbal struck an unbeaten half-century to guide Bangladesh to an eight-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the opening match of a tri-nation one-day international tournament in Dhaka on Monday.
Tamim scored 84 off 93 balls at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium as Bangladesh cruised to 171-2 in just 28.3 overs.
The hosts earlier dispatched Zimbabwe for 170 in 49 overs as left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan claimed 3-43.
Sikandar Raza top-scored for the visitors with 52 as well as taking 2-53.
Bangladesh never looked in trouble, with Shakib striking twice in the first over after skipper Mashrafe Mortaza won the toss and opted to bowl.
Mashrafe and Mustafizur Rahman quickly reduced Zimbabwe to 51 for four, before Raza provided some brief resistance with his dogged 99-ball innings. Peter Moor supported Raza with 33 before Rubel Hossain (2-24) took two wickets off successive balls, fast-tracking Zimbabwes collapse and becoming Bangladeshs fifth bowler to claim 100 ODI wickets.
Mustafizur, who claimed 2-29, produced an off-cutter to uproot Blessing Muzarabanis off-stump and end Zimbabwes innings.
Tamim, who hit eight fours and a six, lost his opening partner Anamul Haque early on for 19 but added 78 with Shakib (37) for the second wicket to set up the innings for Bangladesh.
Shakib -- who won the man of the match award -- said the win stood the hosts in good stead ahead of their match against Sri Lanka, the other team in the tri-nation series.
Keeping up momentum is very important. This win should give us some confidence before facing Sri Lanka, who I think will offer us a tough challenge, he said.
Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer blamed poor batting for their defeat.
It was not one of those wickets where you could score easily. We had a lot of soft dismissals in our batting line-up, he said.
Zimbabwe play Sri Lanka in their next match of the tournament at the same ground on Wednesday.

President Maithripala Sirisena said it is amusing to see members who say they have not obtained membership of the new party in media discussions, asking the public to vote for another party and not the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
He requested the public to engage in politics according to their conscience.
The President made these remarks addressing a political meeting held in support of SLFP candidates contesting the upcoming Local Government elections at Homagama, on Sunday afternoon.
President Sirisena said the secretary and the president of the newly-established party are former SLFP ministers, as well as ones who held key positions in the former government.
He added that those who claim that they cannot operate without the photographs of the late Prime Ministers (Bandaranaikes), are the ones who advise to change the policies of the Central Committee of the SLFP which was introduced by the Bandaranaikes.
He said he would take further steps to reveal to the country those responsible and punish them for past frauds and corruptions.
Minister Susil Peajayantha, State Minister A. H. M. Fauzie, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya, SLFP Homagma Provincial Councilors Gamini Thilakasiri and Weerakumara Dissanayake, and former Kotte Mayor Janaka Ranwaka, were among the gathering.

Turkish jet nearly falls into Black Sea
TURKEY: A passenger jet carrying 162 people came within metres of plunging into the sea after it skidded off a icy runway as it landed at a Turkish airport.
Panic spread through the Boeing 737-800 as it stopped at the edge of the Black Sea - with its nose dangling precariously off of a cliff edge.
Luckily, flight PC8622s wheels became stuck in icy mud as it left the runway at Trabzon Airport, which may have preventing it from entering the sea.
Shocking footage from inside the Pegasus plane taken just moments after the crash shows passengers evacuating as women and children are heard crying out in fear.
The aircrafts left jet engine was also ripped from its wing during the crash.
Bodies fill the central aisle of the aircraft and stewards can are heard addressing passengers over a loud speaker system.
The dramatic footage appears to show smoke billowing from the cabin. Another clip taken from outside the aircraft shows fire services dousing the plane with jets of water. However, from the video there is no suggestion of there having been a fire. More footage shows passengers gathering under the wing of the plane on the steep slope down to the water.
The flight departed from Ankara, Turkeys capital, on Saturday evening.
But on landing at Trabzon Airport, just under 90 minutes later, the plane left the runway.
Pegasus Airlines is a Turkish budget airline based in the Kurtky area of Pendik, Istanbul.
Trabzon Airport shut and flights were delayed and cancelled as passengers from the flight were evacuated.
Trabzon governor Yucel Yavuz confirmed that all of the passengers and crew on board escaped uninjured, saying: Weve taken all necessary measures. We will reopen the airport to air traffic as soon as possible.
He added that a crisis desk had been set up at the airport. Flights have now resumed in and out of Trabzon. - NDTV

Two Koreas in fresh talks on Winter Olympics
Seoul, Monday: North and South Korea began talks Monday on appearances by performers from Pyongyang's state-run artistic troupes at next month's Winter Olympics in the South, after the North agreed to attend the Games.
Pyongyang agreed last week to send athletes, high-level officials, and others to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, easing months of high tensions over its weapons programmes.
The two sides agreed an art troupe would be part of the delegation, and eight officials -- four from each country -- started a working-level meeting to thrash out the details on the northern side of the Military Demarcation Line at the border truce village of Panmunjom soon after 10 am (0100 GMT), Seoul's unification ministry said.
The North's delegates include Kwon Hyok-Bong, a senior culture ministry official, as well as Hyon Song-Wol, the leader of the North's famed all-female Moranbong music band.
The 10-strong band, established in 2012 with members supposedly chosen by leader Kim Jong-Un, is known for its Western-style, synthesiser-driven music and sophisticated fashion style rare in the isolated nation, although most of their songs laud the regime. Their numbers include the jaunty "Mother's Birthday", about the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, and the more soulful "We Call Him Father", an ode to leader Kim Jong-Un.
Such lyrics could fall foul of the South's National Security Act, which bans praise for the North. The band once cancelled a planned performance in Beijing in 2015 and returned home after Chinese officials took issue with propaganda images on the stage featuring Pyongyang's long-range missiles.
The South's delegates include senior officials from the state-run Korean Symphony Orchestra, raising the prospect of groups from both sides of the DMZ performing together -- another top North Korean act is the State Merited Chorus, a military choir.
The two Koreas are also set to hold talks with the International Olympics Committee (IOC) in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday over how the North's athletes will participate in the Games.
South Korea has proposed a joint march for the opening ceremony and a unified women's ice hockey team, reports quoted a minister as saying last week.
The South Korean government and Olympic organisers have been keen for Pyongyang -- which boycotted the 1988 Summer Games in the Seoul -- to take part in what they have been promoting as a "peace Olympics".
The North remained silent on the offer until Kim abruptly announced an intention to take part in his New Year speech, in a move seen as aimed at easing military tensions with the US.
Tension has been high on the flashpoint peninsula as the North staged a flurry of nuclear and missile tests since last year and Kim traded threats of war and personal attacks with US President Donald Trump.
Kim's declaration triggered an apparent rapprochement and a rapid series of moves, while Seoul touted last week's talks -- the first inter-Korea meeting in two years -- as a potential first step to bring the North into negotiations over nuclear arsenal.
South Korean President Moon Jae-In, who advocates dialogue with the North but remains critical of Pyongyang's weapons drive, said last week he was willing to have a summit with Kim "under the right conditions", but added that "certain outcomes must be guaranteed".
In a setback for such hopes, Pyongyang on Sunday slammed Moon as "ignorant and unreasonable" for demanding pre-conditions -- possibly a step towards denuclearisation -- for a summit.
"The south Korean chief executive should not be dreaming," the state-run KCNA news agency said in an editorial, accusing Moon of "brownnosing" the United States.
"The south Korean authorities have an axe to grind, hoping to eat corn without teeth," it added.
It represented a return to the North's more usual tone -- in the run-up to the talks KCNA had uncharacteristically and respectfully referred to Moon by name and his title of "President".
KCNA added that the North could still change its mind about taking part in the Olympics. "They should know that train and bus carrying our delegation to the Olympics are still in Pyongyang," it said.
A spokesman for Seoul's unification ministry played down the editorial, attributing it to "internal reasons and circumstances".
"We believe that it is important to seek improvement in ties based on mutual respect and understanding," Baik Tae-Hyun told reporters. AFP

## Title: The ultimate tour

The ultimate tour
Most people play sport for the fun of it. Some do it to get fit, others for fame and fortune. A few use it as an outlet for frustration. But without doubt, the greatest reason for playing sport is the tour, stated Merv Hughes in his book Merv and other funny stories.
Sport has little to do with reality at the best of times. An Australian cricket tour of England is so far removed from everyday life it can at times be difficult to come to terms with. The Ashes tour of 1989 was perhaps the ultimate tour noted Hughes.
For four months, they travelled around England in a luxury bus, stayed in the best hotels, played cricket and got paid for it! On their return they enjoyed an honorary dinner, ticker tape parade, a champagne breakfast and motorcade around MCG on grand final day. All the stuff of movie stars and famous rock groups, hardly the sort of attention given to a cricket team. Particularly a team that was described as the worst ever to leave the shores of Australia added, Hughes.
He doubted that any of the players on that tour ever dreamt of achieving the success they found in England. Their record seems an incredible achievement to him even now.
They won four of the six Test matches and may have won the other two if not for the weather. In the one day series they won one, lost one and tied the other. Of the fourteen first class matches played they had eight victories, five draws, and only one loss- a remarkable result considering that some of these fourteen games were played by men suffering from crippling hangovers. Hughes reminisces that many people felt that he was lucky to be selected in the tour party since in the three Test matches before the side was announced he only captured one wicket. He remembered being terribly nervous on the day the team was to be aznounced.
At the time Hughes was playing in a promotional cricket game at Sale, in Eastern Victoria, as part of the promotion they visited the local hospital to say hello to the patients. Television film crews and journalists from the press were with them as the team was due to be announced some time that morning. This only served to make him feel worse, as his response-whatever it was going to be  would be shown all over Australia.
The news eventually came and he thought that he was in the team and that he managed to give a calm and understated expression of his feelings.
He of course felt very excited and wanted to turn cartwheels and punch holes in the roof. Dean Jones was also with them and while he was being interviewed Hughes slipped into a side room to be alone for a moment. As he closed the door behind him he could not help but yell out at the top of his voice, You f---- beauty!
And there was a gasp from behind him and he turned around to find two ladies sitting bolt upright in their hospital beds. They both appeared concerned and one asked, Are you alright young man Hughes replied that he was being picked for the Ashes.
A look of horror passed across their faces, and the other lady said, Oh! You poor boy! He didnt stop to explain any further, said Hughes.
BEWARE OF THE PRESS
Before Hughes left for England his managers, David Emerson (Emo) and Peter Thomson organised a meeting with him to discuss the dangers of the British press. They were concerned that he didnt realise how nasty the British tabloids could get.
Emo brought along some paper cuttings from the scandal that led to the sacking of Mike Gatting from the English captaincy recalled Hughes and went on to state that the articles responsible for the controversy would almost be funny if they hadnt ultimately been so harmful.
Gatting made love to me- waitress tells of romps read the headline that caused the controversy. Alongside it were two photographs: one of the young woman in question, entitled Louise also known as kipper knickers and another of Gatting captioned Gatting Rough. The rough Hughes was led to believe by the story, had something to do with Gattings sexual technique, and as to Louises nickname, he wouldnt hazard a guess (readers who are familiar with the smell of kippers need not guess any further). Hughes chugged along and stated that there were some journalists in the more traditional papers who saw these circumstances in their proper light. The Sunday Express asked, could the awful day be coming when the only safe person for a public figure to sleep with is his own wife One writer in The Sunday Times suggested that all players (and press) be castrated to prevent further strife.
The Guardian was worried at the sensitivity of the selectors and wondered if players like Cox, Alcock, Hardstaff and Inchmore would be allowed to continue playing. Hughes indicated that cricketers did stay up late at night, drank beer and talked to women. Some of them more than the others but it were no ones business but their own. By sacking Mike Gatting the English selectors assumed the same moral stance as the gutter press - they place a greater emphasis on sex than on cricket. Their archaic attitude has only encouraged the tabloid papers to hunt for more victims.
Hughes recalled that he informed his managers that they had nothing to worry about. His track record with women or tragic lack of one, suggested that there was no danger of any involvement in a sex scandal (worse luck), drinking wasnt an issue as he had sworn off the beer until after the Test Matches. Before he left on tour, he had to promise to be on his best behaviour. No drinking, no talking to women, no late nights and no junk foods concluded Merv the perve as they address him in Australia.
Merv Hughes is a good example for our young guns.

Well Governed societies
The call for good governance is as old as the call for poverty alleviation! We have not been spared either. Debates about palanaya abound.
How does the rest of the world deal with it To quantify the effectiveness of these policies, indexes like the World Justice Projects Rule of Law Index, the World Banks Governance Index and the Social Progress Index survey residents, compile publicly available statistics and rank countries based on their performance across different categories.
While each index varies in their precise ranking, certain patterns emerge across all three, with the same countries consistently at the top for their progressive social policies, trust in government and effective justice system.
Denmark
While all the Nordic countries rank consistently high across every index, with near-perfect scores on the Basic Human Needs ranking in the 2017 Social Progress Index, which includes meeting the nutritional and medical needs of its citizens and giving access to basic knowledge and communication.
These benefits are offered to more than just native-born residents. Anne Steinbach, editor-in-chief of Travellers Archive who recently lived in Aarhus, Denmarks second-largest city, for six months says, When Danes are ill and they cannot go to university or to work, its fine to simply call and let the employer know. In Germany, however, employees and students need to get an official certificate from the doctor. Both countries are structured when it comes to policy and governance, but Germans like everything to be on paper, in order and certified, whereas Danes treat each other more like friends in almost every situation.
While life in Denmark can be expensive compared to other European countries, with the highest collective taxes in the EU to pay for these services, the benefits outweigh the costs, says Steinbach, and residents are friendly and welcoming to boot.
Danes are all about hygge, she said, describing a word that roughly translates to a cosiness shared among friends. Having a movie night or a dinner night and inviting Danish friends over is a perfect way of blending into the Danish culture. Danes love to talk, to mingle and to simply sit together, enjoy the candlelight, good food and interesting talks.
New Zealand
Australia and New Zealand are virtually neck-and-neck across the indexes, but New Zealand scores slightly better for overall political stability, fundamental rights and lack of violence/terrorism.
Zoe Helene, founder of Cosmic Sister, who lived in New Zealand for 10 years and frequently visits her parents who are permanent residents says. You know the saying you can judge a civilization by how they care for their elders When a New Zealand citizen becomes a senior at 65 they automatically start receiving a generous government allowance, no matter who they are, no matter how much money they earned or inherited, and no matter when they arrived in the country, Helene said.
Canada
Both the United States and Canada rank highly across all indexes, but Canada scores higher in political stability and lack of violence/terrorism. In fact, Canada comes close to many of the Scandinavian countries in its near-perfect scores, including access to nutrition and medical care, as well as to basic knowledge and personal rights.
Canada is more progressive in its values than our neighbour to the south. For instance, it would be quite rare for attitudes against a womans right to choose, or removing rights from LBGTQ persons, to become serious topics of debate, said Alia Bickson, a guide who lives in Toronto and has dual US and Canadian citizenship. Of course, individuals have varying views, but the country as a whole supports policies in line with compassion and acceptance of varying life choices.
Japan
Not only does the nation rank highest in Asia by the World Bank for overall government effectiveness, rule of law and political stability, it also received the highest marks in Asia from the Social Progress Index for its access to basic knowledge, water and sanitation, and access to nutrition and medical care.
Health insurance is universal, though it can be expensive since its income-based and taken out of wages  but residents can go to any doctor anytime and costs are capped. Japan also has some of the worlds best cancer doctors.
The education system is another of the countrys strengths; elementary and secondary school is mandatory, and Japanese schools rank well globally. Though the schools are highly regimented and systematic  which can lead to over-standardisation, they have prioritised nutrition as a key part of education, with school lunches prepared with locally grown ingredients and paired with lessons on healthy eating and food history.
Botswana
Botswana consistently ranks as one of the strongest-governed countries in Africa, especially in its role in containing corruption, regionally ranking the highest in both the World Bank assessment and Rule of Law Index. After a string of scandals in the early 90s, the government created the Directorate of Corruption and Economic Crime (DCEC) in 1994, which continues to investigate and prosecute officials accused of corruption. Not only that, but the national revenue from diamond mining has been fairly well distributed throughout the county.
The entire country was founded on national unity and that is still the case to date, said SehenyiTlotlego, Botswana native and philanthropy coordinator for safari company Sanctuary Retreats. We are a nation that believes and practices Ntwakgolokeyamolomo, which means Disputes are resolved effectively by debating them to a conclusion, and not by going to war.
The country is known for having strong personal freedoms, scoring high in both freedom of the press and personal property rights. That freedom extends to everyday interactions. Batswana are easy-going people, that believe in open talk and do not take kindly any hidden agendas. It is advisable to be open and discuss issues in the interest of resolving them, said Tlotlego. We are also a very liberal society where colour, religion and gender doesnt matter, and we will tackle, head-on, any form of injustice.
That has also led to strong social foundations that give citizens the opportunities they need to learn and stay healthy. Every village with 500 or more people qualifies for a medical clinic and primary school, said Tlotlego. The country also was early in recognising the HIV/AIDS pandemic and created a rigorous testing and counselling programme, with free antiretroviral treatment to every citizen testing positive.
Conservation has also been a strength of Botswanas government, which has led to tourism driving 12% of overall GDP. Most of the funds accrued from the tourism industry is ploughed back into the protection of protected areas, wildlife management areas outside protected areas and the ever-growing anti-poaching unit, said Tlotlego. Botswana has set up and supported one of the strongest anti-poaching units in Africa.
Ranked highly for its open and transparent government, control of corruption and access to basic knowledge and medical care, Chile has one of South Americas most stable and corruption-free governments.
Whereas you might be expected to pay a bribe to police or politicians in other South American countries, that doesnt happen in Chile, said Peter Murphy Lewis, owner of tour company Chile Guru and long-time Chile resident.
Health insurance is affordable and effective, but where the country really shines is its infrastructure. Santiago, and Chile in general has high-quality infrastructure which makes living there a relative breeze with none of the headaches one might associate with developing countries, Newton said, referring to the countrys high-quality highway system and near-universal access to water and electricity. Santiago also has one of the worlds largest urban parks in the world, the 1780-acre Metropolitan Park, and numerous bike paths that even Paul McCartney has traversed.
While Chile is extremely open and friendly to foreigners, rigid social classes can make it hard to break into the countrys inner social circles, according to Lewis. He recommends that all newcomers join a local Facebook community group, so they can quickly make new friends and find referrals for English-speaking doctors and other services.

Why the heck
The season for giving is over for most of us. But the wives are still out shopping for belated festive gifts. With purchases little and large, they do not believe in Santa Claus. But they do believe in Master Charge! Or rather with a slight amendment to Caesar's brief victory speech they say, 'VENI, VEDI, VISA'! I came, I saw, I credited. Did a little shopping actually!
During the season fathers, granddads, husbands and consorts everywhere received all kinds of gifts. Neckties being one of the top choices. Ties for the legal, medical, bureaucratic and business fraternities are practical and for most men a necessity. But I am no corporate slave. Besides, I do have hang-ups about being hanged with a tie. I prefer to have my collar loose instead of being choked with a neck noose.
But I have been gifted with such an abundance of them that I detest ties or anyone who has any ties with ties. I have amassed so many of them over the years that you can call me a tie-coon of sorts. I have such an array to choose from. These include solid ties, striped ties, neckties, bow ties, ties, ties and more ties.
Still, I would like to formally thank all my friends and relatives for adding to my mammoth tie collection. Its final. Youve done it. Now if you were to measure the assortment all tied together, my wardrobes would contain 158 feet of silk and polyester self-throttling devices.
Yes, I am at the end of my tether with all these boring formal accoutrements. So much so, in fact, that they make me feel suicidal. Its only natural with so many frayed knots and a surfeit of tidy ropes waiting to be strung around my neck. Which brings me to the pertinent question: Which you dont have to be tongue-tied about answering.
Why do we have a fixation over an old colonial sartorial legacy that makes no sense for dressing in comfort in our tropical climate It would certainly be a sagacious accessory for cooler climes or for a more formal occasion such as a wedding or black tie dinners held in air-conditioned surroundings. If some men imagine they can run the world, why cant they stop wearing neckties in humid climatic conditions such as ours
Whoever swore allegiance to the necktie in a country where average summer temperatures are 38 Celsius plus deserves to choke. Of course, necktie aficionados who are legion will essay a strangled cry. The tie, they will protest, is as much part of western attire as pants and shirts, and haven't the latter been absorbed into the Sri Lankan wardrobe Yes, but then we are all addicted to pants these days and feel vulnerable without them in public places.
How intelligent is it to start the day by tying a noose around your neck and then allowing a woman to tighten it Talk of the Lady High Executioners. The official local Hangman appears to be hanging around cooling his heels. That is because we have ceased to be a swinging society as far as criminal elements are concerned.
Necktie parties have been banned although capital punishment is legal in Sri Lanka. However, since June 23, 1976, there have been no executions, although death sentences were handed down continuously by the High and Supreme Courts for murder and drug trafficking convictions. But we do still perceive hang-women hanging out who dont give a hang about the rest of the male chauvinistic world go hang itself.
But you must give them credit for being better at looping the loop or noosing the male moose. It's all coming unravelled. The dames want to tie the knot and the chappies dont want to get tied down.
There is an obvious catch to it. A woman giving a man a tie hopes shell eventually be able to tie him up in nuptial knots. But even then he is almost certain to receive the tie she thinks he should be wearing. So it seems as if its curtains for all sensible dressers with the drapery running down their shirtfronts. I for one think its time to loosen the colonial ties or discard them altogether. Besides, neckties strangle clear thinking.
I must concede I was required to wear a tie often in my long career as a journalist and impresario. But I could not quite get the hang of tying it. You ask me whether I could manage the perfect loop I'm afraid knot. But I am no quitter and if at first I don't succeed, I tie and tie again.
Then at the most inopportune moment the blasted phone decides to ring. I grab it with one hand while trying to loop the tie knot with the other. And I yell into the phone: Sorry, youll have to ring later. Im tied up at the moment. What I have trouble with is the end of the tie that hangs from the knot - the part in front that gets gradually wider.
There seems to be some trick to getting the tie, after pulling it through whatever knot you've fashioned, so that the part directly below the knot has a symmetrical little dimple in the centre where the knot cinches it. I've even seen these beautifully sculpted visions that had two or even three dimples, again symmetrically placed. Breath-taking!
My own efforts, however, always produce a misplaced, off-to-one-side dimple, so that the tie won't stay centred. As the day progresses the back part starts to peek around the corner as the front part shifts to one side. I complain its lop-sided and the family members say: No leave it as it is. It matches your grin!
The Government announced recently there was no basis to cheeky rumours that the authorities were planning to set up nudist beaches for tourists in Sri Lanka. The statement that the country would continue with prude beaches instead of nude beaches set many minds at ease. Mine in particular, considering the fact that many companies allow their employees to dress-down casually on Fridays.
Before the rumours were scotched, I was stripping my thoughts to a bare minimum how a nudist resort would react to the sartorial requirement of what nudists should wear on casual Fridays A wag suggested that in friendlier naturist resorts in the region they might consider offering dress-up days instead. And the dress code A solo tie to hang as a hallmark of male sartorial ethics. And to bottom it off no pants to resort to the code of free movement! [emailprotected]
