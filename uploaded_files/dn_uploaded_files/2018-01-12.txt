President laid the foundation for political, economic liberation
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa came down to the level of a parliamentarian, and now, he is at a Pradeshiya Sabha level. That was the result of a self-destructive act; defacing ones own political image, said Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He further said, No matter what attempts the former President makes to regain power, he is legally barred from becoming the President again; he does not bear any chance of becoming the Prime Minister either. As such, all political transactions made hoping for a bright and promising future with the former President, are futile and not practically possible.
He said so addressing a Local Government election meeting held at Medawachchiya.
The SLFP general secretary further said President Maithripala Sirisena has successfully laid the foundation for the country to move forward in order to achieve political and economic emancipation sans corruptions, wasting of public funds, cheating, and misappropriation, which hindered the countrys development progress.
His dedication to this was reflected in the act of appointing a Presidential Commission to inquire into the controversial Central Banks bonds issue, Dissanayake added.
Being a national government, we have started work to develop the country in conformity of the wishes of the people. The main objective of the good governance government, based on an integrated module, is to empower people-friendly reforms that a single party government has so far, failed to achieve in political history. Some politicians and their followers dont understand this positive and practical theory; they pretend in order to get their own political agendas fulfilled and to gain power, he said.
During previous eras, major political party rivals used to make all efforts to topple the government by opposing its policies to gain power; hoodwinking, misguiding, and agitating the masses. Today, we have passed this parasitical barricade and are heading towards our goals, he added.
He said because he was holding a strong portfolio in the government, he was in a position to support his voters without asking them to wait until an SLFP government come into power. This new political, people-friendly, and progressive trend ensured peace, co-existence, understanding among communities, sympathy and respect towards us, internationally.
When Mahinda Rajapaksha was in power, he encouraged amateur divisional-level politicians by saying that they had the opportunity to hold the presidency of the party, if determined, but he blocked the path of a rising politician from entering into Parliament by contesting the last General Elections in the Kurunegala district, he said.
Is it reasonable or justifiable Where is the so-called second row of SLFP politicians being promoted as Mahinda Rajapaksa once uttered Now the candidates of G. L. Peiriss new political party campaigning for the elections, exhibit Mahinda Rajapasas image at the forefront while canvasing for votes. I appeal to voters to think: would Mahinda Rajapaska pass funds to renovate rural roads or to construct culverts in villages, being in the present position he is in Intelligent voters should condemn and reject hypocratic politicians and should not fall prey to baseless and vituperative political slogans, Minister Dissanayake said.
You could question from your own conscience, whether or not President Sirisena and his government have saved our country from political disaster, international wrath, nepotism, economic destruction, terror and violence, after he gained power three years back. Hence, reject all evil forces at the forthcoming election and find the most suitable candidate among the cluster of them to hold the responsibility of your village, the minister added.A range of religious rituals were observed recently before the historic Katu Seya chaitiya in Mihintale, for evoking blessings of the deities and the triple gems for whole country, President, and the government. At the ceremony, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake offered a symbolic gold hoe to the Katu Seya.

Enterprise Sri Lanka launch in March
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme, one of the main proposals made in the budget to create entrepreneurs would be launched in March.
He further said that those who obtain credit facilities would be given interest subsidy upto 75% of the effective interest rate.
The government expects to disburse Rs 60,000 million through state and private banks to would be entrepreneurs and another Rs 5000 million has been set aside by the Treasury to reimburse the interest subsidy to the banks.
Under this scheme 15 different loan schemes have been proposed for young entrepreneurs in the fields of Agro, fishery industries and for small and medium enterprises.
This scheme includes journalists and those who are self employed as well.
In addition to young entrepreneurs, women and differently abled persons will also be provided special opportunity to take part in this programme. Women and differently abled persons who come forward to take part in this programme will be offered additional interests subsidy of 10% and 15% more respectively. The women will have to form a company at least with ten equity share holders and each share holder will have invested at least Rs 10,000. The government will extent a comprehensive support package which includes both non-financial and financial assistance including grants and the credit through the enterprise Sri Lanka credit schemes to these companies.
Minister Samaraweera held a discussion yesterday with the Heads and the Chief Executives Officers of the State and Private Banks at the Treasury.
State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne and senior ministry officials also participated at this discussion.
Minister Samaraweera called upon all the banks to extend their fullest support to implement this programme in order to create jobs through the expansion of economy while aiming to expand exports.
The government expects the SME sector to be the backbone of the economy. However, the lack of capital or the difficulty in accessing capital due to both the cost of capital and the requirement for collateral have been the main impediments in the development of start ups of the SMEs, the Minister said.
However the minister stated that our objective is to ensure that no entrepreneur is ever denied credit due to the lack of collateral, but is able to access financing given viability of the project proposals.
The President, Prime Minister and the private banks assured the minister of their continuous support to this project to realize the governments objectives of creating one million new jobs, increase the per capita income and the expansion of exports through enterprise Sri Lanka programme.
When entering the field to expand the small and medium scale business sector including self employment, the Minister informed the bank officers that the Government will not allow the banks to repay the loans, because of the impossibility of bailing to obtain the capital costs and loans.
As the Treasury has decided to handover the bails which are expected by the banks from businessman, hereafter by considering only the feasibility of the project proposal the Government has decided to issue a Treasury bail for the debtors to give loans on concessional interest basis.
With the aim of obtaining female participation in the field of business and industry, the women who join the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme will be given an interest relief of 10% in addition to 75% interest relief when granting a loan and 15% extra (surplus) interest relief for the specially skilled individuals with a Treasury bail will be provided by the Government as decided.
The Government will provide non financial technical facilities for the companies which women have a greater entitlement, including at least 10 participants that start up with a minimum capital of Rs. 10,000 from each share holder.
The Government will hold 75% of the leasing cost of the machineries get under the leasing method by such companies and the the Treasury will issue the required bail for the relevant banks.
With the objective to create one million new jobs and to encourage the export by increasing per capita income, the Chief Executives of all the State and Private Banks had promised Minister Samaraweera of their fullest support to the Government Enterprise Sri Lanka programme.

MP Mujibur Rahman said the UNP would make Colombo great again as it was in Premadasas era by winning the upcoming local government elections.
The UNP always won the CMC, but under the previous governments, CMC did not develop. The power of the local authority was with the UNP, but no effective measures were taken as the Centre had high hand in every matter, he said.
<U+200B>He said that after R. Premadasa, housing <U+200B>schemes were not implemented and Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the Defence Secretary took over the lands of the people.
Rahman said Colombo children hardly get a chance to enter popular schools and a majority comes out of Colombo. He said he was taking initiatives to change the system.

Even though, UNP gained victory in Colombo, the party could not make smart moves to make Colombo a great city as the central government stood as a barrier to it. Therefore, a real change can be seen only when the UNP is in power, he said.
He said the present government has given a long term solution to the garbage issue and it will be further strengthened after the upcoming elections.Prime Minister requested the public to refrain from electing drug addicts or such persons to local government authorities.
I have instructed stakeholders to work with the Youth Parliament to eradicate drugs. I request all the candidates to do their best to make Colombo a drug-free city as it is a one of the major problems, he said.
He emphasized that whilst developing the country, Colombo City also has to be developed, as it is the financial hub of the country.
He said Colombo is the stronghold of the UNP. Therefore, the party is bound to serve the people living in Colombo and improve their standard of living.
The present government has to pay the debts for all the projects started by the former government under the name of Beautification of Colombo, he said.

Cyclone Joyce: Australian residents warned to take shelter
Communities in Australia's north-west are bracing for a tropical cyclone, the second to hit the region in two weeks.
Cyclone Joyce, currently a category one system, is due to make landfall near Broome in Western Australia on Friday.
Authorities have told local residents to secure their homes and take shelter. The cyclone is tracking south and is predicted to bring winds of up to 100km/h (62mph), according to the Bureau of Meteorology.
Higher tides, heavy rainfall and flash flooding are also expected over the coastal region, about 2,000km north of the state's capital, Perth. Forecasters had predicted the cyclone could strengthen into a category three, but on Friday they said that was now unlikely.
The weather event has forced the cancellation of flights and the closure of major roads, local media reported. Cyclone Hilda, also a category one, swept through the same region on 27 December, bringing down trees and power lines. Australia regularly experiences cyclones during summer.
Last year a powerful system battered Queensland, causing significant damage and deaths in resulting floods.

Ganemulla Flyover opens: Feb. 10 will prove on which party peoples' mandate would lie on:Kiriella
The country would see which party the mandate of the people lies on, after February 10, since this unity government has developed the country in a manner that all provinces receive their dividends, said Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday.
He made these observations following the opening of the Ganemulla Flyover which stretches across 504 metres comprising of two lanes which would end the three hour delay of vehicles altogether in a day at the Ganemulla Level Crossing.
He further said that the present unity government had implemented many projects to develop transportation out of which, Rajagiriya and Ganemulla Flyovers have been vested to the people. He added that the Polgahawela Flyover is to be opened soon. He also added that the government had already initiated the project of construction of the Kandy - Colombo Express way.
Minister Kiriella said that the government would keep on developing the road network as it was the key for the development of a country. He also said the government would develop the Northern and Eastern provinces in par with the development in the South of the country, as the area was affected by the three decade conflict.
Minister Kiriella said that after the good governance government was established, the members of Gampaha district led by MP Ajith Mannapperuma met him and requested for a flyover for Ganemulla, which had been neglected for a number of years. He added although there were many such requests, the Ganemulla Flyover was given priority along with the other two flyovers at Rajagiriya and Polgahawela.
The Minister also said that the Expressway from Kadawatha to Meerigama of the Colombo - Kandy expressway would be constructed by a Chinese Company, then to Kurunegala by local contractors later to Galagedara by the Japanese company. "This Expressway would be completed by 2020 before the General Election," Minister Kiriella said. "The Indian Government supports us immensely to develop the Northern and Eastern province in par with the South of the country."
He added these roads were developed since many factories would be set up in Hambantota within the next three years. A number of factories would be set up in Trincomalee with Japanese and Indian funds. He added that a free trade zone would be set up in Galagedara area in Kandy. "If we need to set up factories, we have to develop the road net work," Minister Kiriella said. "If not, factories would not be developed."
The foundation stone for the project was laid on April 19, 2016 by Minister Kiriella. The Flyover was built at a cost of Rs 1,768.21 million funded by the Government of Spain.
Around 87 trains travel through Ganemulla to and from, necessitating the closure of the rail gates, as frequently as 90 times per day which causes severe traffic congestion on either the sides of the level crossing.
Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena, Pandu Bandaranayake, UNP MP Ajith Mannapperuma participated at the event.

Life in a condominium
A large number of eminent resource persons made their presentations with regard to various aspects of condominium living and the manner of usage of common elements and common amenities.
The awareness programme was mainly dedicated to State officers involved in assisting the Condominium Management Authority and the management corporations in charge of condominium maintenance.
Local Government agency, Land Ministry, Police Department, Divisional Secretariats, and Provincial Councils officers participated.
At the end of the session, Condominium Management Authority Chairman C. A. Wijeyeweere was interviewed.
He said that this Awareness programme organized by the Condominium Management Authority, was to make the relevant stakeholders aware of the condominium style of living, without causing any hindrance to neighbouring apartment owners.
When Wijeyeweere was requested to make the general public aware as to what a condominium property is, he said that a condominium parcel/unit is a defined space; they are independent parcels in a condominium plan, designed for independent use.
In response to an inquiry as to what types of condominiums are available in Sri Lanka, he added there are three categories of condominiums, namely Residential, Commercial, and Mixed-Development.
Explaining on the common elements of condominium property, Wijeyeweere said structural components cannot be directly attributed to any single dwelling unit.
Foundation, columns, main load-bearing walls; components meant for common use, such as staircases, corridors, lifts, fire escapes, garages, community halls, playgrounds, access roads, motors, and pumps, are considered as common elements and amenities in a condominium.
These common elements need to be identified in a condominium plan. When an individual gets the ownership of a condominium parcel, they also get the right to utilize its common elements, and these are legally conferred to them.
The Chairman added that he was impressed with the interest displayed by the panel of resource persons and the participants who actively participated in the deliberations.

Paris Accord - Applying Six Sigma  Methodology to solve  climate change
During the last six months, I have written seven articles to Sri Lankan papers criticizing (i)Paris Accord for putting the onus of finding solutions for climate change onto the individual countries and (ii) UNFCCC and IPCC for spending 20 years on researching climate change without identifying a single solution which could be applied universally to solve climate change. But today I am happy that UNFCCC and IPCC have accepted their inability to do so and providing opportunities to individual countries to find their own solutions.
My objective for this article is to show how one could arrive at a solution for climate change using Six Sigma Methodology. It is strange that western corporate leaders who have gained gigantic financial benefits for their companies from Six Sigma Methodologies - I am reminded of how Jack Welch, the famous CEO of General Electric came for a Six Sigma meeting dressed like a Karate Black Belt- have not pressed that we use Six Sigma Methodology to find a solution for climate change. In fact, Jack Welch wrote in his much publicized letter to shareholders in February 1999 that Six Sigma will be the biggest, the most personally rewarding and in the end, the most profitable undertaking in our history.We have invested more than a billion dollars in the effort and the financial returns have now entered the exponential phase
Unlike other more common quality management initiatives, Six Sigma has been developed into a complete array of new techniques leading up to and not limited to Six Sigma DMADV2 (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design,Verify and Validate) Methodology with astounding results for the companies using these. Though neither green belts nor black belts, we have been providing SixSigma consultancy services and one of our recent assignments was to carry out a Measurement System Analysis (also called Gauge R & R Analysis) for de La Rue Security Printers - local outfit of the international currency notes printer at the Biyagama Zone- completing the assignment for 23 instruments in exactly 40 working days as per the project schedule. They had been struggling to find a local consultant to do this for quite some time
Application of six sigma methodology
Now I wish to show how we applied Six Sigma Methodology known as DMADV2 methodology to identify a solution for climate change. It started with the first phase called Define phase and here I used that definition provided by International Energy Agency in the first paragraph of the Executive Summary of their Energy Outlook 2009 document.
It said that It is no exaggeration that future of human prosperity depends on how successfully we tackle the following two central energy challenges facing us today:
(1) Securing reliable and affordable energy and
(2) Rapid transition to (a) low carbon(b) energy efficient and (c) environmentally benign form of energy
Then I had to identify the Critical to Climate (CTC) Characteristics of this process of providing energy using fossil fuels which form the core of the current day climate change crisis.
For this purpose, I depicted the energy generating process as indicated below, identifying Inputs for the process, Process itself and Outputs from the process.
We identified seven potential CTC characteristics stemming from the statement by the IEA as follows: a) reliability, b) affordability, c) carbon content, d) energy efficiency, e) carbon dioxide generated, f) water vapour generated and g) waste heat generated. Out of these seven, reliability and affordability stem straight from the IEA document and so does energy efficiency as well.
The concern of been environmentally benign was interpreted as not influencing the environmental balance associated with components of the climate system and three climate parameters temperature, precipitation and wind. These CTC characteristics will influence the values of (1) extents and/or (2) quality of atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere and hydrosphere, temperature, precipitation and wind. Climate change was defined using these statements. The CTC characteristics should also stem from the usage of fossil fuels. We then discarded carbon content as it is again captured by carbon dioxide emitted which isa much easier characteristic to measure, monitor and grasp. Furthermore, what influences the seven components of the totality of climate system was not the amount of carbon in the fuel; but how much of carbon dioxide is been emitted. We also discarded Energy Efficiency as Waste Heat Generated is also an indicator of the same; higher the energy efficiency, lower the waste heat generated. Then the three parameters which influences the climate system were found to be (1) carbon dioxide emitted - that is the parameter which is over-emphasized, (2) Newly Formed Water (NFW) vapour emitted- the most ignored and neglected although it influences (a) atmosphere by reducing oxygen content in air and been a Greenhouse gas,(b) hydrosphere by ultimately ending up there, (c) cryosphere by enhancing the temperature more than carbon dioxide (d) biosphere by actively engaging in all biogeochemical processes (e) temperature by contributing to its enhancement (f) precipitation by directly leading to precipitation (g) wind by reducing wind shear more than other three gases (O2,N2,CO2) and (3) waste heat given by the fossil fuel while providing energy for an anthropogenic use. The moment we realized this significance of NFW vapour in this approach, we lost all our faith in the research done by climate scientists concentrating on carbon dioxide and temperature.
Then an analysis was carried out on the four sectors - commercial, industrial, residential and transportation -to identify the sector, that needs to be addressed first, in order to speedily bring significant benefits in respect of CTC characteristics. The outcome of this analysis is shown in Table 1. It was found that gasoline fueled transportation is the most significant contributor to climate change. Cost of Million British Thermal Units MBThu - is an indication of affordability of the energy.
Please Note that in Residential and Commercial Sectors only natural gas and electricity were used and waste energy given is what corresponds to the waste associated with the electricity used. In the case of industrial sector other fuels are used and the value of waste energy is an estimate on the high side. Because electricity and other fuels are used in these three sectors, NFW emission is given as been less than CO2 emitted. Liquid fuels and natural gas generate one (18kg) and two (36kg) molecules of NFW respectively for each molecule (44 kg) of CO2. In the case of transportation, only oil is used  this was prior to President Barak Obamas promotion of gas fueled transportation  and NFW is based on that while waste heat is taken as 80% of energy in the fuel as per thermal efficiency figures quoted in literature.
Then the process from well to wheel was broken down into different production phases from extraction to the step where energy in the fuel in the tank is converted to energy turning the wheel and this last phase was found to be the one making the most significant contribution to the environmental damage in respect of CTC characteristics.
In the next step the tank to wheel step was studied using Root Cause Analysis where the four aspects Man, Material, Method and Machine were analyzed to see which component makes the most significant contribution to the CTC characteristics.(1) Characteristics like mental state of the man, arrogance, (2) material aspects corresponding to petrol Octane 92, Octane 95, Auto diesel and Super diesel, (3) aspects corresponding to driving methods and (4) specifications corresponding to the internal combustion engine-both petrol and diesel -were then considered to find that it is the Machines which influence the CTC characteristics the most.
Then we got into the design phase and we started reviewing designs available to replace the ICE powered vehicles and the corresponding fuel combinations using the same CTC characteristics and it was found that Battery Electric Vehicle -Renewable Energy combination to be the most advantageous combination.
TABLE 2
This Table is based on data given in World Energy Councils document called Transport Scenarios in 2050, Ph.D. Thesis at MIT titled On the Road in 2035, the three objectives pronounced at UN Climate Summit in September, 2014 and current prices in Sri Lanka. Row corresponding to Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle (HFCV) was not completed due to uncertainties associated with the path to obtain the hydrogen. There are two ways of obtaining hydrogen; namely by electrolysis of water and by steam reforming of natural gas. Both do have inefficiencies as follows:
If electricity is available from renewable sources, it could be used to power Battery Electric Vehicles at 95% efficiency while HFCV will give us an efficiency of 48% only. If natural gas is to be used to get hydrogen, then it could power an ICE vehicle directly generating CO2 and NFW, without first converting gas to hydrogen using steam and then converting it in fuel cell. Both processes will generate CO2 and NFW at least to the same extents; but the second is less efficient.
Of course, renewable energy sources themselves have so many options like hydro, solar, wind, geothermal etc and Solar is the most favorable in respect of the extent of availability and reliability. Even in respect of solar, there are different Technologies like photovoltaic solar and concentrated solar thermal. For concentrated solar thermal one needs a minimum level of solar radiation and PV solar would be the preferred solution for Sri Lanka.
The question which arises then is where the required PV solar panels could be installed and Dr. Marc Jacobbsson of Stanford and Dr. Mark Dalucci of California at Davis in their Wind, Water and Solar (WWS) infrastructure have suggested rooftops and solar parks to provide energy for vehicle electrification and other energy uses. They have even calculated land area that would be required for the same. The issue with solar parks is that you need to carry out deforestation at the rate of about 1.8 hectares per megawatt and this would reduce (a) possible reflection of shortwave radiation (b) absorption of carbon dioxide by vegetation and (c) conversion of solar radiation to chemical energy during photosynthesis  all three enhancing climate change.
What we propose is laying PV solar panels along and above the highways-we call it Highway Solarisation - and use that electricity to power Battery Electric Vehicles. This particular solution has many significant advantages in addition to giving the best possible values for the CTC characteristics.
The solution
As such this most powerful technique of Six Sigma DMADV2 has provided us a very good solution for climate change in Battery Electric Vehicles associated with Highway Solarization. It would completely eliminate generation of carbon dioxide, NFW vapour and waste heat currently associated with vehicular transportation
We have carried out the first five phases of DMADV2 methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify phases) to solve this issue of climate change and has arrived at this solution of Highway Solarization and yet to carry out the Validation of the solution. We are awaiting approval from related government agencies for the Validation phase and once it is completed, Highway Solarization will become a completely proven and confirmed mitigation solution which will eliminate climate change due to fossil fuel driven transportation - the most significant source of greenhouse gases as at today.
Implementation issues
When one looks at the situation in the proper perspective, one would notice that PV Solars capability to assist in generating energy for mankind and make fossil fuel oil usage obsolete was a known thing for quite some time. But at the beginning it was conceived to be a small scale or rather domestic phenomenon and the changeover rates and duration were calculated based on the same. That is why oil company executives were scoffing that even after 30 years, the penetration of PV solar would be only about 5%.Then the concept of PV solar parks and megawatt installations became common. Even then the large areas required and deforestation required were adequate deterrents to prevent large-scale proliferation of the same and the possibility of mankind quenching its thirst for energy using renewables was in doubt. Concept of WWF infrastructure mentioned above cleared those doubts and its authors managed to convince everybody that the global energy requirement could be fulfilled using the WWS infrastructure. Still getting so many rooftop solar panels installed and so many solar parks installed in different countries with different forest cover regulations appeared to be somewhat difficult to achieve and the oil companies did not see a possibility of them getting into that small-scale business.
Highway Solarisation - with so many Highways available across the world and no special approvals been required - could become an industry which oil companies would readily invest in and reap benefits in line with Investments. What they need to remember is that they should develop a new business model for the operation and they dont need to dig thousands of meters down to get energy when the sun bestows upon them millions of kilowatt hours everyday to quench the thirst for energy.
Highway Solarisation could be implemented very fast even up to a few Terra Watt hours and it would bring significant revenue very fast. As they establish generating capability to this level they can manipulate prices to match their targets for return on investment. They need to remember that the price paid by an I C E vehicle owner for unit energy actually used is very high and the oil companies can charge significant prices for the energy they develop and the users should not be complaining bearing in mind the fact that the oil companies are doing a great service to mankind by saving them from the imminent travails of climate change.
How well they carry out that task will determine whether they would remain at the same positions in the Fortune 500 listings or they would move out just in the same fashion many other corporate giants have moved out in the past.
New York Times recently carried a news item about a statement from the reinsurer Munich Re to say that insurers lost nearly $135 billion in 2017 due to the natural disasters attributable to climate change. The news item also mentioned that the overall loss was about $ 330 billion. Generally, insurers invest the premiums received in profitable ventures to generate funds to pay for the losses incurred by the insured.
So, does it not mean that reinsurers like Munich Re stand to gain a lot by investing in Highway Solarisation. On one hand they would obtain the normal returns arising from the projects and they would be eliminating a significant portion of the insurance claims and they would be making our Loved Planet Earth a better place to live. This would be the finest example of demonstrating their dedication to the Triple Bottom Line.
If we in Sri Lanka invest a billion dollars - equivalent to what G E under Jack Welch invested in Six Sigma- in Highway Solarizationagain a Six Sigma initiative - and establish about 700 megawatt of PV solar power on Southern Expressway and the energy generated - 1050GWHrs per year - is used to power 400,000 BEVs at 15000 kms per year, we would be saving $170 million per year on our oil bill and after 6 years that power will be almost free  the exponential phase Jack Welch spoke about - for our small island nation with so much of development plans like tourism industry, Port City project. This of course is on the assumption that oil prices dont go up in the interim. May this be my gift to Mankind for the year 2018. What is better: Lighting this lamp or keep on cursing the darkness of climate change!

Personality development workshop for SLFP candidates
If the voters of Mahiyanganaya and Rideemaaliyadda cast around for a better political philosophy for the development of the locality, then there is the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) currently under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena behind them, a local politician claimed.
Chief SLFP organizer for the Badulla district electorate of Mahiyanganaya added that he is confident that leader of Party Maithripala Sirisena is able to carefully navigate difficult and complex routes to democracy and development.
When it comes to a better future for the country, harsh measures should be taken against unscrupulous people, wrongdoers and those who are with anti-democratic attitudes to the country and it is the leader of the party and incumbent President that has the capability of doing so, K. P. Gunawardhana said addressing a gathering of candidates fielded by the SLFP in the forthcoming local government poll.
These days, Gunawardhana is meeting the candidates contesting for the two local government bodies of Mahiyanganaya and Rideemaaliyadda pradeshiya sabhas at a Saturday workshop on personality development for them. He criticized those SLFP members who are contesting the February 10 election separately, accusing them of causing tremendous damage to the party and to the path forward for the country.
The optimism about reunification has all but died, due to tough decisions taken by them, he said, adding that many of them would have come back individually at the end, though". The political future of the nation as well as the party should not be ruined by making excessively abrasive comments, Gunawardhana lamented.
Although dissidents who see him as a person betraying the party policies for the sake of UNP (United National Party) vilify the leader of the party, those who are against corruption and malpractices of politicos are still with him. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) fielded candidates will win the upcoming poll, for sure against this background, he added.
The chief SLFP organizer for the Mahiyanganaya electorate urged the candidates to strictly adhere to the election guidelines issued by the Election Commission and the Department of Election Commissioner. He said that all rules and instructions given through the guidelines by the two official organizations this time tell those who are in the fray how to engage in electioneering democratically and peacefully, adding that they are not a barrier to anybody to do their work correctly.
These types of guidelines enable the country to hold future elections properly, Gunawardhana added.

Port City reclamation to be completed by 1Q - 2019
Close to 63 percent of the 269 hectares of land that would constitute the Port City Colombo, currently under construction has already been reclaimed from the ocean, and reclamation of the total area is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019, said Thulci Aluwihare, Head of Strategy and Business Development, for the project company.
We are on schedule. The 269 hectares is divided into residential, office, hotels, and theme parks and in addition to that there is a proposed international school, hospital and a convention center planned within Port City. So it wouldnt be wrong to say that this would be a city within a city that provides an integrated living experience.
He says that since the project is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with the Government of Sri Lanka, a proper market study will be commissioned prior to developing the strategic plots i.e. the school, health care plot (hospital) and the convention center.
This is because we need to position first, to understand the kind of demand and travelers who would arrive here and gain a proper understanding of the MICE industry before we decide on the capacity for these facilities. There would be a 2 kilometer stretch of artificial beach, Colombos first yacht Marina, and approximately 300 meters width from the beach and the breakwater made up of shallow water for swimming, water sports etc.
The entire area is separated into 5 precincts-districts. One is the financial district which would be around 40 hectares in size.
The project company plans to break ground for the construction of the Colombo International Financial Center building complex by the second half of this year.
It will be done in two phases and the total estimated investment would be US$ 1 billion, which will be split between the first and second phases of the development.
We conducted an international architectural competition in the latter half of last year and selected US firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), to do the architectural design for the financial district.
Currently it is in the design stages and it will be a mixed use development i.e. office, residential and retail.
Of the 269 hectares of the Port City, over 90 hectares is just open spaces or common area. Building orientation has been considered for wind and light and there are height zoning laws governing the height of buildings said Aluwihare.
In addition to that our Master Plan includes DCR (design control regulations); which any developer who wants to build in the city would be required to comply with. DCR in four volumes includes; urban/town planning, utilities, landscapingand sustainability guidelines have to be adhered to and although a certain amount of flexibility would be allowed, it would be within these parameters so that the look, feel or stature of the Port City is not compromised in any way, says Aluwihare.
In terms of day to day maintenance and management of the Port City, Aluwihare says that an estate management company would be set up under the tripartite agreement. It would be jointly managed between the Government and the Project Company.
The total built up area of the Port City is 5.65 million square meters of GFA (gross floor area). The local demand alone would not suffice in filling this; our vision is to build a world class city for South Asia, so how do we attract people to come and live and do business here The Government has come forward to set up the Colombo International Financial Centre within the Port City, to form business friendly policies to attractbusinesses to set up in Port City. We need to understand that Sri Lanka is not the only girl on the beach, there is competition around us. However, with the right infrastructure supported by business friendly policies of the Government, we have the opportunity to promote FDIs, export of services and ease of doing business says Thulci Aluwihare.
He says that this is a great opportunity for Sri Lanka to leapfrog, and regain the lost momentum postcivil war.

President's term covers six years
The incumbent President who was elected on January 8, 2015 had assumed duties in the office of President on January 9, 2015 for a period of six years. Any changes of the term of President would be an alienation of the sovereignty of the people, Attorney General Presidents Counsel Jayantha Jayasuriya said.
There is no provisions in the 19th Amendment to operate same with retrospective effect. Constitutions cannot be amended with retrospective effect, the Attorney General said making submissions on a determination sought by President Maithripala Sirisena from the Supreme Court as regards the duration of the term of his presidency.
The Supreme Court yesterday concluded arguments put forward in support and against the reference application forwarded by President Sirisena seeking an opinion whether it is constitutional for him to serve for a period of six years in the office of President and all parties in the application were directed to file their written submissions by today (12).
Later on, the Supreme Courts determination over the reference application is to be communicated to the President before January 14.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC yesterday informed the Supreme Court that people had exercised their sovereignty through the right of franchise to elect President Maithripala Sirisena to the office of President for a period of six years prior to the operation of 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appearing for an intervenient petitioner informed the Supreme Court that Presidents term should be confined to five years in accordance with the 19th Amendment to the constitution. The President in his website also insisted that he would like to limit his term of office. He agreed to have it for five years,Counsel stated.
Seven intervenient petitioners filed their papers and made oral submissions regarding the Presidents reference.
Chief Justice Priyasath Dep had nominated a fuller Bench comprising five judges of the Supreme Court to hear the reference application forwarded by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The matter was taken up before a Supreme Court five-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice K.T. Chitrasiri.
President Maithripala Sirisena, in terms of Article 129 (1) of the Constitution, has referred to the Supreme Court the following question for consideration and for an opinion to be submitted to the President on or before January 14, 2018.
Whether, in terms of Provisions of the Constitution, I, as the person elected and succeeding to the office of President and having assumed such office in terms of Article 32(1) of the Constitution on January 9 2015, have any impediment to continue in the office of President for a period of six years from January 9 2015, the date on which the result of my election to the office of President was declared.

In the day and age, where people become overwhelmed by the digital flood of information, there is an increasing demand for local content and publication that can be trusted.Trust, integrity and connection are some of the premium qualities people are seeking out  this has to manifest itself in the quality and integrity of the stories that are being produced.
Resa, loosely translated to meaning community, is a medium of communication which transcends the ordinary. Our society simply cannot go forward with the type of thinking and perspectives we derive today from the local press. We need to further intellectual journalism at a time where the industry is dominated by old-school thinking, gossips and click bait stories, said Chamara Lakshan, Chief Editor of Resa.
Resa, a Lake House publication which hit the newsstands starting yesterday (11), is a newspaper meant for every member of the family. Run daily, the paper will also have an online edition.
Chamara said that the online edition would not simply replicate stories that appear in the print form but offer more long-form, in-depth versions. The editorial team of Resa, comprises of some of the best in the media industry, with many of them being below the age of 40.
This attests to the thinking which is prevalent throughout the publication, Chamara says.
Resa, which is out daily, is viewable online at www.resa.lk. The launch of the publication (pictured here) was attended by eminent academics and professionals from the field.

SCI, Health Ministry sign MoU for better nutrition
Save the Children International (SCI) recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry (MOH) of Sri Lanka, with the participation of major officials from both institutions.
The foremost objective of this event was to detail the projects goal of improving maternal and child nutrition in the tea estates of Sri Lanka and to define the paths in which the two major parties will work collaboratively in implementing the project to improve the nutritional status of women and children on tea estates during the first 1,000 days of life (the approximate period of time between the start of a pregnancy and a childs second birthday).
Tea estates are the core focus area of the project, since they lag significantly behind on nutrition. As a result, the project is operating in four districts; Galle, Kandy, Matale, and NuwaraEliya; where the majority of tea estates are located. Within the project, SCI commits to ensure the improvement of quality of health and nutrition services to the estate community, to improve the awareness and demand for services and activities to improve nutrition, and many other obligations through the collective partnership with government health institutions, tea companies, and the communities.
The MOH commits to develop policies and strategies to address the issues faced by women and children in the estate sector and to work with the project to promote an increased awareness of estate families on the importance of ensuring an improved nutritional status during the first 1,000 days. It is hoped that, through this partnership between SCI and the MOH, important improvements could be made for the nutritional status of women and children on Sri Lankan tea estates.
The Good Nutrition on Tea Estates project is a three to four-year investment with a total budget of around 685,000,000 LKR (about $4.5 million USD), aimed at supporting several hundred tea estates. This project complements a broader portfolio of food security, emergency response, education, and child rights programmes at Save the Children. Save the Children has been working in Sri Lanka for the past 40 years and has been working in all parts of the country in these various programmatic areas.

SLIIT students showcases innovative  talents at INSYS 2017
 Five innovative teams of students at SLIIT participated at INSYS 2017, a one day symposium that gave them the opportunity to showcase their skills and they all clinched merit awards at the event.
INSYS 2017 brought together academics and researchers from local and overseas universities as well as local industrial experts to a common forum to publicize their latest research findings and exchange views and ideas under the theme of Innovations for Sustainable Future. The symposium was organized by the Office of Research & Innovation Services (ORIS), Sri Lanka Technological Campus (SLTC), Padukka. 
Internationally renowned professors and a prominent industrialist were among the keynote speakers who enlightened the audience with cutting edge technological advancements in electrical and communication engineering.
Among the topics discussed was the readiness of Sri Lankan industry in adapting these technologies. 
Two technical sessions at the symposium focused on Communication Engineering, Dynamics Systems, Modelling and Controls and Robotics. A workshop was held on emerging Technologies in Mobile Communications for local engineers with an exhibition of innovative product development by school students and engineering undergraduates at which the SLIIT students scored with their innovations. Over one hundred local and international researches, academics and industrialist participated in the symposium.
One team from SLIIT submitted a design for an automatic pet feeder to provide both food and water to pets even when the pet owner is not available at home to do it.

Teachers Union warns of impending strike
The Ceylon Teachers Union warned that they would launch a trade union strike action if the education officials do not take action over Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Dassanayake who allegedly forced a principal to kneel.
The parents of a young girl had met the principal of a Tamil medium school in Badulla with a letter from the Chief Minister seeking the admission of that student. The Principal, however, refused to enroll the student by citing that she would only follow the instructions of the education authorities and the circulars regarding Grade 1 admissions.
Upon hearing this, the Chief Minister summoned the principal to his residence where he had reprimanded her and threatened her, Ceylon Teachers Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin told the Daily News. She was forced to kneel before him and apologize.
Stalin said the union was concerned over inaction by the Education Ministry and had submitted a letter to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka seeking redress.
We have also written to the President and the Governor, seeking their intervention, he said. Similar incidents have taken place in the past under a previous regime but it is up to the present government which banks on the promise of good governance to do good. Stalin, however, warned that if their letters or requests are not heeded to, they would have no choice but to resort to trade union action next week.

Traffic offenders to get fines by mail
According to a new system to monitor traffic offences, CCTV cameras in strategic places in Colombo would take pictures of offenders, and the picture along with the fine would be mailed to their homes, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said yesterday.
He said this new system of monitoring traffic offenses would be introduced in the near future.
We will start a pilot programme on this next month, the minister said addressing a workshop for Poilce motor traffic officers.
The workshop was jointly organised by the Sri Lanka Police and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on first aid provided to victims of major accidents.
When the fine goes to the home, people can then accuse or argue with that. People can also use the fine sheet to contest their case in court or pay it, he said.
In future drivers licenses are also to be digitised and all offenses are to be recorded in that, he added.
We will provide police officers with equipment to read these licenses and get information on the driver. Hence we will not need to deploy this many officers on motor traffic duty, they can be assigned to safeguard the people in other ways, said the Minister.
He also promised through a Cabinet Paper to introduce a rewards system to recognise traffic police officers working in difficult situations.
We will give the officer a portion of the fines he collects. We are doing this because we know the difficulties you undergo and we want to reward that, he added.
The Minister said that during the last three years the crime rate in the country had declined by 35 per cent and the crime clearance rate has increased by 20 per cent.
He said the crime rate in 2017 has shown a decline by 35 per cent in comparison to 2014. The crime clearance rate which stood at 58 per cent in 2014 has increased to 78 per cent in 2017.
Minister Ratnayaka said that better use of modern technology has helped the Police to increase the crime clearance rate significantly during the last three years.
He said the government will continue to equip the Police with the latest technology in crime resolving to keep the upward trend.
The Minister further said that all police stations have been instructed to work harder to increase the crime resolving rate and have been given necessary powers and facilities to conduct investigations and take action to curb crime and violence.
He also noted that the government will come up with an awards and incentive scheme to encourage police officers who engage in successful crime busting.

US issues positive travel advisory to Sri Lanka
The US State Department has released a four-point safety ranking system similar to a travel advisory and an interactive world map showing war zones and countries that pose serious security risks. Accordingly, Sri Lanka has been listed as having the lowest advisory level.
Sri Lanka is now listed as a Level-1 country which means Exercise normal precautions when travelling to Sri Lanka. Other countries in Level-1 include Australia, Singapore, Brunei, Sweden and Switzerland. According to the descriptions provided on the State Department website, Level-1 is the lowest advisory level.
Meanwhile, 10 war zones and states have been ranked Level Four, "Do Not Travel". This includes Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
North Korea is also Level Four, with the additional restriction that US law prohibits American travellers from using their passports there, effectively banning visits.
The Straits Times quotes an official at the State Department who insists that the change is to make advice clearer to US travellers. "These are not political documents. These are simply based on our assessment of the security situation," senior consular official Michelle Bernier-Toth said.

Witnessing clashes in Parliament is regrettable: Premajayantha
It is regrettable to witness unnecessary clashes in Parliament, as the main task of the Parliament is law-making, Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
Persons who are incapable of making laws, are fighting and quarrelling in Parliament, even though law-making is the main task of the Parliament, he said.
The minister said so addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) weekly media briefing at its headquarters, yesterday.
The minister, while condemning the clash that erupted in Parliament on Wednesday, said it should have been avoidable, if the Speaker took necessary measures. Accordingly, the Speaker should have held a party leaders meeting prior to the summons.
There should have been a party leaders meeting, at which all party leaders could decide the date when the bond commission report could be presented to Parliament. Considering the date, when the report would be available, the speaker could summon Parliament, he said.
The Special Presidential Commission on the treasury bond issue had been held for ten months. However, certain persons could not be patient for a week until the report could be submitted by January 17, he said.
Speaking on the several allegations levelled against the bond commission by certain persons, Minister Premajayantha said that not only him, but also the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) could be satisfied with the conduct and the qualifications, experiences, capabilities, and relevance of three commissioners.
He further said that it is unfair to level allegations on the three commissioners of the bond commission, as they are among the most experienced and capable persons in their sectors.
He added that accusations related to the bond issue cannot be allowed to be heard through a civil case alone; there should be a criminal case as well.
