Allu Sirish opens up about his NEXT FILM
Allu Sirish claims this film will be a game changer.
An actor, who hasnt had a film release in over a year, says he has invested a lot of time on his next project, which is currently on the floors. He believes it will be a game changer for his career. This gap gave me an opportunity to learn a lot and understand what I want to do with my career. It opened some new doors and helped me to see things from a different perspective, Sirish told a news portal, adding that the time taken for his next project is totally worth it. The yet-untitled film, which is currently on floors, is being directed by Parasuram. This is a big film. Im sure that it will be a game changer for my career. This is the kind of film that will bring scores of families to the cinemas again. Ive worked so far only in love stories but this is a family drama, he said. Explaining about his character in detail, Sirish said: I couldnt get the pulse of all the characters that Ive played so far. However, the character in this film is very close to my inner self and that got me excited. I could easily relate to it. I like to do films that help me get in touch with some part of me.
While Sirish is spending ample time on a project, his brother Allu Arjun has had four releases in the last two years. If I really push myself, I can easily do two films a year. But I dont see the need to hurry and end up doing bad projects. I dont like to ape my brother and do things exactly the way he does. Each film is like raising a child and this process cant be rushed, he said.
Before the project went on floors, Sirish spent quality time in the gym. He says it wasnt in preparation for his role in the film. I had to undergo a knee surgery after the release of my last film. In order to get back in shape, I started working out and I loved the transformation. Fitness has now become a way of life, he said.
Also starring Lavanya Tripathi, nearly 50 percent of the film has already been completed. We are planning to release it in February or March next year. Even if it gets delayed, were fine because we dont want to hurry, Sirish, who is still keen to explore opportunities in Tamil. He made his acting debut in 2013 Tamil-Telugu bilingual Gouravam.

## Title: Chefs Shack  Break away from the Kitchen

Chefs Shack  Break away from the Kitchen
Everyone deserves a break, no matter what industry you work in. There are some who take it almost everyday ;), some who take it on the weekends, some who take it once a month and some who take it once a year. Now when you take that vacation, you usually end up in a tropical island, winter wonderland or maybe just in the comfort of your own home.
So, when you are a chef, you are always in the kitchen. And your cuisine goes way around the world than you actually have. And even when you do go around the world, you are still back in the kitchen teaching people your style and not really having that break you need.
But now, Chefs from around the world have the chance to throw their knives and forks aside, pack up and make their way down to Sunny Sri Lanka (not so sunny now with the rains), and chill out at the first of a kind Chefs Shack.
Chefs Shack is the brainchild of the one and only celebrity chef and restaurateur Dharshan Munidasa. Known to always think out-of-the-box, he came up with this Bed & Breakfast rest stop for Chefs, Restaurateurs, Sommeliers, Wine Makers and anyone in the F&B industry.
Chefs Shack is located at the Dharshans home with a very new state of the art Hacker kitchen done by Fine Furniture Pvt Ltd outfitted in Bosch home appliances. There are two bedrooms  one up and one downstairs  with 400 thread count bed sheets and duvets. Each room has a bathroom with amenities by Spa Ceylon.
And for the tech people out there who need to be on the phone will be happy to note that they have an iPod with Bluetooth enabled speakers, an iPod controlled lighting system, a Nespresso machine, safe, a mini bar and a stock of OLU water. And the first guest to make a stop was none other than Sri Lankan born Australian Chef Peter Kuruvita who is known very well in Sri Lanka and is an award-winning chef and restaurateur, TV presenter, author, industry speaker and restaurant consultant.
Both of us are half Sri Lankan. Chef Shacks is a very simply concept. Its a B&B for chefs. And making reservations here is not the same as you its normally done. You need to find a connection to me. For example Peter suggests this place to someone by email and they contact me etc. There is a booking fee  which is a bottle of champagne and an ingredient or two. Peter had brought in a few ingredients that are his own and these are things we expect from people, and hope this trend continues in other parts of the world as well. We are looking forward to welcoming more chefs here, Dharshan stated at a small launch meeting at the Shack.
Im glad to be here. I love your kitchen. I worked with Bosch before and theres a big company in Australia that has all the kitchens in one and it invites all chefs to come and check it out. But being here, being the first guest and checking it all out. We normally meet either when hes finished work or when Im flying in and out and its always in the restaurants. I am more than happy to say that this man has to pull himself out of the restaurant to come and work in his house.
Youve done amazing things for Sri Lanka and for putting Ministry of Crab where anyone in Australia and the world comes to MOC. I think to have something like that makes everyone in Sri Lankan very proud because we need to keep pushing the virtues of the country out there.
I think this is a wonderful idea and incredible generous to open your house to the others. Ingredients I brought are badly packaged but made with love, Peter stated.
When I approached SBS and asked them can I do a show, they asked whats Sri Lanka, whats it all about I threw the question back at them and asked them what do you think Sri Lanka is all aboutSri Lanka has changed, turned and come to be the destination in the world to be in, Peter stressed.
Peter added that he has already recommended the next chef who is the English Australian Chef Matt who is a brilliant chef but will drive you mad. Peter has done something in the south coastal TAFE which is an education facility for chefs. They started it about 12 years ago. Idea was that he went, he worked with the young chefs and when he left, he had to recommend one chef. From 12 years ago to today, some of the best chefs are from that facility.
Speaking about the Chefs Shack, room rates will differ depending on the season and as mentioned above the mandatory booking fee is a bottle of champagne and one ingredient. Dharshan invites the guest chefs to cook with him and of course share a recipe where hopefully, 200 chefs later, all those recipes can come out in terms of a Best Seller Recipe Book.
The brand new kitchen will soon be home to the set of Season 3 of Culinary Journeys with Dharshan.

Embark opens store at Dickmans Road
Twenty five years after she launched her first retail store, entrepreneur and brand builder Otara Gunewardene has returned to that location to open an independent store to celebrate Christmas with Embark fans in Colombo.
The opening of the new store at 38, Dickmans Road (now Lester James Peiris Mawatha) is part of the planned expansion of Embarks retail presence after Ms Gunewardene exited from Odel to refocus her energies on the building the community animal welfare programme and the fashion label that supports it.
The Dickmans Road store accommodates the full range of Embark products including the brands signature slogan T shirt range for Ladies, Gents and Kids, the famous Embark wrist bands, fashion accessories, bags, gifts and canine products as well as the full range of 2015 Christmas Specials that the company says is sure to make excellent gifts during the season.
The building, which many Colombo residents still recall as the first Odel store, has been given a colourful exterior and bold branding that makes it stand out visually and easy to find.
Ample customer parking has been made available opposite the store.
Embark ventured into independent retail in August this year with the opening of its Galle store and has since opened stores at the departure lounge of the Bandaranaike International Airport and at Kandy City Centre. The brand is also available at Odel Alexandra Place and Odel K Zone, Ja-Ela.

Emirates fleet retirement schedule for 2016
Emirates has announced it will take delivery of 36 new aircraft in 2016 and retire 26 aircraft under airlines fleet plans for the year ahead.
The new aircraft joining the fleet in 2016 include 20 A380s and 16 Boeing 777-300ERs. These two aircraft types are recognised as some of the most efficient and quiet commercial airplanes available, emitting on average 12% less carbon dioxide than the aircraft being retired.
At the end of 2016, the aircraft retirements and new deliveries will put Emirates average fleet age at 5.6 years, dramatically younger than the global average. A recent analysis shows the average fleet age for the top five airlines in North America is 13.6 years, while the average fleet age for the top five airlines in Europe is 10.7 years.
The 26 aircraft Emirates will retire in 2016 include 12 A330-300s, four A340-300s, one A340-500, six Boeing 777-200ERs, two Boeing 777-300s and one Boeing 777-300ER.
The average age of the Emirates aircraft slated for retirement in 2016 will be 15.7 years, well-below the average industry retirement age of 25. In addition, 13 more aircraft will be retired in 2017 and another 13 will be retired in 2018.
Sir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline said, Emirates has a global footprint as the world's largest international airline, and we have a responsibility to our customers, the communities we serve, and the planet. We are fully committed to flying a modern fleet that is better for the environment, and provides our customers with a superior level of comfort and safety.
With the retirement of older aircraft and the introduction of new, more fuel efficient aircraft in 2016, Emirates will continue to lead the industry in reducing the age of our fleet, while at the same time defining new levels of service that our customers have come to expect.
Currently, the total number of aircraft in the Emirates fleet stands at 244. In 2015, the airline received 26 new aircraft, including 15 A380s, 10 Boeing 777-300ERs and 1 Boeing 777 Freighter. The airline has 262additional aircraft on order, worth over US$120 billion at list prices. Its order book includes 71 Airbus A380s, 42 Boeing 777-300ERs, 115 Boeing 777-9Xs and 35 Boeing 777-8Xs.

Supun-Warnakulasuriya
The highest try scorer for league rugby champions Royal College and the architect of their famous rolling maul Supun Warnakulasuriya has been ruled out of the Sri Lanka under 20 team for the Junior Rugby Asiad in Singapore with a serious knee injury.
Warnakulasuriya received this injury while playing in a practice match for the Sri Lanka under 20 team against A Division side Police.
The practice match was played in the early morning hours last Thursday at Police Park.
Sri Lanka under 20 captain and number eight Omalka Gunaratne (concussion) and hooker Nisal Desaka (broken nose) were also injured in the same match but have recovered sufficiently to go on the tour.
Third year school coloursman Warnakulasuriya represented the Royal 1st XV side under captains Rimzie Jamaldeen, Nimshan Jayawardana and Bhanuka Gamage. Wasantha Warnakulasuriya, father of the injured Supun told the Daily News: I am sad that my son cannot represent the country at the Junior Asiad in Singapore. This is part and parcel of a sport like rugby as you are bound to suffer nasty injuries. Since he is recovering fast I am hoping that Supun will be able to return to play club rugby for CR and FC in the ongoing Dialog league rugby tournament."
The Sri Lanka team leaves for Singapore on Friday for the tournament that will be played from December 13-19.

Firms opt for flexible working to retain top staff - Regus
Remote working is becoming ever more the norm with the majority firms reporting the focus has shifted to measuring outputs rather than time spent in the office
New research by global workplace provider Regus has revealed that four fifths of firms are shifting their focus from relying on time spent in the office, to measuring their individual outputs with results-based assessments, signalling that remote working is becoming ever more customary.
According to Regus's new research- a survey canvassing the opinions of over 44,000 people from more than 100 different countries - 61% of firms report that businesses in their sector also use flexible working as a mechanism for retaining and attracting top staff.
With more and more businesses embracing flexible working, implementing successful remote management processes is essential to ensuring top workers are recognised and developed. Out of the 44,000 plus surveyed, 63% manage a remote worker or team, yet, only 43% of firms have put in place special training. Excelling in remote management, unsurprisingly, plays an integral part in nurturing employee relations, motivation and loyalty.
Additional key global findings:
* Over half of respondents (54%) confirm that companies like theirs are looking to increase the number of remote workers;
* 67% confirm that senior management trusts that flexible working can be productive;
* 46% are managed by a remote manager at least some of the time;
* 76% declare that senior management can actually benefit by becoming more productive if they can work flexibly.
Regus Sri Lanka Country Manager Dr. Nirmal De Silva said the huge cultural shift in the workplace towards flexible working continues to grow.
This latest research shows that the business people are embracing this change. With improved productivity, better staff retention and lower operating costs at stake, implementing successful remote management processes can clearly bring businesses huge benefits." "Given the significant surge in flexible working, it is positive news that firms are also adapting their measurement of employees to fit and are shifting the focus from an office face-time mentality to one of measuring real outputs regardless of location. One important caveat remains, however, while globally workers managing a remote workforce or being managed remotely are increasing, too few firms are investing in specific training which could improve the transition from fixed office workforce to mobile workforce making it even smoother and more productive.

FITIS Software Chapter to initiate Crowdfunding program
Federation of IT Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) Software Chapter is planning to initiate a new program on Crowdfunding as a part of its four pillar strategy for the development of the ICT industry and its members, namely business development, capacity creation, policy decisions and training and development.
FITIS Software Chapter has been in operation for 20 plus years, and has been successfully organizing many programs and activities over the years. Crowdfunding will be the biggest initiative of FITIS Software Chapter introduced in 2015. The Crowdfunding concept has attracted immense attention over the past five years. Since Barack Obamas presidential campaign mobilized millions of small donors to fund his campaign, people have realized the power of Crowdfunding.
Many stories, such as the one of Ouya, a game console developer who raised $950,000 in just eight hours on Kickstarter, have also highlighted the potential of Crowdfunding for creative projects.
Crowdfunding is traditionally viewed as the utilization of websites or platforms to raise funds from a broad pool of potential backers, who are engaged through integrated marketing and social media promotion. Since the Title II provisions of the JOBS Act were legalized in late 2013, there have been dozens of new platforms launched to attract investments by accredited investors.
Crowd Funding (CF) is not appropriate for later stage financing. Although, there are a few examples which show that through Crowdfunding, it was possible to raise large amounts of money even for later-stage projects of incumbent companies, these must be regarded as exceptions.
As most projects are posted on public Crowdfunding platforms before a proof of concept has been carried out, it is rare that intellectual property is protected at that point.
By sharing their ideas, projects and concepts online, often at a very early stage of development, those who turn to Crowdfunding run the risk of having a competitor steal their most important resource at that stage: their intellectual property.
The four different types of Crowdfunding methods include: Debt-Based Crowdfunding, Equity-Based Crowdfunding, Reward-based Crowdfunding and Donation-Based Crowdfunding.
The many forms of Crowdfunding, a relatively new and popular avenue for start-up businesses, campaigns, and other organizations looking to promote a business, investment, cause, or other pursuit.
Donation Crowdfunding is exactly what it sounds like - the campaigns amass donations without being required to provide anything of value in return.

Grand Barista Championship returns for third consecutive year
Colombos favourite coffee house chain Barista Lavazza staged its signature annual Grand Barista Championship 2015 on December 1. The much-awaited event took place at Baristas Gandhara outlet in Colombo 6 and was held for the third consecutive time.
The championship first commenced in 2013 as an internal competition to motivate staff members. However the success of the first event led to a much larger event last year. The aim of the event is to crown the ultimate brew master from among the Barista Lavazza staff from their outlets spread across the island. The winner receives an all-expense paid educational tour to India. Commencing at 9am this years championship saw six highly skilled competitors battle it out for the grand prize.
After a grueling and well-contested championship Nirodha Sankalpa emerged the champion Brew Master while the 1st runner-up was Thuwan Surajdeen and 2nd runner-up position was clinched by Roshan Subesinghe.
This years competition was adjudicated by a renowned panel of judges comprising Illy Coffee Business Development Manager Alexandra Rocci, Colombo School of Hospitality Management CEO Steven Bradie, Inflight Service Delivery Sri Lankan Airlines Training Manager Divakar Gnanakan, JAT Holdings Business Development Manager Jerome de Silva and London House of Coffee Operations Manager Kiyaz Borham. The eminent panel followed stringent international barista championship guidelines thereby ensuring a truly world-class competition.
A Barista Championship was held in a small scale two years ago and as a result of continuous training we later branded the championship as GBC (Grand Barista Championship) last year giving the championship a unique identity. Last year GBC was held in a grand scale and this year we made it an even bigger deal as a means to appreciate the talent within our ranks.
We are extremely happy with the competitive spirit with which each of the participants took part and even more so of the high level of coffee based drinks they came up with.
Competitions such as this only showcase how much young talent our country possesses and that we can take on the world if this talent is groomed in the right manner, Barista Coffee Lanka (Pvt) Limited Training and Development Manager Tharanga Perera noted.
Darshana Sampath was the winner of GBC 2014 and was sent to India to visit a Lavazza coffee factory to experience firsthand how the coffee used at Barista outlets is made. He also participated at special coffee trainings conducted by global experts which in turn have enabled him to enhance his brewing techniques.
After becoming the Barista Champion and visiting the Lavazza coffee factory in India I returned with more passion for coffee than before and continue to make great coffees, Sampath said speaking on his achievement. It was really exciting for me to have my friends at Barista cheer me on while I was competing. Im now looking forward to adding more knowledge to my skills through further training, this years winner Nirodha Sankalpa added.
Coffee is the core of Barista Lavazzas business and all aspects of serving the perfect cup of coffee to every customer are taken very seriously. Therefore a lot of time, energy and funds are invested continuously to not only ensure the best raw material but also to develop the team their skills. Championships of this nature ensure that the best of the best are trained within the company itself.
A brew master at Barista Lavazza is a respected profession in the world for their specialized skills in brewing perfect espressos, cappuccinos and lattes. Most of the coffee house chains brew masters have joined fresh after school from various parts of the country and from different walks of life. Many of them have experienced a subtle but effective transformation as they become part of an organized learning experience.
The culture at Barista Lavazza is driven by our passion for our main product which is coffee and our company prides itself on the modern style of management that we follow. We believe our staff is the greatest asset and we do everything within our capacity to develop this asset and treat them with the respect and care which we expect them to extend to our guests. We have a passionate, energetic and enthusiastic bunch of people who work with a lot of ownership never failing to take initiative to make the customers experience worthwhile. GBC is actually a platform that is created for our team to display their skills passionately in front of a distinguished audience, Perera added.

How Deepika Padukone bagged XXX alongside Vin Diesel
Deepika Padukone sent social media into a tizzy after she posted a picture on Friday. The Bajirao Mastani actress posted a picture on Facebook tagging Vin Diesel, one of the key cast members of the XXX series, without letting him face the camera! Since their picture had the famous XXX logo in the backdrop, there were speculations if the beauty has signed her first international project.
Things were clearer when a source close to the actress confirmed this development. The source was quoted saying, The night after the success party of Tamasha, Deepika flew to America for a meeting with Hollywood star Vin Diesel. No wonder, Ranveer Singh is still promoting his next release alone! But who knew Deepika would surprise everybody with this photograph! It is a big achievement for her and she is finishing all formalities in America.
While the development is a HUGE deal for the actress, we can exclusively tell you what happened behind the scenes and now DP bagged the project. A source exclusively told BollywoodLife, In the past, Deepika had given up Fast and Furious 7 with Vin Diesel for Happy New Year with Shah Rukh Khan. She was quite upset that she wasnt able to be part of the action film.
But being someone who honors her commitment, she decided to give HNY priority over the international film. But Vin personally told her not to worry and that they would soon collaborate in the near future. They had discussed the XXX film at that point and Diesels agent stayed in touch with the actress and signed her for XXX: The return of Xander Cage.

IMF forecasts growth rate of 5.5%
The International Monetary Fund(IMF) forecasts that Sri Lankas economic growth rate will be around 5.5 percent which is higher than the regional average.
IMF resident representative Eteri Kvintradze speaking at the LBR LBO Debrief: Business Climate Outlook conference said despite external vulnerabilities and concerns about fiscal consolidation, Sri Lanka can be competitive in the South Asia region.
With the end of a war and recently built infrastructure, Sri Lanka businesses are well placed to benefit from new opportunities, she added.
She also said that Sri Lanka enjoys permanent peace and good infrastructure which is an advantage the country has over their neighbors. This is an advantage that the investors should look at seriously.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently said Sri Lanka may seek an IMF facility next year as a prudential measure given uncertainties tied to the global economy.
Sri Lanka has one of the lowest corporate income tax productivity rates in the region.
As a result, government projections for revenue increases next year look overly ambitious, given tax proposals outlined in the government budget.

Maruti Suzuki eager to open assembly plant now
Car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki India is once again looking at setting up an assembly plant in Sri Lanka,Board of Investment Chairman Upul Jayasuriya said.
Speaking to Daily News at the opening of the India Sourcing exhibition at the Convention Centre on Monday he said that talks are on once again and they have shown renewed interest.
Maruti Suzuki India had initially announced it was contemplating setting up a plant in Sri Lanka in 2013 and the preferred location was Hambantota. This was to use the Hambantota Harbour for re- export. However due to some tax issues with the then government the project did not materialise. He said that the positive developments between India and Sri Lanka is one plus factor for them to reconsider Sri Lanka.
The increase in tax on imported motor vehicles too is another factor for this.
Sri Lanka is currently the second largest market in terms of sales of Maruti Suzuki India.

Myanmar launches fledgling bourse
Myanmar officially launched its first modern stock exchange Wednesday, but without a single stock to trade, as the nation's latest drive for economic revitalisation struggles to take flight.
Aung San Suu Kyi's pro-democracy party swept elections last month, boosting confidence in the former junta-run nation's reforms.
Myanmar's launch of a bourse of its own marks an ambitious new stage in efforts to ignite investment. Crowds gathered Wednesday outside the elegant newly restored colonial-era building in the heart of Yangon to witness the stock market's official launch.
But they were not listening for the toll of a trading bell because the exchange has yet to list a single firm.
Delays in confirming underwriting companies have pushed back the timeframe for initial public offerings.
It will take time to be up and running, maybe two or three months, said Tin May Oo of Myanmar's Securities and Exchange Commission, lauding the benefits of a transparent trading system. Officials expect a clutch of local firms to kick-start the stock exchange when it is fully operational.
Businesses, stifled for years under the economic mismanagement of the former junta, have welcomed the chance to raise funding through the market. I can save money from my salary at the end of the month but it's not enough to run my own business so the stock exchange will be my hope, said graphic designer Lin Aung.
I will watch their transactions and processes for a few months to learn about stock markets, and then I hope I will have a chance to participate, he told AFP.
The bourse has been decades in the making in Myanmar, one of only a handful of nations without a modern stock exchange.
Every country needs a capital market and ours will bring new investment opportunities, Aung Tun Thet, an advisor to the president's office, told AFP recently.
In 1996 Japanese firm Daiwa Securities and a state bank set up the Myanmar Securities Exchange Centre, but this allowed over-the-counter sales of shares in just two firms, a Myanmar timber company and bank.
Official media has said state-owned Myanma Economic Bank will own a controlling 51 percent stake in the Yangon Stock Exchange (YSX), with the remainder divided between Japanese partners the Japan Exchange Group and Daiwa Institute of Research, the research arm of Daiwa Securities Group.
Myanmar was under the thumb of the military for more than 50 years.
A once-buoyant economy was dismantled by bungled state-controlled policy and heavy sanctions imposed by western nations for major human rights abuses.
But reforms since 2011 have seen the door creak open to a potential consumer market of 51-million people.

While both sides are keeping tight-lipped on the specific details, they have shared that the event will have a strong Christmas theme, and that the spirit of giving will definitely be ever present at the location.
SLT certainly has the resources to back up the hype.
The total internet solutions provider offers multiple broadband technologies including both wired and wireless technologies, Fibre, 4G LTE andADSL.
Further, with two of the most happening companies involved, the possibilities are endless for what they might have in store.
The event activation was described as a digital first, implying that technology will most definitely be involved, as one would guess given SLTs participation. Given that every floor of Majestic City will without a doubt be packed to the brim on the days leading up to Christmas, the public must surely have been factored in as well.
The pairing has already kicked off the holiday cheer with the implementation of a large touch-table at the heart of Majestic City for the general public to try their hand at a variety of touch-based games.
While the games have attracted quite a bit of attention from visitors to the mall, Social media is also bigger than ever, and with it comes the need for instantaneous updates and real-time happenings. If the games hint at anything, SLT and TNL will be targeting the youth yet again with sleek, futuristic experiences, so social media integration is essentially guaranteed. For now, we can only speculate until the big unveiling later this week, so heres hoping for another jolly holiday surprise!

First Test at Dunedin today
Sri Lanka battle heavy odds in series
DUNEDIN, WEDNESDAY: Brendon McCullum, Chris Cairns and Nigel Llong combined to effectively relegate Sri Lanka to bit-part players leading into the opening match of the two-test series in Dunedin on Thursday, though the spotlight will soon be unavoidable.
Ideally there will be limelight too for a rebuilding squad but the opportunity to inflict New Zealand's first defeat on home soil since South Africa won at Hamilton in 2012 seems as remote as the prospect of fine weather for the duration.
Sri Lanka are among New Zealand's current sequence of 11 unbeaten Tests at home having suffered two comprehensive defeats at the start of last summer, despite having the redoubtable Kumar Sangakkara to anchor the batting order.
Sangakkara then followed Mahela Jayawardene into retirement in August leaving an array of former discards, debutants and largely untested newcomers to support captain Angelo Mathews, opener Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal as the chief source of runs.
While McCullum's involvement in the Cairns perjury trial and English umpire Nigel Llong's appointment despite a game-changing blunder in Adelaide last month were naturally storylines leading into the first home test of the summer, Sri Lanka's preparations have also been dogged by dramas.
Dhammika Prasad's tour-ending back injury in the warm-up game in Queenstown and first-choice wicket keeper Kusal Perera's exile after testing positive to a banned substance has made a tough assignment even more daunting for a squad that has played their last eight tests in Colombo, Galle or Pallekele.
Mathews alluded to the change of climate on Wednesday, yet losing Prasad and Perera are bigger concerns.
Kusal's news was shocking. I can't really comment on that. We hope Sri Lankan cricket, Kusal and his lawyers will do their best to get him on the park ASAP, he said.
Recalled opener Kaushal Silva was due to arrive on Wednesday as Perera's replacement, a timeframe that meant he was highly unlikely to feature so the uncapped Udara Jayawardena is in line to blunt the new ball with Karunaratne.
We don't have greats in the team anymore, so it's up to us. We've got to pass on what we know, said Karunaratne, who is one of just three specialist batsmen with previous test experience in New Zealand - he made 152 in last year's Boxing Day test in Christchurch.
Kithuruwan Vithanage finds himself reinstated to the top order after an impressive A tour in Christchurch in October, while 20-year-old Kusal Mendis, who has one test and only 11 first-class games on his resume, retains his place despite twin failures in Queenstown.
Milinda Siriwardana, who is just two tests into his career, rounds out the capable batsmen and will also offer a second spin bowling option behind Rangana Herath who is likely to be confined to a containment role until the pitch wears.
In contrast to Mathews, McCullum has few concerns - Cairns is apparently not among them - as the Black Caps seek to build on the momentum they built in Australia after being outplayed in Brisbane. Other than Martin Guptill's continuing under-performance at test level the Black Caps appear set to bounce back from the 2-0 series loss across the Tasman.
Spinner Mark Craig also struggled but could retain his place subject to a final pitch appraisal before the toss. He has been bracketed with left arm quick Neil Wagner.
Although the pitch presented seam-friendly on Wednesday McCullum realised prolonged sunlight could take some sting out of the surface.
You've got to make sure the team is not picked for the first day, you're picking for the full five days, said McCullum, before offering both options hope.
Neil Wagner's a guy who's going to bowl long spells so It allows you to rotate your seamers in shorter spells for a little bit more high impact.
And then the rider: If it [the wicket] does dry out [before the toss] and if we think it's going to dry out later in the game then Mark Craig certainly comes into play.

Supply chain benchmarking and KPIs for the future
Supply chain leaders are gradually gaining a better understanding of their daily operations, but they may be missing out on a key aspect.
While it is commendable to know what is happening today and how your supply chain compares with industry leaders and standards, it is even better to see what will happen tomorrow  before it happens. Benchmarking and key performance indicators (KPIs) are both important parts of supply chain management. They can be used as a platform to develop predictive indicators that guide you in adjustments to your supply chain now for protection against or leverage of situations likely to arise in the future.
The Benchmarking and KPI Platform
A brief recap on these items will set the scene for the paragraphs to follow. Supply is the process of measuring processes, products and services to see how they compare with others. You can make a comparison with industry standards or averages or with the top performers in your sector or in others. Thus, you might choose to record your organizations DIFOT performance (Delivered In-Full, On-Time) to see how well it compares to industry expectations. Benefits of benchmarking include being able to set realistic targets and adopt best practices. By extending to compare with other non-competing companies or industries, you may uncover significant differences and new supply chain methods that your own industry is not yet using.
Key performance indicators then help you to monitor progress towards the results you want. As the word key suggests, KPIs should be for a small set of the most important measurements to be made. They provide a quick, direct way of seeing if your organization is meeting a target or if there is divergence from the standard it is trying to achieve. They can also be a handy way of communicating priorities to supply chain staff and an enterprise in general.
While one KPI may also be broken down into component KPIs to be sure the right bases are being covered, long lists of KPIs are to be avoided. Nine or ten is often a reasonable maximum. Some organizations also get excellent mileage from focusing on even fewer.
How do Enterprises Use Benchmarking
One of the first questions a company or organization needs to answer is what to benchmark. For supply chains, the Supply Chain Council offers the SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) framework. SCOR has three main components: process modelling, performance measurements and best practices. In the performance measurements part, there are over 150 key indicators that measure supply chain performance.
While SCOR is designed to be useful for any kind of supply chain operation, it is also to be used per individual supply chain, rather than a group of supply chains. This is an important point, because one enterprise can in reality have several separate supply chains, each one defined by the customers served and the products and services provided. In this case, benchmarking is to be done on each internal supply chain operation, separately.
An enterprise then selects the core set of indicators that is the most valuable to it. The selection can be determined by business goals, KPIs that other enterprises are using, relevant industry standards and the possibility of making meaningful, comparative measurements. The principles may seem simple, but in practice, organisations must be wary of quagmire debates about what to measure, how to measure it and how to interpret the results afterwards. A pragmatic or suck it and see approach that starts off with a few likely candidates and refines them or adds to them (while keeping the total number small) may be the best route to improvement.
The Perfect Order Example
Typically, an enterprise wants to deliver its products or services to the right customer at the right time, in the right place, in the right condition, and with the right invoice. Assuming that this process is also profitable to the enterprise, it then provides a foundation for customer satisfaction and repeat business. A Perfect Order indicator based on the combination of the five indicators above can be defined to track overall how close the enterprise is coming to this happy state of affairs. This indicator is of particular interest because it corresponds to customer expectations: customers want deliveries to be perfect.
If standards for the five separate indicators are being achieved 100 percent, then the overall Perfect Order indicator will also show 100% (100% x 100% x 100% x 100% x 100% equals 100%). But what happens if all five factors are being achieved at only 99% Then the Perfect Order indicator will become 99% x 99% x 99% x 99% x 99%, which equals about 95%. Of course, the Perfect Order indicator could show 95% because just one factor is underperforming at 95%, even though the others are achieving 100%, and so on for other possible combinations. In any case, if the Perfect Order indicator shows less than 100%, it is possibly to immediately drill down to check each contributing indicator to see which of those five lower-level indicators is causing the problem.
Should such a Perfect Order indicator always show 100% In an ideal world, yes, it should. However, if your benchmarking activities show you that the industry standard is 98%, while your organization is already achieving 99%, there may be justification for sticking with excellence as a competitive differentiator, rather than pursuing absolute perfection.
KPIs for yesterday, KPIs and KPPs for tomorrow
Based on past data, a key performance indicator is necessarily reactive. In other words, it shows you that a problem has occurred. As in the Perfect Order example above, you can examine contributing factors to find any culprits for poor overall performance, and take the right remedial action. However, damage may already have been done. Dissatisfied customers may voice their complaints to others. In general they are more likely to criticise an enterprise than satisfied customers are to praise it. By the time your KPI has shown you there is something wrong, you may have lost valuable customer goodwill together with future revenues and profits.
It would clearly be preferable to have indicators that give you information about what is likely to happen in the future, and not only what has happened in the past. Depending on who is talking about them, you may hear such indicators being called KPPs (key performance predictors) or KPIs, where this now stands for key predictive indicator.
Demand forecasting and planning are examples of predictions that use indicators in order to reach a conclusion. Those indicators may include sales pipeline information about with deals to be closed this month, deals in progress and the number of new leads generated per month. They may also include information about the economy and about exchange rate trends, if goods and services are being supplied in different countries.
How Do You Define Metrics for the Future
The future usually contains more unknowns than the past. Whereas many standard industry models exist for the rear-view or diagnostic KPIs we were discussing before, the prognostic KPI (or KPP) that looks ahead will often need to be customized. However, there are a number of general rules that apply to both rear-view and predictive KPIs:
I. They must be sufficient to cover the critical areas of supply chain operations
a. At the same time, they must not be so numerous that they cause confusion or oversights
II. They should be linked to priority business goals, rather than less meaningful activities
III. They will need to be updated as market and enterprise needs evolve.
IV. They must be based on reliable data
V. They must have clearly defined owners to avoid indicators operating in a vacuum with nobody checking their relevance or taking the action required.
Lets return once again to the Perfect Order KPI example above. Predictive indicators such as those for demand planning or for transport availability and fluidity can be used to take preparatory actions to ensure that indicators such as delivery at the right time and delivery in the right condition stay at 100%. In turn, this helps the overall Perfect Order indicator to stay as high as possible.
It is also worth mentioning that KPIs based on historical data (the rear-view, diagnostic KPIs) may also have predictive capabilities. For instance, average customer satisfaction tells you about what your customers think of you after the different deliveries you have made and other factors from the past. However, the same indicator can also point to likely customer retention rates, new customers acquired through referrals, and thence to changes in S & OP costs and ultimately to future supply chain profitability.
Trend analysis from historical data may also give a glimpse of the future. Looking at past results for KPIs can reveal deeper underlying changes or seasonal effects, both of which can be used to enhance the predictive power of the KPI concerned.
KPIs, Supply Chain Complexity and Compromise
While we continually move towards a better understanding of supply chains and how they work, they remain complex. Just as equations in mathematics with more variables are harder to solve, supply chains that draw on input from multiple departments, suppliers and distributors are harder to model and tune than, say, production line scheduling on its own.
In addition, supply chains are complex enough for certain factors to be in opposition with one another.
The classic example is the duo of customer satisfaction and supply chain costs. An organization can try to push supply chain costs down by carrying less stock and being less reactive to customer demand.
There is then a negative impact on customer satisfaction. If on the other hand customer satisfaction becomes the overriding criterion, costs rise.
Supply chain managers are typically aware of this. KPI pundits on the other hand may insist on having KPIs that do not work against each other, meaning that efforts to improve one KPI do not automatically worsen another.
While in principle this sounds sensible, supply chains remain balancing acts between different goals and priorities. KPIs that work antagonistically against one another are all part of the territory.
The practical solution is to manage so that the KPIs concerned remain at overall optimal levels, with for example enough customer satisfaction and enough profitability. Determining what enough is in each case is done by experience and judgment, trial and error, relevant industry benchmarks, or a mix of these. Predictive KPIs or KPPs then help an enterprise to keep the conventional KPIs at the levels or within the ranges required.
Bettering supply chain performance
Supply chains are not alone in facing the challenges of understanding what has happened or what to do about it. Other functional departments and organizations use business intelligence (BI) techniques, often in the form of software programs, to generate KPIs and to better understand past and future performance. The advantage of such computer-based approaches is that they allow graphical displays to be easily generated in the form of dashboards with performance speedometers or rev counters, and displayed on a PC or Smartphone screen.
The analogy of automobiles is a popular one for describing descriptive, decision and predictive business intelligence accordingly. Descriptive BI or analytics correspond to what a car driver sees when looking in the rear-view mirror at the road behind. We have already referred to KPIs using historical data as rear-view KPIs in the same way. Decision BI or decision analytics inform the driver about immediate actions to be taken (turn left, brake, speed up, etc.). Predictive BI is then similar to the GPS that the driver uses to see where the road is going afterwards, future traffic conditions, and so on.
In the same way that supply chains often have much to gain from benchmarking input from other industries, the ways in which business intelligence is being used to create, manage and react to KPIs are also potentially beneficial.
Conclusion
Benchmarking and key performance indicators are already a solid combination used by numerous supply chains to improve management and performance. Broadening horizons by looking at benchmark data from different industries can open up new thought processes and possibilities for an enterprise to steal a supply chain march on its competitors. Now it is also time to bring predictive KPIs or KPPs into the mix.
These predictive KPIs are likely to be more specific to the enterprise concerned than the historical KPIs used so far. On the other hand, looking at how other sectors are using predictive business intelligence is likely to yield additional inspiration for improving supply chain performance too.
