[CITIZENS' Mail - (08-02-2017)
Flag down the rag
On January 19, two Sinhalese newspapers reported a tragic case where a student in Peradeniya University who opposed ragging was assaulted by a group of raggers'. The victim needed admission to hospital and he is said to be the son of a judge. I congratulate the student for his courage and wish him a speedy recovery.
Over the past few decades (since I was a medical student) the despicable practice of ragging has become increasingly depraved and dangerous.
In 2015, a 23-year-old female student at Sabaragamuwa University was mentally traumatised by ragging - she committed suicide. In 2012, a 21-year- old female student fell during a ragging session and suffered a spinal injury. In 2010, my grand-nephew, then a medical student at Peradeniya University, paid dearly for his stance against ragging. The raggers assaulted him, fractured his nose and lacerated his face. He needed surgery and still has scars as a reminder of the ordeal.
In 1995, a nephew of mine, now an architect, and his batchmates had been ragged at the Moratuwa campus for three months. The perpetrators issued orders in rude and foul language. The orders had been to crawl up to the fourth floor almost daily and staying crouched under chairs when lecturers were not around. On the last day, they were barred from urinating for several hours. It was a humiliating and harrowing experience for the victims.
Subsequently, the nephew's younger brother refused to go into any university because of ragging. I am sure there are many other untold stories of humiliation, horror and hurt in our highest seats of learning.
Sadly, after burning midnight oil for years, students in Sri Lanka begin university life not with elation but in fear (of ragging) and their parents are equally apprehensive and anxious. It is incomprehensible that no one has been able to stop this dastardly practice by thugs who consider the universities to be safe havens to give vent to their sadistic urges.
There should be no ragging
whatsoever, in any form or degree and raggers should be barred from universities for life. I hope that
someday every university will be a happy place for every student from day one.

## Title: Combatting wasteful consumption

Combatting wasteful consumption
Extensive and increasing use of fossil fuel across the world for diverse modes of transportation and production of electricity for domestic and industrial purposes is the main factor behind global warming which is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges facing the world today. Though there is a small but powerful lobby against this prognosis, largely backed by fossil fuel interests, the dominant opinion on the issue is almost unequivocal. The latter is reflected in the mainstream global opinion expressed by the adoption of SDG's and the Paris agreement on climate change by the United Nations in 2015 and 2016 respectively.
Yet, what is quite uncertain is the ability of the world community to bring about the social and economic transformation required to arrest the trend towards increased global warming in the next few decades. This is due to increasingly unsustainable consumption patterns across the world, particularly in the developed and fast developing countries.
As is well known, increasing consumption creates the demand for various goods and services, which in turn leads to increasing use of fossil fuel. So, the challenge before us is not only to wean us away from fossil fuel in favour of green energy but also to reduce wasteful consumption of natural resources and diverse goods and services. Our experience shows that these are challenges that are not easy to overcome, particularly because most people do not voluntarily change their consumption patterns. So, in this article, I intend to concentrate on consumption and explore the possibilities for its reduction.
Economic growth
As is well known, economic development everywhere has been accompanied by increasing consumption of goods and services. In fact, economic development became almost synonymous with mass consumption of goods and services. While developed societies became affluent, I.e. abundance of consumer goods, most consumers tended to overconsume resulting in widespread waste of resources. On the other hand, people in less developed countries, often harbouring a sense of relative deprivation, aspired to emulate their developed country counterparts. So, when the developing countries reached a higher level of economic growth, it was almost natural for them to adopt similar consumption patterns.
A clear case in point is the adoption of car culture in the developing world in recent years. As is well known, large cities in many developing countries today are full of motor vehicles resulting in many serious problems including the increasing use of fossil fuel. Similar patterns can be identified in other areas of consumption as well with equally serious adverse consequences.
Both economic development and the spread of modern consumption over the last several decades have been guided by neo-liberal policies adopted by governments as well as global institutions. The key words here have been globalization, privatization and free trade. While national economies have increasingly come under the control of private interests, financial capital has become increasingly mobile and global. National governments have lowered taxes to attract FDI, often contributing to domestic fiscal crises. The resulting reductions in social spending has reduced the quality of public services such as education, health and public transport, encouraging the well to do to rely more and more on privately funded healthcare and private modes of transport.
Increasing use of private transport and other privately funded services, often at the expense of public provision has serious social and environmental implications. As is well known now, people living in large urban centres, particularly in the developing countries like China, India and Brazil are forced to live with serious negative effects of air pollution, slowing down of mobility due to traffic congestion and increasing road accidents. Moreover, the marginalization of public transport in the face of increasing use of motor cars by the affluent has also negatively affected the life chances of low income people who are dependent on public transport.
Environmental and health risks
Mass production and consumption of commodities have become defining features of development almost everywhere in recent years. Production of durable industrial goods such as household appliances and cars has almost become a thing of the past.
The short life span of many industrial goods not only promote the accumulation of industrial waste everywhere and poses unprecedented environmental and health risks, not to mention the mass production and use of disposable stuff ranging from plastic bags to water bottles that continue to contaminate the environment posing a threat to both humans and animals alike. A recent documentary entitled 'Plastic China' produced by a socially and environmentally conscious team in China shows the growing threat of wasteful consumption of almost all sorts of commodities and the increasing threat of accumulating industrial waste everywhere.
Those who are compelled to deal with the hazardous waste such as those employed in the recycling industries run grave risks to their own health and their families. We in Sri Lanka have seen the increasing influx of junk motor vehicles and parts into the country and the possible dangers it poses to our water ways. On the other hand, plastic bags and bottles have become a real menace, clogging water ways and polluting the environment in densely populated areas and public spaces. All well-meaning pronouncements and efforts on the part of the authorities in recent years have had little or no effect in containing the problem. We need researchers to undertake some serious research on this and related issues.
Low income population
Wasteful consumption is not confined to industrial products. As the President of the country also noted several weeks back, a considerable part of our available food is also wasted. While a significant section of the low income population shows clear signs of malnutrition, the greed of many affluent people results in obesity, besides artificially jacking up the price of rice, vegetables and fruits the poor badly needs to feed their families.
Wasteful consumption and related problems in the world are intricately connected to persisting imbalances in the global economy. Emerging global consensus on sustainable development no doubt provides a sound basis for bringing about the necessary economic and social transformation on both national and global levels. But the rising economic and other nationalisms in many parts of the world, particularly in the United States threaten to undermine this laudable global initiative that many countries have embraced.
It is in the interest of everybody, in particular the marginalized and the vulnerable to translate the accumulated wisdom and experience of many societies into concrete action by way of policies and interventions and ensure that the goals of sustainable development are achieved over the next decade or so. This is what we owe to the younger generations and those who yet to be born everywhere.

Consortium to invest Rs.130 million in Golden Care Residence for elderly
An Australian consortium with two Sri Lankan directors has invested Rs.130 million to build Golden Care Residence, to provide elderly care facilities and accommodation for Sri Lankans.
Currently theres a large population of Sri Lankans living and working overseas and not able to take care of their parents who live in Sri Lanka. Also the locals who are working full time are unable to provide care for their parents due to their hectic lifestyle and we are looking at targeting this segment, Golden Care Residence Director Chaminda Sunnadeniya said.
Our areas of expertise include aged care accommodation, aged care planning, general aged care services, dementia housing and respite care support.
The investment is being made by three directors (one Sri Lankan and two dual citizens in Australia and Sri Lanka.We have purchased an 85 acre land in Kaduwela to build a 25 room retirement village with parks and recreation centers and more, Company Director Bentley Barsenbach said. He said they will first open the Kaduwela Golden Care Residences in June and plan to open ten more centers elsewhere and will invest over Rs one billion for it.
Due to smaller groups in each homes our residents will be able to get personalised care and a 24/7 CCTV monitoring system will be available. Each resident will be provided with a device to communicate with their loved ones via Skype, Facebook and Viber.Doctors will be visiting the residence monthly for health checkups and clients will be registered with the Hemas hospital for ambulance and other services.

Du Plessis' 185 makes it 4-0 for SA

A Sri Lankan line-up that was dismissed for under 190 in the first three ODIs and had not topped 300 in any format on the current tour of South Africa made a fist of chasing a record total at Newlands, but eventually fell 40 runs short. South Africa's batsmen filled the boots by posting thehighest total at the ground, overtaking the 354 for 3 they put on against Kenya in 2001. It proved enough to extend their winning streak at home to 13 matches and put them one win away from the No.1 ODI rankings.
Quinton de Kock scored his first fifty of the series, AB de Villiers his 50th ODI fifty, butFaf du Plessisstole the show. His second century of the series also made him the holder of thesecond-highest individual score by a South African, surpassing de Kock's unbeaten 178 against Australia in September 2016 and three runs short of Gary Kirsten's 188* against the UAE at the 1996 World Cup.
Sri Lanka's reply started strongly asUpul Tharangaand Niroshan Dickwella plundered 100 runs off the first ten overs. Tharanga went on to score the first century by a Sri Lankan batsman on this trip but was dismissed in the 30th over. It left Sri Lanka with a tough task of having to sustain momentum.
Sandun Weerakkody, playing in just his second ODI, ensured that by bringing up a maiden half-century to keep Sri Lanka within range, and even put them ahead of South Africa at times. After 45 overs, Sri Lanka were 317 for 7. In comparison, South Africa had only reached 317 at the end of 46 overs. But as is so often the case for South Africa, Imran Tahir came up with crucial incisions.
He took two wickets in his final over - trapping Nuwan Kulasekara lbw and having Weerakkody caught at backward point - to leave Sri Lanka needing 51 off the last four overs with just one wicket standing. They didn't get there, but neither have 22 other chasing teams in day-night matches at Newlands. Sri Lanka, however, put on the most runs among all sides that have attempted to chase down totals.
South Africa knew the advantages that could be gained from setting a target and chose to do that on a flat deck. Hashim Amla was dismissed early but that only gave du Plessis enough time to settle in and build an innings. He shared a century stand with de Kock by the time Sri Lanka could have their first drink. De Kock brought up fifty off 40 balls and was threatening more but added five more before he edged Sachith Pathirana to Tharanga at slip.
If Sri Lanka thought that would slow South Africa down, they were wrong. De Kock and du Plessis had motored on at a rate of 6.89; de Villiers picked up exactly where they left off and put on 137 runs with du Plessis at 6.90. Their contributions were almost mirror images of each other - du Plessis scored 70 runs in their stand; de Villiers 64. Du Plessis' fifty came off 46 balls with a drive off a half-volley. De Villiers reached his fifty off 51 balls, the delivery before du Plessis dug out a Kumara yorker to get to a hundred. De Villiers only added another 14 runs before being bowled around his legs; du Plessis did not give them any such let-off.
As his innings went on, he batted more aggressively. His first fifty came off 46 balls, his second off 43 and his third off 40 as he brought out everything from a straight drive back over the bowler's head to a scoop over fine leg, once in the same over.
Farhaan Behardien was not simply a passive observer. He scored almost half the runs (31) in a 74-run stand but was happy to hand strike back to du Plessis as he went in search of the record. Du Plessis wanted it and hit Nuwan Kulasekara for six in the penultimate over to overtake de Kock and then tried to repeat the feat with four balls to go. Du Plessis did not get enough power behind his shot and long-on took the catch to end his quest. For Sri Lanka, though, the damage seemed done.
Their batting throughout this trip has left much to be desired but with nothing to lose, they came out blazing. Tharanga and Dickwella, who had already scored two half-centuries on this tour, enjoyed the batting conditions as much as South Africa had. Wayne Parnell and Dwaine Pretorius opened the bowling, JP Duminy was given the ball when it was three overs old, Imran Tahir was called on in the powerplay and Tabraiz Shamsi was not used until the 14th over. By then, Sri Lanka had made their intent clear.
Pretorius made the first breakthrough in his second spell, when he had started to use the short ball more. Dickwella played early to a delivery that got big on him and he top-edged to Behardien at deep square leg to end a 139-run opening stand. Like du Plessis, Tharanga continued almost completely unaffected by a dismissal and brought up a 73-ball hundred.
At the halfway stage, Sri Lanka had scored more runs they had in this series so far - when their best performance was 186 - and had brought the required run-rate down to just under seven an over. Much rested on Tharanga though, especially when Kusal Mendis walked across his stumps and gloved a Parnell delivery to de Kock. Tharanga only managed two more shots in anger before he steered Parnell to backward point and Sri Lanka's challenge looked over.
But there was some depth to the Sri Lankan effort and it came in the form of Weerakkody. He started slowly and lost Dhananjaya de Silva to an lbw, but put on a 79-run fifth-wicket stand with Asela Gunaratne, the intent against Shamsi and Pretorius' short ball was noticeable. He brought up fifty off 46 balls to keep them alive. But Tahir had other plans to give South Africa an opportunity of inflicting a series whitewash.

Du Plessis dazzles as South Africa post 367-5
CAPE TOWN Faf du Plessis hit his second century of the series as Sri Lankas struggling cricketers found themselves on the end of another battering in the fourth one-day international against South Africa at Newlands on Tuesday.
Du Plessis hit a career-best 185, only three short of the South African record, as South Africa piled up 367 for five.
Du Plessis made his runs off 141 balls and hit 16 fours and three sixes. He was caught at long-on off the first ball of the last over trying to clear the boundary with a hit which would have taken him past Gary Kirstens long-standing South African best of 188 not out, made against the United Arab Emirates in Rawalpindi during the 1996 World Cup.
Du Plessis shared century partnerships with Quinton de Kock (55) and captain AB de Villiers (64).
Sri Lankan hopes flickered briefly when Hashim Amla was caught at first slip off Lahiru Kumara for one and South Africa were able to score only four runs in the first three overs.

Economy responding to stabilisation measures
Headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumers Price Index (CCPI), has increased to 5.5 per cent in January 2017 from 4.5 per cent in December 2016, the Central Bank said yesterday.
Core inflation, based on CCPI, also accelerated to 7.0 per cent in January 2017 from 5.8 per cent in December 2016. Headline inflation and core inflation, based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), which is available with a time lag, also reflected an upward trend in December 2016, recording 4.2 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis, the CBSL said in its review for January.
In spite of the increase in inflation in recent times, which is mainly attributed to the impact of tax adjustments and the adverse weather conditions, inflation is projected to remain in mid-single digit levels, on average during the year supported by appropriate supply side and demand management policies.
Meanwhile, the year-on-year growth of credit extended to the private sector by commercial banks remained high at 21.9 per cent by end 2016.
In the external sector, the cumulative deficit in the trade balance expanded further to US dollars 8.2 billion during the first eleven months of 2016 from US dollars 7.6 billion during the corresponding period in 2015, as a result of increased import expenditure, amidst the contraction in export earnings. Earnings from tourism and workers remittances continued to dampen the adverse impact of the trade deficit on the overall balance of payments.
Earnings from tourism were estimated to have increased by 14.0 per cent to around US dollars 3.4 billion during 2016, while workers remittances increased by 3.7 per cent to US dollars 7.2 billion during the year. The realisation of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows was below expectations in the first nine months of the year, while there were some outflows of foreign investments from the rupee denominated government securities market.
The Monetary Board is of the view that the economy is gradually responding to the stabilisation measures adopted by the Central Bank and the government since late 2015. However, close monitoring of macroeconomic developments is necessary in the period ahead, with a view to adopting further corrective measures, if required.

Insurance scheme for schoolchildren started by this govt: Ravindra
An insurance scheme for schoolchildren was started only by this government, Labour and Trade Union Relations State Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
Every schoolchild has an insurance cover for Rs. 200,000 which can be used to obtain medical treatment, the minister said.
The minister was addressing the gathering after distributing Rs. one million worth school equipment among children in Welimada recently.
Samaraweera said the government made certain changes during the past two years and arrangements will be made to repay loans taken to build the Hambantota harbour by commencing a joint venture with a Chinese company.
"No land will be sold as stated by some parties. The JVP is stating that the Hambantota harbour is to be sold. The JVP is saying so as they are scared of losing their power to the Front Line Socialist Party," he added.

Internet a positive tool if used responsibly: -NCPA chief
The Internet could be a positive tool for children if used responsibly, National Child Protection Agency (NCPA) Chairperson Natasha Balendra said.
She said it has a lot of potential to negatively impact children.
The Internet can be harmful to children as instances of sexual exploitation and cyber bullying are increasing. We need to teach children life skills, problem solving, sexuality education, and how to form good relationships in order to protect them online, she said.
Balendra was speaking at Safer Internet Day 2017 organised by ICDL Sri Lanka held at the BMICH yesterday under the theme 'Be the change: Unite for a better internet.'
Students, heads of schools, government and private education and training institutions, and many governmental organisations from the ICT industry attended the event.
ICDL Sri Lanka Managing Director Harsha Alles said it is important to have children learn about and how to use the internet.
The idea that children are digital natives is a dangerous fallacy. Unless we train children in ICT and computer science, many businesses will not have enough skilled labour. As it stands, many children do not know enough about workplace ICT, he said.
Sri Lanka CERT/CC Chairperson Chief Guest Dr. Ajith Madurapperuma cautioned that the internet has caused most people to knowingly or unknowingly give up their privacy.
He said to combat this, educators and parents must teach children how to use the Internet and not just assume they will behave properly on the web. We must teach children how to be safe on the Internet. We want to give children the guidance to use computers properly, Dr. Madurapperuma said.

Israel mulls direct air links with Colombo
Sri Lanka and Israel are looking at establishing direct air links between the two countries and firstly exploring the possibility of arranging charter operations commencing next summer.
This is subsequent to a discussion Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga and Sri Lankan Embassy officials had with leading tour operators in Tel Aviv, while attending the 23rd annual International Mediterranean Tourism Market (IMTM 2017) at the Tel Aviv Convention Centre.
Representatives of 40 countries and regions are participating at the exhibition this year with an anticipated attendance of over 20,000 visitors. Following the positive outcome of the meeting it was decided to follow up with operational level meetings in the near future.
Renewed efforts are being made to position Sri Lanka as an attractive destination for the outbound Middle East tourism market. The star performer for Sri Lanka in the Middle East market last year was Israel which grew by an impressive 33.4% year on year in a scenario where overall growth from the region was 6.5%.In order to achieve our targets we need to aggressively market Sri Lanka at the appropriate fora so as to secure our share of the international tourism pie. The Middle East is a lucrative market that needs to be carefully nurtured. With the travel issues in Europe and US this is our opportunity to woo the Middle East, Minister Amaratunga said.
In order to consolidate this growth trend Sri Lanka Tourism is paying special attention to the Israeli outbound market which is estimated at 16 million travellers, double the countrys population, which denotes the fact that its citizens undertake multiple foreign trips during the course of a year.

Lyon, OKeefe turn to spin greats for India help
Sydney: Nathan Lyon and Steve OKeefe have sought help from two of Test crickets greatest off-spinners ahead of Australias series in India later this month.
The front-line pair approached New Zealands Daniel Vettori and Australias chief destroyer in Sri Lanka last year, Rangana Herath, for advice ahead of the four-Test tour, which starts on February 23 in Pune. Between them, left-arm spinners Vettori and Herath have captured more than 700 Test wickets and boast outstanding performances in Asia.
The main things you get away from those guys is challenging the batters defence, OKeefe told Cricket Australias website Tuesday from the teams pre-tour training camp in Dubai.
And if you can continually put the ball in the right area, given these conditions will spin more than what were used to at home, that will help us.
Its about building pressure and not being overawed. he added.
(India) are a class team, theyre exceptional batters at home and its going to be a big job.
Following last months Sydney Test win against Pakistan, OKeefe worked with former England international and fellow left-armer Monty Panesar at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane. AFP

Malaysias Lee left fuming over knee injury
Kuala Lumpur: World number one Lee Chong Wei was left fuming after an injury at Malaysias new training centre cost him what may have been his last shot at the All England Championship, reports said Tuesday.
The 34-year-old, who was gunning for his fourth title at the prestigious tournament next month, will be out for weeks after he slipped and fell at the new Academy Badminton Malaysia on Saturday.
Lee, who has signalled he may retire this year, tore a medial collateral ligament in his left knee in the incident, the Star newspaper said Tuesday.
This injury could have been avoided, Lee was reported as saying.
Lee, a silver medallist in the last three Olympics, said he had complained about the new centres slippery court mats but nothing was done.
The Malaysia team only moved to their new national training centre in the Bukit Kiara suburb of Kuala Lumpur a week ago.
My first thought was I didnt want to end my career like this, Lee said.
Lee had said last month that he hoped to win the 2017 BWF World Championships in Scotland in August before retiring.
He was so fired up to train after the Lunar New Year celebrations, said national coach Hendrawan.
I sympathise with him because he has not played for some time and has been preparing well and this had to happen. AFP

Man in robes arrested for sexually abusing boy
A man in robes was arrested by the Anuradhapura Police Emergency Unit for allegedly sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy given to a temple in the 5th Canal area at Sravastipura by the boys parents for ordination.
This follows information provided by the vihara dayaka sabha members who agitated after knowing the offence.
Police said the man was under the influence of liquor at the time of arrest, and he was produced before the Anuradhapura hospital JMO who confirmed following a breathalyzer test that the man was drunk.
The investigations revealed the man had two child abuse cases pending against him in the Anuradhapura Magistrates Court.
Police said the mans sexual habit came to light when the boy had visited a residence of a dayaka sabha member to work to earn bus fare to return home.
Thereafter, the boy had said he could not withstand the sexual harassment meted out by the man and wanted to get back to his parents.

Mathews, Stokes top draws at IPL auction
England allrounders Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes and their limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan are among the seven players who have listed themselves at the highest base price of INR 2 crore (approx US $298,000) for the IPL player auction scheduled in Bangalore on February 20. India seamer Ishant Sharma, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, and the Australian fast bowlers Mitchell Johnson and Pat Cummins are the rest of the players in this set.
Ben Stokes  
A total of 799 players were part of the initial roster which would be pruned once the franchises submit their choices before the deadline this weekend. There were 160 capped players from eight countries - leaving out Bangladesh and Pakistan - and 639 from India, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and West Indies. Of the 24 capped Indian cricketers, everyone barring Ishant has listed their base price at INR 30 lakh.
Considering they will have to put a majority of their players back into the auction in 2018, some franchise officials said they would not be too aggressive in buying players this season. However, they did agree that there would be considerable interest in the English players.
Although the IPL is yet to decide on the retention rules, franchises expect the right-to-match option to be available. This allows franchises to buy back a specific number of the players they have released for the auction, by matching the highest bid those players attract; if they match the bid they win the player.
With the impressive all-round skills he showed during England's recent tour of India, Stokes tops the list of marquee players that several franchises have said they would like to have.
After Andrew Strauss took over as the ECB director of cricket last year, he has allowed England players the freedom to play in domestic T20 leagues like the IPL to gain wider exposure. Morgan, who has played for three different teams, Jos Butler (Mumbai Indians), Sam Billings (Delhi Daredevils), Chris Jordan (Royal Challengers Bangalore) have all commented on the positive influence of playing the IPL.

MIA takes over Londons Meltdown Festival

One of pop's true originals, MIA, has been handed the keys to this year's Meltdown festival in London.
The musician said she would "bring together music's best forward thinkers" for the week-long event.
Although the programme is yet to be announced, it is bound to combine her revolutionary politics with a restless passion for new music.
Created in 1993,Meltdownis curated by a different cultural figure every year, from David Bowie to Yoko Ono.
MIA said she intended to showcase "different types of music which have inspired each other to exist" at London's South Bank Centre.
The singer, whose biggest hits is the Clash-sampling Paper Planes, is known for pitting hip-hop beats against world music.
Her lyrics address oppressed peoples around the world, including Tamils, Palestinians, and African-Americans.
Often outrageous, always outspoken, her songs and videos have angered the US government, Super Bowl fans, and an entire French football team.
Here are five times she stood up to the status quo.
Challenging Saudi Arabia over women's rights
The video for Bad Girls finds MIA perched atop a car as it races through the Moroccan desert on two wheels.
It was inspired by YouTube videos of "drifting culture" - a Saudi phenomenon, where daredevil drivers nonchalantly sip tea or smoke hookahs while their vehicle is tipped up on the passenger-side tires.
By putting herself in the driving seat, MIA was openly supporting the "Women to drive" movement in Saudi Arabia, which is (still) seeking to allow females the right to drive in public.
Accusing the super bowl of exploiting girls
When MIA appeared as Madonna's guest at the 2012 Super Bowl, she was instructed to censor a lyric during the song Give Me All Your Luvin'. She responded by raising her middle finger to the camera - and America went apoplectic.
"I literally had to make out of there like a diamond robber," she told the BBC of the aftermath. "There was so much press. I was like, 'I can't believe this, it's insane.'"
The National Football League attempted to sue her for $16 million, saying the singer broke a pre-show agreement to maintain its "reputation for wholesomeness".
MIA responded with a feisty YouTube statement, protesting that at "the precise moment in question" you could see 15 dancers behind her, all of them under 16.
"They're all wearing cheerleader outfits, hips thrusted in the air, legs wide open, in this very sexually provocative position," she said. "Is my finger offensive, or is the underage black girl with her legs wide open more offensive to the family audience"
The dispute was eventually settled in private.
As recently as last year, the star courted controversy by appearing to criticise the Black Lives Matter movement.
Asked about the upsurge in politically-motivated music by London's Evening Standard, she said: "It's interesting that in America the problem you're allowed to talk about is Black Lives Matter. It's not a new thing to me - it's what Lauryn Hill was saying in the 1990s, or Public Enemy in the 1980s.
"Is Beyonce or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter Or Syrian Lives Matter Or this kid in Pakistan matters That's a more interesting question.
"And you cannot ask it on a song that's on Apple, you cannot ask it on an American TV programme, you cannot create that tag on Twitter, Michelle Obama is not going to hump you back."
The quotes were characterised as an attack on Black Lives Matter - an accusation the star angrily denied. Nonetheless, the controversy led to her being dropped as the headliner of the Afropunk Festival in London.

Highlighting the the plight of refugees
As a former refugee, who escaped the violent civil war in Sri Lanka to come to London as a child, MIA has written about the refugee experience since her first album, 12 years ago.
But the self-directed video forBorders was her boldest statement to date, featuring boatloads of refugees, and people desperately climbing barbed wire fences in an attempt to flee tyranny.
She said it was inspired by an aerial photograph of "1,000 people in one boat" printed by Time Magazine, which pressed home the urgency of the topic.
"We're at some sort of turning point," she said. "Society was gearing up to become more closed off than it has been."
Bizarrely, the biggest protest against the video came from the Paris Saint-Germain football team, who objected to MIA wearing a bootlegged version of the club's shirt (it read "fly pirates" rather than "fly Emirates").
An exasperated MIA said the team had missed the "bigger picture and the bigger message".
"It's gone over their head."
Predicting Wikileaks
MIA's fourth album opened with a track called The Message - riffing on the spiritual song Dem Bones, with a lyric about government surveillance.
"Headbone connects to the headphones / Headphones connect to the iPhone / iPhone connected to the internet / Connected to the Google / Connected to the government."
Back in 2010, critics derided the song as naive - but three years later, Edward Snowden leaked details of a massive global surveillance programme by the US National Security Agency.
MIA responded by posting a collage of those negative reviews on Tumblr, asking "Who said this three years ago"
Her actions earned the praise of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who later helped her write lyrics on her fourth album, Matangi.

Mixing priorities
Measures are underway for a change in the police uniform, to bring the sartorial aspect of the police personnel in line with contemporary times, it was reported. The last change made to the police uniform was way back in 1974, followed by several additions to the standard Khaki uniform adopted at the beginning of the century. IGP Pujitha Jayasundera has granted approval to conduct the survey on whether the police uniform should be changed to improve the service of the Sri Lanka Police. The survey will focus on public opinion on changing the police uniform, identification of the uniform colour with the responsibilities of the police officers, effects of the change on the civil society and on the change of attitude of the public towards the police based on the changed uniform, according a news item we carried in Monday's edition.
Of course, the mandatory uniform of staff in certain state sector institutions have been subject to change after a period. Most of these take place with the change in governments. The national carrier is one example where the green hued peacock sari of the air hostesses turned blue with end of the UNP regime. The change in the hue of the Air hostesses uniforms did not see a turnaround in the financial fortunes of the national carrier. The government is today battling to bail out the debt ridden entity.
Similarly, it is hoped, the change in the current Khaki uniform would not be a change for the sake of change exercise but a well thought out one. We say this because re-uniforming some 85,000 police personnel countrywide is going to be a costly exercise which would also raise the question if the government has got its priorities right. Besides, the public are quite accustomed to the current Khaki uniform of the police which still inspires awe and respect among most, although some gentlemen in Khaki had brought disrepute and dishonour to the police uniform. Hence the stature and symbolism of the Khaki uniform should be kept intact. Any changes to this ubiquitous symbol of authority will not have the desired impact immediately and it would take a long time, if at all, for the public to get accustomed to any change contemplated.
Be that as it may, what the IGP should strive for is a macro transformation and measures to raise the image of his service as a whole. Needless to say this cannot be achieved by a mere change of hue in the police uniform. The Police service, while in recent times earning for itself laurels for many important arrests and detections have still not exactly endeared itself to the public. A Minister in the Rajapaksa government placed the police as the second most corrupt state institution and many would not have entirely disagreed with this view.
While the IGP is striving his utmost to clean up the service and make it acceptable to the public there are still obstacles confronted by him in his endeavours. Corruption has become so endemic in the police service, the IGP's no doubt will be an uphill task to reform and transform the ways and attitudes of his men. To begin with, the the policemen, especially the patrolmen, and others in the lower ranks are a poorly paid lot and cannot be kept out of temptation's way. This is mostly seen in the case of the Traffic Police who are notoriously on the take. Hence, the recent decision by the government to increase the salaries of the lower grades in the police service by 40% is a move in the right direction though it is moot if this alone will make a change.
Police brutality, though rarely heard these days, is not exactly a thing of the past. The war mindset cannot be erased in the case of most policemen even today, a full eight years after the war. These men were recruited sans any screening, to augment manpower, and old habits, as they say, die hard. This propensity to violence we see today is, no doubt, a carryover from the war days and should be put right if the police service is to be turned into an essentially civil enforcement body.
The IGP also should strive to ensure the dignity of the Khaki uniform is not belittled. Today it is common to see policemen getting into arguments with protestors and are sometimes at the receiving end of verbal abuse. He should not allow a similar fate to that which befell the police personnel guarding the UN compound in Colombo during a demonstration led by Wimal Weerawansa to re-visit his men.
In that episode, following a telephone call by the then Defence Secretary to the officer in charge to clear his men, supporters of the politician went about humiliating and making play at the police on duty, tugging them from their uniforms, with one officer even having his hat removed by the mob. Protecting the dignity of the Khaki uniform would be much more feasible than any change effected to this symbol of authority.

NDB Wealth focuses on financial independence
Having marked Sri Lanka's Independence Day, it's time to start preparing for your own financial independence. Meaning different things to different people, financial independence can, for example, result in being debt free or even having a sufficient amount set aside to meet any emergency. Another way to look at it, make your assets effectively work for you, by consistently continuing to generate an income in excess of your expenses.
The need for financial independence is much greater during periods of global or local uncertainty. Today, many who can see retirement fast approaching do not have a proper plan so they can meet it with adequate peace of mind. NDB Wealth's Financial Advisor Christina Wesley said nine out of 10 people are worried about how long their savings will last once they retire, with a further eight, out of 10, concerned that they will never accrue enough to fully give up work once they reach retirement age.
Wesley also revealed that there are two important elements to securing financial independence: increasing your assets, and reducing your expenses. While a simple lifestyle will help you manage your expenses, accumulating assets requires knowledge and foresight. Further, accounting for complexities such as taxes, pensions, etc. make the whole process even more complicated, requiring expert advice to navigate the numerous potential pitfalls of any decision you make.
Many have intimated to us that they need to take control of their finances to feel more secure about their future. The Financial Advisors at NDB Wealth are trained to listen to your worries and come up with plans that will take care of your specific concerns. Being smart about your money from the start can also mean being able to retire early, if you want,Wesley said.
NDB Wealth additionally provides a number of very simple, introductory plans that help you easily take on the responsibility of building wealth. NDB Wealth allows you to maximise your savings and income beyond the limitations of traditional banking, by initiating clients into high performance instruments such as money market funds. Plans such as Retirement Savings and Retirement Income, both offered by NDB Wealth, can provide avenues to improve your long term financial independence.
Regular, yet manageable, amounts of savings deployed in a smart way can help build significant quantity of wealth in the future. But you need to start planning and saving for your retirement today itself, added Wesley.

In addition there are trained groups of radiographers and nurses working in the unit on a 24/7 basis said Dr. Lakmalie Paranahewa. This is the first dedicated Biplaner Neuro Cath Lab in Sri Lanka where we have done a large number of neuro interventions with very successful results, she added.
Today, neurointervention is recognised as a minimally invasive approach to repair brain vascular diseases, resulting in a shorter recovery time for the patients, ensuing less side effects with patients benefitting immensely from the faster recovery period. Moreover, as it is not open surgery and only a puncture in the groin, and patients can return to their normal routine within a very short period.
Especially in the treatment of aneurysm afflicted patients, the results of the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), after studying a large number of patients, most of them favoured the endovascular procedures of coiling over the open surgical treatment of clipping. The Coiling procedure in treating aneurysms is where platinum coils are placed in the aneurysm preventing the blood from entering it.
Elaborating further, Dr. Nihal Wijewardena said, An aneurysm is a ballooning out of a vessel that can rupture. It is very serious and once diagnosed must be treated urgently. Cholesterol, hypertension, heart disease and possible congenital conditions could cause this condition, Dr. Paranahewa added.
The unit also treats patients diagnosed with AVMs (arteriovenous malformation), which is group of abnormal blood vessels connecting arteries and veins which when ruptured cause bleeding in the brain. According to Dr. Paranahewa, this difficult condition too can be treated very successfully with endovascular procedure with less complications in comparison to surgery. We have done so many cases with very good results.
At Asiri Centrals Interventional Radiology Unit, patients with certain vascular diseases in the spine also receive treatment through endovascular procedures with great success. Dr. Wijewardena added, We have had many patients who have been bedridden due to spinal vascular malformation who have recovered and are leading normal lives after the procedures.
As an organization that has already taken the first step in delivering best practice interventional care, the Unit has progressed towards high-quality care for stroke patients through its Acute Stroke Management Unit, another first for the country. The Stroke Management Unit is in par with international healthcare standards.
Emphasizing the importance in quickly identifying a stroke through the FAST method (face drooping; arm weakness; speech difficulty and criticality of time) ensures getting patients immediate care enabling better stroke management.
This kind of dedicated Stroke Unit is only available at Asiri Central. We have a dedicated stroke physician, and the ideal setup where everything is on hand at any given time for optimum treatment of a stroke patient. We are also the only hospital to perform clot retrieval where for an acute stroke it involves the mechanical removal of a blood clot from a patient's brain, Dr. Paranahewa said.
A stroke is no longer an old-aged disease, there has to be renewed public awareness that just administering the drug is insufficient. Treatment of clot retrieval should be carried out immediately, Dr. Wijewardena emphasized.
The Unit also performs a variety of peripheral vascular hepatobiliary and genitourinary interventions.
Especially in treating primary liver tumours that cannot be removed surgically, through intervention the chemotherapeutic agent is injected right into the tumor. In the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal bleeding, interventional treatments in the form of embolization is also performed by the Unit.

Ranjan and Anuruddha lock horns over sand mining in Divulapitiya
Pandemonium ruled in Parliament yesterday when Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Gampaha District Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Indika Anuruddha locked their horns over sand mining in Divulapitiya and a letter issued allegedly by the Deputy Minister.
The tense situation erupted when Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake rose to answer an oral question raised by MP Anuruddha with regard to a sand mining issue in Divulapitiya. The question had been directed to the Land Minister. The Deputy Minister began to answer by speaking of destruction in Divulapitiya by way of sand mining.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya directed Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake to answer the question observing that Deputy Minister Ramanayake would be given time to make a statement on his issue.
However, things got worse when Indika Anuruddha tabled a letter issued allegedly by Deputy Minister Ramanayake that requested to grant permission to run a business of metal quarry to his supporters to provide granite needed for the Colombo Port City project. Anurudda said Ramanayake had asked permission through a letter for his supporters to run a metal quarry and their names were in the annexed list.
Anurudda urged Ramanayake to make a statement as to whether he had issued such a letter or not.
When Deputy Minister Ramanayake was allowed to make an explanation, he said Anuruddha and his family engaged in ilegal sand mining in Gampaha.
He said Divulapitiya area is subjected to destruction because of ilegal sand mining. Opposition member Ranjith Soyza said Deputy Minister Ramanayake used unparliamentary language. Speaker Jayasuriya said they would be expunged.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake said the country knew that he did not do any such illegal activity. But Anuruddha engaged in illegal activities, he said.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera joined the cross talk and said the document which was tabled by Anuruddha should be sent to the Government Analyst since Ramanayake has denied placing his signature to it.
The Speaker said he read the letter. It was a request letter to Minister Kabir Hashim to allow an access road to a metal quarry and not a request of permission to run a metal quarry, he said.
Responding to the Speaker, MP Anuruddha demanded to read the letter.
"I know the letters. I can read it," The Speaker said. "You cant order the Chair", he said.
The argument arose again for a second time when Opposition Member Padma Udayashantha Gunasekera during his supplementary questions asked Social Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake of the government's stance on the Divulapitiya issue.
Minister Dissnayake said the question had nothing to do with the original question. He asked MP Gunasekara to learn to raise oral questions in the proper manner. Minister Dissnayake too was heard using unparliamentary language when Gunasekara urged him to answer his question.
Police report on Malabe shooting incident will be presented to Parliament: PM
A police report on the investigations into the shooting incident at Malabe targeting SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senanayake will be presented to Parliament, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was replying to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he would inquire into the progress of the investigations, adding that he would look into the possibility of obtaining the police report within this week itself. We are still unaware as to what led to the shooting incident, he said.
MP Dissanayake urged the Prime Minister to produce a comprehensive report on the incident to Parliament, observing that various interpretations over the incident could further confuse the issue.
Meanwhile, a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena over the court ruling on the medical degree holders of the SAITM and students protests against it, led to a heated argument between the government and Opposition members.
MP Gunawardena questioned as to why the government resorted to fire tear gas and water cannons at the university students who were peacefully demonstrating against the SAITM.
He demanded the government to release IUSF Convenor Lahiru Weerasekara and other students who were arrested during the protests.
Higher Education Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella replying to these concerns said Parliament could not reverse an order given by the court. Whether we like it or not, we are bound to accept it. You cannot change the ruling by getting the students onto streets to protest. If you do not agree with the ruling, you can appeal against it.
The students were arrested because they violated a court order during their protests, he said.
Kiriella, reminding that the former government led by Mahinda Rajapaksa was responsible for the inception of the SAITM issue, stated that Prof. Carlo Fonseka was appointed the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) during the previous regime because he was willing to give his consent to the SAITM. The former government facilitated Rs. 600 million to build that hospital, he said.
However, UPFA MP Dr. Ramesh Pathirana contradicted the Ministers statement and said Prof. Carlo Fonseka never gave his consent to the SAITM. UPFA member Bandula Gunawardena said the former government didn't offer Rs. 600 million to the SAITM, but it was a loan obtained from the Peoples Bank.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa said the SAITM issue had been aggravated because the graduates passing out from medical faculties of state universities and those passing out from the SAITM were given the same recognition.
If you make Act 16 (Examination for Registration to Practice Medicine in Sri Lanka) compulsory for SAITM students, you can resolve the problem to some extent, he said.
MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake commenting on the court case on the SAITM issue said both the plaintiff and the respondent of the case were on the same page on the issue, and therefore it was not acceptable.
He said the court had been used for a hypocritical motive at this instance. He said the Health Minister deferred acting against the SAITM because his sons wife was a student in it.
Speaker asks MPs to mind their language
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya making an announcement over live telecast of Parliamentary proceedings requested all Parliamentarians to be mindful of their conduct and language in Parliament and set an example by themselves to the country as otherwise people would lose their faith in parliamentary democracy. He requested them to refrain from slinging mud at each other and not to resort to unparliamentary language during Parliamentary debates.
Since November 21, 2016, live telecast of parliamentary sessions started. We have introduced high definition TV technology. Parliamentary sessions are aired live through Channel 91 of Peo TV. With effect from today (7), sessions would be aired in all three languages. People can watch parliament sessions and listen to them in Sinhala, Tamil or English.
Latest developments can help MPs to set an example themselves and behave in parliament in accordance with dignity and decorum of the institution. If MPs continue to sling mud at each other and resort to unparliamentary language, that would result in public losing their trust in the parliamentary system, the Speaker said.
Speaker advises Mustapha to look into alleged financial irregularities of Uva PC
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday advised Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha to look into the alleged financial irregularities of the Uva Provincial Council.
The Speaker made this instruction when allegations of financial misappropriations of the Uva Chief Minister were brought to the attention of Parliament again by UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday.
Minister Mustapha replying to the queries raised by the MPs insisted that he was not empowered to take disciplinary action against the Chief Minister as it was a devolved power as of the 13th Amendment. I have limited power and I cannot interfere into the work of provincial councils, he said. However, the Speaker maintained that Mustapha should not shirk his responsibility as the subject minister and should take steps to ascertain whether such financial irregularities had taken place. These are serious allegations.
If the Provincial Council had produced false information, you can ask the Governor to take action against that, he told the minister. UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri said the Uva Chief Minister had allegedly misappropriated Rs. 5.1 million in guise of a programme to distribute school bags to students. MP Anura Dissanayake said the public officials of the Uva Provincial Council had been subjected to harassment for exposing the shady deals in the council.
MR had spent Rs. 90.25 m on advisers and other officers
National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera yesterday revealed that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had spent Rs. 90.25 million as salaries to 196 advisers and other officers during his tenure.
He made this revelation in Parliament while responding to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila on the advisors to President Maithripala Sirisena. According to the answer by State Minister, D. M. Jayaratne, W. J. S. Karunaratne, Wasantha Obeysekara, Gamini Sumanasekara have been appointed as advisors to the President, while there are no personal secretaries and only six coordinating secretaries.
Joint Opposition MP Gammanpila said according to the media, each district has a coordinating secretary to the President. He questioned if it were only a media show.
MP Gammanpila said he cannot accept the answer as there are a large number of advisors, including defeated MPs.
He said appointments of Shantha Bandara and Nishantha Warnasinghe were granted by President himself, but their names are not included in the answer.

Premaya Nam premieres
Premaya Nam, the directorial debut of Vindana and Kalpana Ariyawansa that has made the rounds at several film festivals and with critics, will premiere at the Regal Theatre at 4.15 pm on Friday, February 17.

Vindana and Kalpana Ariyawansha hail from a rather arts-conscious family, having been educated at Ananda College. Kalpana was domiciled in the United States from 1994 and managed to work with Warner Brothers, specialising in digital animation at a time when animated films had reached a peak. Vindana Ariyawansha is also a veteran quizzer, whose personal experiences figure considerably in their debut feature, with the script being authored by both of them.
Premaya Nam features Shyam Fernando (as the protagonist Vishwa, who suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or OCD), Suranga Ranawaka (as Inoka, his empathetic nurse), Samanalee Fonseka (as Samadi, his wife), and Buddhadasa Vithananarachchi (as his father). While details of the plot should not be revealed until it reaches a considerable audience, critics and audiences alike have been rather receptive and appreciative of the films story.

Putting my arms around his shoulders, I leaned and placed a silent kiss on his pale lips. Stepping down, I looked into his eyes: the very eyes which melt my soul and ablaze me are now immersed with serenity. His gaze is set at a faraway horizon, an expedition in quest of the reality of life.
Fate keeps on weaving the cobweb of life that we are tangled in. Unless broken by the ones who are trapped in, the circle continues. Met as strangers, destiny took us to a shore, a shore with no name. Though, struggled to name it, we knew its unyielding. Moments of flames, moments of sensitivity and moments of truth were passed.
I hugged him tight. I could hear his beating heart, going on and on. On his ear I whispered do you still feel me looking away, he said yes.

SAITM has due approval from UGC: Dr. Fernando
The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) has received approval and recognition from the University Grants Commission (UGC) as a degree awarding institution, SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando said. He said the medical faculty of SAITM has been continuing to uphold the standards of medical education.
He was addressing the media along with academic staff of the SAITM medical faculty yesterday.Dr. Fernando said SAITM always continues to uphold the standards of medical education in collaboration with the authorities including the UGC and the Higher Education Ministry to produce doctors of the highest standards.We are certain about the standards of our pass-outs and therefore we urge the authorities to conduct a common general examination for all medical graduates including medical graduates of all nine state medical faculties, graduates of Kotalawala Defence University and graduates of SAITM. Then it will be obvious as to who will perform well. But the Medical Council and the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) are reluctant to have such an examination, Dr. Fernando said. According to him certain politically motivated persons and political parties were trying to gain political power through SAITM leveling various allegations on the quality of SAITM graduates. He urged such elements not to make SAITM a scapegoat for their agendas.Prof. Deepthi Samarage said SAITM was a brainchild of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa since he helped immensely to commence SAITM in 2008. Prof. Samarage said there is no problem whatsoever relating to the quality of the medical graduates of SAITM. However, the GMOA and the Medical Council are continuously leveling various allegations on the quality of SAITM, she said.She asked the Medical Council to guide and point out any shortcomings in SAITM, which they would rectify. SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senaviratne said SAITM was taking measures to obtain medical degree offering status from the UGC a few years ago on the advice of then Chairman of the SLMC Prof. Lalitha Mendis. But that initiative was obstructed by the SLMC itself after the change of the chairmanship of the SLMC.

Selection policies or selection politics
So Sri Lanka has lost another series in South Africa when they conceded a 3-0 lead to the host in the five-match One-Day International series with two to play. The way things are panning out Sri Lanka are in danger of being whitewashed 5-0 an ignominy which they have suffered only once in their entire history - against India in 2014. It would follow their 3-0 drubbing in the Test series.
The current team is in the process of rebuilding and too much criticism cannot be leveled against the players who are trying their best to find their feet on the international stage against a team that is on a role and playing on their own backyard are proving to be unbeatable, except perhaps in the shortest of formats  T20 where Sri Lanka managed to even the odds by winning the series 2-1  a rare feat for them in South Africa.
What is most galling than the losses is the composition of the squad picked and the teams selected for the matches that has also contributed greatly to the defeats apart from the inexperience.
It is clear as daylight that Sri Lanka are woefully short in their batting especially the middle order which has left a gaping hole after the retirements of legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. It is blatantly clear that the squad is short of a specialist batsman. Knowing where the weakness laid the national selection committee picked only six specialist batsmen and included three all-rounders  Asela Gunaratne, Chaturanga de Silva and Sachith Pathirana at nos. 6, 7 and 8. Thereby not only was the composition of the team unbalanced but it severely weakened the batting. So when a specialist batsman was out of form (or injured) there was no proper substitute for him. It is elementary in team selection that you have power hitters occupying these slots with the capability to clear the ground and raise the tempo when needed. The irony is that there are proven players in the caliber of Milinda Siriwardena, Chamara Kapugedera, Thisara Perera and Dasun Chanaka etc who are sadly lamenting on the sidelines.
This is clearly evident from the totals Sri Lanka has come up with so far in the series  181, 186 and 163. On all three occasions they have failed to bat out their quota of 50 overs which is a cardinal sin in one-day cricket. One has only to make a cursory glance at the composition of the South African team where it comprises of specialist batsmen and specialist bowlers with one all-rounder in Chris Morris.
Even the bowling line-up selected also looks pretty lopsided with the team comprising three left-arm spinners with only one having he skill to complete 10 overs, the other two only bowled four overs each. The only leg-spinner in the side Jeffrey Vandersay is dropped after one game in spite of the conditions favouring his style of bowling. It is a known fact that wrist spinners are at their best when there is scoreboard pressure and in the first game they were defending only a paltry 181 runs.
When the conditions in South Africa demands for express bowlers it is unimaginable that players in the caliber of Dushmantha Chameera and Kasun Rajitha who hits the deck are not automatic choices on those wickets. Instead Sri Lanka continues to persist with two fast bowlers conceding at the rate of 7 runs an over with bowling speeds of mid/high 120 kmph. Both these bowlers are going to be in their mid-thirties in when the next World Cup comes around in 2019. It would be more beneficial for the team to groom the young brood of fast bowlers in preparation for the world event. The absence of there being a policy of grooming youngsters for the next World Cup challenge is quite a worrying factor.
A worrying trend in recent selections is where young players are chucked out of the side after just one game. A case in point is the dropping of Sandun Weerakkody after just one game when it was blatantly clear that the squad was short of a specialist batsman. It is being grossly unfair on the part of these youngsters when such decisions are taken. The weakness clearly lies in poor player identification where players are thrown into the deep end hoping they live up to their promise.
A brief analysis of our recent successes would reveal that the future of our cricket lies with the youth. Kusal Mendis and Niroshan Dickwella scored an aggregate of 346 runs in the recently concluded Tri-Series in Zimbabwe which Sri Lanka won beating West Indies in the final. Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva scored an aggregate of 621 runs in the Test series against Australia which Sri Lanka posted their most significant success in Test cricket.
So with such a vast quantity of young talent flourishing the pride of this proud cricketing nation need not be compromised due to unfair and manipulated selection policies to satisfy the whims and fancies of administrators who are only interested in fortifying their power base in the circuit. By doing so they are only abusing the slogan they have come up with One Team One Nation.

Shapovalov fined $7,000 over umpire strike
London: Canadas Denis Shapovalov has been fined for hitting the umpire with the ball during his countrys Davis Cup tie against Great Britain, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) announced on Monday.
Shapovalov, 17, was disqualified after striking chair umpire Arnaud Gabas in the eye with the ball in Ottawa on Sunday, gifting singles opponent Kyle Edmund a victory that gave Britain a 3-2 win.
The ITF fined Shapovalov $7,000 (6,520 euros), rather than the maximum $10,000, after accepting he had not intentionally struck Gabas after smacking a ball off the court in frustration at losing a point.
In a statement published on his Twitter account before the fine was announced, Shapovalov wrote: There is no excuse for this behaviour and I take full responsibility for my action. AFP

Shrine of sacredness
Before the origins of major religions of Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity the primitive people across the Globe believed on superstitions and cult practices sometimes of bizarre nature of human sacrifices which even extended in feasting on the hearts of the sacrificial victims.
For the primitive people the forces of nature created numerous challenges for their survival and in order to overcome these forces they believed that they had to appease the evil forces and the deities.
Natha God, God Kataragama ( Skanda Kumara) who came to Sri Lanka from India and having two wives known as Walli Amma and Tavani, God Upulwan (Vishnu), God Sumana Saman, God Dadimunda, God Siddha Suniyam, God Ganesha, God Iswari, God Mahasena, God Wibisana, God Rawana, Goddess Sarasawathie, Goddess Lakshmi, Goddess Uma, Goddess Pattini and God Devol are the prominent powerful Gods and Goddesses according to the ever increasing number of devotees and shamen in the present day Sri Lanka.
The historical origins of both Goddess Pattini and God Devol are intermingled with mythology and legendary folktales which proved to be timeless and last for ever which is a characteristic of folktales and legends. Mythology is not just a collection of tales but a universal language symbolically conveying a deeper message to humanity. The parentage of Prince Devol had baffled the anthropologists and historians due to the prevalence of numerous versions of folklore and the divergent opinions which had not been properly established.
Prince Devol was believed to be one of the seven sons of a mythical king known as Sri Raman hailed from the Kingdom of Malala in India. Folklore revealed that the king Raman had seven consorts known as Thedapathi, Gunapathi, Amithapathi, Siripathi, Mihipathi, Yasapathi and Agnipathi.
King Ramans seven consorts had given birth to seven sons known as Devol, Hiruras, Sandaras, Agniras, Maharas, Kudaras and Samiras.
Folklore traditions
Prince Devol was also identified as one of the three sons of Queen Thrivakkali of Solirata.
In addition to the prevailing folklore traditions relevant to the parentage of Prince Devol, a king known as Swarna Ramasinghe had also been identified as his father.
Andun Kudumbara, Sandurun Kudumbara, Erdi Kudumbara, Mal Kudumbara, Dala Kudumbara, and Vadige Kudumbara were the six other names given to Prince Devol.
Opinions of scholars widely differ on the existence of Goddess Pattini and God Devol and numerous other interpretations had also been given to the events that unfolded in the long narration of the legend since the day of deportation of Prince Devol and his six other brothers. Some believe the Shrine of Goddess of Pattini was in existence at Seenigama long before the arrival of Prince Vijaya and his retinue of Aryans in SriLanka.
Goddess Pattini was believed to have held sway all over the whole country while residing in Seenigama shrine. The era of her reign had coincided with that of the Lord Buddhas lifetime when the country was inhabited by the prehistoric tribes of Yakka and Naga.
A hymn usually recited during the ritual dances performed in Devol festival comprised of a description of the existence of a shrine consecrated to Goddess Pattini at the ancient Port of Seenigama till the invasion of the abode by the Prince Devol.
In the annual Devol and Pattini ritual celebrations held in the shrines across Sri Lanka the ritual dances are performed for one whole night till the dawn of the following day by a troupe of experienced shamen (kapuralas).
The verse renditions or hymns recited to the tune of the beating of several drums are highly rhythmic and easy to understand due to the colloquial language generally used in composing them.
Magnificently decorated
Prince Devol and his six brothers were in the habit of killing animals and elderly people in the kingdom of their father King Sri Raman. The citizens of the Kingdom Malala made complaints to the king about the terror unleashed by his seven sons led by Prince Devol. In order to resolve the crisis, by his seven sons, the king got seven ships made to deport them out of the kingdom. They set sail in the seven ships which were made out of wood and magnificently decorated and full of silk clothing material.
Some scholars are of the opinion of the existence of a busy trading port at Seenigama. According to prevailing legends, it was believed during the era of Kakusanda Buddha a king known as Swarna Kuduppu Ramasinghe had seven consorts. The seven sons during their previous births had offered a robe to Kakusanda Buddha. As a result of this meritorious act Prince Devol became God Devol.
One of the consorts of King Raman had given birth to a daughter known as  Padmini  who had offered a sweet mango to the Kakusanda Budha to become the Goddess Pattini.
During the course of time Padmini died and was reborn as Goddess Pattini and took refuge in the abode of Seenigama Shrine in Sri Lanka.
Seven brothers of Padmini (Goddess Pattini) had to undergo numerous hardships during their hazardous sea voyage in search of a land to embark and finally all seven wooden ships were wrecked and the victims Prince Devol and his six other brothers were struggling with the powerful waves and ship wrecks posed great dangers to the lives of the seven princes.
When they were drifting in the mid - sea for seven days Prince Devol prayed to God Sakra about their plight. God Sakra intervened and rescued them and created a stone rafter to help them continue their mission.
All the deities reigned in various parts of Sri Lanka reached the consensus not to allow Prince Devol and his retinue to disembark on any of the ancient sea ports of Sri Lanka.
Prince Manawamma prevented disembarking of Prince Devol at Yapa Patuna (Jaffna ), Kandakumara objected their entering Samankula at Panadura, God Upulwan objected Prince Devols entering at Dondra Point. God Dadimunda intervened when Prince Devol tried to enter thecountry from Lanumodara, God Deva Rajjuru objected Prince Devol and his retinue entering from Unawatuna. In addition to these ancient sea ports, Prince Devol had tried to reach ashore from Kosgoda, Beruwala, and Ambalangoda.
Failing all these attempts of reaching ashore, Prince Devol and his six other brothers had tried to disembark at Seenigama where his sister Padmini from a previous birth was residing at the coastal shrine as Goddess Pattini. All the deities including Goddess Pattini conspired in advance against the arrival of Prince Devol at Seenigama.
Goddess Pattini created seven mounds of fire on the beach stretch behind the ancient Shrine of Goddess Pattini which was built on a rocky crop of land now found several metres away in the sea as a result of massive sea erosion taken place as far back as 1921.
Proving the divine powers, Prince Devol and his six brothers crossed over the flames and destroyed the seven mounds of fire. Reminiscing that they were born as brother and sister they reached an amicable settlement. Fire walking in Sri Lanka is believed to have originated at Seenigama and Prince Devol known as Devolsamy was groomed how to conduct rituals by his sister Goddess Pattini.
Permanent abode
Goddess Pattini had handed over the throne to his brother God Devol, ceded her reign and for Nawagamuwa identified by her as her permanent abode where the ancient shrine consecrated to Goddess Pattini is located.
Prince Devol after establishing as God Devol was in the habit of exploring the hinterland in disguise and he settled down at a suburban village known as Weragoda where Devol found his mistress.
Nobody in the village was aware neither Devols magic powers nor his divine connections as he was a total stranger to the area. Even though Devolsamy was unemployed he was in the habit of bringing home rice,sugar, fish, coconut and other essential foodstuff. Devols wife gave birth to a son and when he grew up to be a young boy at Weragoda, one day Devols wife explained to her son about the suspicious behavior of his father. On the instructions of his mother, the boy followed his father Devol and revealed how he collected rice, coconut and other foodstuffs.
He discovered that his father shake wayside coconut trees and plucked coconuts and obtained sea sand which turned to rice. The next day the miracles did not work and he suspected his son for secretly watching his performances of magic and killed his son. Some believe he killed both his wife and the son. The Seenigama shrine consecrated to God Devol has become a sought after shrine by the devotees seeking divine assistance in resolving numerous problems.
Whenever medical treatments found ineffective for sterility failure of legal procedures for examination success obtain promotions and winning elections and numerous other services devotees seek the divine assistance of God Devol. Originally the people sought the assistance of God Devol to take revenge against their enemies. Now it has become a trend of the Politicians of the Opposition to dash coconuts before the shrine of God Devol thinking God Devol would help them to topple the government in power.

Skilled in aesthetic splendour
The complex psychological process which is very much a conscious process is also automatic when it comes to naturally talented singers such as Lakmini Geethanjali Udawatta. It is a combination of signals from the nervous system that help to produce intricate musical notes and interpretive decisions on whether to apply a particular technique in measuring up its comparative and expressive value, all this within seconds. One of the imperative distinctiveness of applying comparative philosophy and vocal creativity is to discriminate one tradition of music, specific styles, and techniques from other traditions of music and their corresponding styles, by not blending them all together.
Lakmini was born in 1981 as the second daughter to unassuming parents in Piliyandala, Kithsiri and Swarnapali Udawatta who were both teachers. At the very tender age of just five, Lakmini had confirmed precisely an excellent wisdom of timing and vocal potential.

Listeners souls
Lakmini was typically acclaimed and cherished for possessing sturdy vocals which were absolutely mesmerizing. It cascades and get etched on listeners hearts hastily. The tones, the rhythm, the muscle, lift up listeners souls to the climax with extravagance. Some years later, it became obvious to the family how acutely she hunted to conquer and triumph the stage. Lakmini was different to her counterparts who resolutely clung on to a microphone while others were apprehensive with other pastimes.
Lakminis teachers were Ananda Weerasiri, Thanuja Priyanthi Bandula, Mano Malawala Arachchi and. B. Victor Perera. The former was her fist teacher in music while the others guided and enhanced her innate vocal potential to the subsequent phase.When Lakmini was just 12 years old , contested in a singing contest organized by The Education Ministry called All Island Singing Competition. In which she sang in a competition for the first time in year 1991, she performed admirably to be crowned the winner.Lakmini had won this crown for 09 consecutive years upto the year 1999..That victory was her first in a sequence of first-place positions in numerous singing competitions organized by various Government and Non Governmental institutions. She remained totally unassuming during her triumphs but accepted all constructive criticisms to heart to perk up her talents.
Incomparable significance
Despite her singing talents Lakmini was also a very meticulous student at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Balika Vidyalaya in Colombo. A superior education was one of the elusive gears that their parents sought to impart to her. This incomparable significance was profoundly instilled in her. During her high school days she was elected as a school prefect and the band leader of Eastern Band. She also excelled in outdoor sports while in school .After high school, education Lakmini continued her musical studies at the University of Delhi obtaining a Bachelor of Arts (Hon) In Hindustani Music in year 2004.

It is pertinent to mention that she is a household name in Dubai as Sinhala music is concerned, Lakmini has lamented that she had hurdled over many obstacles owing to the fact that the medium of education is English in Dubai. She has a large number of students studying in her academy..For festivals like Sinhala New Year, Vesak , Christmas,Worlds childrens Day etc Lakmini invariably organizes musical recitals for audiences of Dubai expatriates.

Balamandalas for them will be established if JO members come to our side or new organisers are appointed, he said.
We will hold district leadership camps after setting up balamandalas island-wide.
SLFPYF Conventions will be held in each district as a final phase of the programme. We set up a balamandala and held a convention in Jaffna for the first time in the history, he said.
The party marches forward with the input of youths and analyzes had been conducted to understand the reasons for the defeat at the last presidential election in to rectify the mistakes, he said
We planned to start a political study center for the SLFP under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena in next month. Our aim is to produce intellectual and skilled politicians who have a good knowledge of local and global political and economic trends, and the history and the policies of the party. We request youths with progressive ideas to join us, he said.

Sri Lanka dedicated to promoting relations with China: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said Sri Lanka is firmly dedicated to promoting its relations with China and that he believed on the basis of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, the Belt and Road Initiative will open up a new era for Sri Lanka-China cooperation. He said since the two countries established diplomatic relations 60 years ago, their ties have gained constant and sound development, which were later upgraded to a strategic partnership.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Sirisena on Tuesday exchanged congratulatory messages to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Sri Lanka.
Xi said he appreciates Sri Lanka for its active participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. I am willing to work with you to consolidate political mutual trust, expand mutually beneficial cooperation and deepen people-to-people friendship between the two countries, so as to inject new vigor and vitality into the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership featuring sincere mutual assistance and enduring friendship.

Sri Lanka foreign minister to visit Saudi Arabia

Sri Lankan Ambassador Azmi Thassim on Saturday said he was making extensive arrangements for the forthcoming visit to Saudi Arabia of his countrys Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Its going to be a remarkable visit, since the foreign ministers talks will focus on how best the two countries can cooperate with each other in working toward achieving the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program (NTP) 2020, Thassim said at the 69th anniversary of his countrys Independence Day celebrations at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh.
Sri Lanka looks forward to further strengthening bilateral relations, especially in the fields of employment, trade, investment and tourism, he added.
Appreciating the long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia, our country wholeheartedly supports Vision 2030 under the wise leadership of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman, and NTP 2020 initiated by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, second deputy premier and defense minister.
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, trade and tourism have increased tremendously to the benefit of the people of the two countries," he said, adding that nearly 38,000 Saudis holidayed in Sri Lanka last year.

Sri Lankan maid not fully paid for 11 years
Escorted by a lawyer from her countrys embassy, a Sri Lankan housemaid reported that she had not received the majority of her salary for 11 years, security sources said.
The maid said that her sponsor only gave her about 10 percent of her monthly salary to send it to her family and kept the remaining 90 percent for himself.
This continued until she decided to leave Kuwait and asked him for the money. He told her he had saved for her, but he denied ever saying so. The Public Authority for Manpower contacted the sponsor, who promised to pay back the money to the maid as long as she returns back to work for him. - Kuwait Times

Sublime Swarna: Five days, ten films
Last November, at the 26th Blue and Gold Quiz at Royal College, I met Lathikka Asiri Niriella, veteran quizzer, history teacher, and a great many things besides. We took note of the scores, but waited rather impatiently for the questions to be read so that we could quiz each other more. Eventually, we came to the last query: a short video clip of a blind man singing a T. M. Jayaratne song about the consolations that life offers us. The question was about the actor: Vijaya Nandasiri.
They didnt ask about the film but we knew and answered at once: Nedeyo. That prompted us to talk about the movies, about the Sinhala cinema, and more pertinently about how as a child he went to the theatre to savour the K. A. W. Pereras films. He correctly surmised that more than the stories, what enthralled the audience in them was Premasiri Khemadasas music. I agreed, and then went off to more serious, subtle films. Eventually, we got to talk about Hansa Vilak.
Ensnared audiences
I put to Niriella that what ensnared audiences when it premiered was its theme: adultery, after all, was not a topic directors had selected before. Niriella agreed: We had to do a great many things just to watch Hansa Vilak. We had to lie to our parents, cut school, or immediately go for the afternoon show after classes were over. To this Niriella added: It was a different time, a different world. You just dont get films like that anymore.
Hansa Vilak was what Regi Siriwardena called it: a permanent landmark. By opting for a taboo subject like adultery, it set down two precedents. One, it gave free rein to other directors to follow (it is telling, after all, that Vasantha Obeyesekeres more daring work followed Bandaranayakes debut), and two, it did away with the thin line between good and evil that actresses stuck to in earlier, as serious films. Again, its telling that a whole breed of actresses, even those as conventional as Malini Fonseka, went for directors who paired them up with themes they wouldnt even have touched before. The actress responsible for this paradigm shift, Swarna Mallawarachchi, has today been credited for what she did. Rightly. But is it enough, we can ask.
From January 22 to 26, ten of her best films were screened at the National Film Corporation, right down from Sath Samudura (her first) to Channa Kinnari (directed by the same man who got her back into acting 20 years later, Asoka Handagama). The Hall had room for only about 330 people, but it was housed by more than 400 spectators virtually every day. Wading through these classics, one by one, even in as busy a month as January, would have been a priority for who came and watched, and for me personally, what defined them was how they traced Swarnas evolution, as an actress and as a human being. This is not a conventional biographical sketch. This is a sketch, yes, but of a different sort.
Essentially unsympathetic
Hansa Vilak caught Swarna in a twilight world: she had just returned from her sojourn abroad and had been featured as a supporting character in three films: Ridi Nimnaya, Biththi Hathara, and Yahalu Yeheli. For that reason perhaps (on account of her inexperience), to her first real leading role she brought with her the qualities that defined her first few performances, in Sath Samudura, Hanthane Kathawa, and Thunman Handiya.
In the latter three films, she is essentially unsympathetic: in Sath Samudura and Thunman Handiya, for instance, she is hostile towards her mother-in-law (played in both by Denawaka Hamine) and brother-in-law (played by Cyril Wickremage in the former and by Joe Abeywickrama in the latter). In these she comes out as your typical jealous, spiteful in-law, who by even the subtlest gestures lets you know that s/he despises your presence.
Mathara Achchi, which I have not seen in a long, long time, was different and unique: in it, she is almost the conventional lover, who awaits her lover even as she realises that he may not return. But then it was a conventional story, quite unlike all those other films had been featured in by that time and would be featured in. Her travels abroad, in Europe and Australia, made her aware of the wide range of sensitivity actresses like her were capable of, which empowered her to return to the land of her birth and take part in more serious productions. The closest to a conventional flick she got to after that, needless to say, was Yasapalitha Nanayakkaras Anjana.
Ridi Nimnaya, Biththi Hathara, and Yahalu Yeheli are a veritable bunch. Watching them again, Im struck by the subtlety that Swarna brings in, and also the fact that they are in stark contrast to her later career: in the latter film, as the less-than-empathetic sister to Nadeeka Gunasekara, she almost jars, if at all because her role is to affirm the kind of patriarchy she repudiated in all her subsequent performances. And then, of course, she got Hansa Vilak (with some apprehension: it took some convincing by Bandaranayake to get her in, given her doubts about a character that was black).
In Miranda Ranaweera, she epitomises the sensual pleasure-seeker. In Palagetiyo, Vasantha Obeyesekere tried but couldnt quite get Dhammi Fonseka to fit into that kind of figure. Fonsekas inexperience showed, and sometimes quite glaringly. Swarnas Miranda, on the other hand, is the exact kind of fetishised female the Sinhala cinema was afraid of depicting: the woman who had casual flings and returned to her earlier lover or husband without any qualms, and willingly endured pain and death at the hands of her present paramour.
The last 20 minutes of that rather deep film are, admittedly, confusing (in a deliberate sense), which makes Swarnas portrayal even more oblique. Does she return to her husband, does that husband gloat at Dharmasiri after the latter murders her, and does Dharmasiri murder her and that old woman at all, are hence questions which the director intended for the audience.
The films that Swarna Mallawarachchi got after Hansa Vilak defined an entire era. In Suddilage Kathawa, she revelled as a sensuous pleasure-seeker, who makes use of the mudalali (played by the only man who could depict such a ferocious womaniser, Somi Ratnayake) to get what she wants but then is misunderstood and killed by her own husband (Romiel, played by Cyril Wickremage). Observe the very manner in which she speaks and articulates her emotion, and you will agree with Swarnas own summation of her character: Strong, cunning, but essentially ignorant and indifferent to the fact that she was being exploited. A world away, no doubt, from the other Simon Nawagaththegama adaptation she was featured in, Sumitra Peries Sagara Jalaya.
Scriptwriters vision
Sagara Jalaya is, as those whove read Nawagaththegama would know, a fleshed out adaptation of his short story Ohu Mala Da Pasu. There are stark differences between the very rhythm and pacing of this and Suddilage Kathawa, which has to do with the scriptwriters vision (Nawagaththegama scripted Suddilage Kathawa, while Sagara Jalaya was scripted by the gentler, more nuanced Lester James Peries) and which showed, quite discernibly, in Swarnas performance: as the forlorn but stubborn mother, she earns the ire and wrath of an entire community that only superficially sang praises for her dead husband. To date, it remains Swarnas most powerful portrayal, as what I would call the quintessential Sri Lankan mother.

Suspended sentence for Wimals supporter
A supporter of former Minister Wimal Weerawansa who pleaded guilty to shouting in open court in a manner obstructing court proceedings, was yesterday sentenced to one and a half years imprisonment suspended for seven years by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.Sudesh Premalal Fonseka, 48, of Panadura was arrested by police on January 24 following the Magistrates order after he shouted in open court when the Magistrate was delivering her bail order regarding National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa. Apart from the suspended imprisonment, the accused was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000. He was warned not to repeat such behaviour in the future.Slave Island Police filed a charge sheet consisting of two counts under section 223 of the Penal Code and section 55 of the Judicature Act for obstructing Court proceedings.In a surprising turn of events, the incident occurred in the presence of Magistrate Jayaratne after he shouted and pointed his finger at the Magistrates Bench citing that former Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and former Chairman of the State Engineering Corporation Ashu Marasinghe, should also be arrested.
The Magistrate observed that the incident can be considered serious and could be referred to the Court of Appeal because it comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
Defence Counsel Premanath Dolawatta appearing for the suspect informed Court that his client is a heart patient and he is the sole breadwinner of the family.
Taking into consideration the facts, the magistrate decided to impose a suspended imprisonment.

Tamil Nadu in chaos after chief minister's revolt

India's southern state of Tamil Nadu has been plunged into crisis after the chief minister revolted against his incoming successor.
On Sunday, the ruling AIADMK party announced Sasikala Natarajan would become the next leader, two months after the death of influential politician J Jayalalitha.
O Panneerselvam, who had taken over after her death, resigned on Sunday.
He now says he was forced to quit to, make way for Sasikala.
On Tuesday evening, Panneerselvam visited a "monument" erected in honour of Jayalalitha at the Marina beach in the capital, Chennai (Madras).
Panneerselvam meditated there for 40 minutes before announcing that Amma (mother), as Jayalalitha was popularly known, wanted him to be chief minister and that he had been compelled to put in his papers by a group of legislators on Sunday.
Panneerselvam told reporters that he was not "convinced of the decision" taken by this group, but "by then they had collected the signatures of the legislators" in favour of Sasikala, a close confidante of Jayalalitha.
For close to three decades, Sasikala, known as Chinnamma (younger mother) to her supporters, had been an almost permanent fixture in Jayalalitha's life, and was often seen with the former chief minister on public platforms.
"Finally she [Ms Natarajan] held my hands and asked me to obey the decision, for the party, as she did when she insisted me to take the chief minister's post," he said.
Unclear
Panneerselvam also said he was willing to withdraw his resignation "if people wanted".
Some leaders of the AIADMK, who owe allegiance to Sasikala, have criticised Panneerselvam's remarks and called him a "betrayer".
Reports say he will need the support of at least 118 of his party's 134 lawmakers if he wants to continue as the leader of the government.
Correspondents say it is unclear whether Panneerselvam will be able to garner the requisite support, although many people in the state have opposed Natarajan's elevation.
Tamil Nadu's main opposition DMK party also criticised the decision saying that "the people of Tamil Nadu did not vote for anyone from Jayalalitha's household to become chief minister".
The governor of Tamil Nadu will now have to take a call on whether to ask Panneerselvam to show his support, or swear in Sasikala as the next chief minister.
Never given any formal role by Jayalalitha in the party or the state government, Sasikala's role was always that of aide and confidante.
But analysts say her proximity to power allowed her and her extended family to wield huge influence in the party and the government.
Sasikala's influence over Jayalalitha also became the source of intense media speculation and tabloid gossip.
They also faced corruption charges together. A Karnataka high court order in 2015, which cleared them of involvement in a corruption scandal, paved the way for Jayalalitha's return to power after a setback in September 2014 when a trial court found them guilty of corruption.
India's Supreme Court has heard an appeal in the case, and is expected to issue a verdict next week.
If convicted, Sasikala will not be allowed to hold public office for six years.

Traffic signals will be installed at major junctions in Jaffna to minimise the rising number of road accidents. This was revealed during a programme organised by the National Council for Road Safety to raise the awareness of the people of Jaffna on the rising rate of road accidents.
National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said the major causes for road accidents in the Jaffna Peninsula were a lack of knowledge of highway rules among the people due to the 30-year-long conflict situation and lack of traffic signals to regulate vehicle movements. He said although there are 64 major junctions in the Jaffna Peninsula, only three had traffic signals.Traffic signals should be installed at key junctions in the Peninsula to reduce road accidents.During the programme, schoolchildren, drivers, pedestrians, motorcyclists and cyclists were made aware on road accidents and traffic signals while cyclists were instructed to install reflectors at the rear of bicycles to make them visible at nights.

Treasured words
I sincerely feel happy that I had the rare chance of reading the novel titled as The Prospector translated from the work by J M G Le Clezio, from French into English Carol Marks. Le Clezio is cites as the winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature. On reading the page moving novel, I found it as a remarkable contribution.
The protagonist known as Alexis is shown a attempting to find a treasure, which he knows via legend, history and myth.
But does he succeed
Le Clezio offers a series of episodes where the protagonist is shown as passing time with his mother, father and the loving sister who keeps him. There is also the depiction of their constant struggle to exist amidst several natural calamities such as the flood, landslides and severe winds. But from moment to moment, the protagonist becomes optimistic when he realises the nature of the calamity he and the others have to face.
It is the understanding of a sublime beauty. The life led by the protagonist intermixed with others around him are sensitively captured. The human interiors, disputes, the will to live and love are all underlined as creativity that has to be faced by the humans. The hallmark of the work I presume is the use of the poetic language which by and large evokes a sense of spiritualism. Wherever the protagonist wanders, he discovers the essence of the myth of human creations left behind as a legacy.
The work is segmented into seven major periods. The place names may look fictitious or real. They are Boucan, 1892, the starting point a land where the protagonist and his family attempts to live as cultivations. But they are driven out by natural disasters which they fail to overcome. Then comes the second segment of moving to a better place called Forest side. The encounter of a seafarer makes them leave to a place it named Rodrigues in 1910. This also indicates the passage of time.
The fifth segment in the work titled as Ypres, winter 1915  the Somme, Autumn, 1916, is full of such poetic and mythical episodes which pave the way for the reader to enter into an enchanting world full of bliss, which has been already cited as the exploration of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilisation. The moment of illumination in the whole work is the ultimate achievement in the struggle of settling down which is marked in the last segment which goes as Monanava, 1922.
In this a grave recollection in the mind of a silent man is recreated depicting the inner self as a discovery of mans need to live in peace. Chronologically time passes, and the need to fight against time is futile. Le Clezio in a prophetic creative vision sees a given time passed with an added spiritual value. The period is denoted from 1892 to 1922. The conclusion is recorded as follows.
Now the night has fallen. To the depths of my being I hear the living sound of the rising sea.
Le Clezios novel is regarded as the crowning achievement from Frances pre-eminent contemporary novelists. The work is reminisced of the creative works of Andre Gide and Marcl Proust. But Le Clezio has his own stamp in The Prospector. He underlines two major themes of the creative artist.
Firstly a sensitive creative writer cannot escape from the grips of his nostalgia of the past lived and well remembered as memoirs. Secondly, the creative writer cannot escape from the realities of the existence such as the need to live in peace and harmony, the episode that bring the disasters, agony as well as ecstasies. As Le Clezio creates he makes his protagonist Alexis find a treasure left behind by a legendary character.
But it is prefaced by the reader and a search for the treasure of the need to live. The man by nature is obsessed with finding some treasure need for him to live. It may be wealth or knowledge. Like his protagonist Alexis, Le Clezio too has travelled widely.
The translator, Carol Marks, deserves to be commended by the reader for the sensitive linguistic approach, which is found rarely in the translation process. The passages in English read more like an original and one good example come from the concluding chapter where the nostalgia rises into a climax. A few sentences I recall go as follows.
I think about Nam. I think she must be still sleeping somewhere, alone, in her big frase bed under a cloud of mosquito netting. I wish I could whisper to her about things that have no end, about memories, fragile and transparent like a mirage of our house and its blue rood, the garden of all of birds where night is falling, the ravine, and the tree of good and evil that stands as the entrance to Monanava.

TRUMP VOWS TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM
US: President Donald Trump vowed Monday that America and its allies would defeat the forces of death and keep radical jihadists from gaining a foothold on US soil, but did not offer details about his strategy to defeat the Islamic State group.
In his first visit to US Central Command -- responsible for an area that includes the Middle East and Central Asia -- Trump also did not say whether he would scrap parts of the anti-IS mission in Iraq and Syria undertaken by his predecessor Barack Obama.
Today, we deliver a message in one very unified voice to these forces of death and destruction -- America and its allies will defeat you. We will defeat them, he told about 300 military personnel at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.
We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. And we will not allow it to take root in our country, Trump added. Freedom, security and justice will prevail. He accused Islamic State fighters of leading a campaign of genocide, committing atrocities across the world, and promised an unspecified historic financial investment in the US military.
Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11, as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino, and all across Europe, added the president.
He claimed that the very, very dishonest press doesnt want to report on certain attacks, without offering any corroborating evidence to back up his allegation.
They have their reasons, he said, without explaining further.
Trump made fighting radical Islamic terrorism a central plank of his election campaign, and the issue is emerging as the organizing principle of his foreign and domestic policies.
Centcom plays a key role in Operation Inherent Resolve -- the US-led mission to degrade and defeat IS. A total of 17,861 strikes have been launched across northern Syria and Iraq since August 2016 under the mission.
In late January, the President ordered generals to begin a 30-day review of the US strategy to defeat IS.
Trump used potential cooperation in the fight against the fighters as a reason to embrace Russia and has tried to implement an order banning refugees and nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.
The ban has spurred an unprecedented battle with the courts. On Sunday, Trump tried to pin the blame for future attacks on the federal judge who has temporarily blocked his executive order.
Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! Trump said.
He did not offer evidence for the suggestion that would-be terrorists are flocking to the country.
Most experts express more concern about Americans becoming radicalized and carrying out IS-inspired attacks, rather than the group dispatching clandestine agents around the world.
The contours of Trumps policy to fight the Islamic State group abroad are still coming into focus, after less than three weeks on the job. His call for a review of the anti-IS campaign included any recommended changes to any United States rules of engagement. That could foreshadow a tougher approach, but it is one that some experts warn could fuel radicalization. - AFP

Volkswagen plant in Sri Lanka: Setting the record straight
For seven long years Volkswagen automobiles was to set up an assembly plant in Sri Lanka. This may have been Sri Lankas longest talked about development project which involved two successive governments but never took off.
A land vested in BOI in Kuliyapitiya was given on a freehold basis to Western Automobile Assembly for a proposed vehicle assembly plant.Indias Volkswagen plant rolling out their 300, 000 car
It was eventually Kartin Hohmann of Volkswagen Passenger Cars' corporate communications voice clip to a local TV channel that that there are no plans for Volkswagen brand investment in Sri Lanka at this point of time that ended this five year long episode.
Being a business journalist I clearly remember writing about this seven years ago and if my memory is correct the headline in Daily News was Volkswagen to invest on an assembly plant in Hambantota.
Once again the broker behind this was Senok Automobiles.This company was allocated land in Hambantota by Hambantota District MP Namal Rajapaksa. Plans were announced and even the then President boasted that the South will get a Volkswagen plant.
However for three long years nothing happened. With the change of government the subject was once again opened by Senok Automobiles. However this time around, the company also had the backing of the German Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Dr Jurgen Morhard and Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva.
Both played and read given to them by Senok Automobiles with a change in venue from Hambantota to Kuliyapitiya.
To make the deal more newsworthy and authentic, in mid-August 2015 BOI and Senok Automobiles signed an agreement to establish an assembly plant for VW in Kuliyapitiya.
The agreement was signed by Upul Jayasuriya Chairman of BOI and Noel Selvanayagam, President of Senok Automobiles (Pvt) Ltd. He was a former director of Sri Lanka Insurance.
Under this agreement which is a BOI Section 17 agreement, the investor was to assemble vehicles in the 1000 cc to 2000 cc category. These vehicles were to be diesel powered and include passenger cars, Sport Utility Vehicles (SUV), Multi Utility Vehicles (MUV) or commercial vehicles. The total value of this project will be an investment of US$26.5 million of which 21.5 million will be invested in fixed assets within a period of 24 months.
As Volkswagen is currently the world leader in automobile manufacture, recently overtaking Toyota of Japan, this project is a very high profile one and a statement about Sri Lankas growing attractiveness as a destination for investment.
BOI is very keen to attract other leading automobile manufacturers into the country as the industry creates opportunities for the creation of local component manufacturers that can supply the building of a complex product such as passenger car. It is estimated that the assembly plant will be operational within a period of 30 months. Initially these vehicles would be marketed locally for a period of three years and thereafter the vehicles manufactured will be exported to overseas markets, the BOI website said. Though the investment is not on, the BOI still carries this post, the BOI web post says.
Senior Ministers Malik Samarawickrama, Ravi Karunanayake, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Deputy Minister Sujeeva Senasinghe too backed this claim. Not to be out done Prime Minister too said that Volkswagen will invest in Kuliyapitiya.
However Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne hinted that Volkswagen plant may not come Sri Lanka's way. But he was snubbed by other Ministers and he kept silent.
The grand finale for the ground breaking was held with both President, Prime Minister, Minister of Development Strategies, Minister of Education, Finance Minister engaged in the ground breaking. Several flags of Volkswagen were displayed at the venue.
BOI Chairman Upul Jayasuriya at the ground breaking said that the Volkswagen plant would be a major leapfrog for the country in the right direction.But soon it turned out be the opposite as Volkswagen in Germany said they have no plans for Sri Lanka.
A senior official from the Ceylon Motor Trader's Association (CMTA) said that the deal had taken two successive governments, public as well as the German Embassy for a right Royal ride. Everybody has missed the simple point.Why should Volkswagen invest in Sri Lanka when they have a plant in India Sri Lanka is not Bangladesh or Pakistan where there is a readymade market to sell cars within these countries.
Volkswagen India operates a manufacturing plant in Pune (Chakan) Maharashtra which is capable of producing 200,000 vehicles per annum. Along with the manufacturing of Volkswagen Polo and Volkswagen Vento and the newly launched Volkswagen Ameo, the plant is also shared by koda Auto India Private Limited for manufacturing the koda Rapid.)
The CMTA member says that the record of Volksvagen has now changed to the manufacture of European cars. So why were there no banners of any European car models at the venue he asked.
After the deal did not take off in a evidence based, fact-filled message posted on Facebook the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Harsha De Silva explained as follows
1. Given I was responsible for the initiation of this project I would like to place the following facts before the public.
2. In my new job as the Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs I met with the then Ambassador of Germany, Dr Jurgen Morhard in early January 2015. At this meeting the Ambassador indicated that Volkswagen had attempted to set up a plant in Sri Lanka since 2008 but failed due to various reasons.
3. I indicated to him that we would be delighted to have VW set up a plant in Sri Lanka and we initiated discussions between the Government and the company.
Of the signing Deputy Minister de Silva said,
1. Having initiated the possible investment, the Ambassador and I moved out.
2. We were told the discussions continued among various stakeholders locally.We were informed that Volkswagens local agent Senok Automobiles representing the carmaker negotiated terms with several government authorities to get necessary clearances.
The Deputy Minister quoted the German Embassy Deputy Head of Mission Dr. Michael Dohman as having said during the signing ceremony in August, It is important for the German Embassy to have a big company like Volkswagen in Sri Lanka. Germany is always talking to enterprises to attract them here. People will have to be trained and educated, and many other components are needed, so it will boost the local economy,
On why the deal did not go through, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva offered this argument:
1. In just a matter of a couple of weeks after signing the agreement, on 3 September 2015, Volkswagen, after months of denial, admitted to the EPA in the US that they had cheated on emissions tests on some of their diesel models in the US. On 18 September 2015, the EPA went public with this admission of guilt.
2. Soon thereafter the VW stock crashed and the senior management was fired. Later some 30,000 jobs were cut and it has thus far cost the carmaker some US$ 18 billion in losses.
The Deputy Minister said that in Sri Lanka,
1. This scandal that rocked VW was a complete shock to everyone, obviously including us in Sri Lanka. Apparently Senok Automobiles who had signed for VW had attempted to save the agreement and continue with the investment as planned.
2. However, at one point, I believe after much negotiation, the Government had decided it would be better not to go with a dedicated VW assembly plant due to possible legal issues that could crop up due to the massive fallout from their emissions scam. This we knew today when the PM explained the sequence of events to us.
3. Given the BOI agreement had still been in place with Senok Automobiles for the original VW assembly I understand that they had rescued the project by agreeing with the BOI to go ahead to establish the plant to assemble various makes of European automobiles.
4. It had been for this assembly plant, renamed Western Automobile, the foundation stone laid for an automobile assembly. At no point at the foundation laying ceremony (which I could not attend) had there been any mention of the plant being for VW.
He adds further,
In fact since I moved out of my earlier portfolio of Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs to the new one in the Foreign Ministry in August 2015, I had no dealings with the project and was sincerely unaware of the various changes until it was explained today. I would appreciate that fact be respected.
I hope the above explains the confusion and we as a country can be satisfied that the assembly plant is being established and many jobs will be created besides thousands of training opportunities for young people.
There was also a subsequent interview published in the English media where BOI Chairman Upul Jayasuriya was running down Sri Lakas only car assembly company Micro and its Chairman Dr. Lawrence Perera.
This is not what he should do.Jayasuriya must speak to Dr. Perera and try to offer him more concessions.This is a very sad stance taken by the BOI Chairman, the CMTA official said.
He also asked as to why the Finance Minister was hell bent on offering concessions to a new second hand car assembly plant without promoting Micro.

Wallabies, All Blacks hail van der Westhuizen
Sydney: Australia and New Zealand Tuesday saluted extraordinary South African rugby legend Joost van der Westhuizen, hailing his skill and leadership as an inspiration.
The former scrum-half, a Springboks captain who won the 1995 World Cup, died on Monday aged 45 after a five-year battle with motor neurone disease which left him frail and in a wheelchair.
Rugby world lost another great person and player, former Wallabies back David Campese tweeted. Joost ... will be remembered for the great fight he had to fight. RIP my friend.
Fellow Wallaby Tim Horan added: Loved playing against and with you Joost. The most competitive player I ever played against. You are an inspiration to all. #RIPJoost.
Australian Rugby Union chief Bill Pulver said in a statement he died too early.
Joost was a truly extraordinary rugby player and having read about his efforts with the J9 Foundation he sounds like an equally extraordinary human being. At 45, his great life has ended too early, he said.
Former New Zealand scrum-half Justin Marshall said that at his peak, van der Westhuizen was the best player in the world.
He just had an ability, on the flip of a coin, to change a game  a player like that was someone you could never underestimate, was always dangerous, he told New Zealand radio.
Players like that dont come along very often.
Marshall said his great on-field rivalry with van der Westhuizen developed into a close friendship off the pitch and he admired the tenacity with which he battled the disease. All Black great Dan Carter also paid tribute.
He was one of the few non All Black players I adored. Such sad news!, he tweeted, while New Zealand Rugby chief Steve Tew said he inspired many around the world.
Joost had an incredible playing career and over the course of it, established strong friendships with a lot of New Zealand players, Tew said in a statement.
We know theyll be taking this news hard. He was an inspiration to a lot of people in South Africa and around the world both for his skill and leadership on the field and the courage with which he faced this illness.
Van der Westhuizen, who was at the time of his retirement in 2003 the most capped Springbok, playing 89 Tests, was instrumental in South Africas victory over New Zealand in the 1995 World Cup final in Johannesburg which made him a national sporting hero. AFP

Why is the World so Passionate about Shakespeare
As we still celebrate the 400 the death anniversary of William Shakespeare, the question asked by many is: why is he so passionately revered both as a dramatist and literature icon. No one seems to have the answer but remain in awesome at his remarkable wizadry.
The amazing language he used in dialogue, stunned the world then and now, a reason no renown writer attempted to eclipse.
Shakespeare thou art the Muse among the living and the dead. The creator of such magnificent characters that are immortalized so much so, they emerge as idols from incarnation.
Leading them is Hamlet, the Danish Prince.
Shakespeare did not simply appear from nowhere in a literary desert but on the contrary as a shooting star in the 16 the century from amidst the theatre instituted by a small group of young and educated people who had set about to make the theatre their career. His appearance on the scene threw light and illuminated the future theatre of drama and dialogue.
The universal genius he was, the works are now read and performed everywhere. He started life as the son of a glover with no more than average education at primary level that stunned the UNIVERSITY wits whom he white washed as he gained momentum on popularity, pulling the rug off from under their feet. They never recovered from that shock until they passed away.
Colossal drama
He knew how to exploit to the full the resources of contemporary theatre though sandwiched between it and classicism. One of the Chamberlain's Men, he was playwright, actor and gentleman. The spirit of England never left though he waded through many a country to set many of his plays and characters. I often wondered why he never made HAMLET the Prince of England but the Prince of Denmark in a colossal drama as this play.
In fairness to him every year some five to six thousand works about Shakespeare are published and since the end of the second world war as a virtual industry, producing books and articles on the playwright.
Shakespeare was such an extraordinary playwright unquestionably the greatest to date, He had little regard for his characters and plots that were later to become legend and every scholar to every critic was in no mood to question his authority. They accepted everything he wrote; total historical to improbabilities as well as impossibilities. He failed to portray contemporary manner and was unhampered with shakles of time. Never a historian of his time, h raced back to history to come up with a mix bag of improbabilities. Some of the strange events in his plays were censured gravely and never was possible with the time he wrote events.
But that did not matter as many thought some of his plays would not have been tolerated at the Globe. Many still wonder why he did not cast Hamlet as an Englishman or Romeo's birthplace as in York instead of Verona. These plays would have had winder appeal if they were sustained in their original sites.
But Shakespeare was different.
He was a master of his craft who was able to drive shock into heart rending tragedies and next minute turn around to create humour. Thus his characters were created to meet such situations. The horror found in his plays cannot match today's crime scenes that appear listless.
No other pen has written words that are simple and poignant that interpose history or tragedy and rise to fiery heights as the play gathers momentum. He used subtle preludes to an oncoming terror filled scene as found in many of the plays and reach a climax only to delight a director who later mounted such plays for hysterical audiences.
And who is the real Shakespeare
How did he rise to be the world's greatest playwright
How did he collect his colossal vocabulary
How did he change the course of English language
How did he influence the English literati already in existence
And most of all, how did he survive the jeers and snobs of his contemporaries who called themselves the University-wits
Immortal figures
No one has found the anserts to date. But I find of these solutions in the boyhood of his background in the rural setting from which he emerged; the of his time. He was a very observant youth. He trudged across valleys and dales; climbed mountain before the sun sets. His love for the forests of Arden, the swans in River Avon, etc. are bits I find in the plays. A nature man, there was nothing he missed in birds and bees nor the ever-changing four season the way composer Vivaldi had scored into his great scores. He paid much attention to his observations and the great writer who did not care to find characteristics, made them rise to immortal figures.
A historian able to illuminate the least of history plays with the inspiration of England's past by the historically minded dramatists was way out for the Bard In the approach to Shakespeare's life and works that related to the age of his time can never be during the Elizabethan period if one spends a life time trying figure it.
However, historical investigations by determined scholars have brought many things to light, especially found in the Sonnets that have baffled generations due to the careless handling of historical event by Shakespeare. Many Shakespearians feel the key to the resolution of their problem are now cleared except for his mistress. However a firm establishment of a firm chronology that took place year after year resulted in an enrichment of contemporary content that critics had been looking for. It cleared the doubts that many carried over his 'lost' years between 1587-1592 but it was also a tall order.
All the problems of the Sonnets had worked out consistently without knowing who the famous Mr. WH was could have been young Southampton. It had to be a Elizabethan historian to the circumstances and the available data to put together the results and come up finally to pin point the 'Dark Lady' often mentioned in the Sonnets.
People came to realize that the dark Rosaline in LOVS'S LABOUR LOST was inspired by the playwright's mistress.
However, was Rosaline the Dark Lady
Once again Shakespeare gave rise to doubt. Why did he go out of his way to make HENRY VILL an exceptional play Was it to play down Henry and Anne Boleyn as mere lay-figures and blame Henry's divorce from Catherene of Aragon and lay it on Cardinal Wolsey Catherene being Spanish; why was she made the heroine in the play. That was in with keeping with James l's policy invented by Shakespeare seeking an alliance in order to make way for a marriage to his heir. Tactfully and prudently became the only playwright who never got into trouble. Because one third of his plays were from England, Scotland, Denmark tracing back to their rural roots and ancient collaboration of events that were sited and muddled.
But that did not matter because most people of his time were ignorant about history and paid less concerned. They were more concerned and elated about their right royal Englishman was on the way up. His plays were so colossal, spectacular and vibrant England had never seen or heard such magnificence or seen them staged. They swept aside the other playwrights who were good in their own right who had taken centre-stage before Shakespeare's rise. Some were the University-wits.
Shakespeare simply swept them to oblivion.

Your memory, your muscle
Human beings and a few of our quadruped friends have been endowed with the gift to remember the past. Legend tells us how the dog of warrior Ulysses recognises him on his return, wags its tail and closes its eyes. Androcles is spread by the lion as a gesture of gratitude. King Dutugemunu's royal tusker 'kadol' bad kept a pebble in his mouth to remind him of a wrong done by a kings warrior. To avenge when the time comes. He spits it out when the warrior saves him from a bucketful of 'Lo Diya'. Conies remember where they had hidden bones.
But, Man, the most consummate of beings has the ability not only to remember, but also to recall happy and sad events encountered by him from childhood to grave. They are memories. At times memories linger and are rarely forgotten.
Memories can be vividly brought to light, in a dream, with ones eyes closed, alone or in the company of others. Memories of happenings in ones life, be they be in the family, in school, workplace, in ones own country or abroad and interesting events in history, achievements and catastrophies are recorded in our memory and could be played back in a second, amidst laughter and tears.
Let us begin with momentous memorable memories. Memories of the moment when one becomes a grandparent. Memories makes one to peruse the old albums. Memories when one takes the vows of marriage. Snapshots of nuptials of children. The unforgettable memories of cutting the wedding cake by a child. The tearful embrace of the daughter before leaving the home sweet home of the parents to build her own nest with her partner. The final wave aboard the gaily decorated car will make the golden album to shudder with vibrant memories that flood ones minds eye.
You are seated with the children and grandchildren at the sea shore. Suddenly memories when as an engaged couple, you walked with your partner and recalls, the incident when an unexpected wave, drenches both. Laughter unlimited that cause you to relate the memorable shower bath incident to the children.
Happy memories of squabbles. About the marriage counsellor saying that marriage is not a bed of roses. That it has thorns too'.
A sight of a mother feeding her babe makes one to go back to the time when a persons own mother fondled her child. There are also incidents that are best forgotten.
Then comes the absolutely resplendent memories of happenings that took place from childhood to the present. These memories are more poignant when seated by a kin of friend peacefully sleeping in a casket. Vivid memories while gazing at an eternally sleeping persons.
There will be no memories without moments, with its suffixes momentous memorable, momentarily. At time angry tearful moments.
Finally, while taking a walk down a silent, serene, sorrow soaked pathway, gazing at the majestic, magnanimous writings from our holy books, memories rush into our minds. Here we see 'in memoriams' memorials that eulogises the meritorious deeds of a mortal by way of graphite or concrete slabs, statues and lovely memorials making us to go down once again down memory lane. Now for a memorable happening steeped in unfathomable memories.
A very young officer had trespassed into enemy territory. He was to face the firing squad. His eyes blindfolded and hands were tied behind a post. The firing squad was ready. Is there anything you wish to say before you die asked the commanding officer. The 18 year old thought. Sir, I wish to relive a memory. When I was 8 years old, I injured my head. I ran up to my mother with extended arms, blood streaking down my face. She too came running towards me with arms outstretched.
We embraced each other. My blood was mingling with our tears. Sir, I can relive that moment while my eyes are blindfolded. Please untie my hands. I want to relive that memory when we embraced each other. I want to embrace when I die! The CO Was silent, next he shouted. 'Ready, aim. He stuttered. Halt! We cannot shoot is mother, She is embracing him.
We have all had mothers. Some of you have mothers. All of us have had unforgettable memories with mothers'. The boy was escorted by a weeping and happy firing squad to the border. Unforgettable memories saved a life. It also brought back memories of mothers to many.
Verily, memories are made of these.

ADB to charter new country partnership strategy with Government
Asian Development Bank (ADB) is working on a new country partnership strategy with Sri Lankan government to address dynamic challenges with sustainable, inclusive and environmentally friendly solutions, a senior official said.
ADB, South Asia Regional Department Director General Hun Kim said ADBs previous assistance to Sri Lanka was primarily focused on fulfilling the basic needs of people and filling gaps in physical capacities. But in the coming years, ADB will be a forward looking strategic partner with the government to remove impediments to private investments and creates new engines of economic growth and enhance the productivity of economic systems, he said.
Without increasing lending capacities, we want to see the solutions expand in Sri Lanka whether it is for development finance, investment strategy or promotion of technology transfer, he said.
With the limited size in the domestic market and demand, strategic shift must be made to diversify production base in the country and most importantly increase productivity across sectors for expansion of exports and participation of global value chains and creation of higher value jobs.

AIA hosts AIA Vitality program
The AIA Insurance Group in Sri Lanka recently hosted an exclusive media roundtable discussion at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.The topic under the discussion was newly introduced AIA Vitality program, which was launched in Sri Lanka on January 15, 2017.
Present at the discussion were Bill Lisle, the Regional CEO of AIA Insurance and Pankaj Banerjee, the CEO of AIA Insurance Lanka PLC as well as other senior members of the organization. Leading members of the media also graced the event.
Sri Lanka was the AIA Group's first business acquisition in its 98-year history back in 2012.
The AIA Group is the second largest in the world on market count. Based solely in Asia, AIA's network spans across 18 markets.
Our model has always been very simple, we collect money and we pay a claim; that's what an insurance company does. This leads to us having very little engagement with our customers and as an industry we are renowned for being quite poor when it comes to engaging with our customers, said Lisle.
About 5 years ago AIA joined forces with a very innovative company in South Africa called Discovery'. Globally known for its work in healthcare and having worked with Obama in the US as well as a number of countries in Europe,'Discovery works to understand the causes and find solutions to some of the non-communal diseases across the globe. It was found that it comes down to 4 main lifestyle traits that contribute to 70% of non-communicable diseases. Such traits as, poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking and alcoholism contribute to an inappropriate amount of deaths on a global level.
According to Lisle over 1 million of the citizens of Sri Lanka are diabetic while 26% of the population are over-weight.
Discovery helped us find a really simple solution to helping people become healthier. There are 3 parts to the Vitality Circle as we call it, said Lisle. First, know your health. In this way we hope to motivate people to simply discover the state of their health. Once you know your health the question is, what are you going to do to improve it Hence our slogan: Let's walk Sri Lanka! By having a more balanced diet, reducing alcohol intake and quitting smoking habits one may take a huge step forward in becoming healthier.
The AIA Vitality app will monitor the improvement of an individual's health and reward that particular person with redeemable points.
So the second and third parts of the Vitality Circle are, do something about it (your state of health) and be rewarded for doing something about it, respectively. You can collect points for walking or simply having a medical check up. Thus you earn points just for doing things you should do, Lisle explained.
AIA Vitality has already been launched in countries such as Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. The app is currently in launch phase in Korea, Thailand and the Philippines.
Over the next 12 months we will have rolled the program out across all of our markets, stated Lisle. We've partnered with literally hundreds of partners who wish to support healthy living. Those partners range from healthy food stores, to pharmacies, hotels, cinemas, sports equipment, gyms and even airlines.
The AIA Vitality program follows a point reward mechanism, which provides instant rewards, which will serve as a means of motivating people to lead healthy lifestyles.
What this program allows us to do is actually reward people for being healthier and by having integrated insurance policies we can actually give discounts on premiums to people who we know are healthier. This becomes a win-win situation. We are helping our communities become healthier and live longer, we reward them as a way of motivation and we're reducing premiums of pro-life for those who become healthier. We invite people to be a part of our insurance program, so that when they are in need we can be there to protect them, said Lisle.
According to the Regional CEO, there has been a most encouraging response from staff to distribution and their customers. Engagement between AIA and its customers have increased 10 fold.
The CEO of AIA Insurance Sri Lanka, Pankaj Banerjee said, A program like Vitality will aid in differentiating the AIA Group from the rest in Asia. Our Let's Walk! campaign is pretty simple and straight-forward but very powerful and useful, explained Banerjee. At first we did the launch internally amongst our staff and agents as the concept was new in Sri Lanka. An insurance company talking about living healthier and longer rather than disaster and death is unique. So we wanted to make sure that our staff and agents had a clear understanding of this concept and the value proposition it offered customers. (DJ)

Ambivalence and uncertainty
To a refugee, returning home is a lifelong dream and an end to his or her life in limbo, but for many Sri Lankan refugees returning from Tamil Nadu in the last eight years since the end of the war, coming home has been a bitter-sweet experience filled with both regret as well as hope.
Sivakumar, 39, his wife and three young children returned to the village of Krishnapuram in Kilinochchi along with 35 other families in August last year. He brought his brother and his family along with him and the two families today share a small home with their younger brother and wife. The latter works as a de-mining officer and his wife is attached to the Civil Defence Force; neither earn much to support all. Soon the returnee families would have to build their own homes.
We thought that we would come back to our own place as soon as things got calmer, said Sivakumar but has now started to question his move with no house to stay in or income to survive in his homeland.
During his stay in India, he was trained as an electrician but his status as a refugee meant that he could not be employed full time anywhere.
Sivakumar, Denise Stellar and children
It is normal that those who protect us, impose certain restrictions on our freedom for our own safety, said Sivakumar who took a boat to India in 1990 to flee from the war.
Living among 100 Sri Lankan families in a refugee camp in Tamil Nadu, he met and married 35-year-old Denise Stellar.
We have been looking for work for the last two months but have found none, said Stellar. Sivakumar cannot practice as an electrician without a National Vocational Training certificate and hasnt taken steps yet to register for one.
They are being helped by the Chennai based NGO; Organization for Elangai Refugees Rehabilitation (OfERR) where most of the staff themselves were refugees.
OfERR Project Officer, Reginald Charles who works with Sivakumar noted that many refugees go through a period of withdrawal soon after their return. Five months ago, Sivakumar was quite depressed and they were regretting returning. But in the last two days, his spirits have picked up and he says he should have returned two years ago so that he could have built something solid by now, explained Charles.
The main reason for such optimism is that they found out that their father had left them some land they could cultivate on. The children who were never farmers however have had to learn fast.
OfERR which commenced operations in 1984 looked after over 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamils who fled to Tamil Nadu after the ethnic riots in 1983. In 2004, they set up a branch in Sri Lanka under S. Sooriyakumari to help those affected by the Tsunami. The NGO has been acting as a liaison between the government and recent returnees, helping them settle in and restart their lives.
According to Charles, around 65,000 people still reside in camps in Tamil Nadu while there are another 35,000 people who live outside the camps.
We have 487 returnee families in Kilinochchi and OfERR has worked with around 300 families, said Charles. The returnees are spread out in six districts in the North. Close to 381 families live in Mullaitivu while there are another 4,144 families in Jaffna.
We study and identify their needs and then link them to necessary services. We also collect valuable data on them, said Charles.
Settling in
To those who have returned after 30 years of exile, a lot has changed and at times, their country of refuge is more home to them than their own land. Former refugee and staffer at OfERR, Tharmaratnam Sajikaran knows all too well the struggles of settling in. It is not easy to immediately change your mindset when you leave the camp. Food and shelter was always provided and everything you needed was close by. For 25 years everything was looked after by the camp, he said.
Here the hospitals are far away, buses are not frequent and there is very little to do, added Sajikaran who had fled to India in 1998.
In camp he studied for his university degrees in Computer Science and Sociology, and thereafter joined ofERR and returned to Sri Lanka in 2012. According to Sajikaran, the government of India opened up higher education facilities for the refugees a few years after settlement and today there are around 4,000 graduates living in camps. Most have resorted to be day labourers as we cannot find permanent jobs, he said. Some have thus returned and in Vavuniya there are around 35 Indian qualified graduates.
Many are hesitant to come back. They are treated better than the locals there and they are not sure of the conditions here. If they are certain that things are good here, they will return. But at the same time, one cannot expect to have everything for you here as soon as you return, said Sajikaran who is working to convince many others to return home.
In time, many learn to adapt, as 36-year-old Selvakumar Chandrawadana, a mother of two young boys has proven. Her family returned to Sri Lanka in 2004 during the Cease Fire which did not last long and was soon caught up in the midst of another war,
We came back because we thought of our childrens futures. Even if they studied at university, they would not be able to get a permanent job there, she said. They spent the next six years shifting from one camp to another until they got their own land in Kilinochchi in 2010.
I did not have anything to start with, said Chandrawadana who with much perseverance received a bank loan of Rs 90,000 to start her own tailoring shop having been trained in tailoring in India. Today her husband drives a threewheeler and she is a successful entrepreneur employing two other women under her.
The only problems I have now are settling my loans. I have to work and pay them, my only wish is that I dont get sick, she said as she looks to expand her business further.
Marrying local
As one lives in a foreign land for over 25 years, bonds, apart from economic are also likely to be formed. Mutthaiyah Veluayuthapillai, a 65-year-old who returned to Sri Lanka in 2013, having left in 1990, had his daughter marry an Indian national much to his disapproval. At the start I was apprehensive because you hear so many stories of Indian men treating their women badly. Their culture is also not similar to ours, he said. He is not alone in his apprehension but many second generation refugees, born in camps, have taken a greater liking to their adopted cultures than their own. His daughter having returned with him, has applied for a spousal visa to return to India.
We lived well there. I also had four milking cows and I used to sell milk to the locals there. Many there asked us why we wanted to come back, but I told them that we were returning to our own land and the children want to see their country, said Mutthaiyah who has five kids. One of his sons migrated to Switzerland and has helped him resettle. Today he has built a small home in Perandan Nagaram in Killinochchi and tends to his paddy fields.
Similar to many of the returnees, Mutthaiyah laments that he had to struggle on his own with some assistance from his family and friends to resettle in Sri Lanka. The government has not helped us much, he said, a sentiment echoed by many others.
No government assistance
Sajikaran explained that while there were some Grama Niladhari or local government officials who were attentive to the needs of the people, many did not know much about the people they were supposed to serve. In addition, the government also had certain schemes and criteria when it came to providing assistance and it was thus not easy for them to adapt to changing needs.
It is only in the last six months that the Ministry of Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms started giving 35 houses to returnees, but there is no proper resettlement scheme for them as soon as they come back. People cannot always live with their relatives, especially for an extended period of time which invariably result in family issues, added Sajikaran.
Many of the returnees are also not aware of the manner in which the system works in the country. There are several schemes that are available at the local government level to help the poor but many are not aware of it, said Sajikaran who spent six months after his return to study the entire system of governance in the country.
OfERR has thus set up welcome groups in every Grama Niladhari division where returnees reside in, which consists of the Grama Sevaka of the area, rural development society member, womens development society member, people from civil society and farmers associations to help the returnees settle in. They also inform OfERR when a new family from Tamil Nadu comes into their area so that assistance can be offered to them quickly.
Sajikaran observed that while many refugees may feel that their government has let them down, compared to the Indian counterpart, even those living here feel the same. Everyone is in the same boat. Those who are living here also have the same problems. They say, we too have suffered, so why is it that those who have left get treated better Also I may have many problems, but for the government, I am just one among 25 other affected families in the village, he said.
Many returnees have also started to feel local resentment building up against them. Poovalasingham Sivabalasingham, 42, who lives in Mullivaikal, Mullaitivu is frustrated that none of his immediate family or neighbours have helped him, his wife and six children since their return in 2014.
We thought that our family was here and that we needed to come back. At first they all came for the money the UNHCR gave us as soon as we returned. But now they have all disappeared and no one is here to help, said Poovalasingham as he struggles to make a living once again while constructing a home for the family.
The war and the Tsunami has changed people, they have become so heartless, this place was much warmer and friendly when we left in 2000, added his wife Sivalakshmi, 41. She is under greater strain having to manage six young boys with no assistance. At camp, there were day care centres and schools close by which provided meals and fellow refugees close at hand to babysit. Here they are on their own in the former war zone. They are yet to get the birth certificates of four of their children sorted.
Poovalasinghams regret of returning is also shared by Anthonypillai 31-year-old Amarithadasan who is looking to migrate to the West at any cost. Having left Sri Lankan when he was three, he returned in 2004, at 18 to face both the Tsunami and the war.
I came back carefree at 18 not knowing anything. It is after I came back that I got to know of the Tamil struggle and we faced the worst of it, he recalled. Anthonypillai having married a local, had also helped the LTTE out with minor tasks. There is no one here who hasnt helped, as not many had a choice, he said. But this got him marked as an LTTE cadre and in 2009 the family fled to India to avoid military interrogation. In 2011 they returned to look after the remaining members of his wifes family.
I am always under watch by the military and I fear for my life. In the last two years, there have been no problems but I am scared that they would make me disappear. I wanted to leave for Switzerland but the agent who promised me passage took my money and disappeared, said Anthonypillai who has not been able to recover from his trauma. He is trained as a painter but has not been able to find much work given the competition from local painters.
As Anthonypillai looks to flee Lankan shores once again, Mutthaiyah said, When I visited Tamil Nadu, I told them, come back or they will take away your land and land prices will go up, making it harder for you to buy a new one. Get back your land first, start now before it is too late. Sitting under the shade of his coconut tree, Mutthaiyah watched his lush paddy field with satisfaction. He is content having returned home after 23 years.
It is difficult to come back but not impossible, he said as he leaned back in his chair enjoying the warm breeze of his homeland.

Verbal communication can be presented in several different ways. Simple, Soft and Calm, quite presentable and pleasant, with positive attitudes of yours, but it is at times rough, tough, harsh and uncontrollable combined with negative attitudes.
Ideas generated by writings. At the early stages it was only through newspapers but now it has exposed extensively via e-mails, internet web browsing, TV, SMS through Mobiles, FB, Linked-In, Twitter etc.
As professionals communication take a major part in your day-to-day activities. Speaking to a person makes you live. Being with people makes you more comfortable. In business, it is a key function of management. An organization cannot operate without communication. It has to be dealt through all levels of staff and people, departments and employees.
Communication is one of the most important and reliable business skills, no matter what your industry is. Yet many of us have not been trained how to communicate with co-workers and clients. Every word repeated must have sense.
Equal attention
While communicating in an organization the first priority will be the people within the organization, it means the employees. The rankings start from the CEO and the Board of Directors, Senior Managers, Executives and Staff. The staff too will be split as minor staff and labourers. You will communicate with outsiders as well.
The most important people are the customers who visit your organization on business transactions. Then there are visitors who comes frequently or once in a way for meetings and other work. These are the types of people you communicate within your daily routine. Pay equal attention to all types of people you communicate with. Do not categorize. Create a positive attitude towards all.
Communicating effectively with all these types of people has to be dealt clearly and carefully. Keep in mind that all are not the same. They have their ways of presenting and speaking. Questioning and answering. As such you have to be eager how you communicate with these types of people. First listen to them while they speak. Make them feel that you respect them and are making every effort to full-fill their requirement.
Listening combines directly with communication. This is a skill which is extremely important in communication. When you listen carefully you can attend to the said task well. If your thoughts run-out when someone is speaking you will be lacking of information. Focus on what is said. Take other things out of your mind when someone is communicating with you verbally. The human mind is easily distracted by other thoughts, Try to put other thoughts out of mind and concentrate on the message that are being communicated
Facial expressions
Be a good listener while speaking to a person of any level or standard. Then be of assistance and support to them. Listening combined through facial expressions too has to be taken into consideration when communicating with all types of people. Sometimes you will be speaking to a person that you do not like speak or sight. Then what will be the situation Do not be confused or puzzled. Take it easy. You must go ahead.
Everyone cannot be in line when it comes to vocabulary. Some are smart enough to add, adjust and make their way to fulfill their communication standards. As such to be effective in your communications use words that can be easily understood. Try to avoid jaw breaking words or words you think it is difficult for you to pronounce. If it takes place you can be misunderstood and there will be no sense of what you have communicated throughout. Explaining and explanations are of waste of your precious time. As such better to try-up with common and normally used words combined to a sentence.
Ensure that you are confident while you communicate. Do not be uncertain while you respond. Confidence is always mastered while you are communicating. You should be strong enough to communicate at a stretch without doubt. Avoid the words such as "um" or "ah".
Every word repeated must have sense. Word is the link of combination between the process or transaction of communication. It initiates response from the listener. Word though it represents only four letters, words are the symbolized power of communication, requiring us to be as highly reliant on how a person sounds and expresses themselves. You as a professional holding a responsible rank in your organization have to be very careful and more effective when you speak. Why should you be careful while communicating or speaking As you must have a clear idea and you must be aware of what you are communicating or speaking about. Every word turned into a sentence becomes a speech and it is communication. It must have the required meaning. Be very polite and concerned when you speak to a person. It is professionalism. Do not nod or say Yes or No for everything which most of us think it is short and sweet. Your response in brief containing a few elegant words will create the required image to the person who speaks to you. This is applicable whether the person is live with you or he/she speaks to you over the phone.
Friendly voice
Another important fact to be careful is not become harsh or lose your temper. Patience is the most valued aspect while you speak. There may be times a person shout or snub you. Do not do the same. Be calm or try to be calm. It is difficult. But under certain circumstances you have to do it.
A word can mean a different thing when said in a different tone of voice. Make sure you use the appropriate tone of voice to communicate so that you wont be misunderstood and discourage. Voice and expressions accompanied by you has to sparkle and shine while you speak or communicate. A passionate and a friendly tone of voice can make your seem more comfortable. It is an attraction! You will somewhat be recognized in the society the way you present your communication skills and ways. Elaborating communication further many of us most of the time listen halfheartedly to many people we meet, we prefer and like to pay attention to a friendly and a powerful voice than to a voice that is dull, monotone, frustrated and angry. Taking these emeralds to shine brighter it is your concern to focus more on your tone of voice and such can be attained with ease with just a little experimentation and practice.
This involves speaking clearly, naturally, with confidence, and without any nerves constricting your voice. The opposite would include shouting or screaming, speaking too quickly, mumbling, and sounding urgent or irritated. Another way to sound passion and power is the way of speaking from the heart.

Brain behind Metallic Hydrogen: Pressing on Pressure
Harvard Universitys Professor Isaac F. Silvera and Dr. Ranga P. Dias, a Sri Lankan post-doctoral researcher, reported in the Journal Science on January 26th that they have succeeded in creating metallic hydrogen, a substance that has been sought after for around 80 years.
The discovery of metallic hydrogen could revolutionise transportation, electronics, and power systems if it is proven to be a superconductor and stable at room temperature and normal pressure, as has been theorized.
Born in Kottawa, Dias spent his childhood and early adult life in Sri Lanka before moving to the United States to pursue a PhD in physics. He is 36 years old and has been working on the metallic hydrogen project at Harvard for the past three years.
The following is an interview with Dr. Dias.
Q: How did you get interested in condensed matter physics
A: Thats a good question to start with. At an early age I was exposed to the term superconductivity. I was a member of an astronomical society in Sri Lanka called the ASSC, or Astronomy and Space Study Center, which is located near the University of Moratuwa. I joined that club when I was 13 years. In that society they do a lot of astronomy and astrophysics. People from all sorts of scientific backgrounds, whether its mathematics, chemistry, or physics, meet at the ASSC and learn from each other. It doesnt matter how old you are, the people there listen to lectures, hold observation sessions, and solve problems together. They had a physics cycle where senior members of the society, who were university students at the time, discussed big problems in physics. So I was exposed to these discussions from an early age, and this superconductor thing always struck me. I felt it would be a neat thing to work on, to see if you could really find a superconductor at room temperature.
Q: What is a superconductor
A: We say superconductors are substances that conduct electricity without any resistance. So far, nobody has found a superconductor that works at room temperature. They do exist but only at very low temperatures. If we can find one that works at room temperature, that could really revolutionise our way of life. To find one of these, you have to study condensed matter physics, and Ive always been focused on that.
Q: Can you tell me how you got from the University of Colombo to Harvard
A: So, I wanted to do condensed matter physics, but I really wanted to do it quickly. In Sri Lanka, we go to university when we are 20 or 21, by the time we finish our undergraduate studies we are 26. So, I applied when I was in my third year at Colombo to graduate programs so that by the time I finished my fourth year I could quickly start my PhD. I graduated in July, and then in August I moved to the United States to do my PhD at Washington State University. At the time, it was considered one of the best universities for extreme condensed matter physics. These are the people who do experiments with extremely high pressure.
My PhD was very successful. I was able to find a new superconductor. It is the simplest molecular superconductor: carbon disulfide. Its just a liquid, but I was able to transform it into a superconductor at a very low temperature, like 6 or 7 Kelvin. People knew about my work, and I got some attention from the scientific field, and then this Harvard group found out about my work, and they invited me to come and work on hydrogen. So thats how I ended up there. They actually asked me to come three times, but the first two times I had some other commitments. But the reason I went is that Harvard is very famous for its research on hydrogen. Professor Isaac Silvera, my current adviser, is one of the pioneers in low temperature physics, and he has been studying hydrogen for quite a while. If you really want to study hydrogen physics, Harvard is the best place to go.
Q: Can you take me through the process of discovering metallic hydrogen
A: Yeah. The recipe is kind of already there. People predicted this more than 80 years ago. Its just a matter of figuring out the correct pressure to make it happen. In a room temperature and normal pressure setting, hydrogen is a gas with molecules that are very, very far apart from each other. So, if you squeeze hydrogen molecules together, then at some point you can dissociate those molecules, and you will have the proper electron arrangement that can conduct electricity. So for that, you have to bring the molecules together by squeezing them hard, and you have two different options to generate really high pressures. The first is creating a shockwave from which you can calculate the pressure exerted on a substance. The other option is to create mechanical pressure by squeezing substances together. This is static compression. Shockwaves only last for very short periods of time, like milliseconds or nanoseconds. But in static conditions, you can have all the time you want.
A lot of materials can go through the transition from gas to solid, such as both oxygen and xenon. Hydrogen is special, though, because it has new exciting and exotic properties. It is a superconductor at room temperature and can also be a superfluid, which is similar to a superconductor, but it can also flow without any resistance. These are highly energetic materials that have the potential to revolutionise the transportation industry and rocket propulsion. Thats why people have wanted to create metallic hydrogen for such a long time. The problem we had was getting there, but we were able to come up with a new technique to somehow achieve the necessary pressure. To get to these higher pressures, we used an apparatus like a nutcracker called a diamond anvil cell. We took two diamonds and placed hydrogen molecules between them. We use diamonds because they are the strongest material that we know of, and also because they are transparent. The transparency allows us to do x-ray and spectroscopic studies, which are very important for our work. So we used that method to generate these higher pressures. But the problem with hydrogen is that it is very diffusive. It can actually go into the diamond and break it. These diamonds, though they were very nicely polished, had a few surface defects when viewed through an atomic microscope. We were able to come up with new techniques to remove these defects. For example, we put a special coating on top of the diamonds so that hydrogen would not diffuse into them. So that gave us an edge to achieve these high-pressure conditions.
Q: How many people worked on this
A: Just my adviser Professor Isaac Silvera and I worked on the project.
Q: Can you talk about the applications of metallic hydrogen outside of space flight Why is this discovery so significant
A: Huge potential lies in its superconductivity. If you really could turn this into a room temperature superconductor, as has been predicted, then you could make wires out of metallic hydrogen that would conduct energy without any dissipation. Right now, if you want to send electricity from the East coast of the US to the West coast, you could lose at least 60 percent of the energy because of the resistance within the wires. But with metallic hydrogen superconducting wires, then you will not have any energy losses. Superconductors also have a property called diamagnetism, which means that, if you put a magnet on top of one, the magnet will float. So you can make magnetically levitated high-speed trains. Right now, you have to cool superconductors down to make them work, but if you can find one at room temperature, transportation will change. Also, the best way to store energy is in superconducting coils. If you store a current in a superconducting coil it will stay there basically forever. Theres no decay, so this would be the best way to store energy. You can think of this technology as an improved battery. It could revolutionise cell phones and any other device that uses a battery. Electronics, transportation, and power systems could all change due to this discovery.
Q: Do you think that the metallic hydrogen will be stable at room temperature with regular pressure
A: The calculations say that it should be metastable, meaning that it should be like a diamond. Let me give you an example. Graphite is the most stable form of carbon at room temperature and pressure. But if you take graphite and squeeze it very hard, it will turn into a diamond. And then once you release the pressure, the diamond stays there and does not revert to graphite. Hydrogen has this exact same property and has a large activation barrier to go back to its original form. Thats the beauty of it. People can think, okay, if metallic hydrogen is only stable under pressure, whats the use of it But we have calculated that it should be stable at room temperature.
Q: Right now, the sample of metallic hydrogen is still under pressure
A: Yes, thats correct.
Q: When do you think you will take the pressure off of it
A: Pretty soon, probably in the next couple of months. We wanted to do X-ray studies too. So after that we will test the metastability.
Q: What do you see as your next project
A: After testing the metastability and the doing the X-Ray studies, we are planning to test its superconductivity, which is the main property everyone is excited about. So for that its going to be somewhat challenging. The sample we are talking about is very small, about 1/10th the width of a human hair. You have to put tiny electrodes onto the sample and measure it. One of the problems is that we use this metal gasket to load the hydrogen into the diamond anvil cell, so we have to find a way to use an insulating gasket instead of a metal one. Otherwise you short the electrodes.
Q: Do you see this being cost-effective in the long term
A: Yes, I would say so, because I think we can find a way to make this happen in large quantities. The only problem is we need to come up with another method of making metallic hydrogen in large quantities. I have some ideas, but we still need to make them happen. Theres also an unlimited supply of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere.
Q: Do you see yourself collaborating with Sri Lankan scientists in the future or moving back here to teach in the near future
A: Im really interested in collaborating. I dont see myself moving back in the near future because the type of research I do at Harvard is quite expensive and needs a lot of funding. Im not sure if theres that level of support in Sri Lanka. But I do believe I can make a bridge between Sri Lanka and here by collaborating with people. There are some experiments that we could do together. For big projects, many small experiments must be done, and maybe we can collaborate on these and do some of the small-scale tests in Sri Lanka. I would also like to guide and teach young scientists. Perhaps we can look into creating joint PhD programs. Thats something I really want to push.

British actress says filming in Sri Lanka helped mend broken heart
The Good Karma Hospital Star Amanda Redman revealed that filming in Sri Lanka helped mend her broken heart after losing several people close to her
For the next two years, it was one disaster after another, said Redman, of the deaths of her mother, her At Home with the Braithwaites co-star Lynda Bellingham, and a close childhood friend too.
She said she hoped her return to Sri Lanka marked the conclusion of this dark period in her life: Its like Ive come back here and the circle of crap is complete and I am so much happier.
Redmans character Lydia is all heart and energy at the centre of the show, despite a shortage of resources, staff and technology.
The show is set in southern India, but monsoon season meant the set had to be moved to Sri Lanka. Its written by Dan Sefton, based on his own experiences as a NHS doctor working in South Africa.
Redman explains: Dan is actually a doctor, who is still practising and has also experienced working in a cottage hospital, so hes had all the experiences hes writing about  running out of money for basic drugs, working without fancy machines  its all real and truthful, and that to me, is everything.
I was reading the last two episodes in bed and sobbing. Ive never read anything like it. Look, Im going now, even thinking about it! Its beautiful but not mawkish. Because actually the minute you get sentimental it becomes soapy and thats not something I would be interested in playing.

Browns Hill comes alive with roar of automobiles on Feb. 26
The hilly slopes of Browns Hill, Matara will be deafened by the incessant cry of motor vehicles on February 26 with the flagging off of the 21st annual Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb. The Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb is an annual motor sports event conducted by the Southern Motor Sports Club (SMSC), which takes place at Browns Hill, Matara, a picturesque small hill, in the midst of salubrious coastal environment of the South. The track lies in the pathway to the residence of the District Secretary (GA) of Matara, a 700-meter long track of winding stretches of narrow tar mac.
This is the first event organized by SMSC in 2017 after Ashhar Hameem has been elected to the presidency of SMSC for a second term.
Known as the only outstation club, unremittingly affiliated to the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS) since its inception in 1997, the SMSC plans to organize this event to perfection. The track preparation, safety standards, time keeping, vehicle recovery processes, competitor relations, etc. are expected to be met best standards available in Sri Lanka.
The Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb track is a unique track, with four extremely tricky and challenging corners; the Single Tree Corner, Southern Corner, Residency Corner and Tower Corner, which the conquering requires high driving skills and perfect man-machine combination. This is the very reason for all well-known drivers in the country taking part in this event amidst a large number of spectators every year. Ace driver Darin Weerasinghe holds the course record for the Eliyakanda Hill Climb with a timing of 32.8 seconds which he established last year riding his Subaru WRX STI X 2000cc car. Sachira Rajakaruna riding a Yamaha YZ 250 recorded the best timing on two wheels (35.64 secs) last year.
This years event will have a practice day on February 25 and the following day main event will consist of 10 motor cycle and 24 motor car events. Scrutinizing of competition vehicles will commence at 7.30 a.m.
The races will start at 9.00 a.m. and the price giving will be held at the Pearl Cliff Hotel, Browns Hill, Matara at 4.00 p.m. This event will sponsored by Sri Lanka Telecom, Ceat Tyres, Mobil, Thamalu Enterprise, Douglas Sons, Viraja Learners, Wurth and many other reputed firms.

Certain powers of Local Authorities withdrawn
The government has taken a decision to partially withdraw certain powers presently delegated to Local Authorities by the UDA Circular No 1 in 1985, to expedite behind the decision was neither a personal vendetta against the local authorities nor a way to earn income for the UDA. The UDA only wants to modernise the methods used in facilitating urban development activities, Dr. Munasinghe said.
Of all development activities the local authorities are responsible for, the UDA receives only one percent. In Colombo, it will be a higher percentage. Most of these activities will be large scale urbanisation programmes. The local authorities will retain powers regarding housing and many other activities, he said.
The UDA is to delegate the withdrawn powers as soon as urbanaising processes are properly organised and modernised, Dr. Munasinghe said.
One of the withdrawn powers is the issuance of preliminary planning clearances for all development activities. Another is the building approvals issuing which includes application processing, charging fees and issuing approvals for selected activities, Dr. Munasinghe said.The inefficiencies, delays, lack of transparency, timeworn technologies and malpractices involved in with the development activities carried out by the local authorities from 1985 to 2015, led to this temporary decision, Dr. Munasinghe said.He said a UDA survey revealed that malpractices amounting to billions of rupees have taken place in the development facilitating process under the local authorities. Dr. Munasinghe said with a modernised process, the public will be able to get preliminary planning clearances within three weeks, if all correct documents are duly provided. He said the UDA is to establish their branches in all districts as a solution to the practical issues that may follow the new changes. The UDA is also responsible for constructing government buildings adopting the Green-concept, as an extension to President Maithripala Sirisenas vision for sustainable development, Dr. Munasinghe said. The UDA is to provide information regarding the withdrawn powers in the authoritys website, he said.
Asked on the UDAs action plan on illegal constructions in and out of Colombo, Dr. Munasinghe said the UDA has already sought legal action against for more than 1,000 cases in this regard.
We have sought legal action against these illegal constructions. There are large scale illegal constructions in Colombo exceeding 2,000. If we consider slums and ghettos, the number rises to 40,000. With the tedious and lengthy legal process, the UDA has to spend a great amount of money on these cases, Dr. Munasinghe said.

Charm of the dawn
Sri Lanka is famous for its exotic natural beauty in whatever the province she secures. The hill country is the middle of the island where anyone could assume the worlds best scenic pictorial beauty and the most venerable area, which carries the Tooth Relic of the Buddha in Kandy and the sacred blotch of the foot of the Buddha placed on the highest elevation of the mountain which called the Sri Pada. It is a holy rock where the four major rivers, Kalu, Kelani, Mahaweli and Walawe commence flowing down from a holy sprout with the blessings of the Buddhas foot covering north, east, south and west. Sri Lanka does not have to speak a day of a heavy drought. The lush greenery is printed as a picture from the very mountain top, bouncing with different attire of nature according to climatic condition in flora and fauna up to the end skirt of the bluish sea surrounding the island.
Adams Peak is the tallest area of the mountain range. It is also famous as Butterfly Rock based on the belief that butterflies fly towards this and knock their heads against this holy rock where they breathe their last with the blessings of the Buddha. Ancient history speaks of Samantha Kuta, Saman Gira and Sri Pada. Yet Christians do believe that this holy footprint belongs to Adam who was created as the first man by the Lord with his wife Eve and this land is the Garden of Eden. Hence the British named it as Adams Peak. There goes another rumour that this print on top of 2243 miles high from sea level, belongs to St Thomas or even Lord Shiva.
Whichever legend one should care to believe this place has even a pilgrimage centre for over 1000 years. The kings of ancient years provided resting places to shelter the weary pilgrims up to the summit.
The pilgrim season is on from December and runs until Vesak festival. The Tourists and locals make the climb up the countless steps to the top. From the summit to the foot of the mountain it is illuminated in season by a string of lights which look very pretty as they snake up the mountainside. Out of season you can still do the walk, but must have a torch. It is a seven-hour climb.
You must also witness the first rays of dawn light up the holy mountain. The fine view of the hill country rises to the east, while to the west the land slopes away to the sea. The shadow of the conic shape of the peak is visible to the west. A very rare holy shadow of the nature you will never see anywhere in the world. John Stills in Jungle Tide describes the peak as a vast and revered cathedral of the human race.
As this seven-mile climb goes up, the climate becomes very chilly where one should carry warm clothes. There are approx. 5200 uphill man made steps to climb with many resting places and restaurants. One should start the climb at 8 pm to witness the charms in the dawn.
You are not allowed to carry litter, alcohol, cigarettes, meat and recorded music as a respect to the atmosphere.
For many people, the hardest part is backtrekking. The endless steps can shake the strongest knees and if your shoes dont fit well then toe-jam starts to hunt too. When coming down, a hat is required as the morning sun rays are quite scorching.
The mini Adams Peak is located in Ella in Badulla. You can also visit Ravana Ella cave, falls, temple Bambaragama falls, Ravana wild sanctuary etc.
