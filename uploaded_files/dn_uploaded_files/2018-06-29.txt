Oil palm cultivation in Kegalle comes to an end
The oil palm cultivation in Kegalle district would be brought to an end, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
He said that there had been a protest from various groups of people including the environmentalists against the oil palm cultivation in Kegalle district. "The Kegalle District Development Committee decided not to allow the oil palm cultivation in Kegalle district," Minister Siyambalapitiya said. "So we would take actions to stop the oil palm cultivation totally. Steps are being taken to get a Court order preventing the oil palm cultivation in the district."
Kegalle District Secretary Chandrasiri Bandara said that there was a trend in Kegalle district to replace the rubber cultivation with oil palm cultivation. "However, 65 percent of the lands in Kegalle district is sloped and the rubber plantation acted as a forest cover," Bandara said. "So the public was cautious and protested against the oil palm cultivation."
He also said that later with the intervention of Minister Navin Dissanayake the cultivation of oil palm cultivation was suspended temporarily until the environment report is prepared by a committee appointed by the Kegalle District Secretariat. He added that however, some of the Rubber Estate Companies in Kegalle district were continuing the oil palm cultivation secretly.
He added that due to this reason and after considering the impact on the environment, it has been decided to bring the oil palm cultivation to an end in Kegalle district.

Raise a happy and healthy kitten
Getting a new kitten is one of the best things in the world. Theyre cute, soft as down, and as cuddly as, well, kittens. Nearly irresistible, kittens melt even the toughest of hearts.
It's good to get things started off on the right paw, and the food and care you choose can make all the difference in the health and happiness of your growing kitten. Here are 10 starter tips for you and your "mew" companion.
1. Continue feeding your kitten its "normal" diet, but slowly introduce high quality kitten food (i.e., high in protein and taurine, and low in fillers and carbs) into the mix; consult your veterinarian as to what best serves your cat. After it has adjusted, feed it the high quality food exclusively.
2. Feed your kitten at least three times a day from a shallow plate. Remember, theyre tiny things and so they need easy access to their food. Snacks, especially during the growing stage, should also be included. Small amounts of high-protein foods like cooked egg yolk, boneless fish, and cooked or raw liver will be a great treat, and will help build strong bones.
3. That said, it's alright to feed your kitten frequently while it is growing (under six months old), even several times a day. If your kitten prefers grazing or eats modestly, keep a small amount of dry kibble available in a dish for it throughout the day.
4. Always have fresh water available and check it throughout the day for cleanliness. Keep in mind that water is enough, no other liquid needs to be given. In fact, cow milk can cause quite a tummy ache and should be avoided.
5. When you first bring your kitten home, its a good idea to keep your kitten in the same room with the litter box for a few days so that it may get used to it. Kittens dont need much in the way of training. Often, just knowing where the box is enough of an incentive to use it; cats naturally prefer to bury their waste.
6. Keep a close eye on your kitten. Theyre small, curious, and can get into trouble. It is all too easy for a small animal to get caught between furniture and appliances, fall into a toilet, or be stepped on. Until it learns self safety, you will be your kitten's best line of defense.
7. Take your kitten for a checkup and all appropriate immunizations.
8. Play with your kitten. A piece of string, crumpled paper, or a toy from pet store -- almost anything can be a toy. Kittens (and cats) love to play. The bond you begin now, through play and unconditional love, will be unshakable for many years to come.
Love your kitten and treat it well. Soon, your kitten will grow into a beautiful, faithful, and loving cat.

RAJIVA WIJETUNGE: A shining example of a record 40 years in TT
A promising cricketer with tremendous potential to hit the big time, but who prematurely quit the lovely game of cricket to concentrate on table tennis and athletics was Royalist RAJIVA WIJETUNGE.
Now called a FRCS  an acronym for - Former Royal College Students -. In medical terms FRCS stood for - Fellow Of the ROYAL College of Surgeons. But now Old Royalists revel in being tagged FRCS.
Having said that WIJETUNGE'S first love was cricket at Royal after performing brilliantly under captains Ranjan Madugalle and Ashok Jayawickrema. A Sri Lanka cap could have been his for the asking, but he quit cricket luverly cricket and put aside his talent with bat and ball and took to a tryst with Table Tennis and Track and Field In which games he excelled.
Keen cricket fan
WIJETUNGE who is still a keen cricket fan, keeps a tag as to what is happening on the cricket field, reached the top in Table Tennis, being a player of more than ordinary promise where he missed by a whisker of sporting national colours in this sport was just one of those things. He reached a milestone completing 40 memorable years in the table game and is still going strong.
That is an achievement of great significance. It is said that many are called, but a few are chosen and this saying rings true of the unassuming and ever ready to help WIJETUNGE who while sporting that certain smile still keeps going forward playing the sport he loved with the enthusiasm and intensity of a schoolboy.
WIJETUNGE in addition to his prowess in cricket, excelled in table tennis and was also a superb athlete. He could well be tagged an all round sportsman and a pride to his school and the clubs he represented.
Frame to be admired
I have watched and followed WIJETUNGES sporting career from the time he opened bowling for his school and to the time of writing. With a frame to be admired, strong and sturdily built, he was a batsmans nightmare when with new ball in hand.
He could vary his deliveries, with competent swing both ways, with good speed and also packed a stinging bouncer. As a batsman, he could contribute using the long handle as it was then known with big hitting.
Although he is now known for his dominance in table tennis, I would like to first start with his cricket career at Royal. He was lucky to have a captain in Ranjan Madugalle and he says Madugalle had natural talent and was a good thinker of the game and playing exquisite strokes all round the wicket with a straight bat and says he was fortunate to have played under him.
Leading by example
Little wonder then that Madugalle captained the country, making runs leading by example and who is now a much sought after Chief Test match referee.
In addition to having Madugalle to show him how, he had the good fortune of coming under competent coaches in Gamini Salgadoe, Mahes Rodrigo and Vijaya Malasekera who etched a niche during their careers as Royal cricketers.
WIJETUNGE rode the high horse when he became President of the Table Tennis Association of Sri Lanka and was elated when under his Presidency Udaya Ranasinghe won a Gold Medal in the junior boys singles event at the South Asian Table Tennis Championships in 2015 and it was the first time that a Lankan had won a gold medal in an international tournament.
List of achievements
Heres a list of his achievements that he, his school, club, the country, employers Ceylinco and MAS Holdings could well be proud of. Starting with cricket where his best bowling figures were 5 for 20 against St. Benedicts College and had a match bag of 8 for 37. With the willow his best was an unbeaten 54 against Richmond College.
He also played Donovan Andree and for CCC and had best bowling figures against Cots 7 for 21 with his blistering pace. He also played under former Sri Lanka captain Michael Tissera when CCC won the Sara trophy and also played for Nomads. In a Donovan Andree game he made 138 against Bloomfield.
At school he won colours for cricket, table tennis and athletics. He helped Royal win the Most popular team of the year award in 1979. Won the Best Bowlers award at the Royal-Thomian Mustangs trophy 50-over game. Was a member of the Royal TT team in 1974 which won the junior and senior inter-school tournaments. He captained the school in TT team in 1976.
Putt Shot record
WIJETUNGE holds the schools under 14 Putt Shot record which he established in 1973. Since 2002 he has represented the Sri Lanka Veterans TT teams and toured China, Japan, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa and Singapore.

The New York Times in an article titled How China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port published on Monday (25) revealed that nearly US$ 7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbours account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of former President Rajapaksas campaign.
It further stated that the details were on a document from an internal government investigation.
The article stated that the document details China Harbours bank account number - ownership of which was verified and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out.
Minister Ramanayake addressing the media after filing the complaint said that he contacted the Times journalists who revealed the allegations before making the complaint to the FCID.
He challenged former President Rajapaksa to file a case against the NYT if they claim to refute all the allegations exposed in the article.

Ratmalana Airport to undergo expansion
The Ratmalana Airport is poised to undergo expansion, said Minister of Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva addressing an event held in Colombo recently.
The minister said he managed to get about 25 acres of land in the Ratmalana airport released by paying Rs725 million to the air force to relocate their hangers elseware. But this will not fully solve the problem to help the private entrepreneurs who want to come into the Ratmalana Airport to commence aviation related businesses, as there was a huge demand, he said.
We need to expand the Ratmalana Airport. We are spending about Rs one billion in installing the latest navigation equipment, he said.
The Batticaloa airport has now been converted to a fully fledged civilian airport and Hingurakgoda, Palali and many other airports are in the process of being transformed into civil airports, he said. Since the country have come into a new era of development and in view of the large tourist influx particularly high end, and the inflow of investors, the aviation industry needs to flourish. And particularly since the era of air restriction is over the people must also reap the benefit of peace that has dawned in the country.
Therefore internal flight services, air transportation and flying schools are areas, that must undergo rapid development, he said.

Read on !
There is nothing quite like the feel and smell of a book. Nothing digital comes near it. Having said that, reading, whether in paper form or on a screen, has many benefits.
Reading has many incredible benefits. Here are a few of them.
Stimulates the mind  Studies have shown that if you are constantly stimulating your mind, you slow the progress of mental diseases can even prevent them. Keeping your brain active and engaged prevents it from losing its power by sharpening its logical ability. The brain, though an organ, operates very much like a muscle  you have to exercise it to keep it healthy and strong.
Acquire knowledge  Everything you read fills your head with new bits of information, and you never know when it might come in handy. The more knowledge you have, the better-equipped you are and the more able you become to tackle challenges. Even if you ever were to lose everything you physically possess, your brain has an unlimited capacity for storing and using knowledge youve acquired all your life. Use it!
Hones critical and analytical skills  Have you ever read an amazing mystery novel and solved the mystery yourself before finishing the book If so, you were able to put your critical thinking skills to work by taking note of all the details provided and sorting them out to determine whodunnit. That same ability to analyze details comes in handy when it comes to critiquing the plot, determining whether it was a well-written piece, if the characters were properly developed, if the storyline ran smoothly, etc. Should you ever have an opportunity to discuss the book with others, youll be able to state your opinions clearly, as youve taken the time to really consider all the aspects involved. Even in real life, critical thinking skills are essential.
Being able to solve problems given certain elements are a part of daily life  from finishing a project for work to figuring out how to navigate difficult relationships, possessing critical thinking skills are necessary in all walks of life.
Improvesmemory  When you read a book, you have to remember an assortment of characters, their backgrounds, ambitions, histories, and nuances, as well as the various arcs and sub-plots that weave their way through every story. Amazingly enough, every new memory you create forges new synapses (brain pathways) and strengthens existing ones, which assists in short-term memory recall.
Boosts concentration  In our internet-crazed world, attention is drawn in a million different directions at once as we attempt to juggle several tasks at once. Studies have shown that in a single 5-minute span, the average person will divide their time between working on a task, checking email, chatting with a couple of people (via online chat and/or in person), keeping an eye on social media and monitoring their smartphone. This type of behavior in which we are constantly distracted causes stress levels to rise and lowers our productivity. While reading a book, however, all of your attention is focused on the storycausing the rest of the world to fall away as you immerse yourself in every fine detail seen from the point of view of another. Try reading for 15-20 minutes before work and youll be surprised at how much more focused you are once you get to the office.
A fun source of entertainment  Theres a reading genre for every literate person on the planet, and whether your tastes lie in classical literature, poetry, fashion magazines, biographies, religious texts, young adult books, self-help guides, street lit or romance novels, theres something out there to capture your curiosity and imagination. Whether you choose to nourish your inner escapist or feed your brain with new knowledge, step away from the computer for a little while, crack open a book and feel free to replenish your soul for a little while.
Feeds your imagination  The story of a book will absorb your mind so let your imagination fly. While you are reading, you are building images, faces, places, colors, settings and stimulating your creative juices. You connect all these creations and making changes while you keep reading as your worldview expands. Allowing your mind to explore a new literary world opens the door of new ideas, subjects and situations that can get you thinking on trying new experiences.
Reduces stress  No matter how much stress you are going through at work, in your personal life or anywhere else, reading a good story can help you take your mind off these difficult situations. A nice novel can help distract you, while an interesting article can slip your mind out of your problems of that present moment. All allow you to relax and release any tension, especially if youre reading a subject you are personally interested in.

## Title: Redress to all communities who have suffered
## Supertitle: Reparations Act: Not compensation for LTTE cadres:
## Section: Features

Reparations Act: Not compensation for LTTE cadres:
Redress to all communities who have suffered
A few days ago, Sri Lanka took yet another significant step on its path to reconciliation and healing. The Cabinet endorsed the Office for Reparations Act, which establishes an independent authority tasked with formulating, designing and implementing reparations policies, aiming to redress victims who had suffered violations in the course of the past conflicts in Sri Lanka. This Office will receive applications from the aggrieved persons and recommend to the Cabinet of Ministers most effective forms of individual and collective reparations, including specialized policies on public education, memorialization and on children, youth, women and victims of sexual violence and persons with disabilities.
As is usually the case in our country, those prone to political opportunism which prioritises their personal wellbeing over the countrys unity and prosperity, immediately attempted to confuse the public with various misinterpretations of the Acts provisions. Unfortunately, this confusion was not helped by a separate initiative by the Minister of Resettlement, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs D.M. Swaminathan, which supposedly referred to some form of compensation for ex-LTTE cadres. Although his proposals were rejected by the Cabinet, it was in the interest of the victims and the public at large, to put to bed any confusion about the Office for Reparations Act and its aims.
Sri Lanka's Constitution clearly recognizes that every single Sri Lankan has the right to enjoy equal protection before the law. The state therefore, recognizes the dignity of all victims of past conflicts. It also recognizes, as the Act stipulates, that the respect for their right to an effective remedy would contribute to the promotion of reconciliation for the well being and security of all Sri Lankans, including the future generations. We all know that the end of the war does not mean an end to the pains and sufferings endured by the victims. Many Sri Lankans of different backgrounds, still suffer the impact of violations, including physical disability, psychological trauma, loss of property, poverty, marginalization and other forms of harm. Reparations are a method of alleviating the enduring suffering, but also could empower the entire communities and restore them as rights holders and equal citizens. Literally all written and oral submissions received by the Consultation Task Force (CTF), spoke of at least one aspect of reparations. This is precisely why the Office for Reparations was established.
The law is clear: Reparations are not given on the basis of the victims ethnic or religious background, or belonging to any particular political group. To imply that this law is somehow designed to favour one group over the others, is simply not true. All Sri Lankans are equal under the law and this Act clearly stipulates that reparations could be awarded to the aggrieved persons who are victims of:
- Violation of human rights or humanitarian law (as contained in the First, Second, Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions of 1949), or
- Families of persons killed or missing as a result of such violations crucially, in order to be eligible for reparations under this law, the aggrieved persons had to suffer such violations in the course of, or in relation to:- The conflict which took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces or its aftermath;
- In connection with political unrest or civil disturbances; or
- In the course of systematic gross violations of the rights of individuals, groups or communities of people of Sri Lanka; or
- Due to an enforced disappearance as defined in the International Convention for the Protection of all persons from the Enforced Disappearance Act, No. 5 of 2018.
There is absolutely no way that any particular group would have preference over another in this process. The Office for Reparations would be an independent authority, which would receive applications from all Sri Lankans who fall under the above described criteria, without any discrimination due to ethnic, linguistic, religious, gender or other background. The Office will determine the best and most comprehensive form of reparation, taking into account the gravity of the violations, the type of needs and the capacities of the state and will not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity or religious affiliation.
Reparations are not new for Sri Lanka. The Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority (REPPIA) played an important role in trying to repair the victims of conflict and natural disasters, but it also faced significant challenges. There has been disappointment and dissatisfaction among victims surrounding their past experiences of reparations. According to the Consultation Task Force report, the promise of reparations has faced barriers and/or biases due to the inadequacy of administrative processes.
It is time to change that. It is time to strengthen the capacity of the state to reach out to victims of violations, to consult with them and to establish appropriate individual and collective forms of reparation.The Office for Reparations Act marks the beginning of this process, which would ensure that no Sri Lankan is left to languish as a result of harms they had suffered as a result of the conflict. This is what our Constitution, our conscience and the future of our children demand.

Sampath Bank, BSL sign  Memorandum of Understanding
Sampath Bank, recently entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Biodiversity Sri Lanka (BSL).
In a significant change to typical conservation initiatives the MoU will allow each organisation to work in concert with other, state and private sector, partners towards the restoration of degraded fern land in Halgahawala, Opatha and the development of a biodiversity credit accrual system for Sri Lanka.
The MoU was signed by Dilhan Fernando, Chairman Biodiversity Sri Lanka and Aruna Jayasekera, Group Chief Human Resource Officer Sampath Bank.
Sampath Bank is a national icon that has always worked to steward the country towards a brighter future. This is why we are proud to have them on-board this landmark partnership that will have a significant impact on the future of Sri Lanka, said Dilhan Fernando, Chairman, Biodiversity Sri Lanka.
This MoU further showcases Sampath Banks commitment to the environment and creating a green future for the nation. The five year long arrangement will allow the Bank to fund BSLs pilot project in the Kanneliya Conservation Forest as well as work closely with partners to monitor its progress based on ecological and biological indicators.
The first phase of this project has produced the biodiversity baseline and management plan for the degraded forest patch of 10ha in Halgahawala, Opatha.
The project will restore this patch of highly degraded rainforest using principles of restoration ecology to enhance its ecological functions, habitat quality, species diversity and its capacity to provide biodiversity and ecosystem services in close approximation to what prevails at the nearby rainforest. In parallel to the restoration, the project will also develop a biodiversity credit accrual system using the insights derived, with the aim of assigning a unit value for enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services.
A secondary benefit of the project is that it will boost the local economy by providing employment opportunities to adjacent communities. Commenting on this historic partnership Aruna Jayasekera, Group Chief Human Resource Officer, Sampath Bank, said, As one of Sri Lankas leading national banks that has been serving the masses for over three decades, we see it as our duty to proactively tackle challenges that may adversely affect our nation.

Free tablets to advanced level students
Six member committee to  make recommendations
A committee of six members will be appointed to take a final decision on giving free tablets to Advanced Level students, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The Minister, responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, said it was decided at the last Cabinet meeting to appoint an Expert Committee comprising two nominees of the President, two nominees of the Prime Minister and two nominees of the Education Ministry to study and make recommendations with regard to the free-tablet project. A Cabinet Paper presented by Minister Kariyawasam to go ahead with the project of distributing tablets free of charge to schoolchildren did not receive the Cabinet approval on Tuesday as the President expressed his reservations on it. The project was halted on the instructions of President Sirisena in February.
The minister said the President asked to first carry out a pilot project on the initiative. Kariyawasam expressed his determination to go ahead with the move as a pilot project, adding that a decision as to whether it will cover the students in whole country will be taken after considering the committees recommendations.
He said the Government has also paid special attention to the complaints of charging exorbitant fees by private schools to admit students.
Commenting on current political affairs, the minister drew parallels between former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and German dictator Hitler saying that both were vegetarians and that Hilter was not a citizen of Germany, but a citizen of Austria, and likewise Rajapaksa is not a citizen of Sri Lanka, but a citizen of the US.
If he has any affection to this country, he should have obtained Sri Lankan citizenship irrespective of whether he contests elections or not. Seeking citizenship to grab political power or positions is not morally correct. It is clear that he is asking for power to usher in a fascist rule, he added.
Responding to a question by a journalist who queried as to whether the Government would conduct an investigation into the revelations that Chinese companies pumped millions of dollars to former President Mahinda Rajapaksas polls campaign in 2015, the minister said they also have questions over the pace of investigations with regard to certain cases.
However he was optimistic that those investigations would be fast tracked when the special courts come into operation.

Sketching the Island Mentality
Island Mentality, a group exhibition of work by five artists, namely Muvindu Binoy, Hashan Cooray, Pramith Geekiyanage, Firi Rahman and Kanesh Thabendran opens to the public today and will remain open daily until July 14 at the Saskia Fernando Gallery, 41 Horton Place, Colombo 7, 10am to 6pm.
As the island moved towards achieving independence in 1948, the modernist movement also known as the 43 Group changed the influences on traditional norms in Sri Lankan art. During the war the 90s movement began to redefine these westernized practicesand current influences see a new momentum in a post war environment that has opened up the islands art scene to South Asia and the world. A growing interest in the works of the modern art movement internationally and the inclusion of young artists in presentations of South Asian art ensure that the history of the Sri Lankan art scene is established and the future is well sustained. Inevitably the criticism and expectations that follow this interest begin to form stereotypes in the definitions being presented to the outside world. Whether towards the organic way in which the art community chooses to function, or the assumed elitist approach towards engaging with art; these criticisms place a large, diverse art scene into a small space of expectations and preferences that seeks to find parallels with the contemporary art scene internationally, or sensationalize the content that is easier to approach.
Island Mentality seeks to expand these perceptions by redefining the stereotypes and over simplifications often associated with the outsiders perspective. As a pun on the term Island Mentality the five artists exhibits represent adversity in visual and verbal languages whilst renouncing any expected norms or criteria. By combining these works that neither sensationalizes politics nor collectively portray a narrative it is the individuality of process that can be accredited in placing their work at the forefront of art practices in Sri Lanka today. These five artists are self-taught and of formal education backing, they work with politically conceptual content and abstract forms of expression, they are traditional and new media practitioners.

Review of Sri Lanka-West Indies Test series :
Troubled tour ends with a win
Sri Lankas troubled tour of the Caribbean ended with a win in the third and final Test that enabled the tourists to share the three-Test series one-all with one drawn. The result meant that Sri Lanka will have another long wait for their next visit to the West Indies to try and achieve a series win in the Caribbean. On their last tour too in 2008 they drew the Test series one-all. This was the first time that Sri Lanka played a three-Test series in the West Indies.
This current tour provided them with the best opportunity to break that hoodoo and secure a maiden series victory but everything went awry for the Lankans from the first Test onwards which they lost by a big margin of 226 runs at Port-of-Spain. Although they fought back in the second Test at St Lucias bad weather proved a stumbling block and the match ended in a draw. Prior to going into the third and final Test which was a night game at Bridgetown, Barbados the Lankans encountered a number of controversies that resulted in the captain Dinesh Chandimal having to miss the Test following a ICC suspension and fine on him for ball tampering, a hand injury to key spinner Rangana Herath and the sending off home of young leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay on disciplinary grounds.
What one can assume from all these occurrences is that it brought the team together and what we saw at Bridgetown was a determined effort put up by the eleven selected players to save face from all that they had been through over the past week or so. Entrusted with the captaincy of his country for the first time fast bowler Suranga Lakmal, the vice-captain of the team led from the front to fashion out a handsome four-wicket win for his country and ensure that the Sobers-Tissera trophy played for the Test series remained with Sri Lanka. Mind you the team didnt have experienced batters like Angelo Mathews (on paternal leave) and Dimuth Karunaratne (injured) but yet managed to beat the West Indies who were at full strength and become the first Asian country to record a win at this venue.
Lakmal was first promoted to vice-captain during the Test series against Bangladesh in January this year following his success as captain in leading Tamil Union to win the Premier League championship after 65 years in 2015-16. With Chandimal along with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and manager Asanka Gurusinha facing further charges by the ICC for breaching the spirit of cricket by holding up the second Test for two hours and liable to be suspended from two to four Tests, Lakmal may find his new responsibilities as Test captain extended to the South African series starting next month as well.
SPINNERS TAKE A BACK SEAT
This was a series where the spinners took a back seat and the fast men from both sides dominated proceedings. Lankan spinners Herath, Dilruwan Perera and Akila Dananjaya managed only eight wickets amongst them while the pacies Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara and Kasun Rajitha raked in a handsome 40 wickets.
From the West Indies side their only front line spinner Devendra Bishoo picked up only four wickets from three Tests as many as part time spinner Roston Chase took in one innings of the Port-of-Spain Test. The rest of the wickets were consumed by Shannon Gabriel (20 wickets), skipper Jason Holder (12), Kemar Roach (11) and Miguel Cummins (3).
What the series proved is that if the pitches and conditions are right Sri Lanka had a pace quintet to trouble the opposition and win matches. But the big question is whether back in Sri Lanka they would get the same type of pitches they encountered in the Caribbean. With the next Test series being against South Africa at home, it would be ideal if Sri Lanka can prepare fast and green pitches with bounce so that their bowlers can continue the good work and the batsmen now having accustomed themselves to the fast bouncy surfaces of the West Indies confidently counter the likes of Rabada, Philander, Ngidi and Steyn. Or will Sri Lanka with the desperate desire to win the two-Test series make turners to suit their spinners Herath, Perera, Dananjaya and Sandakan
The Caribbean pitches proved a testing ground for our top order batsmen against pace and only two came out on top  Chandimal and Kusal Mendis who each managed a century in the series and made over 200 runs.
But what stands out here is the courageous knock of 28 not out off 43 balls from Kusal Perera following a nasty accident while fielding the previous day that saw him stretchered out and with a big question mark against him batting during Sri Lankas run chase. Perera batted with a lot of discomfort no doubt but stuck to his guns to steer his team home for a memorable win. Playing the supporting role perfectly was Dilruwan Perera who has on many occasions produced some unique knocks in Tests. This one when the team was in dire straits at 81-6 chasing 144 for victory would surely rank as one of his best innings. He proved the ideal foil to the aggressive Kusal playing a sheet anchor role scoring 23 not out off 68 balls in a match winning partnership of 63 for the seventh wicket. Dilruwan has no doubt proved himself to be a more than useful all-rounder in the Lankan line up.
What Kusal Pereras batting down the order proved is that he is no Test opener. His contribution as an opener in the series was 0, 12, 32, 20 and 0. The sooner the Lankan management and the national selectors get this into their heads it will be better for the team. Perera does not have the technique to survive the new ball at the start of an innings - he is too flashy and loose in his stroke play to provide the start that Sri Lanka needs to lay a platform for their middle order batsmen to prosper. The best way to harness the talent of Kusal Perera and maximize it is to send him lower down the order.
Mahela Udawatte the other batsman slotted into the openers berth is not Test class at all. For ten years since making his entry into international cricket at the age of 21 he played only ODIs and T20Is and was looked up as a one-day cricketer. To take the step from one day cricket to Test is a massive one and Udawatte no doubt failed miserably.
PERMANENT BATTING SPOTS
It is high time that the team management stopped experimenting with the exceptionally talented Kusal Mendis and gave him a permanent slot in the batting order. He should bat at either 3 or ideally 4. He is so talented that he will score a hundred in any position he is asked to bat like he showed in the first Test when he opened. The same goes with another classy batsman Dhananjaya de Silva who having the experience of opening at domestic level for Tamil Union would be ideal at no. 3.
The fitness issues concerning former captain Angelo Mathews (although he didnt return home on those grounds on this occasion) puts a big question mark on his career how long he will be able to serve his country. It is good that Sri Lanka has batsmen in the caliber of Kusal Perera and Roshen Silva around to shore-up the batting if needed with Niroshan Dickwella playing a pivotal role as wicket-keeper cum batsman at number 7.
As for the West Indies who are ranked well below Sri Lankas no. 6 at 9 to draw the Test series was a commendable effort. Sri Lanka was expected to beat the Windies but their batting fell foul of the pace attack spearheaded superbly by Gabriel. In the West Indies batting spunky wicket-keeper Shane Dowrich was the pick of their batsmen proving a thorn to the Lankans scoring a century and two fifties in the series and accounting for 13 catches behind the wicket to win the Player of the Series award.

## Title: Is Trumps America the safest country in the world
## Supertitle:

Is Trumps America the safest country in the world
To paraphrase Ronald Reagan: Are you safer than you were a year ago Are you less at risk of serious harm, external dangers, sudden violence, or a loss of freedom or safety Contrary to the alarmist suggestions of populists out to create panic and the breathless paranoia that dominates the news cycle, the answers are mostly reassuring for the West and other major powers.
Consider the United States. Despite U.S. President Donald Trumps systematic attempts to destroy whats left of the existing world order, the immediate threats to Americans havent changed much since a year ago. And if you take the long-term perspective, the United States might even be the safest country in the world  or at least the only one whose greatest risk is its own citizens.
One sign of that continued stability is the complacency in most global markets. If the risk of war involving major powers were clearly increasing, one would expect this heightened geopolitical risk to be dragging down equities, discouraging investment, and slowing global growth. But the Dow Jones industrial average is up more than 15 percent on the year, the Nasdaq composite is up 25 percent, and thus far the market has been shrugging off the U.S. decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal, the possibility of a trade war, and the wild tango between North Koreas Kim Little Rocket Man Jong Un and Donald Dotard Trump.
To be fair, its not just Wall Street: The FTSE in London and the DAX in Germany are both up about 3 percent on the year, and the Japanese Nikkei index and Hong Kongs Hang Seng index have risen more than 12 and 15 percent, respectively. Maybe the markets are wrong, but theyre not pricing in a lot of geopolitical risk right now, which suggests the major powers are about as safe today as they were last year  though long-term trends for non-Americans are another matter.
There are, in fact, millions of people around the world who are in far greater immediate peril than they were one year ago. For the most part, however, they tend to be in places far from the United States and countries that most Americans are perfectly happy ignoring.
Why do I think this
*The United States
The good news  if you happen to be American  is that youre in no greater danger of outside attack today than you were last year. The United States is still thousands of miles away from most sources of trouble  those oceanic moats still matter in many ways  and it still has robust nuclear and conventional forces that can deter or thwart any serious attack on the U.S. homeland. Americans should also be grateful that it would take a lot more than a few stupid presidential tweets to turn Canada into an enemy. The danger from terrorism remains remote; in 2017, in fact, terrorists killed a grand total of 17 people in the United States itself. Maybe you were really worried about North Koreas small nuclear arsenal and primitive (but improving) missile capabilities, but thats a serious danger only if you assume Kim Jong Un and his associates are suicidal. In fact, theres no evidence of a death wish among North Koreas ruling elite, and thus far Kim has shown himself to be a ruthless but rational leader.
Indeed, despite last years saber rattling, the risk of a U.S. war with North Korea was always pretty low. I have no idea why Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass thought the odds of war were 50-50, or why the former CIA head John Brennan judged the risk to be 20 to 25 percent. If asked, Id have said 10 percent or less, even at the height of the Kim-Trump tweetstorm and the talk of bloody nose strikes. Why Because attacking a nuclear-armed power is inherently risky, there were never any good military options, and local U.S. allies and China were strongly opposed to any use of force. So the United States wasnt in much danger back then and is in a bit less danger now. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any country attacking the United States anytime soon, which means itll only be at war if it decides to attack someone else. That risk has gone up somewhat in the past year  especially with respect to Iran  as discussed at greater length below.
The bottom line is that Americans continue to enjoy the luxury of surplus security, at least from foreign attack. Instead, the biggest threats of violent death come from their fellow citizens. There have been more than 1,300 mass shootings (i.e., four or more fatalities) on U.S. soil since 2014, including repeated and horrific massacres at public schools, and more than 56,000 Americans were killed with guns between 2014 and 2017. That is more lives than the United States lost in Vietnam, a war that lasted more than decade.
Americans are also at greater risk due to some recent government decisions. Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association Forum, David Cutler and Francesca Dominici of Harvard University conclude that the Trump administrations decision to relax clean air standards is likely to cost the lives of over 80 000 US residents per decade and lead to respiratory problems for many more than 1 million people. External threats remain low, but that doesnt mean Americans will be able to take a deep breath and relax.
*Europe
What about Europe If you focus solely on the short term, the risk of war has not increased appreciably in the past year.
The only potential source of serious conflict is between Russia and some of its neighbors, but Russia has its hands full in Crimea, its economy remains fragile, and NATO has sent clear signals of its continued commitments in the East, though Lord knows what Trump will do or say at the next NATO summit. And good news: The crime rate in Germany is at its lowest since 1992, no matter what the U.S. president seems to think.

IMCD is a non-for-profit organization spearheaded by a group of passionate youth intending to encourage community development in Sri Lanka, Eka Ahasak Yata is one such an initiative spearheaded in 2017. This year Eka Ahasak Yata is focusing on raising funds to eradicate Chronic Kidney Diseases of unknown etiology (CKDu) from Sri Lanka through distribution of water purification systems - RO plants (Reverse Osmosis Plants).
Eka Ahasak Yata is a well curated show with finely tuned pieces by talented pool of artists, set to indulge the audience in music while contributing towards a worthy cause. This magical evening will take place at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) on the June 30 from 6.30pm onwards.
Lahiru Perera La Signore, Raini Charuka Goonathillake, Mihindu Ariyaratne, Ridma Weerawardena and Supun Perera will perform on the day with DADDY Band to create a scintillating atmosphere at Eka Ahasak Yata.
With Eka Ahasak Yata - Everyone Deserves Clean Water IMCD is looking to provide a solution to the growing rate of Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka. Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) has become a major health issue in Sri Lanka for the past two decades and it has caused more than 23,000 deaths within the period. The probable cause for CKDu is the consumption of water that is exposed to agrochemicals that contain heavy metals such as Arsenic and Cadmium. Drinking water sources such as tube wells and irrigation tanks in North Central Province and other affected Provinces are contaminated by these heavy metals.
Beside water being a primary requisite for survival, it is unfortunate that a considerable population of Sri Lanka doesnt have access to clean drinking water even today, thus causing over 2,000 number of deaths per year. Recognizing the urgency for support, IMCD spearheaded this initiative Everyone Deserves Clean Water to provide RO (Remote Osmosis) Plants to inflicted areas in Northern Central Province.

US, Russia agree to Putin-Trump summit
RUSSIA: Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a summit with Donald Trump in a third country at talks Wednesday with the US leaders national security advisor, voicing hope for an easing of tensions.
Hawkish US envoy John Bolton was received in Moscow with top honours, a lunch hosted by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov followed by a markedly courteous meeting with Putin at the Kremlin.
US-Russian relations have been strained by disagreement over the Syrian conflict, Russias annexation of Crimea, its involvement in eastern Ukraine and allegations of political meddling.
The Kremlins top foreign policy aide said Putin and Bolton agreed that the two presidents would meet at a place and time to be announced on Thursday.
Your visit to Moscow gives us hope that we can at least take the first step to reviving full-blown ties between our states, Putin told Bolton at the Kremlin after the two smiled and shook hands for the cameras.
We never sought confrontation, Putin said, adding he regretted that Russia-US ties were not on top form.
Bolton, previously known for his hawkish reputation and tough stance on Moscow, said it was important to keep talking and complimented Putin on his handling of the football World Cup, currently taking place in Russia.
Even in earlier days when our countries had differences our leaders and their advisors met and I think that was good for both countries, good for stability in the world and President Trump feels very strongly on that subject, he said.
Recently, ties have been strained by a probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and suspected collusion with the Trump campaign, as well as by the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.
Back in Washington, Trump said he had not yet heard a full report from Bolton about plans for a Putin summit, but it would look like we will probably be meeting sometime in the not too distant future. Some Trump critics in Washington has expressed concern that, in his eagerness to come back from a summit with a deal, Trump might concede too much to Putin without getting much in return.
But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told US lawmakers on Wednesday that Washington regards Russias annexation of Crimea, intervention in Ukraine and partial occupation of Georgia as entirely illegal.
And he said he was sure that when Trump meets Putin he will make clear that meddling in our elections is completely unacceptable.
In Moscow, Bolton told a news conference that the idea that a summit would prove some kind of nexus between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin would be complete nonsense.
What must guide his conduct of American foreign policy is the pursuit of American national interests, Bolton said of Trump
He will do this regardless of political criticism at home.
Putins foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said the two Presidents would focus on relations between their two countries, Syria and nuclear arms control and could adopt a joint statement to help improve ties as well as global security. The last, brief meeting between Putin and Trump took place in November 2017 in Vietnam during an APEC summit.
Trump is due to participate in the July 11 and 12 NATO summit in Brussels before heading to Britain to meet with Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II on July 13. - AFP

The World Bank yesterday highlighted four economic policy priorities for Sri Lanka, that include  continuing of fiscal consolidation, pursuing export and investment led growth, improving governance and managing debt risks, in order to sustain future economic growth, create better and more jobs, and thereby reduce poverty.
These must be addressed through macro economic and structural reforms, Senior Country Economist for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Ralph van Doorn said.
Launching the Sri Lankas new Development Update in Colombo yesterday, he said, the key challenges are inter-linked and require a comprehensive and coordinated approach. Although domestic political considerations and institutional constraints on policy implementation make it challenging, a strong political will and the support of the bureaucracy could help with advancing the reform agenda. Steps need to be taken to ensure the support of the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders through improved communications on costs and benefits of the reform agenda.
In 2017, for the first time in decades, Sri Lankas fiscal revenue exceeded expenditures excluding interest payments, leading to a primary fiscal surplus. However, despite this and other improvements in macroeconomic performance, the island nation remains vulnerable, Ralph van Doorn said.
The new report says, natural disasters continue to take their toll on the GDP, while the pace of urgent fiscal reforms has lagged in a challenging political environment.
The report adds; The government is progressing on the reform agenda it announced in its Vision 2025, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated. These reforms aimed at improving competitiveness, governance and public financial management are expected to bring in long-term benefits. Continuation of the IMF program will add to investor confidence. Supported by a strengthening global growth outlook, including in some countries important to Sri Lanka, the outlook remains stable. However, this is conditional on successful reform implementation.
Growth is expected to rebound in 2018 from a low base and continue to be around 4.3 percent in the medium term, driven by private consumption and investment. Although short to medium term growth will continue to be driven by non-tradable sectors, successful implementation of reforms should help the country to rely on productive tradable sectors in the long run. Inflation will stabilize around mid-single digit level, although the upward trend in oil prices may exert some upward pressure. In the medium term, the announced shift by the central bank to flexible inflation targeting will keep inflation in the single digits, while the exchange rate is left to adjust to market forces.
Future of jobs in the hands of youth  WB Country Director
Young people of many middle-income countries focus on jobs that allow them to innovate. They take risks and do not consider sticking to a single job throughout their career. Rather they see the opportunity to change jobs as a way to amass experiences that give them a variety of skills and opportunities. Many dream not only of working at the established big-name companies but at being self-starters who develop companies that could be bought by the big names in the industry.
But, this buzz is yet to take root in Sri Lanka, despite its middle-income status. Most young people in Sri Lanka say they are conditioned by parental ambitions to become doctors or lawyers and then get a job in the public sector. Dont get me wrong. We do need doctors and lawyers in the public sector but how many can be absorbed into the limited spaces that exist in government The outcome has been more job seekers than job creators, said Dr. Idah Z. Pswarayi-Riddihough, WB Country Director, Sri Lanka and Maldives Colombo, Sri Lanka
Hence in Sri Lanka there is a need to redefine the perception of a job. It can no longer be split into a formal job vs an informal job; nor can the future youths afford to all aspire for a job that keeps them as a lifer. Youths should be at the forefront of creating jobs, some of which we dont even know will exist in the near future. We need them to push policy makers, the private sector and the public sector to lift hurdles in their way so they can get on with being tomorrows employers and innovators, she said at the launch of Sri Lankas new Development Update in Colombo yesterday.
Speaking further she said, but this will also challenge many other aspects of todays job world. If the jobs of tomorrow will be vastly different; does the education system as it is today permit the innovation and skills development needed in the future How should the vocational centers be upgraded to skill youths on an on-going basis it can no longer be a once in a lifetime training. With jobs going into the virtual space, does it make sense to have people sitting in an office or will there be other models of working that will be focused on output and impact than presence in an office
You cant upend a status quo on jobs and yet end up with the same model on how people work. There is little doubt that the trend to move in and out of jobs  formal to informal and back again has begun and it can only intensify. Mobility will be the key word for our future youths. Taking risks will be something that they will be more comfortable with than the earlier generation and they will push the system to adjust accordingly to this new trend.
There will be pain as some endeavors fail; and our role will be to help them back up to continue to create the jobs that they want to work in, in future. So, to all the youths who are thinking of pushing the boundaries and becoming the next entrepreneur  the world is ready for you. You must demand the attention of those who have the means to help you start-up - also dont be afraid of failure. And to those who have the space for the new generation of jobs dont wait for the youths to be skilled  reach out and skill them and give them a platform to innovate. There is little doubt that the benefits will accrue to all quarters, Dr. Pswarayi-Riddihough said.
The Sri Lanka Development Update is the World Banks bi-annual macroeconomic publication. It is meant to provide insights into the current state of the economy, based on which it gives a weighted prediction of the medium to long term performance. It also focuses on opportunities and challenges that could manifest along the way.

Conspiracy of privatising public institutions
A member of the Group of 16, Parliamentarian Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday charged that the government has entered into a conspiracy of privatising public institutions and enterprises following the advice of the IMF and World Bank (WB).
Addressing the media yesterday at the Nidahas Madya Kendraya in Punchi Borella, Abeywardena said that most public enterprises are scheduled to be privatised in the next two years and it is necessary to take immediate measures to control this situation. government and opposition members of Parliament should understand the economic crisis prevailing in the country, he said. The economic growth of the country has been reduced to 3.2 percent by the first quarter of 2018 and it was at 7.1 percent in 2014. The unemployment rate in the country has increased to 4.2 by the end 2017 and it was at 3.7 percent in 2014. The inflation rate has increased by 3.2 percent in 2018 first quarter compared to 2017 first quarter, he said.
The group of 16 SLFP Parliamentarians yesterday proposed a seven-point recommendation to avoid a possible recession in 2020.
The seven points are: the responsibility of economic management should be given to a person who has the capacity to perform that task, the government should call an early general election, PM Ranil Wickremesinghes government should accept their inability to govern, the government should realise that selling public property is not the only solution for the issues prevailing in the country, the government should stop showing the money earned by selling public property as FDI, an independent Presidential Commission should be appointed to look into the prevailing financial crisis, and the present government should reveal the names of economic assassins.

Govt. will always rule according to Buddhist principles
Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said ministers need to have the strength to bear the criticism levelled against them by the media. The media attacks us, the President and the Prime Minister. At times the limits are crossed. As rulers, we dont see our own mistakes at times. So we should appreciate the media for pointing them out. We are not going to attack the media for that, he said.
The Minister was participating in a ceremony held at the Medamahanuwara Rajamaha Viharasthanaya.
He further said that the government would always rule according to Buddhist principles. The government is also committed to upholding the supremacy of the law and democracy. We cannot prevent individuals from committing crime. But as a government, we have given prominence to the law. The era where the government itself engaged in illegal activities is over. There was a time when our people disappeared, journalists were harassed, government servants put under various pressures, and the country became infamous for its lawlessness. The United Nations in its sessions allocated three days to answer these questions.
Our government will not support or permit any illegal activity. We have provided an environment for all to live in peace, he said.

Mihintale Aloka Pooja  flourishes togetherness
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited Mihintale together to inaugurate the Aloka Pooja organised by Lake House symbolising the reconciliation in the country, Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi and Custodian Ven. Walawahangunuwewa Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera said.
The Thera was delivering an anusasana on the Poson Poya day during the Aloka Pooja Ceremony.
The Thera said Mihintale became sacred when Kakusandha, Konagama, Kasyapa and Gouthama Buddhas visited the location. "Maithri Buddha will also visit Mihintale. It is the place the Dhamma was discoursed to deities, and distributed sacred relics to the country," the Thera said.
The Thera said the Mihindu procession was held for the first time at the Mihintale and the world's first sanctuary was established surrounding the rock. "Sixty eight stone caves were vested in the Maha Sangha and King Dewanampiya Tissa and his 40,000 followers turned Buddhists at the sacred place," the Thera said.
The Thera requested the President and the Prime Minister to remove all barricades that prevent the children from Dhamma schools. " The proposed Mihintale Illumination System to be launched at a cost of Rs. 3,300 million will be complete before the 2019 Poson festival," the Thera said.
The prelate requested to declare Eighth Wap Ceremony (October) to commemorate Arhath Mahinda Thera's attaining Nibbana.
Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said the CEB incurs a huge loss by providing electricity to religious places in the country. He said the Mihintale Aloka Baraya (Trust Fund) will be established very soon to provide electricity to the sacred area on the request of the Thera.
The Mahameuna Poson Pirith Chanting Ceremony on July 30 followed by an alms giving for 100 Bikkhus at the Bomaluwa Temple will see the end of the week-long Poson Poya Aloka Pooja at Mihintale. Over 600,000 devotees visited Anuradhapura and Mihinthale in the week.

Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) Chairman Upali Mohotti recently said that the PMB incurred a loss of more than Rs 7 billion from 2009 to 2014.
Various measures have already been taken under the present government to make the PMB a profit making institution.
He made this observation at a progress review meeting held recently at the Agriculture Ministry under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera,
The Chairman further said that the reason for the loss incurred by the PMB was the supply of rice free of charge to Somalia during this period and also due to a decision to provide a large stock of paddy to the private sector as animal feed.
The PMB plans to sell paddy at relief rates within the next two months.
Measures have already been taken to purchase 20,000 metric tons of paddy during the Yala season, via 225 paddy purchasing centres established islandwide.

SL needs to recognise social enterprise as a key economic driver
Sri Lanka needs to recognise social enterprise as a key economic driver at the policy level, and include them in the governments economic development agenda, said Lalith Welamedage, Managing Director and CEO of Lanka Social Ventures.
Emphasizing the need to create a more supportive regulatory framework, giving social enterprises a greater degree of flexibility to pursue social business models that generate both social and financial returns, Welamedage stressed that respective policies would recognise social enterprises as a unique legal entity to help protect their social purpose.
Despite the fact that current SME policy makes make some references to social enterprises, we are in a stage where we need the government attention and assistance.
He expressed these views at the launch of the report on the State of Social Enterprises in Sri Lanka. The study was commissioned by the British Council in 2017 as part of the global social enterprise program.
Over the last decade, Sri Lanka has seen substantial growth in social enterprises, established to address social and environmental problems and foster social inclusion, economic integration and sustainable development and entrepreneurship across Sri Lanka. In addition, this sector has a higher proportion of female leaders than mainstream businesses.
He also suggested that the government could establish formal responsibility unit or focal point for social enterprises at the ministerial level under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or Ministry of Finance to coordinate industry related activities.
Speaking on major challenges that hamper the growth of the industry to a great extent, Welamedage cited access to finance as the main barrier facing social enterprises in Sri Lanka due to lack of bankable assets and according to him, many social enterprises operate with low profit margins.
He also said that social enterprises face numerous challenges when it comes to getting into new partnerships as well as various legal barriers to make important business decisions particularly relating to re-investment activities.
He also proposed that concessions be given for prospective entrepreneurs under the new Inland Revenue Act to better garner desired industry growth targets. He also stressed the need to encourage and facilitate private sector to work with social enterprises in supply chains and partnerships and through investments rather than making some concessions for them to work with social enterprises.
Welamedage also highlighted the need to raise the public profile of social enterprises and crate awareness on social enterprises among students in schools, universities and vocational training centres through the curriculum and career guidance with emphasis on starting social enterprises.
They are more passionate about finding solutions for burning social issues and we can better utilize their expertise to find solutions to come out of abject poverty and to create a more conducive environment for businesses to thrive. It is also required to conduct a sub-sector based analysis particularly covering the Southern, Northern and Eastern provinces in a bid to recognise those who are operating in marketing, inputs supply and technical support.
Noting that Sri Lankas existing legal and regulatory framework also needs to be made more favorable for social enterprises to go to the next level, Welamedage said that it is also essential to make social enterprises partners in public contracts as they can become crucial partners when it comes to providing public services in Sri Lanka.
Speaking at the event, Jonathan Wong, Chief of Technology and Innovation Trade, UNESCAP, Bangkok, Thailand said the concept of social enterprise and impact investing is becoming a reality in the Asia Pacific region, and role of private sector and government policy can be a catalyst for this sector. Wong also expressed the UNESCAPs commitment to help Sri Lankan government to create the necessary eco system to foster social entrepreneurship.

SL become first Asian side to win a Test in Barbados:
Suranga Lakmal led from the front  Chandika Hathurusingha
Sri Lankas bowling in the Windies second innings, with stand-in captain Suranga Lakmal leading from the front, won them a tense third Test to draw level in the series, coach Chandika Hathurusingha has said.
The visitors conceded 204 in the Windies first innings, before replying with 154 of their own and coming back to scuttle Jason Holders men for 93 in their second hit. Then, needing 63 runs for victory on day four in Barbados with five wickets in hand, they held on to win the day-night Test by four wickets and make it 1-1 in the series.
That a young Sri Lankan team pulled off the win with several of their senior players missing and captain Dinesh Chandimal serving a suspension would give them confidence, the coach suggested.
We have had a lot of ups and downs. To come back and level the series is a great effort, he said. We always had hope but the way the game progressed we were under pressure.
Tactically, Jason was on the mark but our bowlers responded in the second innings. Our second-innings bowling won us the game. Suranga had a chat and they rallied around. All credit to all four bowlers. Suranga led from the front. That particular 10-over spell put the Windies under pressure.
Lakmal, who had five wickets for the match, including 3/25 the second time around, was elated at how his first experience with Test captaincy went. I feel so happy, he said. I didn't expect it. I thought it was a good opportunity to lead and I took it.
Taking them across the finish line were Kusal Perera, who returned from a short hospital visit the previous day, and Diruwan Perera.
Diruwan said the duos experience of playing together for the same club helped them bat on a challenging, uneven surface. We thought if we bat longer we can get the runs  We both play for the same club and we know each other.
This is the first time I've batted this way, so it was pretty hard for us, and I'm happy we managed to achieve it.
Holder, meanwhile, rued the missed chances. We just did not have enough runs in the second innings, he said. It put our bowlers under pressure to come and do something special. Even though we gave them 140 to win, we knew could do it. But we missed some chances in the field.
With Windies hosting Bangladesh next, Holder was keen to look at the positives. (Shannon) Gabriel was outstanding. I must commend him. (Shane) Dowrich was outstanding as well. (Kemar) Roach needs to be mentioned too, he said of the players who finished with 20 wickets, 288 runs and 11 wickets respectively. The Windies play Bangladesh in two Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is starting on 4 July.

Abbas inspires Leicestershire to big win
LONDON, Wednesday  Six second-innings wickets from Mohammad Abbas helped Leicestershire ease to a six-wicket victory over Derbyshire go third in the Division Two of the County Championship.
Having taken two wickets late on day two to leave Derbyshire on 43-3 at stumps, the Pakistan bowler ripped through Derbyshires top order. Matt Critchleys 86 was the only score of note in a total of 186 all out.
Abbas took 6-54 before Leicestershire made their target of 133 in 29.4 overs.
Middlesex were bowled out cheaply for a second time in the match as they were thrashed by 342 runs by new Division Two leaders Kent at Canterbury.
The visitors were all out for 56 on day one, with most of the damage done with the pink ball under floodlights.
Chasing 467 to win, Middlesex lost their last eight wickets in the first session of the third day - six of them to catches behind the wicket. Harry Podmore took a career-best 6-36 as Middlesex subsided to 124 all out.
Essex and Somerset seem set for a draw despite the hosts losing two late wickets at Chelmsford in Division One.
Resuming on 140-2, all of Somersets top-eight batsmen passed 20, but only James Hildreth (78) and opener Eddie Byrom (54) made half-centuries. Essexs bowlers steadily made their way through Somersets order - Neil Wagner taking 3-122 as they were dismissed for 407 with nine overs left in the day. The hosts closed on 17-2 to lead by 127 going into the final day.
Alex Davies and Dane Vilas both scored centuries for Lancashire as they moved towards a high-scoring draw on a batsmen-friendly wicket against fellow Division One strugglers Hampshire.
Davies scored 115 and Vilas hit a fine 134 as the hosts reached 411 to trail by 40 runs after the first innings.
Hampshire ended day three on 66-2 to take a lead of 106 runs.
Warwickshire appear best placed to force victory on an intriguing final day of their match against Durham.
The visitors ended day three on 152-5 in their second innings to lead by 279.
Durham were in danger of following on in reply to Warwickshires 424, but Gareth Harte and Nathan Rimmington added 54 for the eighth wicket to help the hosts to 297 all out, 127 behind.
Warwicks looked in good shape with Jonathan Trott going well, but he fell for 53, keeping the hosts in touch.
The ex-England batsman, who scored 170 not out in Warwickshires first innings, passed the milestone of 500 County Championship runs this season. Division One leaders Surrey need 139 more runs to beat Yorkshire with all 10 second-innings wickets remaining after a Morne Morkel-inspired comeback.
Surrey trailed by 75 after the first innings despite Ollie Popes unbeaten 69 helping them take their overnight total from 219-7 to 267 all out. Morkel scored 29 and then took 5-39 as Yorkshire collapsed to 152 all out.
Chasing 228 to win, unbeaten duo Rory Burns (55) and Mark Stoneman (32) guided Surrey to 89-0 at the close.
Worcestershire survived a tricky 19 overs to reach 43-0 in their second innings as they chased a tough victory target of 462 against Nottinghamshire. Worcestershire took their overnight total of 215-7 to 287, meaning the hosts had a first-innings lead of 212.
Notts decided against enforcing the follow-on and piled on the runs through Jake Libby (100 not out), Samit Patel (71) and Riki Wessels (55 not out).But unbeaten openers Daryl Mitchell (19) and Martin Guptill (18) held firm.
Glamorgan go into day four staring at defeat on a precarious 121-4, after being set a mammoth 434 to win or four sessions to survive by Northants. Ricardo Vasconcelos (79) and Steven Crook (73) combined in a sixth-wicket stand of 147 in their 406-9 declared. Earlier, Ben Duckett (133) and Luke Procter (70) set a new record opening stand of 208 for Northants against Glamorgan. Ruaidhri Smith, with a career-best 4-75, helped to check their momentum.
The visitors struck a key blow late in the final session when Vasconcelos took a superb reflex catch at short-leg to dismiss Glamorgans in-form Australia Test batsman Usman Khawaja for 38, caught off Sri Lankan spinner Seekkuge Prasanna.

Anusha prepares for Asian Games with bronze in Mongolia
Queen of the local boxing ring Anusha Kodituwakku proved she is fit and ready for a tilt at glory at the Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang in August when she won a bronze medal in the womens flyweight category at the Ulaanbataar Cup Mongolia.
At 39, Sri Lankas boxing heroine Kodituwakku, is at the tail end of an illustrious career which includes winning a historic bronze medal at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in April this year. The Asian Games will be one of her last major competitions with her swansong likely to be at the World Championships in New Delhi in November.
Kodituwakku, a longtime employee of MAS Unichela, showed her impending retirement will leave a huge void as she took on a strong field at one of the warm-up events to the Asian Games, emerging with a bronze medal in the 51kg flyweight class in Mongolia.
Im very pleased with my performance as I will come against these same boxers at the Asian Games too. Winning a medal will boost my confidence, Anusha said. It will be her first appearance at the Asian Games. Four years ago, an injury forced Anusha out of the Incheon Asian Games.
It was a noteworthy performance as she faced stronger opponents at the Commonwealth Games. There were boxers from North and South Korea, Russia, Iran and hosts Mongolia, who are all of a high quality. We are very pleased that Anusha was able to reach the semi-finals where she lost narrowly to a North Korean girl, said coach Manju Wanniarachchi.
Sri Lanka was represented by six boxers in Mongolia, three men and three women.
Anushas next competition as she looks ahead to the Asian Games will be the Police Commissioners Cup in Indonesia early in July. Two other girls from MAS who went to Mongolia too  Keshani Hansika and Krishmi Dharmathilake will accompany her, Wanniarachchi revealed.
The Indonesian event will take place at the same venue where the Asian Games boxing competition will be held leaving Anusha delighted at the opportunity to use this as a dress-rehearsal for her medal bid in August.

Attracting birds with water
Keep it low - The standard birdbath on a pedestal may look good, but its not the best way to offer water to birds. Most natural sources of water that birds use are on or near the ground. Its what they look for in nature. Place the bath basin on the ground or raised up on a cinder block, but keep it within a foot or so of the ground.
Keep it shallow - Birds dont bathe in deep water. Keep the level in your birdbath to about two inches or less. This is perfect for songbirds to wade into and splash around. If your bath basin is deep, place a layer of pea gravel or some large, flat stones in the bottom to offer birds a choice of water levels.
Good footing - Pea gravel or large stones in the bottom of you bath basin also serve to give bathing birds better footing while using the bath. This is necessary to make the birds feel less vulnerable while they bathe. Check the surface of your birdbath basin when its filled. If its slippery, add gravel or stones to make it safer and easier for birds to use.
Well situated. Siting your birdbath is also important. You need to be able to see it from wherever you will be spending much of your time: the living room or kitchen window, the deck or patio. And it needs to be handy to get for cleaning and refilling. Cover nearby - Just as you need the bath to be where you can see it, the birds need to have some protective cover nearby. This will give the birds a place from which they can approach the bath, and a place to flee to should danger approach.
Shady - One aspect of bathing in summer for birds is to cool off. You can keep your birdbath water temperature cooler by placing the bath in a shady spot in your yard. A bath placed out in the open in direct sunlight will have heated water, which will also cause the bath water to evaporate more quickly.
Staging/preening perch - Place a stick adjacent to your birdbath to give the birds an easy landing place when flying to/from the bath. This will make the bath more approachable and birds will use the perch as a place to scan for danger and a place to preen their feathers after bathing. Dont place the perch directly over the bath because the birds will also use it as a pooping perch.
Keep it clean - Speaking of poop, some of italong with leaves, feathers, sticks, insects, and other thingswill accumulate in the water of your birdbath. Plan to scrub out your bath basin with a stiff-bristled brush and use an abrasive cleaner on hard-to-remove algae. Birds always go nuts when the birdbath is freshly clean.
Keep it open - Water is just as vital in cold weather. If you want to keep a supply of drinking water open for birds, consider using a temperature-controlled water heater. These devices keep the water in your birdbath from freezing solid.
Add Motion - Nothing makes a birdbath more alluring than moving water. Moving water sparkles in the sunlight and catches the attention of birds. Far more birds began coming to our birdbath after we added motion to the water than had come to the still-water bath. Moving water has the additional benefit of preventing successful reproduction of mosquitoes in it. Mosquitoes need still water for successful reproduction.

The Criminal Investigations Department (CID), submitting a report before the magistrate on the previous trial date, had stated that the investigations into the alleged unlawful floating armoury onboard MV Avant Garde were still in progress and no institution or person was legally permitted to keep firearms in their possession except the Prison Department and government Tri Forces.
They also pointed out that there were two pending appeals in the court for the prevention of the arrest of the other suspects in the case. The CID officials also claimed that the charges against the respective defendants were not offences which are bailable at a magistrates court. MV Avant Garde was seized by the Sri Lanka Navy on October 13, 2015, for allegedly having a firearm depository on board.

Barking deer freed from poachers trap
An injured barking deer which had been caught in a poachers trap was rescued by the Uragahasmanhandiya Police and handed over to Wildlife officials last Tuesday.
The deers antlers had been injured when it was caught between iron rods and the police officers exerted great effort to free it, said Uragahasmanhandiya Crime Division OIC Inspector Vijith Jayantha.
Wildlife officials who arrived at the police station to inspect the deer however said they could not take the deer with them as they had no veterinarian to treat the animal.
The police stated that they had to keep the deer at the station for close to six hours for this reason.
The barking deer which is a species endemic to Sri Lanka, has been mostly limited to the areas of Karandeniya and Uragahasmanhandiya.
In recent times however, there has been an increasing decline in the barking deer population and the species is at present an endangered species, said Wildlife officials.
There are less than 100 barking deer in the wild at present.

A bitter deal trying to get sugar out of Sri Lankan teas: Plantations Minister
When it comes to tea, Sri Lanka has a reputation to protect.
Even though the country is the fourth largest exporter of tea in the world, Ceylon Tea is some what the most expensive tea per kilo.
That means that any negative press about its quality could affect those high prices.
In February, news broke out that the Sri Lanka Tea Board had raided 80 factories. The regulators alleged that some factory owners were using sugar in the manufacturing process.
Sugar artificially darkens the tea leaves, making them look higher grade than they actually are.
Many factory owners were quick to deny that they had tampered with their tea.
But Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake, said he was confident that the practice was happening, or that at least, it was until very recently.
We hear this from the people inside factories, the people who work for them, he said in an interview. Sometimes (the owners)themselves boast about it.
It is kind of an open secret in the country, he added.
Minister Dissanayake said the Tea Board and Tea Research Institute were currently verifying a new test to detect sugar tampering, that could be used as evidence in Court disputes.
According to Dissanayake, the practice had started about 15 years ago and reached its peak in last year.
While everybody was practicing it, the authorities turned a blind eye to it, he said. But were not going to do that anymore and we are going to act tough about it, the Minister said.
Yet, even as the government tried to get tough on sugar tampering, others say the issues with Sri Lankas tea industry actually had run much deeper.
Screening for quality:
The battle to maintain high quality teas for export is an ongoing one. One of the checks on this process is the Analytics Lab at the Sri Lanka Tea Board, which is currently preparing to carry on with the sugar tests.
Every week, 4,000 randomly selected samples are taken from the tea auction in Colombo, to the lab at the SLTB headquarters on Galle Road, according to the Director of the Analytical Services Dr. Nishantha Jayathilake.
At the Tea Board, those samples are then tested first by the Tea Boards tea tasters. If they flag the tea as suspicious, they send it to the labs. There, the sample could be tested against international standards, which are published by the International Organization for Standardization, such as bacteria, fibre content and pesticide presence.
All the testing we do is according to (these) international standards, Dr. Jayathilake said.
If the laboratories find a problem, they could trace the specific sample back to the seller at the auction, then back to the factory, even back to the garden where the leaf was grown, Dr. Jayathilake said. Its all vertically traceable.
Making sure the tea meets different international standards is important to ensure, because different countries have different requirements for their tea. Japan, for example, only allows that 1 part per billion of the pesticide MCPA, be present in the teas it imports.
A bad batch of tea could jeopardize millions of dollars in sales.
Although most of the samples that come through the SLTBs labs are collected internally, individual exporters could also bring their own product to be sampled to ensure quality. The SLTB also requires that all private sales done outside the Colombo tea auction, be tested before they are approved for export.
Its also in these labs that they could test for sugar added during the manufacturing process.
Every tea, depending on its variety and elevation where it was grown, should have a baseline sugar content, Dr. Jayathilake explained.
Tea Board Chairman Lucille Wijewardena, compared that sugar baseline to the base temperature of the human body. For example, a bodys normal internal temperature should be about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
Its like this with tea, he said.
The problem with the first raid of 80 factories, Wijewardena said, was that the regulators had not been properly established those baselines. Thats how the accused owners challenged the validity of the test.
When you do something for the first time, there could be little snags, Wijewardena said.
He said the Tea Research Institute was currently working on establishing individual baselines for different teas and also verifying the lab test used to determine the sugar content.
Anything over that baseline would be considered adulterated, he said. Minister Dissanayake had warned that he would suspend the licenses of anyone caught, or even shut down the factories completely.
After the warning it would stop, Wijewardena said. No one would take that risk.
A larger problem looms
Wijewardena said that all the media hype around sugar tampering had distracted from what he said was the real issue facing the tea industry.
Even though he and Minister Dissanayake agree that the practice was probably at one point widespread, with the threat of testing, its gone down to only a handful of factories, he said.
At the Colombo Tea Auction, where upwards of 97 percent of the tea grown in Sri Lanka is sold, brokers say that any sugar tampering hasnt really been noticed by the consumers.
(The issue) has been overblown in the media, said Shane Amarasekara, a broker of Forbes and Walker Tea Brokers.
Yields declining due to not increasing tea growth
The larger problem, according to Tea Board Chairman Wijewardena, is that yields are declining due to owners not increasing their tea growth.
Due to it, the area of tea-growing land is declining. The total extent of area under cultivation had fallen from almost 213 hectare in 2010, to 202 hectare in 2016, Plantation Ministry statistics show.
A tea bush has a life cycle of about 30 years, Wijewardena said. After that, its yields begin to decline. So the situation at present is that there are less plants and older ones.
In the past, Planters replaced small sections of their tea fields every year, he said.
But now, theyre under the impression that it was too costly and the return on investment was too long, he said. A young tea bush must be allowed to grow for three years before it could be picked.
However, you can recover the investment in 4-5 years under these current prices, Wijewardena argued. But there is a lack of entrepreneurial spirit in the tea sector.
The upshot of this is that production costs are rising, as tea companies are relying on older bushes that grow less high quality tea. That leads to more refuse in the manufacturing process.
If you manufacture 100 kilos of tea, 15 are taken off as refuse, while the rest cannot be sold at the auctions, Wijewardena said.
To compensate, owners are incentivised to cut corners  such as making the leaves look higher quality by adding sugar to the manufacturing process.
Wijewardena said he believed that adding new bushes to the islands tea fields would lead to less waste and lower production costs.
These are symptoms of the real issue, he said. If you address the root cause, other problems would be solved.
The Tea Board has proposed a plan to require a small amount of the revenue from export sales be put into a fund that could be used by companies for financial assistance in replacing tea plants.
Anyone from small holders to regional plantation companies, could use the funds to rent or purchase backhoes and holing machines to for replanting.
The goal is to plant 1,000 hectare of tea a year for five years.
For the next five years, we are going to address that issue as the single most important issue, Wijewardena said.
In the short term, the Ministry hopes the threat of stings would keep factory owners from using sugar in the process.
Plantation Industries Minister Dissanayake said that the future of the industry depended on it.
No other teas get this price, he said. So for us to ensure this price, we have to ensure that our quality is right.

British High Commissioner faults current business practices
British High Commissioner James Dauris addressed the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors at their Annual Meeting this Tuesday, emphasizing the importance of healthy competition and the need to eliminate corruption as keys to economic growth and development.
Dauris offered words of advice and his observations on the countrys economic growth, after spending three years as the British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and Ambassador to Maldives. Dauris fit his counsel into the six-letter acronym ACCESS: Account, Corporate Governance, Competition, English, Standards, and Support.
Account was the first point of Dauris speech: Holding the government to be accountable and representing the interests of the business community are critical functions of business leaders in any country.
The High Commissioner continued by raising the issue of accountability within corporations themselves: Whatever the field, it requires a lot more determination and firmer principles to stay straight and play by honest rules when people around you arent doing the same and when corruption is a serious problem.
He also encouraged the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors to help themselves by using global standard benchmarks in order to successfully integrate Sri Lankan business into the global marketplace.
The High Commissioner did save some praise for his own colleagues at the British Council and in the British government, for their work to improve the standards of English in the country. He remarked that 173 schools from around the country had participated in the British Council International School Awards Ceremony, a promising indicator of greater English fluency in the coming years; Dauris asserted that an English medium will be the key to financial success in the future as well.
Finally, the British High Commissioner asked the room to support the government towards the goal of restoring investor confidence in Sri Lankas private and public sectors. Dauris quoted from the Institute of Directors website. He said, Moving Sri Lanka up the World Banks Ease of Doing Business Index, for example, needs to involve partnership. It needs business and government encouraging, helping and supporting each other. It needs them to be open with and critical of each other. I dont always get the feeling that the business community is doing as much as it can and needs to be doing to help. My sense is that there are appropriate opportunities for you to speak up as a group more often than you do. Id encourage you, for instance, to use your public authority and your influence with the government to help press down on permit mentalities, to simplify the setting up of businesses, to liberalise labour laws that hold development back. The voice of business and your collective voice as business leaders matter.

CBSL refutes GDP manipulation allegations
The sole responsibility of compiling Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates is vested with the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) since 2007.
However, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has observed media statements by interested parties, in relation to the involvement of CBSL in manipulating GDP estimates of the country, misleading the general public.
GDP estimates were compiled and disseminated by both CBSL and the DCS until 2006. However, considering the importance of entrusting the role of data compilation with an independent authority, CBSL discontinued the compilation of GDP estimates since 2007 allowing the responsibility of compiling GDP estimates to be vested solely with the DCS. In addition to compiling GDP estimates, DCS holds the responsibility of compiling statistics on consumer prices, labour force, poverty, etc. following internationally accepted methodologies to support evidence based policy making. CBSL remains a key user of such estimates for economic analysis and monetary policy formulation purposes. Hence, the allegations that the CBSL is involved in manipulating GDP estimates are totally unfounded.

Celebrating exemplary practices of internationalism
This year celebrated the last year of the International School Awards in Sri Lanka and the occasion was marked by the presence of Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education and James Dauris, British High Commissioner. 170 school principals and 340 teachers from government schools covering all parts of the country celebrated the occasion with special recognition being made of the many British Council Schools Ambassadors.
Over the last 13 years, British Council and Ministry of Education have been working together to promote the adoption by schools of international learning and collaboration. The British Council International School Award (ISA) is an accreditation scheme that recognises and celebrates exemplary practices of internationalism in schools. Taking place in 54 countries, the International School Award encourages schools to collaborate and innovate with overseas schools to create an enriching learning experience for students through the use of information technology, creative informative practices and a practical context for learning. The International School Award raises the profile of schools internationally.
The International School Award is part of Connecting Classrooms, the British Councils global education programme for schools, supported by UK Aid. It is designed to help young people become globally aware and globally competitive in the 21st century. It aims to build the capacity of teachers and principals to support them in integrating a range of core skills (21st century skills) into their teaching and learning, such as critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, digital literacy, citizenship, student leadership, as well as collaboration and communication.
Schools that participate in ISA begin by drafting an action plan for an academic year with a minimum of seven projects related tointernational dimensions covering a range of subject areas and age groups. The schools record their work and present a dossier of evidence that is assessed by a panel. Schools that are successful in meeting the assessment criteria are awarded the accreditation for a period of three years.
British Council Sri Lanka Country Director Gill Caldicott, commented:I am proud to say that by 2016 in Sri Lanka 500 schools had received the ISA with a further 101 receiving the award in 2016-2017. By the end of this month June 2018, we are expecting another 70 schools to receive the award. This is an excellent indication of the value schools are putting on internationalism and collaborative participation.I would like to thank in particular the contribution of the Ministry of Education, Provincial Departments of Education, all of the British Council School Ambassadors, as well as the Principals, teachers and students who have made this programme such a success.
During the last three years of the programme, 32 grants were awarded for professional school partnerships, 1660 teacher were trained as part of the professional development strand and 384 school leaders received leadership training. In addition, the programme delivered many benefits for students and teachers alike. It helped design, develop and implement international activities in schools, which develop global awareness in both teachers and students across a range of subjects.
It also optimised their opportunities for networking, while the award itself gave a sense of recognition to the schools.
While the Awards will no longer be offered, an advantage of being a part of British Councils Schools Offer is the accessibility and connectivity provided by the British Councils Schools Online website (schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org). This portal will continue to provide opportunities for teachers in Sri Lanka to collaborate with partner schools of other countries in a direct and engaging manner.
While the International School Awards will no longer feature in British Councils schools work in Sri Lanka, the commitment of British Council to work in the field of education will continue.
As outlined by Louise Cowcher, Director Education, British Council Sri Lanka: We are supporting the Government of Sri Lankas education reform initiatives through our TRANSFORM programme which will support access for young people to a fit-for-purpose and relevant quality education system, allowing them to reach their potential as well as contribute to Sri Lankas economic and social development.
TRANSFORM operates across schools, higher education and skills, including on areas such as continuous professionalisation of teachers and leaders, professional standards, quality assurance and assessment.
We are delighted to be working so closely with colleagues across different ministries and departments and for the UK, through British Council, to be a strategic partner for the Government of Sri Lanka in achieving its objectives of providing an internationally benchmarked quality education for all young people in Sri Lanka.

But now it's time for something new - and it's safe to say you're definitely going to want to try it. A businessman from Scotland has created a doughnut and chicken nugget hybrid he calls 'the Donug'.
The circular treat sees chicken shaped into a classic doughnut ring, before being covered in a cornflake and panko crumb and deep fried.
If that weren't enough, Donugs come with the option of three sauces - cheesy Dijon bechamel, hot chilli or golden Japanese curry with mozzarella. Or if you prefer, you can just enjoy it plain. Created by Crag Carrick, who hails from Glasgow but now lives in Australia, the Donug costs 5 a pop.
Speaking to Metro , Crag said: "It's about getting Donugs sold at every sporting ground, every service station, every fish and chip shop.
"I want this to be the crazy new food trend coming out of Melbourne."
He added: "I'm giving something that's fun, it's easy to understand, people get it straight away. There's nothing sweet about it. All savoury. It's 98 percent chicken that has our unique and top-secret spice mix."
Donugs took off online recently after Crag appeared on an Australian show called Shark Tank, which is similar to Dragon's Den.
On the show, he was given a 56,000 investment for the Donug business which will be used to pay a manufacturer to start producing Donugs in mass, as well as to cover storage and packing costs. So far the Donug is only available in Melbourne, but if business proves to be successful, Crag will be bringing the quirky creation to the UK and beyond very soon.
Food lovers on social media have gone wild for the savoury treat. Commenting on the @loveadonug Instagram account, users shared their excitement. One wrote: "I'm dreaming I'm eating this!" While another added: "I'm moving to Australia!"

China hits back at US investment rules
The Chinese government has criticised a US move to expand the powers of its foreign investment watchdog.
The government is worried that the move means the US will use national security concerns unfairly in order to restrict Chinese investments.
The new investment rules will target Chinese companies investing in technology industries in the US.
It comes as the US and China both prepare to slap tariffs on $34bn worth of each others goods.
US President Donald Trump has said he supports legislation that would expand the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).
CFIUS is an inter-agency body which scrutinizes the national security implications of business deals that would result in foreign ownership of US companies.
It can make recommendations to the president, who can stop a deal from going though, although in practice a negative CFIUS finding alone is sometimes enough to kill off a deal.
I have concluded that such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security, and future economic prosperity, Trump said in a statement.
The legislation would expand the role of CFIUS, allowing it to stop a deal if it would pose a threat to Americas technological edge.
Intellectual property is a key sticking point in the trade tensions between US and China, with the US accusing China of stealing its technology.
Chinas commerce ministry says it objects to the US using national security as an excuse to tighten the rules for Chinese companies in the US.
China will closely monitor the legislation process and evaluate its potential impact on Chinese companies, said Chinese commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng.
China is a major investor in the US, and it stands to lose from tighter foreign investment rules.
The Chinese governments economic plans have a strong focus on technological advancement.
One way to acquire better technology is to invest in foreign companies that already have it. BBC News

Dengue tops 24,000, 23 confirmed deaths
A total of 24,518 dengue cases and 23 confirmed dengue deaths had been reported up to
June 28 from all parts of the country, the Epidemiology Unit said.
According to the epidemiologists, the highest number of dengue cases, 4,176 had been reported from the Colombo district while the second highest number, 3,539 had been reported from the Baticaloa district.The third highest number of dengue cases, 2,085 had been reported from the Gampaha district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported a total of 1,111 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded a total of 3,065 dengue cases. The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province is 7,752, the epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites (water harbouring places) during this rainy season in order to prevent dengue.Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for the dengue mosquitoe to breed, they added.

Dirt On Our Fingers..!
An item in todays newspaper had me sadly amused. A lady doctor who runs a pain clinic, told the press how she saw a destitute woman bleeding profusely on the pavement outside her gym. She was bleeding profusely, it was all over the pavement and flowing onto the road. I asked the watchman to call the police, but he did not respond.
She then called the local representative and the municipality but they paid no heed to her pleas. Finally five hours later she called the local newspaper and the paper put pressure on the police who arranged for an ambulance and carried the woman away.
I wonder whether it was too late Five hours is a long time isnt it
But that got me thinking: Why didnt the lady doctor herself do something
I remember Farida is a lady who lives quite close to my place and loves dogs. One day in the course of conversation, I told her I loved dogs too. Why dont you come with me to the animal hospital she asked. I agreed. She arrived next day and seated herself in my car with a badly wounded dog, I hope you dont mind Bob, she said, as my rear seat was bloodied. At the hospital, she brought out two huge tiffin carriers of food and proceeded to feed all the hundreds of animals in their cages.
Suddenly we entered the area where the very sick dogs were kept. I watched as Farida placed food in each of their plates. We reached a kennel where a dog seemed to be having permanent convulsions. Distemper, said Farida to me, as she put some food in the dogs plate and handed the plate to me. I put the plate down as near the sick animal as possible, but so bad were the shivers that the animal could not reach the good.
Pick the dog and hold it near the food, said Farida.
What I shouted in consternation. I loved dogs alright but this was beyond anything I had ever thought of doing. I looked at the poor fellow, dirty and filthy and then slowly picked it up, felt its spittle drool all over my arm, and nearly puked with the effort as I held it near its plate. Hold the head firmly, said Farida. I did, and the dog ate.
Itll live, said Farida as she looked at the little fellow after it had eaten. It had stopped its convulsions. I felt happy. I stooped down and touched it. It licked my fingers. I had tears in my eyes as I looked at the wetness on my hand. I didnt attempt to wash it away.
That little bit of dirt on me was worth more than all the other good deeds I could have done, and suddenly it was like a medal Id won.
What we need is a little dirt on our fingers..!

EC Chairman wants PC polls expedited
National Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya made a special request to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday not to delay the Provincial Council Elections.
He made this request during a special meeting convened by the Speaker in Parliament to discuss the PC Elections.
The electoral system to be adopted for the PC Elections was the special focus during the meeting, the Speakers Media Division said in a press statement. While agreeing with Deshapriya, the Speaker has stated that a special meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and party leaders will be arranged soon to come to a final agreement on the electoral system to be adopted for the Provincial Council Elections.
Parliament is to take up a full day adjournment debate on PC Elections on July 6 as dissenting views came up at the last Party Leaders Meeting on the PC electoral system. The party leaders meeting ended inconclusively on June 21. Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, Election Commission members N.J. Abeysekara and Rathnajeevan Hoole, Delimitation Committee Chairman K. Thavalingam and two of its members were also present at yesterdays meeting.
The Speaker has reiterated that Parliament and Constitutional Councils should give special attention to provide for the legal provisions to hold the PC Elections without delay, adding that peoples confidence in democracy must be protected.
Minister Musthapha and Delimitation Committee Chairman K. Thavalingam also emphasized the need to hold the PC Elections.
The Elections for the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa PCs are already due, and the term of another three PCs namely the Central, Northern and North Western PCs will end by September.
Legislation to give effect to a new electoral system, which is a hybrid of First Past the Post system and Proportional Representation system, was adopted in the House last year. However, some political parties, including minority parties, have requested to conduct the elections under the old system. Deshapriya, at a meeting with political party representatives on Tuesday, pointed out that if the Provincial Council Elections are to be held under the old electoral system, legal amendments in that regard have to be passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament.
He also stated that if the PC Elections are to be conducted under the new electoral system, a number of technical errors in the legislation have to be corrected prior to the elections.

EDB, Sri Lanka Embassy in Thailand organize  Technical Exposure, Capacity Building Programme
The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Embassy in Thailand organized a Technical Exposure and Capacity Building Programme for 13 export ready SMEs identified under 2000 New Exporters Development Programme including Women Entrepreneurs, coinciding with the THAIFEX - World of Food Asia-2018 from May 28 to June 2, 2018 in Thailand.
Keeping in line with the Economic Vision of the Government to transform Sri Lanka into a vibrant and prosperous nation through export led growth, the EDB implements a programme to develop 2000 entrepreneurs to become exporters by 2020 at regional level.
The main objective of this programme is to encourage domestic enterprises to invest in export industries to achieve the overall export target US$ 22 billion in 2020.
Under the 2000 New Exporter Development Programme, around 100 SME companies engaged in the food and beverage sector including women entrepreneurs from all regions have been identified to develop as exporters in the first phase. Accordingly, the EDB has initiated integrated product and market development programmes for these selected group of companies covering the areas of product & system certification, technical programmes on packaging and labeling, awareness seminars on e-commerce and cross border procedures, exposure programs to international markets, match making with visiting overseas buyer delegations etc.
The SME companies engaged in the food and beverage export industry are facing numerous challenges to be competitive in the international market.
Management of food chain requires cross-disciplinary competencies in the supply chain and continuous up-gradation of products are equally essential to maintain the sustainability.
SME food manufacturers also need to constantly update their knowledge on consumer preferences and trends in the global market for new products such as organic, gluten free, Halal, vegetarian, vegan, health and functional foods.
They should also be aware of product quality, standards, packaging, pricing and technical capabilities to compete in the international market.
Under the proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Strategic Economic Partnership between the Sri Lanka and Thailand, it is envisaged to cooperate on priority economic cooperation areas of trade and investment and development of agro industry product sector i.e, processing food, rubber products, horticulture, flori-culture products and agricultural machinery is proposed to be promoted. SME development is one of the areas of cooperation to develop and promote under the proposed MoU. The participants for the programme were able to study on value-added food products, food preservation techniques, including design and packaging.
This programme consisted of exposure visit to THAIFEX  World of Food Asia, factory visits, one day training programme at Thai Packaging center. It aimed to share with the participants Thailands approach and experience concerning the development of its food and beverage sector and create a platform for discussion and exchange of knowledge between the participants, Thai professionals and Farmer Associations. During the visit to THAIFEX, companies were able to negotiate with exhibitors who participated from China, Canada, Germany, Sweden, UK, USA etc. at the Exhibition. The companies who participated were able to gain knowledge on latest technology to upgrade their production facilities, develop new products, improve packaging and source equipment required for increasing productivity and most of them have been successful in entering into export markets.

Emirates flight catering builds worlds largest vertical farming facility in Dubai
Emirates Flight Catering (EKFC) and Crop One will co-invest US$40 million to build the worlds largest vertical farming facility near Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central. The project is a joint venture with U.S.-based Crop One Holdings, the worlds leading vertical farm operator.
His HighnessSheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive of Emirates Airline and Group said:Todays announcement is an important milestone for the Emirates Group, for Dubai, and for the UAE. This investment to build and operate the worlds largest vertical farming facility aligns with the UAEs drive for more agricultural self-sufficiency, a vision which began with the late HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAEs founding father. The introduction of ground-breaking technology at the facility also enhances Dubais position as a global innovation hub.
As one of the worlds largest airline catering operations, Emirates Flight Catering constantly looks at innovation, and ways to improve our productivity, product and service quality. Introducing the latest technology to our operations, we secure our own supply chain of high quality and locally-sourced fresh vegetables, while significantly reducing our environmental footprint. We are pleased to partner with Crop One, the industrys leading grower, packer and distributor, and a successful company that shares our corporate values, saidSaeed Mohammed, Chief Executive Officer of Emirates Flight Catering.
Our proven business model has demonstrated profitable commercial production longer than any other major vertical farmer, saidSonia Lo, Chief Executive Officer of Crop One Holdings. 
We are farmers using the most sophisticated plant science and proven business efficiencies to provide market leading consumer products every day. Our selection after a 10-month search by EKFC is a validation of our successful business model that uses patented technology and processes to optimize crop yields and facilitate hyper-growth.
The proximity of the farm to the point of consumption also substantially reduces carbon emissions associated with transportation. It will also ensure the quick delivery of the fresh products, reaching customers within hours of harvest, maintaining high nutritional value.
The construction of the facility is scheduled to start in November 2018 and will take approximately one year to complete.
The first products are expected to be delivered to Emirates Flight Caterings customers, including 105 airlines and 25 airport lounges, in December 2019.

## Title: Equality before the Law
## Supertitle: Affirmative Action Reverse Discrimination:
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, June 29, 2018 - 01:00
Affirmative Action Reverse Discrimination:
Equality before the Law
The universalism of life demands that all people treat all others equally, without discrimination. It is imperative that the distinction between formal equality and substantive equality be made since most often the attainment of formal equality is accepted as the attainment of the freedom to exercise rights freely. The formal approach concentrates on the treatment of all persons who are alike in the same manner. The treatment of a person of a group, for example, a particular race, in a manner different to that of other persons of the same race or group would be seen as discrimination by the formal approach.
The substantive approach, on the other hand, is not only concerned with equal treatment of the law but also with the actual effect of the law. This approach takes into account socio-economic inequalities and puts forward positive measures for the elimination of these inequalities. Substantive equality seeks to eliminate systemic and institutional discrimination against disadvantaged groups. In the case of substantive equality, the Government has a positive response to level the playing field for those who experience inequality. The affirmative action is a means in the form of a set of laws, policies and administrative practices to achieve substantive equality.
Country perspectives Sri Lanka
The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka guarantees the right equality before the law and the equal protection of the law in Article 12(1) and along with it paragraph (2) prohibits discrimination on the ground of race, religion, language, caste, gender etc. There was, however, an express provision in Article 12(4) enabling a type of affirmative action, albeit in very narrow terms couched as follows:
(4) Nothing in this Article shall prevent special provision being made by law, subordinate legislation or executive action, for the advancement of women, children or disabled persons.
From one point of view, this was not a radical departure from the equality principle as this provision may be regarded as a specific instance of rationale classification which is permissible under the equality principle. It is not a contradiction of the right of equality which only requires that persons similarly situated be treated equally and does not require it when there is manifest inequality between persons which justifies special treatment.
Seneviratne v UGC
In Seneviratne v University Grants Commission (UGC) the petitioner challenged the quota system adopted by the respondent UGC with regard to admission to the public university system on the basis that it violated Article 12(1). The facts revealed that the scheme of admissions to the Universities provided for 55% of the places available to be distributed on the basis of ratio of population among the 24 administrative districts: 15% of the places were to be apportioned at the discretion of the Commission among 13 districts which were considered to be underprivileged and 30% of the places were to be decided solely on merit. The challenge was directed to the said allocation of the 55%.
The respondent UGC submitted to Court that by reason of the educational  socio-economic circumstances of Sri Lanka and the unequal secondary education facilities provided mainly by the government, the determination of entry to the universities based solely on the aggregate of raw marks of a candidate cannot be accepted as the sole criterion for higher education. Further, as the Commission contended, it must conform to the national policy set out in the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Article 27 of our Constitution.
Wanasundara J., upholding the classification stated that the increasing number of students pressing for admissions and the woeful lack of teachers and facilities in most of the Provinces had compelled the authorities to modify the merit principle to meet the ends of justice. The departure from the merit principle, though unfortunate is inevitable.
Ramupillai Case
The question of the constitutionality of ethnic quotas in promotions in public service was considered in Ramupillai v Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs and others, a matter referred to a Bench of seven Judges. The quotas were introduced by two Public Administration Circulars issued in pursuance of a Cabinet decision. The petitioner, a Superintendent of Customs, was an applicant along with 15 other Superintendents for 22 vacancies in the grade of Assistant Director. Of the first twenty-two persons eligible for promotions, 15 were Sinhalese and 7 were Tamils. The petitioner was 10th in the order of seniority and would have been promoted if not for the ethnic quota. On the application of the ethnic quota, 19 Sinhalese and 3 Tamils would be promoted, but the petitioner would be left out as he was the 5th Tamil on the list.
The Supreme Court, in its unanimous opinion, struck down the circulars in so far as they applied to promotions. The Court held that the Superintendent of Customs formed a single class. All of them should have an equal opportunity for advancement of their career in the public service irrespective of race, caste, religion etc. Fernando J. explained that paragraph (2), (3) and (4) of Article 12 are essentially explanatory and declaratory of the principle of equality. Affirmative action is not an exception to the principle of equality but its necessary corollary. Differential treatment of citizens on account of factors set out in Article 12(2) is prima facie unconstitutional but there seems to be no such presumption in the case of others factors.
The learned judge stated that differential treatment must be for a legitimate object only. If in relation to a legitimate object, their race reasonably makes persons of one race a distinct class, they may be equally treated. The same is true of sex, religion and political opinion. Thus, for the legitimate object of appointing a suitable person as a matron of a girls hostel, the male may be excluded. In appointing a teacher of a particular religion, persons of other religions may be excluded. The learned judge further stated that racial quotas cannot be imposed simply for the purpose of correcting an existing racial imbalance, except perhaps where there is serious, chronic, and pervasive under-representation or over-representation sufficient to raise a presumption of past discrimination.
Fernando J. took the view that affirmative action is permissible both at the stage of recruitment and promotion, where necessary proof exists, but the proposed remedy would be more strictly scrutinized in the case of promotions on account of other compelling needs and interests such as efficiency, higher levels of responsibility involved upon promotion and the legitimate expectations of employees that merit and devoted services would be rewarded. Applying the above principles, the learned judge held that the State had failed to establish the justification for departure from the merit principle.
The United States of America
The US affirmative action policies were developed to address long histories of discrimination faced by minorities and women. They first emerged from debates over non-discrimination policies in the 1940s and during the Civil Rights Movement. In 1961, President John F Kennedy became the first to utilize the term affirmative action in its contemporary sense in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and employees are treated during employment without regard to race, creed, colour and national origin.
In the US a prominent form of racial preferences relates to access to education particularly avenues to universities and other forms of higher education. In early 1970s Administrators of Harward University invented the Harward plan, one of the countrys earliest and most effective affirmative action programmes, which became a model for other universities around the country. Affirmative action is a subject of controversy in American politics. Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college and graduate schools etc.
Bakke Case
The first major US Supreme Case dealing with affirmative action was Regents of the University of California v Bakke. The Medical School of the University of California at Daves had adopted an affirmative action plan that sets aside 16 % of the places in its entering class for disadvantaged minority students. By a five to four vote, the Court struck down the plan as violating equal protection. But at the same time, the court upheld the general principle of affirmative action and determined that consideration of an applicant race could be a constitutionally permissible factor in university admission provided that it was part of a properly devised admission programme.
Grutter Case
In Grutter v Bollinger, the US Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 vote that race could be used as one of several factors in professional school admissions without necessarily violating the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The Court found that the University of Michigan law schools narrowly tailored policy which considered race and other factors, with no quota or predetermined weight associated with the factors, was constitutional and appropriate to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body. The Court also ruled that University of Michigan undergraduate admissions system, which granted extra points to minorities based on race and which determined admissions status based on cumulative points was unconstitutional because it is too mechanical and does not appear to consider the individuals actual contribution to the educational environment.
India
In India, while Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, Articles 15, 16 and 17 spell out some specific areas of non-discrimination. Article 15 provides that the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, and that no citizen shall be subject to disability or restriction on any of these grounds with regard to access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places for public entertainments or use of wells, tanks, bathing Ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public. There are two exceptions to the operation of Article 15. Firstly, it will not prevent the State from making any special provisions for women and children. Secondly, it will not prevent the State from making any special provisions for advancement of any socially and educationally backward class of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Article 16 provides equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment under the State. It provides that no citizen shall on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for or be discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State. An exception is provided to this principle. There may be reservation of posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services of the State. A special provision may also be made for reservations in matters of promotions in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Article 17 abolishes untouchability.
It is not permissible to waive the requirement of minimum educational qualifications and other standards essential for the maintenance of efficiency of services. The reservation should not be excessive that it practically denies the reasonable opportunity of employment to members of other communities. The provision for reservation in appointments and posts under the State should satisfy two conditions, firstly, the class of citizens in favour of which reservations are made should be socially and educationally backward; and secondly, the particular backward class has no adequate representation in the given public service.
South Africa
Article 9(2) of the South African Constitution recognizes the validity of measures taken to protect or advance persons or categories of persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination. In this section, persons covered under affirmative action programmes are broadly defined, as persons or categories of persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination, unlike Article 12(4) of the Sri Lankan Constitution or Article 15(2) and 16(2) of the Indian Constitution. In the Grootboom Case, the South African Constitutional Court found that communitys right to have access to adequate housing under section 26 of the South African Constitution had been violated. The applicants about thousand men, women and children lived in the West Cape where influx control policies were implemented. The States extensive housing programmes as an affirmative action programme instituted through both legislature and other measures although a major achievement, failed to provide in any way for these people in desperate need. The housing plan provided for the progressive realization of access to formal housing to be accessed through a waiting period of up to seven years or even longer. This was so in essence because the governments housing plan did not pass the threshold of reasonableness contemplated by section 26(2) of the South African Constitution. The Court held that in order for a legislative policy framework aimed at the progressive realization of economic and social rights to be regarded as reasonable, it must be adequate and be comprehensive, coherent and balanced and flexible.
The affirmative action is not a refinement or extension or an exception to, the principle of equality, but its necessary corollary: it is applicable whenever unequals are being considered. However, all differential treatment need be justified to remedy the present effects of past discrimination and not to perpetuate fixed quotas.

From export economy to entrepreneurial economy
Entrepreneurship came into the limelight after few decades of the declaration of the year of export in 1992. In the same year, Export Development Board stated that Sri Lanka already achieved the status of NIC (nearly industrialist country). However, that nearness had floated away to far distant to-date. Then it is important to understand where Sri Lanka went wrong.
According to our research and teaching experience, infrastructure development automatically induces economic development. Next, up to now, no governments had taken the risk (except Enterprise Sri Lanka) to provide incentives (i.e., bank loans) to young men who have yet to start a business. Third, no institute was able to define entrepreneur who could make a significant impact on the economy. Fourth, no scientific investigation carried out to trace the ancient entrepreneurship proximity to ports. Finally, a comprehensive database of small businesses of Sri Lanka is yet to be established.
Claudius Ptolemy (85-165 AD), a great Egyptian geographer of the 1st century, had written about several commercial seaports of Sri Lanka. From 2nd to 13th century, according to historians, Mannar (Mahatitta) located facing the Arabian Sea was the most industrious seaport in Sri Lanka. Later, in the 7th century, Trincomalee (Gokanna) situated facing the Bay of Bengal, became the important port in Sri Lanka. Colombo became an important city since the 10th century and in the early 16th century (1505 AD), with the arrival of Portuguese; Colombo became a commercial hub of Sri Lanka. This evidence shows that Sri Lanka had been a country of seaports with the multitude of activities including transhipment, exports, and imports.
With these activities, Sri Lankan became an export economy and much of the income was derived from exporting spices, gems, and ivory. Ancient Kings levied duties on imports, transhipments, and exports and administered ports creating an ambient environment for export-import business. Dutch and British also continued the same activities adding tea, rubber, and coconut to the list of exports. However, under British and Dutch rules, the role of Sri Lankan as exporters diminished. Hence, most of the Sri Lankan was driven away for plantations for processing and planting of tea, rubber, and coconuts. As a result, export orientation of Sri Lankan was declined along with the export entrepreneurship.
New markets
In the 12th century, when Sri Lanka was flourishing in commerce under the leadership of Parakrama Bahu the Great, America and Australia were yet to be discovered; England was in anarchy under the rule of King Stephan, and Japan emerged as a country of art and literature. According to historians, none of the western countries was entrepreneurial than those of the East.
The industrial revolution in the 17th century in Britain change worlds economy. Britain developed new products, the new method of processing, new methods of organising, discovered new raw materials (i.e., coal and steel) and new markets. These five methods, according to Schumpeter, the great American economist, termed entrepreneurship that breaks the traditional circular flow of traditional economic flow. From the growth statistics of Sri Lankan economy, Sri Lanka is in this circular flow since independence barely surpassing the rate of population growth.
Successive governments of Sri Lanka attempted to infuse entrepreneurship into Sri Lankans through varies policy measures. Inward looking policies and restricting imports from 1971-1977, the export-oriented economy in the 1990s and declaring 1992 as the year of export and similar policies up to 2017 had not given the expected results. Most of the man-made products are highly dependent on imported machinery, raw materials, and processing methods.
Most of the other products are in the primary form with low-value addition (i.e., copra, rubber sheets, coir etc,). Cost of value addition for these products may merely cover only the cost of production and processing. Garment and apparel industry, the major export of Sri Lanka, according to international reports, is one of the most dependent industries in the developing world. These industries have no room for innovation for Sri Lankans to expand their capabilities or for innovative entrepreneurship which is the key to breakthrough economic development.
Rapid growth needs innovation
Economic development of a country, according to scholars, is proportional to the number of innovative entrepreneurs of the country, not the number of ordinary businessmen. The term entrepreneur is always misunderstood. Retailers who sell imported products for a commission, self-employed persons who do business for survival are coming under entrepreneurs and incentives are provided accordingly. This type of entrepreneurs is termed explicative entrepreneurs who does business as others do. However, these entrepreneurs do not contribute to the economy significantly. Further, a continuation of parents business without innovation is also regarded as non-entrepreneurial.
Entrepreneurs who do business innovatively are the ones who contribute to economy considerably. Because he creates something new for the economy, the economy starts growing. Innovative entrepreneurship, according to Schumpeter, a great American economist, says that entrepreneurship should develop new raw material, new product, new process, new organising methods or new market.
Growth is the other major factor in entrepreneurial business. Rapid growth needs innovation. Studies have shown that imitation is at the initial stage of a business which might turn out to be innovative. Taiwan is a country which couldnt emerge as an innovative country due to high dependency on explicative entrepreneurship. China initially started with reflective entrepreneurship but which attained progress through innovative-imitative entrepreneurship.
A major reason for successive governments failure to develop genuine entrepreneurship, in addition to the misconception of an entrepreneur, is identifying entrepreneurs. The basic questions that any entrepreneurship develops institute would ask is what is your business and how much is the turnover. Failing to give an impressive figure may result in the rejection of the application. No further attempts were made to identify the entrepreneurial capabilities even though there are major scientific methods to identify the inborn talents of entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurial talents
According to scholars, entrepreneurship could be taught while others argue it is an inborn talent. Only practical way to identify innovative entrepreneurship is to encourage start-ups and take risk of providing incentives irrespective of success. Another way of identifying genuine entrepreneurship is the rapid growth of the business. Passing out bachelors from universities and emerging non-graduate entrepreneurs may be a pool of entrepreneurial talents who need some sort of state sponsorship to start a business.
According to university statistics, nearly 4,000 commerce and management undergraduates and nearly 2,000 postgraduates in management are passing out annually from 16 universities. Majority of passed out bachelor degree holders are seeking jobs either in state or private sectors. Out of nearly 7,000 bachelors in arts degrees, majority join clerical and allied grades in the states graduate employment schemes or elsewhere annually.
The state has failed to identify their entrepreneurial talents scientifically hence provide unproductive jobs at the expense of public funds. The most unfortunate thing about university curriculum is that non-inclusion of practical aspect in business management (i.e., starting a business) in either stream. Business management subjects are not offered in art stream. If it was made compulsory, as a core subject for both arts and commerce streams, the country may have over 10,000 business projects annually. Even though there is no guarantee of success in all projects, the successful ones may surpass the cost born for all projects. Most of the university curricula in business management, no choice were given either to start a business or to do the theoretical dissertation.
Finally, an effort towards taking a risk on business start-ups of undergraduates and armature entrepreneurs is appreciable. Bearing major portion of interest of the loans extended to entrepreneurs is equally praiseworthy. However, the most important aspect of entrepreneurship is separating explicative entrepreneurs from innovative entrepreneurs. Next, is to make scientific investigation about ancient entrepreneurship, along with the changing prominence of ancient seaports, in Sri Lanka. This may pave the way to get evidence to promote other seaports in Sri Lanka as commercial hubs for different exports. Further, incentives given to explicative entrepreneurs could be redirected to existing innovative entrepreneurs who make the change. Also, it is necessary to compile a comprehensive database on business (annual industry survey is not sufficient) and then to develop methods to identify innovative entrepreneurship scientifically. This could be the stepping stone for innovative enterprising Sri Lanka.

Film distribution dispute rages on
National Film Corporation Chairman Sithendra Senaratne said recently that the distribution of films, which was handled by four private companies, would come under the purview of the National Film Corporation. This rule is for both local as well as foreign films.
"President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a committee to look into the problems of the cinema sector and to identify issues and to recommend suitable remedies. 45 experts who are involved in the field worked on the report. It was submitted to the President recently," Senaratne noted on how the decision has come about.
He noted that a series of meetings with all the stakeholders of the cinema industry, the new line Ministry, the Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministries have resulted in the decision that remedies need to be found for the identified issues.
We also held meetings with film directors, producers, cinema owners and the associations of exhibitors. The decision is a result of certain distribution companies which were not doing their job properly," Senaratne stressed adding that this will result on a fair system which will safeguard the interest of the producers, directors and the cinema halls.
Letters informing about the decision had been sent immediately to the private distribution companies. As a result of this the EAP, MPI, LFD and CEL film distribution circuits held a press conference to express their views regarding the matter. The NFC should at least have the courtesy to give us sufficient notice about their decision. Throughout these years they have not expressed any satisfaction towards how the circuits have been functioning. Such actions will result in the death knell in the Sinhala cinema industry, Sunil Siriwardhana said.
He also added that the private circuits have been contributing immensely to enhance the local film scene. They had funded films, built cinemas and renovated film halls. They have also managed to bring globally acclaimed films from Hollywood, Bollywood and Tollywood to local cinemas.
EAP Executive Director Kasun Jayawardhane added that NFC has overlooked several recommendations given by the committee to enhance its own role. Instead they had taken on the task of acquiring distribution rights which have not been mentioned in the report.
MPI Managing Director Sunil T Fernando stated that this move had been made to screen 80 low quality films that have been rejected by the circuits. MPI Joint Managing Director Arjun Kamalanath also added his bit by noting that government bodies never interfere in distributing films but only act as supervisors in countries abroad.
He also voiced his doubts whether NFC will be able to carry on this task properly considering its level of inefficiency.
It was anonymously decided to form a new industry association compromising key people from three sectors - private film distributors, film exhibitors and film producers - to address the key issues of the film industry as a joint forum.
Accordingly, a new forum namely 'Lanka United Film Producers, Distributers and Exhibitors Association (LUFPD&EA)' was formed. The office bearers are the following prominent figures from the local film industry:
Senior Advisor - Sunil Siriwardhana (LFD Film Circuit and Film Exhibitor)
Joint Presidents - Sunil T. Fernando (MPI Film Circuit, Film Producer and Film Exhibitor) and Kasun Jayawardhane (EAP Film Circuit)
Convener - Arjun Kamalanath (MPI Film Circuit, Film Producer and Film Exhibitor)
Secretary - K. Wimaladasa (MPI Film Circuit)
Deputy Secretary - Dr. Arosha Fernando (MPI Film Circuit, Film Producer and Exhibitor)
Treasurer - G. R. Pathmaraj (CEL Film Circuit and Film Exhibitor)
The following 12 key stakeholders of the industry has been selected and appointed as the committee who represents the private film distributors, film exhibitors and film producers - Imitiaz Cader, Devapriya Abeysinghe, H. M. Hair Haren, Ananda Peiris, Gamini Ehaliyagoda, Rohan Pinnaduwa, R Sadesh Kumar, Aravinda Weerakoon, Sunil Premaratne, L Sankunaraja, Sunil Dharmasiri and Keerthi Weerasinghe.
The newly formed association is expecting to meet up with President Maithripala Sirisena, subject Minister Wijedasa Rajapakse (Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs) and the Chairman of the National Film Corporation (NFC) to discuss the way forward and key issues highlighted in the meeting.
A letter has also been signed by all the participants to be handed over to the President and the Minister highlighting consequences to the film industry due to the recent decision made by the National Film Corporation without consulting any film industry experts.

Five thousand acres in Ratnapura for the landless
Land and Parliamentary Reforms Deputy Minister Dunesh Gankanda said that they were negotiating with the Land Reforms Commission to release 5,000 acres of land in the Ratnapura district to landless people living in the villages and plantations in the area.
The Deputy Minister stressed that those living in the plantations still lived in structures over 100 years old which were unsuitable for human habitation; their tin roofs were now worn away. The Ratnapura district Land Reform Commission manages land with 25,000 people living on these lands and the deputy minister said they would take steps to provide them with title deeds, land for those who do not own land, and development work through the Gamudawa programme.
Further, land held by the plantations and the Land Reform Commission would be given to small-scale investors.

Former NCP Chief Minister ordered to pay Rs. 250,000 to principal
The Supreme Court yesterday ordered the former North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne to personally pay Rs. 250,000 as compensation to a school principal.
This is for violating his Fundamental Rights in transferring him for having handed over a sheaf of betel leaves to the former Chief Minister in a wrong way at a welcome.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Nalin Perera made this order following a fundamental rights petition filed by R.P. Karunaratne Bandara, a former principal of Nivanththaka Chethiya Maha Vidyalaya in Anuradhapura.
The Supreme Court also issued an order directing the state to pay Rs.50,000 to the petitioner as legal costs.
The Supreme Court further issued an order directing the Provincial Education Director to transfer the petitioner back to Nivanththaka Chethiya Maha Vidyalaya in Anuradhapura within two months.
The petitioner was serving as the principal of the Pahala Halmillewa Dutugemunu Maha Vidyalaya by letter dated 28.05.2015 issued by Provincial Education Director (Anuradhapura). He was transferred as the principal of Nivanththaka Chethiya Maha Vidyalaya in Anuradhapura with immediate effect on exigencies of service.
The petitioner stated that he assumed duties as the principal of Nivanththaka Chethiya Maha Vidyalaya and discharged the functions to the satisfaction of the Education Authorities, parents, teachers and students.
The petitioner stated on September 6, 2016, he was informed over the telephone by the Secretary to the school development committee that the Chief Minister will be attending the school on September 9 at 9:30 am for a ceremony to lay the foundation stone in order to commence the work relating to the proposed new school building. He stated that it was a sudden decision taken by the respondents and he was given only two days notice to make all the required preparations for the said ceremony of laying the foundation stone by the Chief Minister.
In the heat of the events, the petitioner had handed over a sheaf of beetle leaves to the Chief Minister to cordially welcome him. However due to an inadvertent oversight said bundle had been turned the wrong way around which mistake was brought in to his attention subsequently.
He further stated that the Chief Minister made quite cynical comments when addressing the gathering alleging that there were school principals who do not know as to how the bundle of beetle leaves should be handed to a guest and alleged that he failed to get sufficient number of parents for his meeting.
The petitioner was informed by the Provincial Education Director requesting him to come to the Chief Ministry of the North Central Province. He stated that he went to the Chief Ministry and he was informed that he would be transferred to a different school with immediate effect on the orders given by the Chief Minister. The reason given for the alleged transfer is the unhappiness of the Chief Minister with regard to the events that transpired at Nivanthaka Chethiya Maha Vidyalaya. Subsequently, he was informed that he has been transferred to Rambewa Maha Vidyalaya in Anuradhapura.
He sought a declaration the respondents have violated his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the constitution.
Senior Counsel Shantha Jayawardena with Sunil Watagala appeared for the petitioner.

Frog fascination
Juliet Coombe interviews Jetwing St. Andrew naturalist Ishanda Senevirathna about his exciting new book on frogs found in and around the cloud forest in Nuwara Eliya
In the end we will conserve only what we love; we will love only what we understand; and we will understand only what we are taught- Baba Dioum, 1968
To love something you have to understand it and it was on this basis Ishanda set up the islands first frog watching tour in Nuwara Eliya six years ago. A night safari that starts at 7am or 8.30pm looking for frogs in the Cloud Forest behind Jetwing St. Andrews hotel. One guest says of the nightly frog tour Nothing beats going on a night frog safari with Ishanda the resident naturalist who will show you tiny little frogs no bigger than our finger nail to an amazing forest frog wall.
The study of frogs goes back to 1735 and yet until very recently the only tour in existence is in Costa Rica. Over the years through different research projects 119 frogs have been documented and it seems103 are endemic to the island (the other16 are mainly from India and other South Asian countries). One of the most loved amphibians is the frog; due to fairy tales suggesting that if you kiss one he will turn into a handsome prince.
Frogs according to naturalist Ishandas book `The Peeping Frogs of Nuwara Eliya, are key to a healthy environment and around the hotel you can see most nights between seven and if very lucky ten different varieties, which are featured in his fascinating full colour guide. The Peeping Frogs of Nuwara Eliya show clearly man and nature cannot exist in isolation and as such we should be concerned when we no longer here the sounds of gribbit near our home garden ponds. Each step we make on this plane has an effect and our understanding of this has never been more important with more and more species becoming endangered and close to extinction.
These adorable characters that come in a myriad of different skin colours, creating the perfect camouflage that protects them from attacks by birds and snakes, surprisingly have only a yearly life cycle. The land frogs are brown with stipples so the birds dont kill them in the mountain zone, but in the dry zone the enemy is mainly the snakes. In the water they are brownie grey, whereas in the shrubs they are green and yellow and on the rocks they are dark grey making it harder for predators to pick them out. I found it fascinating seeing a male and female toad and the significant difference in size. Also the incredible range of microhabitats so close together and ranging from shrubs, to leaf litter, logs, moss covered rocks in streams, pools, wetlands and even the home garden was full of fascinating signs of frog life.
Walking along handmade stony paths you can live the pages of the book by going on a nightly exhibition with Ishanda who will take you with torches to explore the rocky area with dense forest and here with our torches we find shrub frogs that lay eggs in the shrubs around 2 or 3 at a time in contrast to a leaf nesting shrub frog that lays hundreds of eggs, but have only 5 per cent chance of survival. Amazingly on the cold days the leaf nesting shrub frog will climb 15 metres up a tree and seeing one doing it is a truly extraordinary experience. Also on the cold days the naturalist finds more frogs near the water streams that run randomly down Pedro Mountain.
The tour climbs the rocky out crop to the top where the trees change to the Pygmy trees known locally as the Godwin trees, which are centuries old. This is an amazing experience around the full moon as the forest is naturally lit, reducing your need for torches, to find your way to where black lizards can be discovered sleeping and other night insects that the frogs are busy eating are at their most active. Ishanda says we very occasionally find the forest eagle owl and fish owl. The guests love it when we find the rhino horn lizard and pygmy lizard, the latter of which has a curly tail and hangs from plants.
No two days or weather conditions are the same as the animals move from one area to another and on normal days you will see around eight varieties of frogs. The one that gets everyone excited is the Montane Hour Glass Tree Frog as he jumps great distances and with his long body he looks like an Olympic decathlete. The body colours brownish orange and the luminous yellow bottom half of the Montane Hour Glass Tree Frog makes him the king of the Mount Pedro frogs.
Years of study show some eggs found, miss out the tadpole phase and in fact come out as frogs in the case of the shrub frog, which is exciting to see against a backdrop of crickets calling to each other continuously, only broken by the sound of water hens in the wetland area, which you return to on our circuit route through the rocks, Eucalypts trees, shrubs and streams. The drizzle and mist add to the mystery of frog watching tours that also take into account the seasonal life cycles.
The noises made by frogs range from clicking, clickerty click to gribbit the more popular sound often used to represent all frogs in movies, when in reality they all have slightly different calls and individually use different calls according to their situations the same way we might shout if angry or talk seductively if courting.
The nightly frog tour is US $15 per person and can be booked through Jetwing St. Andrews reception with Ishanda Seneverathna. To find out more about frogs you can purchase his amazing book at the hotel or direct from Ishanda after the walk.

Govts support for development of aviation sector
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva yesterday pledged to provide the governments fullest support to both local and foreign companies investing in the development of the domestic aviation sector in Sri Lanka.
The Minister was speaking after opening the new helicopter hanger which is equipped with state of the art facilities to facilitate private sector sales and maintenance of helicopters utilizing their air operator certificate in Welisara yesterday.
This is Sri Lankas first privately owned fully fledged aerodrome built by the IWS Holdings Group that includes the facilities of landing and parking spaces, line and base maintenance for airbus and Bell helicopters, aircraft on Ground Help Desk (AOG ) support, crew coordination and Air Operators certificate (AOG) 24/7.
The Minister further said it is vital to expand the domestic aviation industry in the country for the benefit of tourists and investors visiting Sri Lanka. It is necessary to construct these types of centers in the country providing line and base maintenance for airbus and Bell helicopters when expanding the domestic aviation sector in Sri Lanka.
During the last few years, domestic flight operations were carried out by the Sri Lanka Air force. But, there are many problems including legal barriers associated with these civil flights operations. Therefore, we are pleased that many private sector companies are coming forward to start and facilitate domestic flights operations in Sri Lanka, he added.
Development work of the Baticaloa domestic airport is being progressed successfully at present. We hope to create a number of job opportunities for the Baticaloa youth with these developments and construction projects, he added.

Handstamping art
Russell Powell of San Jose, California, stamps his art onto paper after carefully painting his palms.
One day, while teaching art at an elementary school, he began painting on his hands. Fast-forward two and half years later, and hes created his own art form. A completely self-taught artist, he has refined the process by continuously experimenting. By manipulating his handand the way he paintsmany different ways, he can carefully control the proportions of figures left by his hands.
Powell has painted an array of subjects, ranging from historical figures and music artists to indigenous peoples and exotic animals. To start, he decides whether he wants the finished product to be in black-and-white or in color. Sometimes hell even mix the two styles for a more striking effect.
The hardest part, he says, is incorporating highly detailed features. His painting surface is limited by the size of his hand, and he also has to work around his fingers and palm. He also has to consider how fast the paint will dry once hes started. Since it has to be ready to adhere to a second surface, hes had to develop various techniques for the perfect transfer. Though it may be a difficult medium to paint on, his handprint is what gives him such a personal connection to each piece he creates. His fingerprints are literally visible on each piece.
When he wants to expand the size of a handstamp painting, he can stamp various paintings on his hand together on one canvas. Hell even fill in details and background with partial handprints. Creating expansive landscapes can be difficult, however, as each handprint has to be painted as a mirror image before being stamped.
Powell continues to create art drawing, inspiration from his students.

Japan booed off but reach last 16 despite Poland loss
Volgograd, Thursday: Japan and Poland were booed from the pitch in Volgograd after a farcical end to their final Group H match which saw the Blue Samurai qualify for the last 16 despite a 1-0 defeat.
Japan went through by the slimmest of margins -- their fair play record -- after the last 10 minutes were played out like a training match as both sides settled for the result.
They will meet either Belgium or England after reaching the knockout stage for the third time in their history. When Jan Bednarek scored his first international goal in the 60th minute for already eliminated Poland, the score between Colombia and Senegal stood at 0-0 meaning Japan were going out. But once news filtered through of Yessy Minas 74th minute goal for Colombia the match changed for the worse.
The strike meant Colombia would win the group and Japan were ahead of Senegal despite identical points, goal difference and goals scored, because they had received fewer yellow cards. A cacophony of boos rang out as hardly any tackles were made in the last 10 minutes as Poland decided any sort of win would be enough and Japan decided not to risk any yellow cards. Japan coach Akira Nishino made six changes including bringing in attacking pair Shinji Okazaki and Yoshinori Muto for his World Cup debut.
And it was they who fashioned the first real opening in the 12th minute of a game played at sedate pace in 36 Celsius temperatures.
Bednarek played a blind pass across his penalty area straight to Muto who shifted it to Yuto Nagatomo motoring down the left flank.
His whipped cross was met by a diving Okazaki header which flashed wide. Moments later Muto won possesion again outside the box and his fierce shot was parried out of harms way by goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, one of five changes in Polands starting line-up.
The Polish captain Robert Lewandowski is renowned as a world-class goalscorer for Bayern Munich but, as in the rest of Polands sorry World Cup campaign, he was seeing little of the ball. Goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima kept his place for the Samurai Blue despite a howler for Senegals first goal in the 2-2 draw and repaid Nishinos faith with a wondrous save to keep the score goalless at half-time.
Piotr Zielinski crossed from the right and Kamil Grosicki found himself unmarked near the penalty.
His cleverly directed header looked destined for the bottom corner until Kawashima made up huge amounts of ground to claw it to safety with a right hand at full stretch.
Goalline technology confirmed he had kept it out by less than half the width of the ball but that was just about all Poland had offered as they headed for the shortish plane ride back to Warsaw. Kawashima did it again in the second half to prevent what would have been Tomoaki Nakino own goal.
Okazaki had run his heart out in the sapping conditions and gave way to Yuya Osaka in the 47th minute as Nishino introduced fresh legs.
Kawashima did have to pick the ball out of his net on the hour mark as Bednarak got on the end of a Rafal Kurzawa long free-kick to volley home at the back post. AFP

Magistrate reprimands  Yashoda Range Bandara
Chilaw Magistrate and District Judge Manjula Ratnayake severely reprimanded Yashoda Range Bandara for his failure to repair the house damaged in the accident.
The case relating to the recent Chilaw Kottapitiya Junction motor accident created an upheaval in the area. It was called in the Chilaw Magistrates Court on June 28. Although Attorney Vajira Ranasinghe who appeared for Yashoda Range Bandara pleaded for two weeks time to repair the house, Magistrate and District Judge Manjula Ratnayake ordered that repair work should be completed before July 5.
He also ordered the Arachchikattuwa Police to submit a report in court on that day about the progress of the work. The Defence Counsel also submitted that the laptop computer and the television set had been brought to Court.
Counsel Chinthaka Karunaratne appearing for the aggrieved party said the repair restoration of the damaged house should be urgently completed since two children resident in the home are due to sit the GCE Advanced Level Examination this year.
In the wee hours of June 6, a double cab in which a group of people were returning after attending a party at a Karukapane hotel ran off the road at Kottapitiya junction and crashed into a house causing severe damage to the house and the vehicle. It was later revealed that the double cab was driven by Yashoda Range Bandara, Media Secretary to the State Minister of Disaster Management.
The Secretary to the Ministry of Disaster Management in a statement to the Arachchikattuwa Police later said the double cab had been assigned to Yashoda Range Bandara for official duties.
The Arachchikattuwa Police has recorded statements from both Yashoda Range Bandara and the official driver of the double cab and the latter had stated that he was not driving the double cab on that day.
Arachchikattuwa Police are conducting further investigations.

Maryland shooting: Five killed in 'targeted' attack on US newspaper
A gunman has opened fire at a local newspaper office in Maryland, killing five people and injuring others in what police said was a "targeted attack".
Staff at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis said the attacker, armed with a shotgun and smoke grenades, shot through a glass door into the newsroom.
US media have named a suspect held by police as Jarrod Ramos, who is reported to have unsuccessfully sued the newspaper group in 2012 for defamation.
Police have not confirmed a motive.
They said a white male suspect in his late 30s was taken into custody at the scene of the shooting and was being questioned.
Investigators were said to be looking into "violent" threats that had been made against the Capital Gazette via social media.
"This was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette," said William Krampf, deputy chief of Anne Arundel County Police. He added that the gunman "entered the building with a shotgun and looked for his victims as he walked through the lower level".
County executive Steve Schuh told CNN that the suspect was hiding under a desk in the building when police officers arrived "within 60 seconds" of receiving news of the incident. He said there was "no exchange of fire".
The Capital Gazette publishes several local newspapers, including a daily called The Capital, which has a history dating back to 1884. It is owned by the Baltimore Sun Media Group.
The Baltimore Sun reported that police gathered outside Ramos' house on Thursday after the attack. It said the alleged suspect has a "long-running feud" with The Capital over a 2011 report on a criminal harassment case against him.
The victims have been identified by police. They are:
Wendi Winters, 65, reporter
Rebecca Smith, 34, sales assistant
Robert Hiaasen, 59, editor
Gerald Fischman, 61, editorial writer
John McNamara, 56, reporter and editor
Speaking to reporters, Krampf said an item "we believed to be an explosive device" had been found at the premises and destroyed. He said it turned out to be a smoke bomb.
He added that more than 170 people had been escorted safely from the building, which houses other businesses.

Mina winner sends Colombia through as ill-disciplined Senegal go out
Samara, Thursday: A powerful header from Barcelonas Yerry Mina fired Colombia into the last 16 of the World Cup with a 1-0 win over Group H rivals Senegal, who crashed out due to a poorer disciplinary record than Japan.
Colombia and Japan will play either England or Belgium, who were playing later Thursday.
The South Americans, looking to reach the latter stages after reaching the quarter-finals in Brazil, risked going out of the tournament at the first hurdle.
But after seeing the video assistant referee come to their rescue in a disappointing first half, Colombia were handed a last-16 lifeline 13 minutes from the end when Mina rose to meet a corner from the right and direct a header into the roof of Khadim Ndiayes net.
Polands 1-0 consolation win over Japan meant the Asians finished level with Senegal, who were agonisingly eliminated because they were issued six yellow cards in the competition, two more than Japan.
In Samara, Colombia coach Jose Pekerman kept faith with the attacking front line that thumped Poland 3-0, with midfielders Juan Quintero, James Rodriguez and Juan Cuadrado providing the support for striker Radamel Falcao up front.
But by the end of an entertaining first half, Pekerman was forced to tinker when Rodriguez was forced off with an injury problem and replaced by Luis Muriel.
Before then, Senegal had shown attacking potency but, all too often, failed to threaten David Ospinas goal.
Colombias best first-half chance came from a free-kick that saw Ndiaye dive to parry Juan Quinteros powerful effort after Falcao had been sandwiched in mid-air.
Yet Colombia lacked pace and punch, and the trickery of Juan Cuadrado, so effective against Poland, failed to impress Senegal as they caught the Juventus man out more than once.
When Cuadrado lost possession cheaply at the halfway line, Keita Balde sent Sadio Mane on his way towards goal before the Liverpool man fell under a challenge from defender Davinson Sanchez.
Serbian referee Milorad Mazic pointed to the spot but amid Colombian protests he was called to consult the VAR, which showed Sanchezs boot had made contact with the ball first.
From another free kick Falcao was flagged offside when he headed Quinteros floated delivery high and wide.
Senegal responded, but Keita shot straight at Ospina after the keeper had spilled a powerful drive by Mane.
There was excitement among the Colombian fans when they learned Poland had scored against Japan, but Los Cafeteros struggled to do their bit.
Hopes were raised when Quinteros powerful free kick from the right was blocked in the area and fell to Muriel, whose shot was deflected out. From the corner, Falcaos header was bundled wide.
Penalty claims were waved away when Muriel fell dramatically under a challenge by Ndiaye as the keeper rushed out to close him down.
But the Samara stadium erupted as Colombia finally broke the deadlock.
Cuadrados attempt to dribble into the area earned a corner, and Barcelona defender Mina rose highest to flash a header downwards that bounced up into the top of Ndiayes net on 77 minutes.
Senegal rallied in the closing minutes and it took a series of great saves by Arsenal shot-stopped Ospina to keep Colombia in the tournament. AFP

Principality of Sealand has sat off the British coast for over 50 years. Though it is largely unrecognized throughout the world, it claims to be the smallest country in the world. The island measures just 15 by 40 yards, with just enough room for a small building and helicopter landing pad.
At the height of World War II, the British military installed open-sea fortresses in the mouth of the Thames River. These forts provided anti-aircraft support and deterred German crafts from laying mines in British shipping channels.
The fort Sealand now occupies was designated HM Fort Roughs. Constructed at port, these structures were floated out to sea on hollow pontoons. Once they reached their destination, the pontoons were filled with water, sinking to the seafloor and anchoring the fort in place. The Sealand structure was in operation within 30 minutes of being launched. Soldiers remained in the fort until 1956, when the fort was virtually abandoned by the British.

MRs gems
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, these days, is making statements to the media that border on the ridiculous, to be more charitable, providing comic relief to the public, or, at least the more enlightened among them, during these times of hardship brought on by the high cost of living. Recently Rajapaksa pledged to reduce the Value Added Tax by 20% in a future government under his leadership. When asked by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to explain how this will be done, while at the same time paying off the mountainous foreign debt the country is currently saddled with, Rajapaksa came out with a gem. Said he: If I was able to successfully end the three decades long separatist war this is next to nothing to me.
On Wednesday, in Kataragama, Rajapaksa told journalists that he will make certain that his nephew Udayanga Weeratunga will return to the country to face charges against him, in one month's time. What was keeping him (Udayanga) from boarding a plane to return to Sri Lanka, presently, was the delay in admitting his children to school at the other end, according to the former President. So it is now clear that Rajapaksa is not only very much in touch with Weeratunga but is also well aware of the events connected to the life of his nephew, whom he appointed Ambassador to Russia, that paved the way for him to be involved in the multi-million dollar MiG aircraft deal.
One would have thought that Rajapaksa would make this entreaty to Weeratunga to return to the country to answer the charges, when he met the latter in Japan recently and not wait till the time is ripe to admit Weeratunga's children to a foreign school. That would have saved a lot of trouble and costs to the country in the form of travel of the legal teams to Dubai and for lawyers engaged at the other end. That would also have raised the political capital of Rajapaksa several notches.
However, by keeping mum all this time, when the matter was on the boil, and no intimation made to Weeratunga, during his clandestine meetings with the latter, abroad, to return to the country, Rajapaksa's sincerity in this connection is very much in doubt. This is more so because former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, too, some months ago, requested Weeratunga to return to the country and face the allegations. This ploy, certainly, smacks of a calculated move by the Rajapakas to demonstrate their innocence in the MiG affair. For, in explaining how the billions earned, in commissions were deposited in the offshore company as alleged, Weeratunga will be compelled to reveal the connection of his uncles in the whole deal. By expressly summoning Udayanga to return to the country the Rajapaksas clearly want to create the impression that there indeed was no such deal. A clear case of throwing dust in the eyes of the public.
Mahinda Rajapaksa also spoke of the rise in the underworld, in his discussion with the journalists, in Kataragama, and, the alleged links of government politicians with members of the underworld. But what takes the cake was Rajapaksa's assertion that during his days in power the underworld was non-existent. How, the former President could speak so glibly is difficult to fathom. In whose era did the Wambottas, the Julampitiye, Amares hold sway, anyone who lived on this soil at the time is aware of.
In a way, Rajapaksa may be right in his assertion. Perhaps, the underworld at that time did not gain much prominence, being eclipsed by the killings, abductions and torture carried out by special units of the military, with the knowledge of powerful figures in the government. Nay, the underworld figures at that time were elected members of the local councils. The Chairman of the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha is currently serving a life term for the murder of a British national and raping his finance. But for the direct intervention of Britain in the matter, this was bound to have ended as another unsolved crime. The Manager of the Noori estate was murdered by a gang led by the Deraniyagala Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman. MR was also known to have paid his last respects to the body of slain Chairman of the Ratgama Pradeshiya Sabha, a notorious underworld figure.
True, a war of sorts was declared by the former Defence Secretary against the underworld, but there were allegations from the then General Secretary of the UNP Tissa Attanayake that the police and army were acting selectively in this respect and only underworld figures perceived to be supporters of the UNP were targeted while those supportive of the government were left alone.
Be that as it may, the war against the underworld is presently being carried out in earnest. Police, army and STF teams were shown on TV, the other day, combing jungles to apprehend the remaining suspects responsible for the killing of a police officer.
State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said the government will go all out to curb underworld activities with the help of the tri-forces. The decision was taken at the Defence Council meeting chaired by the President.
