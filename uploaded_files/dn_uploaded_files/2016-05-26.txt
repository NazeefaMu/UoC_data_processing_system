When Arjuna  inspired  Marvan

The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of Year awards have always been a great source of inspiration to thousands of budding cricketers across the country for almost four decades.
This is a classic example on how such cherished moment could inspire even a junior cricketer witnessing the mega show, which has been rewarding Sri Lankas schoolboy cricketers since 1979.
Marvan Atapattu was playing junior cricket for Ananda when his schools first X1 captain Arjuna Ranatunga was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1982. Atapattu happened to witness the show and Ranatunga winning the prestigious award for the second time, after first winning the title in 1980.
I was a student at Ananda then, playing my junior cricket. I witnessed the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards show in 1982 and saw our school captain at that time Arjuna Ranatunga emerging out of a huge cricket ball, erected on stage, to receive the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. That was a great inspiration to me and I thought that I too could make my family, the team and my school proud if I could win that top award one fine day. The things worked well for me to emulate that feat eight years later, Atapattu explained his first-hand experience about the mega show.
Exactly eight years later, Atapattu achieved that dream and emulated Ranatungas feat. Few months after winning the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 1990, Atapattu was selected to make his Test debut for Sri Lanka on November 23 the same year, against India in Chandigarh. He made his ODI debut a month later - on December 1, 1990 against India in Nagpur.
Almost all those who have won top awards at Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show have stepped into the national team in next to no time and many of them have established their mark as top national players, he said.
Attapattu was concerned about the present developments in school cricket, stating that the unnecessary competitiveness has destroyed the standard of Sri Lankas school cricket, which was once considered to be the best in the world with a well-knit tournament structure.
He added that the unwarranted competitiveness created by coaches, school authorities and old boys has caused the deteriorating standard of school cricket. They force cricketers of their school to win matches in all formats. They are not interested in producing quality cricketers who could dish out top class cricket but only insist on winning matches at any cost. That kills the standard of school cricket, said Atapattu.
He said that most schools now tend to employ young coaches who could press the cricketers to win matches but are not interested in producing quality players who could step into the national team. During our time, we counted how many former cricketers of our school are in the national team. But its not the case anymore, he said.
Atapattu attributed poor standard of cricket dished out at inter-school matches at present as the main reason for deteriorating spectator interest in school cricket. When asked about the tremendous spectator interest that attracted during his era of school cricket, some two-and-a-half decades ago, Atapattu said there are several other factors, although the main reason for such development is poor standard of school cricket.

Times have changed. Everybody is busy with their day to day work. Nevertheless, we could still attract spectators to inter-school matches if they could witness some high quality cricket, instead of the monotonous stuff we see quite often now. There are hardly any outstanding players who could attract crowds. Unlike during our era, there arent any classy schoolboy cricketers whom we could spot early as future Sri Lanka prospects, said Atapattu who has made an immense contribution to Sri Lanka cricket as a stylish opening batsman who is famous for his copybook stroke play.
Explaining how the countrys school cricket could regain its glorious past, Atapattu said coaches should be careful about the upbringing of schoolboy cricketers. We must go back to where we were. Coaches must teach the basics properly, the correct technique and not instruct them merely to win matches at any cost. What coaches do now is to try out modifications at very early age. Coaches remote-control their players and expect the boys to react, he explained.
Atapattu said that the present day schoolboy cricketers are subjected to undue pressure by their coaches, principals, masters and old boys. The system is under pressure, trying to win many matches as possible in different formats during a single school cricket season, he concluded.
Atapattu, who has aggregated 5,502 runs including 16 centuries and 17 fifties in 90 Tests, commended the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest for inspiring budding schoolboy cricketers, giving his personal experience as a junior cricketer at Ananda College, Colombo.
The stylish opening batsman has proved his class in limited over cricket too, aggregating 8,529 runs in 268 ODIs at an average of 37.57 with 11 centuries and 59 half tons. It has been a treat to watch when Atapattu was in full cry, mostly in Tests with high-elbow cover-drive being his signature shot.
Atapattu has scored six double-hundreds in his Test career, a feat bettered only by Don Bradman (12), Kumar Sangakkara (11), Brian Lara (9), Mahela Jayawardene and Wally Hammond (7 each). Virendra Sehwag, Javed Miandad, Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar too have scored six double centuries each but had played more Tests than Atapattu.

Cabinet approval to establish  Office of Missing Persons

The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved the establishment of an Office for Missing Persons. The Office will help several thousands families of missing persons across Sri Lanka to discover the fate of their loved ones, and the circumstances under which they went missing. The need to set up such an office is particularly acute as Sri Lanka has one of the largest caseloads of missing persons in the entire world - the result of uprisings in the South and the war lasting nearly three decades. This Office is the first of the four mechanisms dealing with conflict-related grievances that the new Government pledged to establish and legislation will soon be presented to parliament to make that commitment a reality.
Sri Lanka has a long history of recognizing and assisting missing persons through ad-hoc structures. Law enforcement mechanisms have traditionally held responsibility for searching for missing persons.
However, the Southern uprisings and civil war, created the need for new commissions to deal with this issue. The 1995 Zonal Commissions, established by former President Kumaratunga, and a subsequent follow-up commission, investigated cases beginning in 1987. More recently, the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) noted that the GoSL is duty bound to ensure that allegations of missing persons are properly investigated.
The LLRC asserts that relatives of missing persons have the right to know the whereabouts and the truth about what happened to their loved ones. This allows them the possibility of closure and also enables them to seek appropriate legal remedies. However despite these commissions, some formed in the aftermath of the LLRC recommendations, and which have collected over 20,000 complaints, the vast majority of cases still remain unresolved.
By contrast, this permanent Office will ensure that measures are taken and recommendations made so that Sri Lankans no longer have to fear being disappearance. The new office has been established to systematically address the issue of missing persons after a rigorous review of best practices both in Sri Lanka and across the world  including Uganda, Bolivia, Argentina, and Uruguay which have all had missing persons offices.
Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Ghana and South Africa, which also had commissions that dealt with the issue of missing persons, were also studied.
The OMP will be composed of commissioners and officers of the highest moral integrity, constituted at the highest level by the President, on recommendation of the Constitutional Council. It will have a victim and witness protection unit and will also provide victims access to administrative, legal and psychosocial support, when victims may require it. This Office will not duplicate the work of other Commissions. It will absorb previous records in to a centralized system, aiming to complete
outstanding investigations and finally provide families with the answers that they have long sought. The OMP will work in tandem with the other post-conflict mechanisms, and along with the implementation of the convention on enforced disappearances, will prevent the re-emergence of the
white van culture contributing to the safety and security of all Sri Lankans.

Kusal Mendis one bright spark in the English cold

LEEDS: One of the few positives to emerge from the current tour of England by the Sri Lanka cricket team is the batting of Kusal Mendis at the vital number three position.
It is a key spot in the batting order and it has been occupied by batsmen in the caliber of Roy Dias, Ranjan Madugalle, Asanka Gurusinha, Roshan Mahanama, Russell Arnold and the greatest of them all Kumar Sangakkara.
Since Sangakkaras exit from international cricket last year Sri Lanka has been struggling to find a suitable replacement to fill in that big void. Upul Tharanga was tried out in that position, Dimuth Karunaratne was experimented with, failing which they gave it to Lahiru Thirimanne and then to Udara Jayasundera.
Now that pivotal position in the batting order has been given to Mendis who has so far responded with great promise. Making his Test debut against West Indies in October last year Mendis scored 13 and 39 at the P Sara Oval. On the current tour to he has been given that position and he has answered with three half-centuries  two in the side games against Essex and Leicestershire and in the first Test against England at Leeds which incidentally happened to be his maiden Test half-century.
I had a great start on this tour, and that puts me in a good position to play the games coming up, said Mendis. Everyone said it was a good innings, but they also gave me some advice on the weaknesses  especially about foot movement. Were very disappointed as a side at how the match turned out, but were hopeful of doing better.
Mendis was one batsman who was prepared to take the fight to the English bowlers who reigned supreme in helpful conditions.
Barely 21, Mendis represents an exciting talent that has emerged from the schools which is very rare these days. A product of Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, Mendis won the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2013 before going onto lead his country in the Under 19 Cricket World Cup the following year.
He made his first-class debut for Bloomfield in the Premier League in 2015, but although he was in the national selectors radar for some time it was not until he made a tour of Hyderabad in September for the Moin-ud-Dowla trophy that paved the way for his entry into the national team. With scores of 156, 52 and 47 he came into contention for a place in the home series against West Indies and now he has been given a further extension in the ongoing series against England to cement his place in the number three slot.
Mendis himself knows that there is a wide gap to bridge between playing first-class cricket in Sri Lanka and Test matches.
Its a big difference. Ive only really played club cricket before this. I havent played in the A team. I was in some development sides. Its a big challenge to score runs, said Mendis. But Im glad I am able to be here. I did well with the development team in India last year, so that gives me a little confidence.
Playing in England is not all new to this exciting right-hander. I played for a club called Southgate in the Middlesex league. I got a lot of good experience from that, partly because I was on my own, said Mendis.
I learned a lot about how to adjust to conditions and how to deal with that initial disappointment of not knowing them very well and also about how to play when its cold. I had to do that alone, and got a lot of useful experience from that, he said.
But being with the national team Mendis is not all alone, he has plenty of support coming his way.
Everyone helps me  the captain, the vice-captain, the coach  everyone. Im the youngest, but no one treats me differently. Whether Im doing well or had a bad game I feel that support, said Mendis.
No one has tried to change my technique much. Theyve just asked me to play as I was. Mentally there were a few changes. The advice was mainly about mentally adjusting. They told me about being patient at this level, because its five-day cricket. That was something they stressed.
Theyve also told me about how to respond when bowlers talked to me. If we go to argue with them, we lose our concentration. Its important to focus on the game, he said.
The current tour of England is proving to be a learning curve for young Mendis who is keen to secure a permanent place in the team.
Ive played in the number three position before  for club and development teams. Its a big responsibility. Ive been thinking about what is possible for me and what needs to be done there, said Mendis.
I have to contribute runs to stay in that position and the team. I try to bat the same way every day, with allowances for the pitch. Some wickets you can score quickly and others you cant.
Theres no doubt the Mendis is a strong legside player and the opposition will be keenly noting it. To be able to overcome that and score runs is the key to a good player and Mendis has all the ingredients to succeed.

Saunders SC enters semis  beating Blue Star 1-0

Saunders SC booked a semi-final berth in the Cargills FA Cup 2016 by defeating Blue Star SC 1 to nil in the quarter final match played yesterday at the Race Course grounds. The match started around 35 minutes late due to heavy rains.
Both teams fought hard from the beginning to open the scoring, but non of them were able to sound the board throughout the first half as the score remained nil all. Saunders players displayed a better performance but were unfortunate to miss several scoring chances in the first half due to poor teamwork.
Blue Star players came up with an aggressive playing style, where two of their players were issued yellow cards in the third and 60th minutes.
Though they had a good defence, Saunders displayed a much better attack throughout the game. Saunders strengthened their attack with a much organized teamwork in the second half and recorded the winning goal through their foreign player C.B. Abdul Mohamed (Ghana) in the 68th minute.
Saunders SC will take on Renown SC while the Army SC and Colombo FC will clash in semi finals, next Saturday (28) at the same venue from 3.00 pm onwards.

Kohli declares  De Villiers the  best in world

Bangalore, Wednesday: Virat Kohli has declared AB de Villiers the best batsman in the world after the South African single-handedly steered his Indian Premier League side into this season's cricket final.
Captain Kohli, whose rare batting failure on Tuesday put Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in a tight spot in their 159-run chase, saw De Villiers turn things around with his unbeaten 79-run blitz in Qualifier 1.
RCB were in a precarious position at 68 for six before De Villiers stitched an unbeaten 91-run seventh wicket stand with Iqbal Abdulla to stun table-toppers Gujarat Lions.
"Unbelievable, can't believe I'm the winning captain," Kohli, who leads the run chart with a record 919 in 15 games this season, said after the match.
"That should end a lot of debates as to who is the best going around. No question about it," added Kohli, who has been dubbed the new king of cricket by Indian media.
RCB faced a hostile spell of bowling from Gujarat medium-pacer Dhawal Kulkarni (4-14) to lose their openers early in Kohli and Chris Gayle (9) in front of a raucous home crowd.
De Villiers, who has been involved in an all-time record breaking 229-run stand with Kohli in this edition, then rose to the occasion to smash five fours and as many sixes in 47 balls to snatch victory.

PARLIAMENT

Petition filed by former MP against Speaker's ruling:
Contrary to Constitution and breach of Parliamentary privileges - PM
The petition filed by former Parliamentarian Sarath Weerasekara before Court against a ruling by the Speaker on the resolution moved in Parliament on the National Government, was contrary to the Constitution and also a breach of Parliamentary privileges, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament raising a privilege issue and seeking for a ruling of the Speaker on the issue on a future sitting day as yesterday was fixed for discussions on the adverse weather conditions and its effect on the people.
The Premier further said the petition had been filed and notice served on him contrary to the Constitution by Rear Admiral Dr Sarath Weerasekara and Professor Wimaladharma Abeywickrama against himself and few other parliamentarians.
On September 03, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya made a ruling on the resolution on the national government and what the parties needed for the resolution, the Premier said. In accordance with it, I presented the resolution and the same was carried by Parliament.
He further said that it was final and the Speaker's decision could not be challenged. He added that it was part of the powers of the House.
But I have been noticed to appear in Court or my counsel to answer to something that I had done under rulings given by the Speaker and very importantly, the petitioner had said that he was the only MP who voted against the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Premier said. He challenged the whole resolution as to how a national government should be made. He did not mention that the resolution had been passed.
The premier further stated that the petitioner had said the purported determination passed by Parliament was no force or effect in law.
All these amounts to challenging the rulings given by you in the House by exercising our powers under Article 4 and 4(c), the Premier said. When you challenge the decision of the House, you are in breach of privilege. It is done willfully, as the petition does not disclose the decision given by the Speaker.
The Premier also said the petitioner was aware of having being a member of Parliament.
It does not disclose the powers of Parliament that judicial powers are vested on us through us, the Premier said. Even if you go on a Fundamental Rights procedure, you have to disclose the powers of Parliament and this is mala fide done wilfully.
He promised to go into this matter and give a ruling on this breach of privilege by Sarath Weeasekara and Professor Wimaladharma Abeywickrama.
People should join hands to face disasters
People should join hands to face the adverse consequences of natural disasters as it seriously lacks the necessary resources, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by the Government on relief measures and damages caused by floods and landslides.
Weaker sections of society have suffered the most from this calamity. We have a responsibility to look after them. I urge the Government to make its best efforts and do everything possible to mitigate the sufferings of the people. Affluent sections of society must be called upon in some way to help the weaker sections who have been affected, he said.
The Opposition Leader also pointed out the need to have better disaster preparedness in the country, especially in disaster prone areas.
EP CM must apologize to Naval officer - Wimal
NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday called on EP CM to make a public apology to the Naval officer he reprimanded, addressing a Joint Opposition media briefing at the Parliamentary complex.
Chief Minister Nazeer Ahmed behaved in a disgraceful manner. Not only did he scold Captain Ranjith Premaratne of the Sampur Camp, but he did that in the presence of US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Athul Keshap. We demand that he make a public apology, he said.
MP Weerawansa also queried what action the Government would take in this regard if the Chief Minister did not make an apology. The incident took place during a prize-giving at the Trincomalee - Sampur Maha Vidyalaya.
The Chief Minister had not been invited for the event. He had gate-crashed. Thereafter he talks of protocols and demands his due place, MP Weerawansa said.
Meanwhile addressing the same press conference, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma dubbed the proposal of the Government to give official vehicles to MPs as a bribe to bait Opposition MPs for the Government.

New laws to deal with disaster management
New laws would be formulated to deal with disaster management, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday. He also said that there are flaws in the existing process of dealing with disastrous situations in the country.
He made these observations yesterday joining discussions on the adjournment motion moved by UNP Parliamentarian S M Marikkar on the adverse weather situation and suggesting that the relief granted by the government should continue. The Premier further stated that he had discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena last Monday concerning a process to provide relief to the affected people in disasters that would take place in high risk areas and others places in future.
The PM also thanked the employees of the public service who rendered a commendable service during this disastrous situation. He thanked the Tri-Forces, the Police, religious dignitaries, foreign institutions and foreigners, volunteer groups and others who volunteered to help the people.

Fifty schools in Kandy in landslide prone areas
Fifty schools within the Kandy Districts are located in landslide prone areas as alerted by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), Water Supply and Urban Affairs Minister Rauf Hakeem said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by the Government on relief measures and damages caused by floods and landslides. The NBRO had repeatedly warned of threats of landslides in areas where landslides occurred over the past few days. It has drawing the attention of the government on the need to evacuate and resettle these people. In Kandy district alone, there are over 50 schools for which the NBRO had alerted on the possibility of landslides. It had warned the use of several buildings of these schools. I urge the Disaster Management Minister and Education Minister to pay attention to these schools and provide them with required building facilities in safer areas. In addition to Kandy, Ratnapura and Kegalle too have many schools that face similar dangers, he said.

Wimal accuses monk, officers of removing Buddha statue
NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday accused that a Buddhist monk and certain officers at the Prime Ministers Office had allegedly taken away a seated bronze Buddha statue by force from the National Museum and had damaged it, addressing a Joint Opposition press conference at the Parliamentary Complex. He said the government should take action against those who are responsible for the robbery of this ancient Buddha statue belonging to the Anuradhapura era.
The loss from this alleged irresponsible act is heavy. These antiques at the Museum are not play items. They belong to the future generation of this country. This is clearly a crime. The Director had put on record that the statue had been taken away while she opposed it and would not accept it again nor be responsible to what happens to it. Is this the good governance that the Government preaches he asked.

A conservation plan for the central hills is an urgent need, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by UNP MP S M Marikkar on relief measures and damages caused by floods and landslides.
The MP said the destruction of forest cover in the central hills has resulted in the rising of water levels in rivers, adding that mountainous areas from Knuckles to Rakwana, have faced serious destruction over the recent past. He pointed out that tea and cardamom cultivations have been spreading into forest lands nearby the Knuckles Range and the Sinharaja forest. Horton Plains and Sri Pada are also facing the same situation. Hotels in these areas should be removed, he said.
He said as of environmental regulations, every river with a width of over 50 metres should have a 60 meter buffer zone. However, he pointed out that the eco-system of the Kelani River had been destroyed.
Lack of warning system reason for carnage
If there had been an effective warning mechanism, the loss of lives and damages to vehicles could have been lessened to a great extent, former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by the Government on relief measures and damages caused by the floods and landslides.
However, he said the responsibility of politicians at this moment is not to criticize, but to do whatever possible to help the affected people. We should shed party politics at this moment and think how we could help the people. I urge the Government to keep faith on government officials.
The government should encourage them to come forward and take necessary steps. I say this, because I have noticed that some officials hesitate to take urgent decisions. In the recent past, we faced a massive flood disaster in 1958, a massive cyclone in 1977 and a Tsunami catastrophe in 2004. Those who have experience on such catastrophes are still in public service and the tri-forces. They have the strength to face such situations, he said.
