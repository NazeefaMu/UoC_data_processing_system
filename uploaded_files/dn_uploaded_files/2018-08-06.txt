Amazing maze
Guinness World Records announced a hedge maze covering 383,160.12 square feet in China has been awarded three world records.
The Yancheng Dafeng Dream Maze in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, was awarded records for largest maze, largest hedge maze and largest pathway network in a hedge maze, all in the permanent category, Guinness said.
The maze, which from the air creates the image of a giant elk walking through a field, opened to the public at the end of 2017.

Apple is first public company worth $1 trillion
Apple has become the worlds first public company to be worth $1 trillion (767bn).
The iPhone makers market value reached the figure in New York on Thursday and its shares closed at a new record high of $207.39.
The stock has been rising since Tuesday when it reported better than expected results for the three months to June.
Apple beat Silicon Valley rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft to become the first to hit the $1 trillion valuation.
Since the iPhone first went on sale in 2007, Apple shares have soared by 1,100% and have jumped almost a third in the past year.
The rise is even more astonishing - 50,000% - since the company first listed in 1980. That dwarfs the 2,000% increase for the S&P 500 index over the same period.
Apple traces its origins to the garage of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1976 and was initially best known for its Mac personal computers before its smartphone paved the way for the app economy.
Jobs, who died in 2011 and was succeeded as chief executive by Tim Cook, oversaw the development of the iPhone, which transformed Apples fortunes. In 2006 the company had sales of less than $20bn and posted profits of almost $2bn.
Last year its sales hit $229bn, with profits of $48.4bn, making it the most profitable listed US company.
PetroChina was briefly worth about $1.1 trillion after floating in Shanghai in 2007, although most of its shares were held by the Chinese government. It is now worth about $220bn. Despite its $1 trillion price tag, many analysts still do not view Apples shares as expensive given that they trade at about 15 times expected profits, compared with a figure of 82 for Amazon and 25 times for Microsoft.

We meet and we partIn this journey through sansaraBut the meeting or parting does not end with time or yearsIt is a long stretch of an eventful roadWhere milestones matter more than rises or fallsWe have travelled together on this hard, endless roadWhere milestones matter more than rises or fallsThe journey was neither smooth nor full of magical moments aloneBut many achievements reached more worth than monuments in goldLeaving a fragrance that would linger on and unfoldGifting a memory of a life rich and rareNow you are gone as you wished on a fateful mornWhile family, friends and students remember and mournA warm tear drops that none would see or feelAs I ponder about you, while my memory unfolds your sight.

Army opens IT institute in Trincomalee
The Armys newest Ranaviru Information Technology Training Institute (RITTI), established at the Army Logistic School (ALS) in Trincomalee was vested with the spouses and children of retired and serving Army personnel, brothers and sisters of unmarried Army personnel and underprivileged students, on Friday.
The sixth RITTI, as in other five RITTIs in Panagoda, Anuradhapura, Kokavil, Kuruwita and Kandy, will conduct computer courses for students above 10 years of age. However, the Certificate in Applied Information Technology is only for Army personnel. Expressing his intention to open Army RITTIs shortly in Mullaittivu, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Ampara and other remote areas where such facilities are a luxury, Army Commander Lieutenant General Senanayake said that sharing of IT knowledge between Army personnel and school students would further cement the existing bonds of goodwill, reconciliation and ethnic harmony in this multiethnic district.
He also told the gathering that this Army-provided facility would help find the most talented IT students who would qualify for advanced courses.
The courses in the Army RITTIs have received recognition by the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) which in turn enables Army personnel to receive a professional NAITA competence certificate after sitting the examinations.

Asiri Centrals BMT Unit   celebrates fourth anniversary
Sri Lankas first-ever dedicated Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Unit at Asiri Central Hospital recently celebrated its fourth year anniversary bringing fresh hope to the lives of many patients, especially children.
Over the last four years, 32 patients, with Thalassemia and various other blood related disorders have undergone bone marrow transplants at the BMT unit and it has treated patients aged from one and a half years to those in their late eighties.
Established in 2014, it is known as the first BMT centre in the country to be accredited by the Joint Commission International for patient safety and quality of care.
Speaking at a press briefing held in Colombo to celebrate four years of success stories from BMT unit, Dr. Lallindra Gooneratne, Consultant Haematologist, at Asiris BMT unit said new cases of Thalassemia, Blood cancers such as Leukaemia and other blood related diseases are on the rise in Sri Lanka.
However, a bone marrow transplant can mean the difference between life and death for people with blood cancers and related disorders, especially children.
Our unit was the first in the country to begin bone marrow transplantation. Using state-of-the art technology and facilities we were able to successfully treat patients with even very complex conditions. One of our very first young patients was completely cured and successfully completed her Ordinary Level examination recently. Dr. Gooneratne noted.
It was also revealed at the press conference that over 2,000 Sri Lankans suffer from Thalassemia and every year over 60 children are born with Thalassemia disease in Sri Lanka.
Furthermore, North West, North Central and Central and Uva provinces have been known to be the most severe Thalassemia-affected regions in Sri Lanka.
The Asiri Bone Marrow transplant unit is the first and only unit in the country to join the Asia Pacific Blood and Marrow transplantation group.
The Asiri BMT unit is registered with the international donor registry. This affiliation also enables its patients to be notified when a donor becomes available, anywhere in the world.
While Bone Marrow transplants require a matching donor, Asiri Hospital assures patients of finding matching donors via overseas registries. To this end, Asiri Hospital works in collaboration with Indias Datri Registry and other registries in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and Germany to find out possible donors for patients.
Dr. Panduka Karunanayake Consultant Physician speaking at the event described BMT unit at the hospital as a successful private sector led initiative. He said further that the BMT is a complicated and costly operation which also needs careful consideration.

In terms of volume Dialog & Nations Trust led foreign purchases while Distilleries & Commercial Bank led foreign sales.
In terms of value Nations Trust & Dialog led foreign purchases while Hemas Holdings & Commercial Bank led foreign sales.
Point of view 
Equity markets remained largely flat this week, moving within a narrow 20-point range, to close approximately 10 points lower than last week.
Weaker earnings - particularly from blue-chip conglomerate JKH which is perceived as a proxy for the overall economic health of equity markets/corporates - dampened investor sentiment, dragging the Index 25 points lower early in the week following the release of its earnings.
The Index heavy-weight wiped off ~2.82% of its value over the week to close at Rs.138 amid the 23% Y-o-Y decline in its profits for the quarter, dragging the Index lower.
The Index managed to regain some traction mid-week however, as the decline in the key blue-chips share price along with expectations for the CBSL to hold monetary policy rates steady helped revive some buying interest.
The ASPI consequently gained a cumulative 33 points over the week, helping pare down the 43 point loss and helping the Index recover from its lowest close in 3-weeks.
Despite the revived buying interest mid-week, local HNI and institutional interest remained weak, accounting for just 13% of the weeks total turnover to remain the lowest participation level so far this year.
Local HNI and institutional participation levels this year have averaged 40% (in line with the historical range of 35-45%) but this weeks levels remains a low for the year.
HNI and institutional buying interest remained concentrated on just four stocks, with mid-caps RIL and NTB accounting for 66% of the weeks crossings and blue-chips JKH and NEST accounting for the remainder.
Foreign investors meanwhile, reverted to net sellers from the Colombo bourse this week, reversing last weeks net buying position of Rs. 23Mn to a net selling position of Rs. 82Mn this week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue looking for cues from the June quarter corporate earnings releases.
Policy rates held steady for third time 
The CBSL held policy rates steady (SDFR-7.25% & SLFR-8.50%) for the third consecutive time this year, citing its goal of stabilising inflation at mid-single digits to aid a high and sustainable growth trajectory for the economy.
The Monetary authority added that recent trends in monetary and credit expansion indicate greater monetary stability that is consistent with the countrys envisaged medium term growth and highlighted that i) short-term interest rates have begun to adjust downwards in response to the surplus liquidity conditions in domestic money markets and, ii) overall monetary expansion decelerated in June 2018 as private sector credit growth has gradually declined towards desired levels and net credit to the government has reduced.
The CBSL also noted that despite the recent uptick (Y-o-Y headline inflation remained at low-single digits during Feb-June 2018 but accelerated in July 2018), inflation is expected to remain at mid-single digits by year-end amid the onset of the harvest by end-Q318 and well-contained aggregate demand pressures.
The CBSL also reiterated its expectation (supported by leading indicators) for a gradual pickup in GDP growth from Q218 led by expansion in services and industry related activities and supported by improved weather conditions favorably impacting agriculture activities and related industries.
The Bank cautioned however, that although global economic growth is likely to strengthen over 2018 and 2019, risks remain balanced to the downside due to monetary policy tightening in advanced economies, strengthening of the USD, escalating trade tensions and pressure on many emerging market currencies which has led to some of these EM responding to these risks by tightening their monetary policies and allowing their exchange rates to adjust appropriately.

Bangladesh level T20 series with 12-run win over Windies
LAUDERHILL, United States, Sunday - A fine all-round performance by Shakib al Hasan lifted Bangladesh to a series-levelling 12-run win over the West Indies in the second fixture of a three-match T20 International series at the Central Broward Stadium in Florida on Saturday.
Shakib belted 60 and senior opener Tamim Iqbal topscored with 74 as the Bangladeshis posted a challenging 171 for five after they were put in to bat.
Needing victory to keep the series alive ahead of the final match at the same venue on Sunday, the captain then claimed the important wickets of Marlon Samuels and opposing skipper Carlos Brathwaite as the Caribbean side were restricted to 159 for nine in reply.
Mustafizur Rahman took three expensive wickets but it was left to spinner Nazmul Islam to bowl the critical final over of the match with the West Indies needing 15 runs for victory. Just two runs were conceded as Bangladesh kept the series alive and also ended a five-match losing streak in the format going back to the final of the tri-nation series against India in Colombo last March.
We had a good team talk after that first loss and we came out for this match with a really determined effort, Shakib said. It was a good team effort overall and I expect us to continue with this sort of performance in the deciding match. Bangladesh were indebted to their two most experienced players in posting a competitive total with Tamim blazing 74 off 44 balls with four sixes and six fours while captain Shakib contributed 60 off 38 deliveries with one six and nine fours before he fell in the final over of the innings.
Spinner Ashley Nurse claimed two early wickets again and when all-rounder Keemo Paul removed Soumya Sarkar cheaply at 48 for three in the eighth over, Bangladesh were in desperate need of a substantial partnership. Tamim, who earned the Man of the Match award, and Shakib provided just that with a rollicking stand of 90 for the fourth wicket off just 8.2 overs. I decided to be patient at the start and then accelerate later on, said Tamim. Shakib really played an important hand in support and his contribution was crucial.
WEST INDIES TOO CASUAL
Despite innings of 43 from both opener Andre Fletcher and all-rounder Rovman Powell, the West Indies stuttered continuously in pursuit of the target and never seemed in control of the required rate, even with so many celebrated big-hitters in their line-up.
I felt we were just too casual in the field and didn't put it together with the bat as we usually would, Braithwaite said. We just didnt seem to have the same intensity in the last match. We really shouldnt have been chasing as much as we had to tonight. West Indies again experimented with Andre Russell at number three in the order but he fell cheaply this time around after being the match-winner in St Kitts. When Marlon Samuels fell shortly after to an excellent boundary catch by Liton Das off Shakib, Bangladesh held the initiative and never released their hold despite occasional flutters in the latter stages of the West Indies innings.

A bigger belly increases risk of dementia
People who have bigger bellies may be more likely to get dementia as they age, according to a new study.
A higher waist to hip ratio, which scientists use to measure obesity, leads to people performing worse on thinking tests and raises their risk of brain decline. Scientists think this is because high levels of fat release more inflammatory chemicals into the blood which damages brain health.
Researchers from Trinity College Dublin studied data from more than 5,000 people in what is thought to be one of the largest ever studies of its kind. They say the findings may point to the importance of cutting obesity rates to help tackle dementia, which is expected to affect 42.3 million people around the world by 2020.
And this could be worsened by a global obesity crisis  a quarter of UK adults are obese, as well as 40 per cent of adults in the US and 28 per cent of Australians. The researchers used data collected from thousands of people aged over 60 in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The data revealed the link between people's waist to hip ratio and their scores on tests of cognitive function, which analyse how well somebody's brain works. People with a higher waist to hip ratio  those who have fatter stomachs  performed worse in the thinking tests, the study found.
The scientists suggest this is because fat cells trigger inflammation in the brain, stopping it from working as well. Professor Conal Cunningham, the senior author of the study said: 'While we have known for some time that obesity is associated with negative health consequences our study adds to emerging evidence suggesting that obesity and where we deposit our excess weight could influence our brain health.
Professor Cunningham's findings add to past research which has shown overweight people do not perform as well in tests of memory and spatial awareness as people who are a normal weight. This suggests their brains are affected by inflammation caused by their obesity early in their lives, and are more likely to suffer dementia as they grow older. -dailymail

* Obesity now affects millions of people worldwide who are so fat their health is seriously affected and they rack up billions of pounds in health care bills.
* Around 40 per cent of American adults are obese, as well as a quarter of people in the UK and about 28 per cent of Australians.
* Children are also getting fatter, with damning figures in May revealing 22,000 British 11-year-olds leave school dangerously overweight.
* The availability of unhealthy food such as fast food and sugary drinks, as well as a sedentary lifestyle in which people do not do enough exercise, have been blamed for the growing problem.
* Obesity increases the risk of people getting lifelong condition Type 2 diabetes as well as a number of life-threatening diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure.
* In order to treat obesity the NHS recommends eating a balanced diet and limiting the number of calories people eat, as well as exercising regularly.

CB maintains policy interest rates at current levels
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its meeting held on August 2, 2018, decided to maintain policy interest rates at their current levels.
Accordingly, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank will remain at 7.25 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively. The Boards decision is consistent with its aim of stabilising inflation at mid-single digit levels in the medium term, thereby contributing to a high and sustainable growth trajectory of the Sri Lankan economy. In arriving at its decision, the Board carefully considered the current and expected domestic and global economic developments.
The latest update to the World Economic Outlook (WEO, July 2018) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed the strengthening of the global economy in 2018 and 2019 despite less synchronised expansion across economies. The balance of risks is biased to the downside amidst monetary policy tightening in the United States and other major economies, strengthening of the US dollar, pressures on currencies of many emerging market economies and escalating trade tensions. Some emerging market economies have responded to these risks by tightening their monetary policies and allowing their exchange rates to adjust appropriately.
As per the developments observed in leading indicators and current projections, Sri Lankas real economic growth is expected to record a gradual acceleration from the second quarter of the year. Improved weather conditions are expected to favourably impact agriculture activities and related industries in the second half of 2018 and support the overall growth momentum, which is expected to be led by the expansion in services and industry related activities. The economy is projected to reach its potential over the medium term benefiting from a competitive flexible exchange rate, a low inflation environment and a stronger policy framework to support exports and investment, amidst continued fiscal consolidation.
Year-on-year headline inflation, which remained in low-single digits during the period February-June 2018, accelerated in July 2018 as expected. This was mainly due to the recent transitory price pressures stemming from upward adjustments to domestic petroleum prices and higher volatile food prices, as well as the base effect.
Although inflation is projected to remain at the higher end of the inflation target of 4  6 per cent in August as well, the onset of the harvest towards the end of the third quarter of 2018 is expected to lower inflation thereafter. Stable underlying inflation, together with firmly anchored inflation and expectation indicates well contained aggregate demand pressures, and supports the projection of mid-single digit inflation in the medium term.
Responding to prevailing surplus liquidity conditions in the domestic money market, short term interest rates have begun to adjust downwards. Yields on government securities in both primary and secondary markets have also declined recently. In line with these developments, it is expected that other market interest rates, particularly interest rates on lending would adjust downwards in the period ahead, thereby reducing high real interest rates faced by borrowers at present.
The growth of credit extended to the private sector by commercial banks continued its gradual decline towards the desired levels. Along with the deceleration in private sector credit growth and a reduction in credit extended to the government by the banking sector on a net basis, the overall monetary expansion also decelerated in June 2018. These trends in monetary and credit expansion indicate greater monetary stability, consistent with the envisaged medium term growth path of the economy.
Based on current and expected macroeconomic developments, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank was of the view that the continuation of the current monetary stance is appropriate. Accordingly, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels.
Gross official reserves reach US$ 8.4 bn by end July
Despite an outflow from the secondary market, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) attracted net inflows as a result of primary market transactions.
Although some pressure on the exchange rate was observed since late April 2018 mainly reflecting the impact of the US dollars broad-based strengthening in global markets, the depreciation pressure has eased to some extent from late July 2018. Reflecting these developments, the exchange rate has depreciated against the US dollar by 4.2 per cent so far during the year.
The Central Bank has absorbed US dollars 133.9 million, on a net basis, from the domestic market by end July 2018. The gross official reserve position was estimated at US dollars 8.4 billion at end July 2018 compared to US dollars 8.0 billion recorded at end 2017.
The growth of export earnings outpaced the growth of import expenditure in May 2018, thereby containing the trade gap to some extent. Supporting the current account, earnings from tourism and workers remittances continued to increase so far during the year. The recently introduced measures to address the excessive growth of import of gold and motor vehicles are expected to reduce the pressure on the balance of payments stemming from trade account dynamics.
Meanwhile, as observed in other emerging market economies, some outflows of foreign investment from the rupee denominated government securities market were experienced recently.

Galle grandeur nothing new
This is with reference to your news item about shifting of the Galle stadium.
The tsunami did not affect the stadium much as it was buffered by the ramparts of the fort. The esplanade existed during the British times. It was then racing grounds, and not many people today will know that there was an oval-shaped governors pavilion which existed till the forties. The racing ground was shifted to Boossa and the esplanade functioned as a sporting ground, it is the only ground for the entire town. Cricket, football, athletics and even parades were held there. All schools used it for sporting activities. International cricket matches were played even then.
Coming from Colombo by road and passing the railway station, one is taken up by the green expanse of the ground and the ramparts.
The esplanade existed even before the UNESCO came into being and I do not think that we should bend backwards to appease them.
Let them take it off the world heritage list but we will have the grounds as we had it all this time.
I have a hunch that since we are following the Singapore example, it will not be wrong before high rise buildings come upon the ground, once it is removed another place and changed the old world completion of the town completely.

CMTA wants dialogue to ensure growth  of motor industry
The Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA), one of the most senior automotive trade associations in the region established in 1920, issuing a communiqu calls for a dialogue with the government on establishing medium to long term policies that would result in the sustainable growth of the motor industry.
The CMTA represents all major international motor manufacturers in Sri Lanka. CMTA says that they fully understand the current state of Sri Lankas economy which has been marked by the poor performance of its external balances. The association also understands that the government and the economy is unable to sustain a significant outflow of foreign exchange.
We concede that the imports of motor vehicles, which have more than doubled from January to June 2018 versus the same period for 2017, is a contributory factor towards this. This situation has added a further strain on the nations current account which is already seeing an expanding fuel import bill given the rising global oil prices.
Concurrently, the Government needs to maximize its collection of revenue from the import of motor vehicles. The CMTA understands that Government policy that impacts the automotive industry is
largely governed by their external balances and their need to collect revenue.
The CMTA applauded the Governments policies to encourage the import of hybrid and electric motor vehicles, such as the Carbon Tax introduced in the budget of 2018, and assure the Government that
this strategy will in the long run contribute to a lower fuel import expenditure. The import of fuel is one of the Governments largest import expenditures, and much larger in magnitude than the
expenditure on the import of motor vehicles.
The excise duty structure that was proposed in the budget 2018 had a favorable differential for small motor cars (vehicles under 1000 CC) which is likely to have driven the strong vehicle growth experienced in 2018. For Instance, in 2017 according to the Department of Motor Traffic, approx. 60% of all motor vehicle registrations, for that year, were accounted for by vehicles less than 1000 cc.
Subsequent to the tariff revisions proposed in the budget 2018, small cars accounted for approx. 86% of all motor vehicle registrations during the first two months of 2018. In addition, this growth in the quantum of vehicles is likely to have resulted in a significant rise in the levels of congestion, especially within the cities.
Taking the above factors into account, we understand the governments policy decision taken on the August 1, 2018 to increase excise duties targeting the small motor cars segment.
While the raising of excise duties is likely to stem the growth for small cars, we believe that this needs to be coupled with medium to long term policies that would result in the sustainable growth of the motor industry.
This would also reduce the need to resort to such ad hoc excise duty changes, which leads to the stop-go nature of new vehicle imports that leads to uncertainty and causes a strain on both the consumers and firms in the industry.
The CMTA looks forward to participating in a long term policy dialogue with the Government, so the aspirations of the industry and the international manufacturers they represent could be aligned with the requirements of the Government.

COPE summons Power Ministry, CEB, PUCSL over private purchase agreements
The Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE) has summoned officials from the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) over the private power purchase agreements to procure electricity from private producers.
Sources told the Daily News that the Auditor Generals department was also conducting an audit on the procurement system and would table a report tomorrow.
Meanwhile, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Spokesperson Sulakshana Jayawardena said that the Ministry officials have been summoned to the Committee with a report on power purchases.
The COPE Committee initiated a probe after it was revealed that CEB recorded massive loses compared to 2016 due to power purchase agreements with three Independent Power Producers (IPP).
The CEB claims it had entered into an agreement with Ace Power Embilipitiya on April 5 to obtain power for the next three years. However, the regulator PUCSL called the awarding of the tender illegal and refused to give its approval for the CEB to purchase power from this supplier.
Accordingly obtaining power from this station had been stopped effective from July 16.
The interdiction of CEB Deputy General Manager Sujeewa Abeywickrama was also shrouded in controversy after Abeywickrama alleged that his refusal to pay a private power plant had led to his interdiction.

Country still lacks peace and harmony - Sampanthan
Visiting Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland met Opposition Leader and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) chief R. Sampanthan at the office of the Opposition Leader in Parliament on Friday.
Briefing the Secretary-General, Sampanthan said that even though the war has come to an end, the country still lacks full peace and harmony.
People, particularly the minorities, had a great deal of hope with the change of government. They expected the government to deliver on the promises it made both locally and internationally.
A new Constitution which will alter the structure of governance and give more powers to the regions, ascertainment of truth and justice, reparation, dealing with the issue of missing persons, return of civilians lands occupied by the Armed Forces, and release of people held in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act are some of those promises, but the delivery on these matters has been slow and inadequate, he said.
He said there is a commitment to draft a new Constitution.
A unanimous resolution was adopted in Parliament in this regard. On account of political factors, there is a delay on the part of the government in pursuing this matter.
There were reasons why this country faced a war. One cannot address these reasons by not being firm, one cannot abandon these issues because of extremist elements. The government must take a firm stand and lead the country in the right direction. Adopting a new Constitution will be a big step in taking the country forward, Sampanthan said.
The Secretary-General assured the Opposition Leader on the continuous support provided by the Commonwealth to Sri Lanka to promote democracy, rule of law, good governance and environment issues and said that the Commonwealth will continue to support the new constitution-making process.
Further, the Secretary-General appreciated Sampanthan for his moderation and for being an ambassador for peace.

Curran outshines peers to be unlikely hero of first test
BIRMINGHAM, Saturday - It was billed to be a contest between Englands most prolific wicket-taker James Anderson and Indias top batsman Virat Kohli.
But in the end, an unlikely 20-year-old playing in only his second test match stole the limelight from his more established peers and dragged his team to victory over the worlds top ranked test nation in the first match of a five game series.
Sam Curran grabbed four top Indian wickets in the first innings and gave his team a precious 13-run lead despite a century by Indian skipper Kohli.
Then in the second innings, with England on the ropes at 87 for 7, he strung together two valuable partnerships that saw England put up an overall target of 194 runs for the hosts to win.
Playing with confidence, the left arm swing bowler who plays for county Surrey, first combined with Adil Rashid for 48 runs, which was the biggest of the English innings, and then 41 with fast bowler Stuart Broad for the ninth wicket.
Following Englands victory, Curran was given the man of the match award.
I cant take it all at the moment, Curran, told a post match news conference. It feels like Im dreaming. Im sure Ill sleep well tonight because I didnt get any last night. Curran made his test and one-day international debut for England earlier this year and his swing bowling, especially against the Indian top order, impressed his peers. Sam Curran has a great amount of skill, very exciting and promising cricketer, skipper Joe Root said.  Agencies

Debt and the poor
In October last year the Governor of the Central Bank went on a mission to find solution for indebtedness in the north having seen the scale of the problem and the scale of the suffering experienced by the families distressed in debt with solutions on three levels.
1. How to reduce the debt burden
2. How to structure new credit so that the problem is not repeated
3. Raising awareness and financial literacy among the population to prevent a repetition and prolonging of the situation.
This malaise is not confined to the poor in the global South. Illustrated by efforts of the Church of England.
Church expands network of support on money and debt
Scale of problem debt at epidemic levels, says Archbishop of Canterbury. Achieving economic stability together with economic justice for all is too easily overlooked.
He continues: The scale of problem debt in our country is at epidemic levels. Jesus calls us to be hope-bringers and peace-givers. Where there are still lives filled with an oppressive hopelessness, where darkness has a grip, our mission is not done.
In 2013, the archbishop voiced concerns about energy price hikes and he also said in that year that the Church of England wanted to drive payday lenders out of business through the creation of credit unions.
The Church of England has embarked on an ambitious programme to grow a nationwide network of support for people to help them take action on money and debt. A pilot scheme based in churches in London, Southwark and Liverpool dioceses will be expanded to dioceses in the rest of the country under plans put forward by the Just Finance Network, formerly known as the Church Credit Champions Network.
More than 260 credit champions, or volunteers in local churches have been trained so far within the pilot scheme to help people tackle issues from promoting budgeting skills to work on increasing the size of credit unions. Over 300 churches are already involved in the scheme carrying out mass sign-ups to credit unions, setting up credit union branches in church buildings and encouraging local employers to set up pay roll saving for their staff. The programme is on target to bring in more than 3,000 new credit union members by the end of this year and have saved more than 2 million by helping people access affordable credit rather than high cost pay day lenders.
The proposals for an expansion to the network are the latest stage in work first started by the Archbishop of Canterburys Task Group on responsible credit and savings. The network, now managed by Church Urban Fund, will build on initiatives already under way in churches across the country.
Churches and individuals are being encouraged to take part in fundraising to support the expansion of the network through the Archbishop of Canterburys Mustard Seed Appeal, which is being launched today.
Paul Hackwood, Executive Director of Church Urban Fund, said: More than eight million people in the UK are struggling with debt, with many resorting to high cost loans to cover the cost of basic necessities.
Church of England parishes have shown amazing initiative in tackling this real need through work such as promoting budgeting skills, championing credit unions and supporting community-led finance schemes. The leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the work of the Church of England parishes have been crucial to the success so far of the pilot scheme.
We hope that people will be generous in responding to this appeal to allow us to build further on this vital work.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: Churches across the country have responded enthusiastically and with great generosity to the work of supporting credit unions and other forms of responsible credit and savings.
Achieving economic stability together with economic justice for all is no easy task.
Leaving no one behind: the imperative of inclusive development
A central pledge contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is to ensure that no one will be left behind and to see all goals and targets met for all nations, peoples and for all parts of society, endeavouring to reach the furthest behind first. While 37 per cent of the worlds population lived under the international poverty line of $1.90 a day in 1990, the proportion had declined to 12.7 per cent by 2012.
However, the situation of those living in deep poverty has not improved significantly and many people who have escaped poverty remain vulnerable to it.
Trends in inequality also suggest that prosperity has not been equitably shared, with income inequality having risen within many countries in the last 20 years. In general, income inequality across social groups constitutes a significant share of total income inequality, although its weight varies strongly by country.
****
women, worst affected
Government announced an effort to address an exploitative cycle of debt, in which women were worst affected especially in the war-affected districts of the North and East and drought- affected districts in the North Central and North Western Provinces:
The measures included:
* Extensive relief package for 12 drought affected districts.
* Writing off micro-finance loans taken by women in these regions.
* Offering a state subsidized loan scheme.
Microfinance loans taken by women valued at Rs 100,000 or less will be written off under the relief programme. The Government will pay back these loans, while the micro-finance companies have come to an agreement to waive the high interest attached to these borrowings, Minister Samaraweera noted. Minister Samaraweera said his Ministry had decided to submit a Cabinet proposal to cap micro-finance interest rates at 30% per annum in a bid to prevent these companies from lending to vulnerable communities at predatory interest rates.
The Government would also work to better regulate these micro-finance companies and bring amendments to the Micro-Finance Act in order to prevent the manifestation of similar debt traps and exploitative lending programmes.
****
Timely Measures
Social inclusion is presented as the process of improving the terms of participation in society for people who are disadvantaged on the basis of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, and economic and migration status.
Measures taken by our government are timely. The future requires policies ideally subscribed to by all shades of politics, commerce and others with three sets of indicators:
* Those that measure access to opportunities, namely education, health and other basic services;
* Those that measure access to employment and income; and
* Those that measure participation in political, civic and cultural life.

Detect oral cancers early
Screening for oral cancers is available free of charge at any State Hospital (Dental Clinic) and at Narahenpita Cancer Early Detection Centre (CEDEC). The centre belongs to National Cancer Control programme (NCCP) of Ministry of Health. Situated just close to Narahenpita Junction towards Borella, CEDEC offers many health services free of charge. The centre is open from 8.30 am to 4.00 pm on week days. Telephone - 0113159227.
This week the Consultant in Community Dentistry attached to the National Cancer Control Programme and Prof. Ruwan D. Jayasinghe attached to the Faculty of Dental Science of the University of Peradeniya speak about Oral Cancers, the most common cancer among Sri Lankan males.
Daily six (6) new oral cancer patients detected from Sri Lanka. Oral cancer brings the earliest death when comparing with deaths occurs due to other types of cancers.
According to Dr.Prasanna Jayasekara daily three persons die in Sri Lanka from oral cancers. In 2011 a total number of seven (7) new oral cancer cases reported while this number increased up to eight (8) by 2014. Oral cancer tops among all the other cancers in the country and more men get oral cancers than women. Oral cancers show an alarming increase among Sri Lankan males in 2006 - 2011 period. Around 72 percent of oral cancer patients seek medical treatment when the cancer reached to stage three (3)or four (4) which is very late and need serious, complicated and costly interventions. Every day around six (6) new oral cancer patients are being detected. Their five year survival rate is less than 50 percent. There are 28 cancerous substances in smokeless tobacco while there are four of them in areca-nut, he said.
Prof. Ruwan D Jayasinghe said that it is areca-nut and areca-nut based products and tobacco cause oral cancers. Mouth self examination and oral examination by a dental surgeon can detect oral cancers early. The risk factors for oral cancers are consuming betel quid, use of smokeless tobacco and specifically areca-nut products, smoking and consuming alcohol.
According to Prof. Jayasinghe, conditions such as Leukoplakia, Erythroplakia, Erythroleukoplakia and Oral Sub Mucus Fibrosis can be treated before developing them into oral cancers.
Since there is an alarming increase of Oral Sub Mucus Fibrosis among school children they should be prevented from consuming all products based on areca-nut which is freely available around schools in various names in various forms such as toffees, chewing gums,etc.
Medical experts say that the persons who eat more three betel quids, the persons who eat betel quids once in a while but smoke and drink alcohol and the persons who consume tobacco and areca-nut based products are at high risk of developing oral cancers. Involving in unhealthy sexual behaviours is another factor that contributes towards developing oral cancers.
****
According to the Consultants, smoking sends 72 cancerous substances into the body while chewing tobacco sends 28 cancerous substances into the body. Various types of imported areca-nut based products such as Baabul, Beeda, Panparag, Mawa etc freely available at small boutiques located close to schools have four types of cancerous substances and they cause oral sub mucus fibrosis. The tobacco, areca nut and lime are strongly cancerous and mainly cause oral cancer. They also cause cancers in stomach.
****
Mouth Self Examination is the best way to detect the first signs of possible oral cancer.
A - Washing your hands thoroughly.
B - Remove dentures and similar items.
C - Clean your mouth thoroughly.
D - Go in front of a clear mirror with adequate light.
E - You should look for Red Patches, White Patches, Red and White Mixed Patches and Oral Sub Mucus Fibrosis (pale coloured skin inside mouth with difficulty to open your mouth and pull the tongue out including sourness when eating chilies). The patches cannot be wiped out. The surfaces of the patches are little bit rough. The patches are painless. Those are the signs you should look for.
Now you should follow the eight (8) steps and do Mouth Self Examination.
1 - Pull up upper lip and examine the area thoroughly.
2 - Pull down the lower lip and examine.
3 - Stretch open mouth on the right and examine.
4 - Stretch open mouth on the left and examine.
5 - Stick out tongue fully to the left and then to the right and examine.
6 - Open mouth wide to look at the plate.
7 - Roll up tongue and check the floor of the mouth.
8 - Roll up tongue and check under surface of the tongue.

Dhananjaya de Silva was the only positive for us  Samaraweera
PALLEKELE, Sunday - In another ODI lost to South Africa, the only positive Sri Lanka could draw from it was the batting of Dhananjaya de Silva who scored a spirited 84 off 66 balls at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
De Silva came to bat with his side five down for 124 and facing an enormous task of overhauling South Africas massive score of 363-7, and battled it out to take the total to 273 with a series of fluent strokes that somewhat put to shame the early loss of his team mates.
It was a big target. We didnt bowl well and gave away too many boundary balls. We gave away too many runs towards the end as well. When you are chasing that kind of score we had to be positive. Our top order hit a few good shots and that went to the fielders. Dhananjaya (de Silva) is the only positive for us. South Africa has outplayed us in all three games, said acting head coach and batting coach Thilan Samaraweera at the post-match press conference.
We are all disappointed that we lost 3-0. When we won the toss and decided to field we didnt bowl too well with the new ball. Even the last ten overs we were below par, three overs went for more than 18 or 20 runs. That made it difficult. When you are chasing 360 you have to be positive. But the shots that we executed didnt work out well, he said.
Sri Lanka was dismissed for 285 in 45.2 overs which was their highest total in the series so far.
By inviting South Africa to bat first Samaraweera said that the teams intention was to get two wickets in the first 10 overs. We took one wicket but we ended up serving too many boundary balls early on. They batted well in the last ten overs. We were expecting this to be a good track after 2pm but unfortunately 360 is a huge target.
Despite losing the series Samaraweera described the Lankan team as good and added: When you are chasing that many, the top order has to play shots.
Those shots unfortunately went straight into the hands of fielders. When you are chasing that many you have to take a few risks. I am not too worried with that.
The first game we were disappointing. We are searching for that top three. Someone has to get a big hundred.
AN INCREDIBLE FEELING GETTING TO THAT 100  HENDRICKS
South Africas one drop batsman Reeza Hendricks who made a century on his ODI debut described the moment as an incredible feeling.
Conditions were very good the wicket played so much like back home what we are used to. To score a hundred on debut is something that I never thought of. It is really special and an incredible feeling, more importantly it contributed to the team, said Hendricks who was named man of the match.
Hendricks said that batting with Hashim Amla made his task easy.
Our opening pair got us off to a good start although Quinny (de Kock) didnt face as many balls. Batting with Amla with that calm effect he has being relaxed and comfortable at the crease allowed me to play my game, said Hendricks.
For me its special scoring a hundred on debut, its the start of many more. I was fortunate to get the opportunity today and contribute to the team. Going forward if I get a few more it will be good, he said.
Hendricks replaced Aidan Markram in the side for this game.

Duty on small vehicles will bridge trade deficit - Governor
The increase in duty on motor vehicles less than 1000cc has been necessary in the short run to arrest the deteriorating trade deficit, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy said.
He was speaking to the media at the Central Bank auditorium yesterday.
The Governor said half of the deterioration in the trade account was attributed to vehicle imports.
The deterioration in the trade deficit was about USD 716 million over the first five months of this year. Of the amount, USD 350 million can be attributed to the increase in vehicle imports. From January to May, vehicle imports as a percentage of total imports was 6.9 percent and as a percentage of non-oil imports it was 8.5 percent, he said.
He said the decision on duty hike was made in the interest of everybody, particularly the poor and vulnerable, to make sure that the deterioration in the trade deficit will not add pressure on the exchange rates.
In the short run, this deterioration in the trade deficit had to be addressed because it affects the balance of payments. Then we have to borrow more from abroad. As the balance of payments gets worse, pressure on the exchange rate will increase. That affects the poor and vulnerable more as the cost of living could rise, Dr Coomaraswamy said.
If you lose revenue, you can make up for it by increasing other forms of revenue streams or by cutting down the expenditure, but if you lose control of balance of payments, it is very difficult to handle, he said.
The Governor said Sri Lanka needs to develop its public sector transport. He said various plans including the light rail and highway projects under the Megapolis plan will help to achieve that end.
The Central Bank officials showed the statistics of cumulative value of vehicles imported to the country in the first five months of 2017 and this year. The total value of imports of petrol cars less than 1000 cc had increased from USD 26million in the first half of 2017 to USD 195 million in the first half of this year. The import value of petrol cars less than 1500cc had increased from USD 20 million to USD 73.2 million in the given period where as the import value of petrol cars less than 3000cc had declined from USD 33.5 million to USD 21.1 million.
The value for petrol vehicles over 3000cc had shown an increase from USD 2.6 million to 8.8 million. When it comes to the diesel vehicles less than 2,500cc there had been an increase from USD 1.9 million to USD 5.4 million where as the total value of imports of diesel vehicles more than 3000 cc had declined from UD 6.1million to USD 2.8 million. Therefore, the CB officials recapped that the smaller car imports have much to do with the increase in the import value of motor vehicles, they said.

Iconic Grande Dame, the Galle Face Hotel recently hosted a Power Breakfast event with Irshad The White Tiger Sayed, South African national kickboxing champion, two time Muay Thai world champion and mixed martial arts champion.
Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Irshad left his hometown when he was 17 years old and relocated to Thailand to follow his passion for kickboxing. He is currently based in New Zealand, and signed with EFC Worldwide: Extreme Fighting Championship.
Irshad addressed a gathering of fitness enthusiasts, coaches, nutritionists, and motivational speakers at the event. He spoke about his kickboxing career, the strength and commitment it took him to reach this level of success and how we can apply this learning to our daily lives, whether we are in a fighting cage, or a boardroom.
There are parallels which can be drawn between sporting, business and reaching success. I find that sharing my experiences about following my passion, working hard, overcoming fear and making sacrifices are all relatable to the people I meet from around the world. It brings me joy to have these conversations with people and hopefully motivate them to go after their goals, Irshad Sayed said.
Irshads visit is one of many events the Galle Face Hotel plans to host as it strengthens its position as a unique lifestyle brand that provides a balance of curated modernity amidst its rich culture and heritage. -CC

Gardening can improve your mental health
It reconnects you with nature
The ancient Chinese believed in order to be healthy and prevent illness we needed to sustain our relationship with nature. Nature provides us with the grounding, connection, and satisfaction we need to sustain our thriving, happy selves.
It relieves stress
An almost 20-year-long study found that seniors who garden have a lower risk of dementia than seniors who dont garden. (Lifestyle factors and risk of dementia: Dubbo Study of the elderly Leon A Simons, Judith Simons, John McCallum and Yachiel Friedlander. Med J August 2006.)
This research provided by Life Coach Josh just shows what a huge impact gardening can have on your mental health and how something as simple as spending a few hours in the gardening can actually prolong your life.
In one study, researchers had two groups of people do two relaxing activities: gardening or reading a book. They found that after 30 minutes of gardening, levels of the stress hormone cortisol dropped significantly in those who were working the soil!
It helps people who struggle with movement
Kate Hofmann, from Amigo Mobility who is always looking for accessible activities for people with walking limitations, saysWeve found gardening to be a great lifelong and accessible activity for people who are slowing down due to age or have disabilities.
Many activities become more difficult as people age, but with the help of a raised gardening bed, it can be a way to help people stay active despite mobility limitations.
It opens channels for honest communication with children
Kids naturally love to work with their hands, use gardening tools, dig and get dirty, and harvest delicious food. But gardening also helps to teach children important life lessons, like the importance of maintaining things (watering, weeding, and combating pests). And the lessons taught by experience will penetrate far deeper than mere words.
Gardening also fosters more and better quality communication. Working side by side with children gives you time to bond, removing barriers to open and honest communication. Since the child wont perceive this as a formal interrogation, he/she is more likely to lower his defenses, speak with candor, and accept your input.
It improves social skills
Spending time among people can also improve someones ability to make friends and develop his/hers social skills. Gardening also broadens ones knowledge and helps acquire new skills, which can improve the chances of finding a job.
These are just some of the ways that it can improve your mental health, but overall, just getting out into the garden to enjoy a spot of gardening is beneficial for everyone.

How the West became a self-obsessed culture
America's narcissism was the conclusion of a recent study published in the journal Psychological Science, in which researchers polled just under 3,000 Americans across 50 states and found that many of them have an outsize and inaccurate view of the importance of their states role in US history. They refer to this phenomenon as collective narcissism. An individual narcissist is someone with a deep need for validation, someone who thinks theyre great and resents anyone who doesnt recognize their greatness. Collective narcissists, as my Vox colleague Brian Resnick explained, are a group of people who desperately need their group to be admired and validated by others.
Collective narcissism is a fashionable idea these days in psychology, and its linked to psychologists larger concern about a narcissism epidemic  more and more individuals with an inflated sense of self.
Its tempting to blame self-indulgent tools like social media and smartphones for this so-called epidemic, and many do. But thats not quite right, or at least thats the argument that Will Storr makes in his book Selfie: How We Became So Self-Obsessed and What Its Doing to Us.
Western culture has always been this way, Storr argues, and over time weve built up a culture that conditions us to overstate our role in our own successes and failures.
Storr, a British novelist and journalist, has previously written about human credulity and how the stories we tell ourselves about the world color our beliefs about whats true. A book like Selfie seems like a departure from this, but its not. This, too, is a book about beliefs and their consequences. And its not merely a snapshot of internet culture; its really a survey of the history of individualism in the Western world, and how it contrasts with the more community-minded cultures in the East.
Q: Does the West have a self-obsession problem
A: Thats a great question, and the answer is both yes and no. In the book, I argue that the West is basically an individualist culture, and that causes us all sorts of problems. On the one hand, putting all the focus on the individual as the locus of success can be a good thing because youre saying to people, You can do anything; you can change the world on your own two feet, and thats incredibly motivating.
But this is also a bad thing because we give ourselves too much credit for successes and too much blame for failures. The problem with individualism is that it ignores the fact that were social creatures, that we live and survive and succeed in tribes. We call ourselves failures, we call ourselves losers, and thats the beginning of a descent into a range of dangerous mental health problems. And the truth is that our successes and our failures are the product of so many factors we dont control that its a fantasy to believe that we alone are solely responsible for who and what we are.
"The toxic lie that our culture gives us is that we can be anyone we want, do anything we want, but thats never been true"
Q: Your book is really a history of the idea of individualism in the West, so how did we get this way What is it about our culture and our history that produced this self-obsession epidemic
A: Its a fascinating story that was mapped out in 2003 by a wonderful psychologist named Richard Nisbett. He traced the beginning of Western individualism back to ancient Greece, and he attributed it to the nature of the geography, surprisingly enough.
Greece was full of separate rocky islands dotted with individual city-states. To get ahead, you couldnt be part of a big farming community or something like that; you had to hustle as an individual  fishing or foraging or making olive oil or pottery or whatever.

India will be supported for UNSC permanent seat - Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka will support Indias bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the Indian media reported yesterday.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has made the statement to the Indian media during a personal visit to Indias Andhra Pradesh last Saturday.
India has been pushing diplomatic efforts to expand and reform the UNSC with the adding of permanent and non-permanent members. Lest Indias bid be accepted by the UN Security Council, India will become a regional power at UNSC along with China.
These committees will have regular discussions with relevant government agencies to study several identified issues.
Responding to Daily News, former Secretary to the Foreign Ministry Bernard Goonetilleke said the Prime Minister Wickremesinghes statement is a reiteration of Sri Lankas diplomatic position that has been held for a long period of time supportive of India on becoming a permanent member at the UNSC.
Goonetillake pointed out that the issue of Security Council has been taken up for consideration during the last three decades with no resolution to the matter due to variety of reasons. The reforms of the UNSC incorporates key issues including categories of membership, veto held by the five permanent members, regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council and its working methods and the SC General Assembly relationship. According to Goonetilleke, member states, especially regional groups, in this case, Africa, South America and even Asia have developed different positions with regards to the matter at concern.
UN Security Council has fifteen members including five permanent members, UK, United States, Russia, France and China. India will be able to join the elite club if the bid to become a permanent member of the SC is accepted.

A little foresight can fight stage-fright
If the prospect of getting up in front of a group of people and performing terrifies you, you are not alone. Millions of people suffer performance anxiety, commonly called stage-fright. It is actually the number one fear among most people. And for many it is a terror greater than the fear of death.
Welcome to the world of public performances. Most of us are familiar with encountering pre-performance nerves. Very few can perform publicly without experiencing some sort of nervousness. For many it generates an anxiety that borders on panic almost prompting them to bolt off stage.
Broadly speaking, it is an irrational fear, brought on by our tendency to judge ourselves. Still, in the case of stage fright, it is a self-induced anxiety which does not pose any real threat to our lives. Stage-fright afflicts almost every performer, the experienced and the beginners alike. Athletes, musicians, singers, stage actors, comedians, magicians, and public speakers have often suffered performance anxiety at some stage or another.
Experts call it the flight-or-fight reaction. Most people have the same kind of response the first time they face an audience. We are all conversant with the often crippling symptoms that give us the jitters. These may include heavy breathing, a thumping heart, cold palms, profuse perspiring, knocking knees, butterflies in the stomach and an unfocused mind.
The more serious cases may be accompanied by gut-wrenching manifestations such as nausea and vomiting. Some famous entertainers admit to having stage-fright to the extent of throwing up and confess this has persisted through their entire careers. But somehow they still manage to cope and execute brilliant award-winning performances.
Its nerves, darn it, that causes this type of debilitating dread which may often occur just before the performance. As the shrinks say, anxiety about anxiety is the real problem we are dealing with. Performers when becoming aware they are anxious or nervous, aggravate that anxiety by making themselves anxious about being anxious.
In most cases such negative impulses are triggered by lack of preparation. This is a primary cause of stage fright. If an entertainer is unsure of his or her ability to execute a successful performance, that adds to even more pressure and agitation. The main trick is to concentrate on the positive factors of your abilities. Also it is important is to take the focus away from yourself so you can concentrate completely on the performance itself.
As a professional presenter, I have observed many leading artistes and public speakers gripped by fear and almost paralysed by nervousness before coming on stage. That happens largely when they focus on themselves and their anxiety rather than the performance or presentation at hand. It can also result from the fear of facing the role as a threat, rather than a challenge.
Learning to overcome stage-fright at auditions and appearances is a challenge every performer must face. Perhaps the best method of dealing with fear and stage-fright is to know your act like the back of your palm. Preparation is unquestionably essential for any successful undertaking.
Hardly any roles are ever complete without an adequate amount of homework. The aim is to have all the content structured as early as possible to allow sufficient time to work on your role. Whatever approach you decide on would be acceptable, as long as it flows and rings out as natural. If you know what you are doing, you will be more relaxed and focused and ready to wow your audience.
Understanding the etiquette of performing in public can help one get a clear perspective about ways to respect ones audience and get across the messages you want to share with them clearly and effectively. As you raise your awareness of simple yet efficacious steps you can take to show you care about the act and your audience, you will become more unperturbed and confident of yourself as a refined performer. Stage-fright is normal and healthy. And if you are dealing with this fear in a positive way, you can use it to boost your performance and get better results in the execution of your role. Focus your attention on giving the audience the best presentation possible. You are there to serve them. The more determined professionals deliberately train themselves to shrug off such fears and become so practised at stepping in front of an audience that they can actually enjoy the process and have fun.
Riddled with too much stress before you step on stage will compromise your performance. A little bit of nervous energy is good, and can stimulate your performance but too much will impair it. The fundamental problem for many people is a lack of confidence. Confidence is the answer to overcoming first night nerves and having great stage presence. It is self-belief that will allow you the freedom to storm the stage and enjoy your experience. The more effortless a performance appears, the better it will be.
You just have to develop the ability to make yourself relax and understand that it isnt a big deal even if your performance is less-than-perfect. Developing a coolness on the boards is also going to come from facing your fears and just getting up on stage and performing. And because of that your stage presence will appear natural and be more effective. Having good stage appeal comes as a result from being confident. It starts with getting rid of your stage-fright, and getting yourself comfortable to the point where you enjoy performing. After you have mastered that, you can move on to completing your performance by adding to it some innovative stage gimmicks. But be certain not to go overboard and spoil it.
And always remember to breathe deeply. Clearly, this is the best thing to do when suffering from stage anxiety. Take deep, slow breaths, the kind you take when there is a pleasing scent in the air. Count them, and do at least twenty. Breathing is the first line of defence against fear.
Also remember that the audience is there to have a good time. They don't want you to fail. Those people out there want to enjoy the show, not plot a strategy to see the end of your career as a performer.
If you suffer a case of stage-fright, do not let it overwhelm you. As mentioned earlier it is a common problem. And yes, it is true that everybody gets it. But everybody can get over it as well. It can be overcome with patience, resolve, training and practice. Many great performers in diverse fields began their careers hounded by this very fear but were able to overcome it.
Essentially, learn to be comfortable with yourself and be yourself. That is a sure way of socking it to your audience and knocking their socks off! [emailprotected]

Maduro escapes drone assassination attempt
VENEZUELA: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Saturday he escaped an assassination attempt using an explosive-laden drone, after a live broadcast showed him looking confused when a bang went off during a Caracas military parade and dozens of soldiers scuttling for safety.
His government said seven soldiers were wounded in the incident, blamed on Colombia by Maduro and later claimed by a mysterious rebel group.
It was an attack to kill me, they tried to assassinate me today, Maduro, who was unharmed, said in a later state broadcast, speaking of a flying object (that) exploded in front of me.
Venezuelan state television images showed Maduro looking up disconcertedly in the middle of a speech having heard a bang, before members of the countrys National Guard lined up in the parade suddenly scattered.
Communication Minister Jorge Rodriguez said there was an explosive charge... detonated close to the presidential podium and in several other spots along the parade held in central Caracas.
Attorney General Tarek William Saab told CNN he saw a drone filming the event explode.
No drones could be seen in the television broadcast, which showed bodyguards jumping in front of Maduro to protect him with flexible ballistic shields. The broadcast was quickly cut.
Meanwhile, a policeman who requested anonymity told AFP drones may have been released from a nearby apartment that suffered a fire after one exploded. However, other versions of events attributed the fire to an accidentally exploded gas cylinder. The government pointed the blame at the ultra-right wing -- its term for the opposition.
But Maduro himself said: I have no doubt that the name (Colombian President) Juan Manuel Santos is behind this attack. He added investigations suggested the incidents financiers live in the United States, in the state of Florida. I hope that President Donald Trump is ready to fight these terrorist groups. The Colombian foreign ministry denied involvement, saying the allegations were absurd and lacked any foundations. A senior US State Department official said the White House was monitoring the situation closely.
Meanwhile, late Saturday, a civilian and military rebel group calling itself the National Movement of Soldiers in Shirts claimed responsibility for the explosion.
It is contrary to military honor to keep in government those who not only have forgotten the Constitution, but who have also made public office an obscene way to get rich, the group said in a statement passed to US-based opposition journalist Patricia Poleo, who read it on her YouTube channel.
If the purpose of a government is to achieve the greatest amount of happiness possible, we cannot tolerate that the population is suffering from hunger, that the sick do not have medicine, that the currency has no value, or that the education system neither educates or teaches, only indoctrinating communism, added the statement.
The parade Maduro attended marked the one-year anniversary of the Constitutional Assembly, a legislative body packed with loyalists that arrogated powers from the opposition-ruled National Assembly.
Maduro has remained in power over oil-rich Venezuela despite a collapsing economy and a long-running political crisis that has seen his country isolated internationally.
Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have fled due to food and medicine shortages and hyperinflation that could reach one million percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Maduro, a 55-year-old Socialist leader who took over from his late mentor Hugo Chavez in 2013, has effectively sidelined the fractured opposition through control of the courts and the electoral body -- and undinting support from the
After the explosion, he ordered the military to be on maximum alert, and said he is more determined than ever to follow the path of the revolution. He also warned the opposition that investigations will get the bottom of the alleged attack, whoever falls in the process.
His allies Cuba and Bolivia condemned the incident, as Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel and his predecessor Raul Castro expressed solidarity.
Maduro often accuses the opposition and the United States of working together to foment a coup to topple him.
A year ago, four months of protests against his authority that were put down by robust action from the army, the National Guard and police, left 125 people dead.
One of the key reasons for the protests was the creation of the Constitutional Assembly, which aimed to short-circuit the opposition-dominated National Assembly. - AFP

Magnitude 7 earthquake rocks Indonesias Lombok island
A powerful earthquake rocked Indonesias Lombok Sunday, sending people running from their homes and triggering a tsunami alert, just a week after a quake killed 17 people on the holiday island.
Disaster Management Center Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili said the Meteorology Department had confirmed that the earthquake will not have an impact on Sri Lanka. Kodippili also said that all the DMC regional offices have been notified and were asked to stay vigilant.
The latest tremor had a magnitude of seven and struck just 10 km underground according to the US Geological Survey. It was followed by two aftershocks.
Officials issued a tsunami warning, which was later cancelled Please go to a place with higher ground, while remaining calm and not panicking, Dwikorita Karnawati, head of the agency for meteorology, climatology and geophysics, told local TV.
Seawater had entered two villages as high as 10 cm and 13 cm (4-5 inches), Karnawati said later.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias disaster mitigation agency, said many buildings were thought to have been damaged in Lomboks main city of Mataram.
They are mostly buildings with weak construction material, Nugroho said.
Residents in Mataram described a strong jolt that sent people scrambling out of buildings.
Everyone immediately ran out of their homes, everyone is panicking, Iman told AFP.
Another resident Rita Siswati, 47, said the quake knocked out electricity and patients were evacuated from the main hospital.
The epicentre was in the sea 18 km northwest of Lombok, the USGS said, far from the main tourist spots on the south and west of the island.
The USGS reported two aftershocks, one with a magnitude of 5.4.
The quake was felt some 100 km (60 miles) away on the bustling resort island of Bali, and there were early reports of damage including to Ngurah Rai International Airport.
Agung Widodo, a resident of Balis main town of Denpasar, said he felt two strong tremors.
The first one lasted quite a while, the second one was only about 2-5 seconds. The first one was the bigger one, he told AFP.
People could be heard screaming as locals and tourists ran onto the road.
The tremor came a week after a shallow 6.4-magnitude quake hit Lombok, killing 17 people and damaging hundreds of buildings. It triggered landslides that briefly trapped trekkers on popular mountain hiking routes.
Indonesia, one of the most disaster-prone nations on earth, straddles the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide and many of the worlds volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur. - AFP

34th Sarasaviya Awards salutes to the legacy of Dr James Peries
Monumental moment!
When the 45-year old journalist who had already made his career as a filmmaker entered Asoka Hall in 1964, he sensed the limelight. He was a mere Lester James Peries with no credentials to his name. Yet he could reach for many trophies with much ease. The limelight was soon to be in his favour.
The strange turn of fate brought another audience member who was only 20 years back then. 54 years later, he graced the occasion as the countrys Prime Minister to recall how things unfolded back then a few metres away from the conventional VIP lecture pedestal. The 34th Cargills Sarasaviya Film Festival, held at the BMICH on August 3, was themed to pay tribute to Dr Lester James Peries. Dr Peries is known not only for his meteoric rise to the ecclesiastical echelons of local cinema but also for the illumed presence right throughout the Sarasaviya Film Festival chronology.
The countrys oldest film festival returned to the stellar gallery following a brief spell of absence. The return was not easy as quite a few festivals have already joined the ring to steal the show. The Sarasaviya fest was nevertheless armed with superior weaponry. The cultural segments were choreographed meticulously with a subtle aesthetic sense. The souvenir issued to coincide with the ceremony remains unique and would last for at least a century. The 3D revival of Dr Peries bidding his farewell (with his voice aired in the background) is simply mind-boggling.
As two armchairs sink to the ground and the lampshades evaporate into thin air, the traditional ancestral mansion setting fades into oblivion to pave the path for contemporary upholstery on the BMICH stage. With that, the players come to the fore to breathe life into the much-celebrated short narrative which made a long way to the much-talked-about film, Nidanaya (The Treasure). The creative stimulus of Lester James Peries and Tissa Abeysekara was deconstructed into a ballet-like tale.
The souvenir was devoted to the memory of Dr Lester James Peries. It is unique on several grounds. The souvenir which is, in fact, a coffee-table book, compiled by Dr Nuvan Nayanajith Kumara and Hemali Wijeratne, provides a comprehensive account of the Lester James Peries filmography with no eye-sore advertisements in between. In his lifetime, Dr Peries often stressed the need for a film archive. The coffee-table book is one step taken in that long journey.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, flanked by other eminent invitees, presented a special award to Sumitra Peries for her lifelong inspiration on Dr Lester James Peries in his epic journey.
The panel of judges (chaired by Gamini Weragama) was tasked with watching close to 50 films to handpick the best works of 2016 and 2017. The Sarasaviya 2018 had a special focus on most films overlooked at other festivals. Sayapethi Kusuma, Dekala Purudu Kenek and Bahuchitavadiya were among the host of lesser known, yet artistically ingenious, works introduced to the spotlight thanks to the jury attention.
The award for Best Actor for 2016 went to Dasun Pathirana and Best Actress for 2016 to Pooja Umashankar who received their awards from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Samanali Fonseka was adjudged the Best Actress for 2017 and Saumya Liyanage was Best Actor for 2017. Boodee Keerthisena accepted the award on behalf of Liyanage.
Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Managing Director of Cargills Ranjit Page, ANCL Chairman Krishantha Prasad Cooray, Editorial Director Chandrasiri Seneviratne and Sarasaviya Editor Aruna Gunaratne were present.
The Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards was organised by Sarasaviya, the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limiteds cinema weekly, with Cargills, Sri Lankas leading retail and FMCG company.

Nasser Hussain not impressed with Kohlis captaincy
Former England captain Nasser Hussain said India skipper Virat Kohli was phenomenal with the bat in the first Test but questioned his captaincy, saying he should too take some responsibility for the 31-run loss.
Kohli was phenomenal in this game. He deserved to be on the winning side for the way he played with the tail. He single-handedly brought India back into the Test match. I do think he should take some of the responsibility for the loss, though, Hussain told Sky Sports.
England were 87-7 with Curran and Adil Rashid at the crease and for some reason Ravichandran Ashwin went out of the game for an hour. India lost control then - he needs to look back on his captaincy and say when Ive got a bloke who averages 19 against left-handers and a 20-year-old left-hander on strike, why did I take him off, Hussain asked.
The pitch has a lot to do with that - it wasnt a flat belter - and so have the players. The standard of bowling and captaincy (has been great). I think Joe Root has been outstanding in this game.
The template for Test cricket has been set and I dont see why the ICC cant just use the Dukes ball around the world. It produces exciting cricket, so why dont the ICC go down that road

National Sustainability discourse launched today
The National Sustainability discourse, a three month nationwide discussion on the contents of the first draft of the Vision 2030 document will be launched today (6) by the Presidential Secretariat, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
Presidents Secretary Udaya Seneviratne said that following this discourse, the draft will be revised with public input to create a truly consensual national vision to map out the sustainable development policies leading up to 2030.
The President sees real potential in hosting a national discourse based on this document, he said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, he further said that this is Sri Lankas first national effort to create a blueprint to set out the countrys long term economic, social and environmental goals for the next 12 years, reflecting on our countrys strengths and capabilities.
Seneviratne explained that in 2015, the President pledged at the United Nations to provide leadership to help achieve the sustainable development goals by the year 2030 and when he returned to the country he appointed Professor Mohan Munasinghe, Sri Lankas only Nobel Laureate to appoint an independent committee of experts, academics, and professionals to write the first draft of Sri Lankas 2030 sustainable development vision.
He said that in January 2018, the first draft of this document written by 43 leading experts in different sectors was presented to the President and added that it is an extensive 260 page document covering the broader topics of economic, environmental and social sustainability.
Seneviratne said that they intend to include these in the policy proposals for the betterment of the country.
He further said that a Parliament Oversight Committee under MP Thilanga Sumathipala has been appointed to look into the progress of this document and the proposals.
One of the members of the expert committee Shiral Lakthilake said that the committee has no political aspirations and the proposals have nothing to do with that, stating that they expect the public to provide their feedback on this, adding that the main target audience will be youth, academics and professionals.

The Nelson Mandela Lecture
On July 17th, former President Obama delivered the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The lecture came not long after Donald Trumps press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. The talk was Obamas most extensive reflection so far on the current political climate, though it did not once mention Trump by name. The lecture is edited, but not much. -David Remnick.
When my staff told me that I was to deliver a lecture, I thought back to the stuffy old professors in bow ties and tweed, and I wondered if this was one more sign of the stage of life that Im entering, along with gray hair and slightly failing eyesight. I thought about the fact that my daughters think anything I tell them is a lecture. I thought about the American press and how they often got frustrated at my long-winded answers at press conferences, when my responses didnt conform to two-minute sound bites.
But given the strange and uncertain times that we are inand they are strange, and they are uncertainwith each days news cycles bringing more head-spinning and disturbing headlines, I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective. So, I hope youll indulge me, despite the slight chill, as I spend much of this lecture reflecting on where weve been and how we arrived at this present moment, in the hope that it will offer us a roadmap for where we need to go next.
Why Nelson
One hundred years ago, Madiba was born in the village of Mvezo. In his autobiography, he describes a happy childhood: hes looking after cattle; hes playing with the other boys. [He] eventually attends a school where his teacher gave him the English name Nelson. And, as many of you know, hes quoted saying, Why she bestowed this particular name upon me, I have no idea.
There was no reason to believe that a young black boy at this time, in this place, could in any way alter history. After all, South Africa was then less than a decade removed from full British control. Already, laws were being codified to implement racial segregation and subjugation, the network of laws that would be known as apartheid. Most of Africa, including my fathers homeland, was under colonial rule. The dominant European powers, having ended a horrific world war just a few months after Madibas birth, viewed this continent and its people primarily as spoils in a contest for territory and abundant natural resources and cheap labor. The inferiority of the black race, an indifference towards black culture and interests and aspirations, was a given.
Such a view of the worldthat certain races, certain nations, certain groups were inherently superior, and that violence and coercion is the primary basis for governance, that the strong necessarily exploit the weak, that wealth is determined primarily by conquestthat view of the world was hardly confined to relations between Europe and Africa, or relations between whites and blacks. Whites were happy to exploit other whites when they could. And, by the way, blacks were often willing to exploit other blacks. Around the globe, the majority of people lived at subsistence levels, without a say in the politics or economic forces that determined their lives. Often they were subject to the whims and cruelties of distant leaders. The average person saw no possibility of advancing from the circumstances of their birth. Women were almost uniformly subordinate to men. Privilege and status was rigidly bound by caste and color and ethnicity and religion. And even in my own country, even in democracies like the United States, founded on a declaration that all men are created equal, racial segregation and systemic discrimination was the law in almost half the country and the norm throughout the rest of the country.
That was the world just a hundred years ago. There are people alive today who were alive in that world. It is hard, then, to overstate the remarkable transformations that have taken place since that time. A second world war, even more terrible than the first, along with a cascade of liberation movements from Africa to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, would finally bring an end to colonial rule. More and more peoples, having witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism, the repeated mass slaughters of the twentieth century, began to embrace a new vision for humanity, a new idea, one based not only on the principle of national self-determination but also on the principles of democracy and rule of law and civil rights and the inherent dignity of every single individual.
Commercial regulations
In those nations with market-based economies, suddenly union movements developed, and health and safety and commercial regulations were instituted, and access to public education was expanded, and social welfare systems emerged, all with the aim of constraining the excesses of capitalism and enhancing its ability to provide opportunity not just to some but to all people. And the result was unmatched economic growth and a growth of the middle class. In my own country, the moral force of the civil-rights movement not only overthrew Jim Crow laws but it opened up the floodgates for women and historically marginalized groups to reimagine themselves, to find their own voices, to make their own claims to full citizenship.
It was in service of this long walk towards freedom and justice and equal opportunity that Nelson Mandela devoted his life. At the outset, his struggle was particular to this place, to his homelanda fight to end apartheid, a fight to insure lasting political and social and economic equality for its disenfranchised nonwhite citizens. But through his sacrifice and unwavering leadership and, perhaps most of all, through his moral example, Mandela and the movement he led would come to signify something larger. He came to embody the universal aspirations of dispossessed people all around the world, their hopes for a better life, the possibility of a moral transformation in the conduct of human affairs.
Madibas light shone so brightly, even from that narrow Robben Island cell, that in the late seventies he could inspire a young college student on the other side of the world to rexamine his own priorities, could make me consider the small role I might play in bending the arc of the world towards justice. And when, later, as a law student, I witnessed Madiba emerge from prison, just a few months, youll recall, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I felt the same wave of hope that washed through hearts all around the world.
Ancient hatreds
Do you remember that feeling It seemed as if the forces of progress were on the march, that they were inexorable. Each step he took, you felt this is the moment when the old structures of violence and repression and ancient hatreds that had so long stunted peoples lives and confined the human spiritthat all that was crumbling before our eyes. Then, as Madiba guided this nation through negotiation painstakingly, reconciliation, its first fair and free elections, as we all witnessed the grace and the generosity with which he embraced former enemies, the wisdom for him to step away from power once he felt his job was complete, we understood thatwe understood it was not just the subjugated, the oppressed who were being freed from the shackles of the past. The subjugator was being offered a gift, being given a chance to see in a new way, being given a chance to participate in the work of building a better world.
During the last decades of the twentieth century, the progressive, democratic vision that Nelson Mandela represented in many ways set the terms of international political debate. It doesnt mean that vision was always victorious, but it set the terms, the parameters; it guided how we thought about the meaning of progress, and it continued to propel the world forward. Yes, there were still tragediesbloody civil wars from the Balkans to the Congo.
Despite the fact that ethnic and sectarian strife still flared up with heartbreaking regularity, despite all that as a consequence of the continuation of nuclear dtente, and a peaceful and prosperous Japan, and a unified Europe anchored in NATO, and the entry of China into the worlds system of tradeall that greatly reduced the prospect of war between the worlds great powers. From Europe to Africa, Latin America to Southeast Asia, dictatorships began to give way to democracies.
The march was on. A respect for human rights and the rule of law, enumerated in a declaration by the United Nations, became the guiding norm for the majority of nations, even in places where the reality fell far short of the ideal. Even when those human rights were violated, those who violated human rights were on the defensive.
With these geopolitical changes came sweeping economic changes. The introduction of market-based principles, in which previously closed economies, along with the forces of global integration powered by new technologies, suddenly unleashed entrepreneurial talents to those that once had been relegated to the periphery of the world economy, who hadnt counted. Suddenly they counted. They had some power.
They had the possibilities of doing business. And then came scientific breakthroughs and new infrastructure and the reduction of armed conflicts. Suddenly a billion people were lifted out of poverty, and once starving nations were able to feed themselves, and infant mortality rates plummeted.
And, meanwhile, the spread of the Internet made it possible for people to connect across oceans, and cultures and continents instantly were brought together, and potentially all the worlds knowledge could be in the hands of a small child in even the most remote village.

New media, a threat to younger generation - Press Council Chairman
Sri Lanka Press Council Chairman Koggala Wellalage said the electronic and print media and the Facebook are misleading the public by carrying distorted news reports.
Distorted reports will spoil the minds of the reader and schoolchildren, he said addressing journalists at the Kalutara district workshop held at the Garden Beach Hotel in Kalutara.
The workshop was organised by the Press Council with the support of Kalutara District Secretary U. D. C. Jayalal.
Wellalage said over 200 complaints had been received against media institutions and journalists at the Council.These complaints are under investigation.Under the Press Council Bill, rules and regulations, these journalists or the institutions will have to face imprisonment and fine if found guilty, he said.
Local journalists must be responsible for the news reports they submit to their respective editors for publication. A booklet containing guidelines for journalists and editors of newspapers will be published in due course by the Press Council,the Chairman said.
The Chairman said parents must pay special attention to their children who use electronic media and social media like the Facebook. Certain stories appearing in new media can corrupt the minds of schoolchildren and the younger generation, he said.
Lecturer Tudor Weerasinghe said the entire world is governed by the new global mass media that had become a death trap for the younger generation.
If it is not handled carefully by schoolchildren their lives would end in disaster. The government must control the effects of mass media and the facedbook,he said.

No Principal for Urubokka National School yet
The Urubokka National School in Pasgoda, Matara with over 3000 students has been without a permanent principal since November last year.
Parents said the Education Ministry has failed to assign a permanent Principal since the former Principal was arrested by Urubokke police for alleged assault on a Grade 11 student. He was produced before the Morawaka Magistrate and remanded. Thereafter the former Principal who was released on bail had been temporarily posted to the Southern Education Ministry and subsequently transferred to the Deniyaya Zonal Education office. Parents alleged that the former Principal has another court case against him for alleged unauthorised felling of six trees in the school compound and disposing the timber without notice.
Parents said the lack of a permanent Principal was a serious drawback towards the education of their children. Parents said Education authorities should ensure that a permanent Principal is appointed to the school without delay.

Peaty and Kolesnikov break world swim records at Euros
GLASGOW, Saturday - Adam Peaty and Kliment Kolesnikov made it a landmark night at the inaugural multi-sport European Championships when the two swimming prodigies broke world records to strike gold in the space of just over an hour on Saturday.
Briton Peaty added more lustre to his reputation as perhaps the worlds most dominant swimmer when he smashed his own 100 metres breaststroke mark in 57.00 seconds en route to his 17th major gold medal.
Kliment Kolesnikov of Russia reacts after winning the 50 meters backstroke men final at the European Swimming Championships in Glasgow, Scotland, Saturday, Aug. 4, 2018. - AP
The 23-year-old knocked 0.13 seconds off his own record set at the 2016 Rio Olympics - the fourth time he has set a new mark in the discipline in which he has been unbeaten for four years.
Russian teenager Kolesnikov then followed up the home favourites heroics by setting a new 50 metres backstroke mark while winning his first major individual title at senior level just a month after his 18th birthday.
He clocked 24.00 seconds to take 0.04 seconds off the record set by Britains Liam Tancock at the world championships in Rome in 2009.
On a remarkable evening at the Tollcross International Swimming Centre, Swedish phenomenon Sarah Sjoestroem achieved a 100 metres butterfly and 50 metres freestyle golden double only to find herself overshadowed by the record-breaking pair.
Its incredible. I wasnt targeting the record at all, said Olympic champion Peaty after winning his ninth European long course title.
Even after touching the wall, he could hardly believe what he had achieved, shouting no way! Yet the victory was so dominant that the silver medallist, Peatys British team mate James Wilby, was 1.54 seconds adrift.
It felt particularly sweet for Peaty as this was the venue where his career really took off when he won Commonwealth Games gold in 2014.
It started in this pool. Oh my God, I cannot believe that, he said, having bounced back from his first setback for four years when he lost the 50 metres breaststroke final at this years Commonwealth Games in Australia.
Sometimes, youve got to have a bad race to realise how much you love the sport. I was just too tense, I just wasnt me (at the Commonwealths).
Kolesnikov, who had been part of Russias 4 x 100 metres freestyle gold medal-winning quartet on Friday, was so dominant that he beat Romanian silver medallist Robert-Andrei Glinta, a former world junior champion, by an extraordinary 0.55 seconds. Even though he has long been tipped to lead the new generation of talented Russian swimmers as a junior world record breaker, Kolesnikovs progress has still been spectacular and he too could add two more golds in the longer backstroke events. Still, though, he is looking well beyond Glasgow. The big goal is the Olympics (in Tokyo in 2020). It is nothing special what I have done today, the special one is the Olympics, said Kolesnikov. Sjoestroem enjoyed another memorable night in her great career, comfortably winning the 100m butterfly title before an hour later prevailing in a thrilling Scandinavian 50 metres freestyle duel with Olympic champion Pernille Blume. The race to find the fastest European woman swimmer was so close that world record holder Sjoestroem edged her Danish rival by one-hundredth of a second in 23.74 seconds, just 0.07sec outside her global mark.

Presidents invite to professionals
President Maithripala Sirisena has once again extended an invitation to our professionals who have left our shores for greener pastures abroad to return to the motherland and avail of their services to the country. Speaking at a function in connection with Pibidena Polonnaruwa programme, where he launched a series of development projects in his native Polonnaruwa, over the weekend, the President revealed that as much as 10,000 engineers had left the country for overseas and that if the trend continued there would be a serious problem faced by the country due to the dearth of a skilled workforce to implement the multifaceted development programmes now in the pipeline.
The President said there were 24,000 minor irrigation tanks spread across the country and he called on these engineers who are now offering their expertise to foreigners to come back and rehabilitate these irrigation tanks for the benefit of the poor farmers. After this is accomplished, if they feel like it, they could go back to their foreign jobs.
The Presidents concerns are understandable. The flight for overseas jobs among local professionals, no doubt, is going to impact heavily on the development front, though the brain drain is not something of recent origin.
The rot set in with the advent of the Sinhala Only policy in 1956 that saw the gradual exit of professional from our shores. What started in dribs and drabs turned into a torrent with July 83 with the result that the country is today starved of skilled personnel for the specialized jobs. Things can only get worse, with countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Switzerland offering study courses with jobs to qualified youth, which no doubt is bound to trigger another exodus of the cream of the countrys educated talent. With the universities in turmoil and strikes galore, plus the general chaotic state in the country, affluent parents will want to ensure a better future for their offspring by securing for them a hassle free climate for their education.
It is hoped that our professionals domiciled abroad would heed the call of the President and return to the motherland even for a short while to offer their service to the country. No doubt, a good majority of these professional were the beneficiaries of the free education system and they should consider it their duty, nay obligation, not to turn their backs on the country at a time of dire need.
True, most of these professionals may have been lured by the attractive monetary rewards overseas. But there may also be those who had left the country embittered by the treatment meted out to them in their country of birth. The minority Tamils, post July 83, no doubt, fall into this category. Certainly, some of the best brains in this country that adorned the professions took flight in their droves in bitterness after being victims to the unfortunate incidents. Among them doctors, engineers, accountants, architects who took their skills and expertise with them to other countries. Most of them would now be no more, or, in the evening of their lives, and their children may be well settled in their adopted countries and professionals in their own right and may not be keen to grasp the Presidents invitation. There may also be those who would wish to take up the offer of the President, providing it is worth their while. Therefore, a conducive climate is imperative if these professionals are to be lured back to the country and help out in the development programmes, coupled with the necessary incentives.
Above all, what is needed is stability. No professional would want to return to his/ her motherland that is reeling with strikes, protests and agitations on a regular basis, whatever love he/she may have for the country. The President would do well to turn his attention towards this aspect and act with firmness to stem the tide. There is also the need to put the house in order on other fronts as well, particularly where political stability is concerned. Professionals would not look forward to visiting a country where there are political dogfights on a regular basis. All the happenings on the political front would no doubt be lapped up by our professionals on the internet and social media. They would not be eager to walk into such a milieu and be caught up in no mans land.
MPs and judges
A salary hike for parliamentarians is being contemplated to give effect to a 2006 decision to bring the salaries of an MP on par with that of a Court of Appeal Judge. The MPs may well argue that they are, after all, lawmakers while the judges only interpret the law, and, if at all, their salaries should even be higher than that of the judges.
It is moot, though, if the judges will take kindly to their lordships being equated to members of parliament, particularly after the recent revelation that as much as one third of our legislators havent passed their GCE (O/L)s.
No, not by a long shot.

President says No to MPs pay hike
President Maithripala Sirisena says that he will not approve any increase in the salary for Members of Parliament.
He made these comments while addressing the gathering during an event in Polonnaruwa. The President stated that he will not permit the increase of MPs salaries by even 5 cents.
Certain reports published in newspapers and websites had claimed that the salaries of MPs are to be increased by 215 percent and that the relevant proposal has been submitted to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
However, the Speakers Office issued a statement yesterday in response to these reports, saying that no final decision has been taken on the matter.
The statement said that according to a proposal passed in Parliament on 23.11.2006, it was decided that the increase of salaries for MPs and Ministers should be carried out parallel to the salary increase of judges of the higher courts.
In this backdrop, the Speaker recently sent the notifications received by him pointing that the salaries of MPs should match the recent salary increase in the judicial sector, to the Secretary General of Parliament in order to present observations.
However, no final decision has been taken so far regarding an increase of the salaries of MPs and Ministers, the release said.
It also said that opinions can be sought during the Party Leaders Meeting and finally from the public representatives in Parliament as to whether the decision taken on 23.11.2006 or another procedure will be followed when reaching a decision on this matter.

Reeza Hendricks third SAn to score century on ODI debut
Proteas flatten Sri Lanka on flat track to win series
PALLEKELE, Sunday: On a flat Pallekele International Stadium pitch South Africa displayed their full batting potential to run up the highest total at this venue - 363-7 in 50 overs to beat Sri Lanka by 78 runs and take a winning 3-0 lead in the five-match series.
Leading South Africas run-spree was one-day debutant Reeza Hendricks whose knock of 102 off 89 balls with eight fours and a six provided his team with the impetus for their final total. Hendricks was not alone in the run-making for Hashim Amla (59), Jean-Paul Duminy (92) and David Miller (51) all joined the band-wagon as they put the Lankan bowling to the sword.
Sri Lanka facing a tall task of overhauling that total got off to a poor beginning losing three wickets for 63 inside the first 10 overs but fought back gallantly to be eventually dismissed for 285 in the 46th over.
It was another sorry spectacle of batting by the Lankans against South Africas varied attack of fast bowlers who have held the upperhand in the one-day series. They have been responsible for taking 21 of the 27 wickets to fall so far to bowlers.
Yesterday saw another instance where Sri Lanka had not learnt their lessons from the past two ODIs. The batsmen made the same mistakes failing to survive the opening spells of Rabada and Ngidi in the first 8-10 overs. It is a well known fact that South Africas strength lay in these initial overs and it was stated by none than the Lankan batting coach Thilan Samaraweera soon after Sri Lankas loss in the first ODI where they slumped to 36-5 but recovered later to post 193 after the opening bowlers came off.
All the batsmen got starts but none stayed long enough to convert them into big ones like Hendricks and Duminy did for South Africa with the exception of Dhananjaya de Silva who was included for his first game in the series at the expense of Shehan Jayasuriya.
De Silva one of Sri Lankas brightest stars carried the fight to the bowlers to hit a career best 84 off 66 balls spiced with three sixes and eight fours. He lifted the spirits of the large crowd that was present with his excellent stroke play around the wicket.
With Akila Dananjaya offering him good support with 37 off 42 balls, De Silva added 95 for the seventh wicket off 77 balls although it was in a losing cause. The Lankan lower order showed the top order that there was enough runs to score on the pitch if they had only applied themselves.
The South African innings never lost momentum once Amla had given them a flying start posting a run-a-ball 59 (9 fours, 1 six) despite losing his opening partner Quinton de Kock for 2 as early as the sixth over.
Hendricks and Duminy continued the onslaught with a stand of 78 off 73 balls and after Hendricks fine knock was ended by Lahiru Kumara, Duminy joined by David Miller put together the best partnership of the innings  103 off 70 balls that saw South Africa pummel 71 runs off the final five and reach their third highest total against Sri Lanka after the 384-6 at Centurion and 367-5 at Cape Town both scored in 2017.
The 26-year-old Hendricks whose previous international experience is representing his country in 12 T20Is became the third SA batsman to score a hundred on ODI debut after Colin Ingram v Zimbabwe in 2010 and Temba Bavuma v Ireland in 2016 and 14th overall. He was named Man of the Match.
He was the fifth batsman to score an ODI debut hundred against Sri Lanka following Andy Flower (Zimbabwe), late Phil Hughes (Australia), and Pakistanis Inzamam-ul-Haq and Saleem Elahi.
The imperious Duminy struck four sixes and eight fours in his extraordinary 70-ball knock for 92 missing out on a well deserved century when he played an over ambitious pull to hole out to deep midwicket.
Miller one of the hardest hitters of the ball in one-day cricket raced to a half-century off 47 balls with the aid of five fours and a six and Andile Phehelukwayo piled on the misery before the overs ran out making 24 not out off 11 balls.
All the Lankan bowlers went for runs as none were spared. The best return was by Thisara Perera who took four wickets despite going for 75 runs off his 10 overs.
Akila Dananjaya who had taken six wickets in the first two ODIs suffered the most ending with figures of one for 81.
The fourth ODI a night game will be played at the same venue on Wednesday.

Purple pooch
A mum has defended her decision to give her dog purple and blue highlights  insisting that her pup absolutely loves her look.
Though some people have accused 61-year-old Renae Crevalle of cruelty, she says her Chinese-crested dog Sheeba loves her style.
According to Renae, Sheeba has even become internet famous. Renae, who manages dog grooming parlour Suds N Scissors Inc near her home in Carmel, California, USA, said, Shes an internet sensation and when I have Sheeba with me, what should be a two minute stroll down to the beach takes an hour, as so many people stop to stroke her or say hello.
Renae first started trying elaborate tints on Sheebas fur five years ago, for the American Independence Day celebrations on 4 July.
It went down a storm and Sheeba loved it  she was wagging her tail like crazy  so it grew from there, she said.
Id seen some pets being dyed at dog shows and thought Id have a go on my own.
Now she highlights her pups luscious locks, using foils to get just the right tint, every two months, during hour long sessions.
An international jet-setter who travels on superyachts and private jets, Sheeba has been turning heads with her bright fur everywhere from Italys stunning Amalfi Coast to the Bahamas, Mexico, Germany and all over the States.
Renae and her Norwegian partner of two years, Geir Fjugstad, 57, a private banker, take Sheeba everywhere with them.
Renae said, Shes an amazing and fun dog, with a wonderful personality. As well as being an internet sensation, we always take her with us whenever we travel  from Europe to the Bahamas  and she makes friends wherever she goes. Every time I take her out in public, she makes people smile.
I cant walk down the street without people stopping me to stroke her or take a picture.
According to Renae, Sheeba loves being the centre of attention, and often poses and prances down the street knowing shes getting lots of admiring looks.
But while most people thing she looks great, she has also received negative reactions.
Some people dont understand it and think its harmful. But I would never hurt my dog, I love her too much and it makes her happy, Renae said.
Despite the negative comments, Renae focuses on the positive  and says her dogs style is a great ice breaker and has led her to making lots of friends.
She said, When we were on the plane coming back to San Francisco we met the New Zealand rugby team, the formidable All Blacks. All these giant men just melted when they met her. Theyd be very welcome to borrow her as a lucky mascot if they want her to join them doing their famous Maori war dance, the haka, which they do before games. Im sure shed be a star turn!

Ramanna Maha Nikaya holds upasampada
The Ramanna Maha Nikaya's upasampada was held at the Buddhangala Aranya Senasanaya in Digamadulla and the Dhamma Medura Viharaya in Ampara, recently.
The upasampada (higher ordination) is the greatest discipline which promotes the spirit of a novice monk (samanera) to the rank of a Buddhist monk (Bhikkhu). First, the candidate of the higher ordination must be a samanera before he could receive the higher ordination for monkshood, which is considered as a probationary period.
The probationer must pledge himself to the Maha Sangha, to raise him from the state of samanera to bhikkhu, with the statement of Ullumpathuman Banthe Sanghoanukampanu Padaaya, which translates to raise me, cleans me and appoint me to monkshood.
It implies that the higher ordination is the establishment of the necessary surroundings in order to realise spiritual purity and gain access to it.
Although there is only one form of the upasampada at present, there were several methods of upasampada in history, from the Buddha's time. The first upasampada method, which was followed by the Buddha, was Ehi Bhikku Upasampada. It was only performed by the Buddha himself, raising someone up for the higher ordination by telling the candidate, a bhikkhu, to come forward (ehi, bhikku)
This method of higher ordination cannot be performed today, except for the Gnatticathuttha Upasampada, which could be performed by bhikkus themselves. There are some steps to be followed in performing the said method of higher ordination;
First, the candidate must fulfill the essential requirements for the admission of receiving higher ordination. He must be male, must be free from communicable diseases and debts, he must not be a slave, must have parental consent, must be least 20 years of age and must provide for the higher ordination ceremony with a proper suit of three yellow robes (tichivara) as well as an alms bowl (patta). He should also be well-versed in the samanera precept.
According to the Buddha, upasampada could be obtained only from bhikkhus (a minimum of four senior monks). This could be the reason Arahat Mahinda brought five bhikkhus with him when he arrived in this country.
The upasampada is performed traditionally in a small place of limited boundaries, which is called a baddha seema. Since ancient times, the limits for upasampada were in two categories as in land (baddha seema) and in water (udakukkhepa seema). Udakukkhepa seema has been considered the most suitable limit for the purpose.
During the upasampada, the first assignment done is converting the samanera monks into laymen again and offering monkhood back as a samanera. Then, the candidate is presented in front of the bhikkhus in the Seema and provided a temporary name as Naga.
The leading monk among the Sangha in the seema is also given a name, Tissa, considering a few conditions: He must complete 20 years of monkshood after his own upasampada and should prove and receive purification versatility as a bhikkhu. Not only he, but other bhikkhus in the seema must go through rituals known as Abbhahana Vinaya Kamma, through which they become disciplined and versatile. A minimum of four bhikkhus is mandatory to form an appropriate chapter of monks; a Sangha.
The upasampada candidate requests the Chief Priest or Preceptor (Upajjhyaya), to make him rise three times by uttering "Please be my Chief Priest" (Upajjyayo me Bhanthehohi), and the chief accepts the request. Afterwards, the candidate has to answer a few questions asked by the bhikkhus in the seema, to prove himself a suitable candidate to be raised.
Once it is clear that the candidate has fulfilled all the requirements, the bhikkhus grant him the upasampada.
The higher ordination is conducted reciting a special stanza. An elder monk reads the authorised words of ritual from the prescribed book of compendium (Kammavaca in Pali) on palm leaves, or on lacquered paper.
The Kammavaca are the ecclesiastical scriptures or the ceremonial compendium prescribed to be read during ordination ceremonies and other monastic rites. In some cases, when the participant monks are more than four, readers are selected to read the Kammavaca in groups of three and to repeat the reading three times. Thereafter, the newly-ordained bhikkhu is advised by one of the senior bhikkhus, to lead the rest of his life blissfully.
Upasampada could be identified as an extraordinary occasion of monastic life.
The upasampada of the Ramanna Maha Nikaya is held every two years. An Udakukkepa Seema is prepared at a suitable lagoon or lake.
This time, more than 400 samaneras were appointed as bhikkus.

Reading maketh a healed man
Why do you read Maybe you read to relax after a long day, to learn about unfamiliar people or places, to make you laugh or to let you dream. Maybe you never really ask yourself why, but turn to books out of some vague instinct that theyre what you want or need.
The question of why humans invest such a lot of time and other resources in reading is an interesting one for researchers of both minds and texts, especially when it comes to fiction and poetry, where the answer doesnt seem as obviously pragmatic as just learning useful facts. Whatever the answer is, it promises to tell us as much about human nature as it does about literature. For decades now, researchers in cognitive literary studies have been suggesting reasons for why we read fiction. The dominant thinking is some variant on the idea that reading (especially reading narratives, often fictional) is pleasurable because it serves some evolutionarily adaptive purpose, in particular by giving us the chance to hone cognitive skills of one kind or another, free of real world risks. One strand of the general idea that narrative reading may increase our fitness is that it may quite literally help us be healthier.
Self-help books are an obvious place to start. Theres a growing body of research on self-help bibliotherapy (reading a self-help book, with or without some kind of formal guidance) which indicates that self-help books can sometimes be effective alternatives or supplements to other kinds of therapy. independent

Renewable energy
As Sri Lankas tourism and business sectors grow, Colombos skyline is stretching higher and the three-wheelers swirling through the streets are multiplying. But beyond the cranes sprinkled along the coastline and the dusty construction sites popping up across the city, lies a question that could have global consequences: how is Sri Lanka powering this growth
This month, a heat wave swept across Asia, a firestorm ravaged forests on the west coast of the United States, and torrential rain storms accompanied by massive landslides killed dozens in Japan. While climate change has consequences that span the globe, Sri Lanka is uniquely vulnerable to the perils of climate disasters. Last year, the UNs World Risk Index ranked Sri Lanka as a high-risk country for climate disasters.
Experts attribute the increased frequency and heightened intensity of climate disasters to a rising global temperature as a result of high carbon emissions in the atmosphere. It is widely known that fossil fuels - coal, oil, and natural gas - contribute to these emissions by trapping heat in the atmosphere, creating what is called a greenhouse effect.
And thus, the country is facing an impasse. Energy must meet increasing demands, but Sri Lankas existing infrastructure was built for fossil fuels, the go-to energy source of the 20th century. To climb out too quickly of a system so deeply entrenched could prove destabilising and even debilitating in the wake of fundamental national development. But staying bound to the technologies of the past could have disastrous environmental consequences.
Background
Evinced by President Maithripala Sirisenas cancellation of Trincomalees Sampur coal plant in 2015 and subsequent advice to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to approve more coal plants in 2018, the debate around fossil fuels is fraught with conflict and confusion.
Sri Lanka is one of 194 nations to sign the Paris Agreement which sets an ambitious goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And within Sri Lanka, the government has set a series of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
Stakeholders agree to the benefits of exploring alternative, renewable energy sources - solar, wind, and hydro, among others. But, when it comes to how quickly the shift to renewables should happen or how comprehensive the change should be, finding a consensus has proven increasingly difficult.
For some, if there is any hope of reaching the zero carbon emissions goal, Sri Lanka is in a race against time. Coal and other nonrenewable energy sources are too ingrained in the larger system to delay the integration of more environmentally friendly sources. Any addition of coal is a step backwards, and the problem is urgent - inadequate access to energy affects more than half of Sri Lanka and disastrous consequences of climate change are manifesting more regularly.
For others, a quick switch to renewable energy poses a threat to the stability of supply and demand in Sri Lanka, and a slow transition may have good reason. Historically, a transition to an entirely new energy sources sometimes took a full century, so some ask - why the rush
Argument for stability
At a heated debate on Future Energy Trends in Sri Lanka, organised by the Institute of Environmental Professionals Sri Lanka (IEPSL), RMA Energy Managing Director Dr. Tilak Siyambalapitiya stressed the importance of maintaining balance in supply and demand in the incorporation of renewable energy. He explained to a crowd of engineers, activists, scientists, and other professionals in environment-related sectors that one cannot just switch renewables from low demand to high demand.
Precise estimates are paramount to electricity, he explained. For any given consumer, electricity needs to be available at the ready. One does not turn on a light switch, only to wait a minute for the energy source to catch up. Rather, the light flips on almost immediately - because of a carefully maintained equilibrium.
Dr. Siyamabalapitiya fears too quick and careless a transition to renewables could leave people without an adequate supply of electricity.
If you had only solar and wind power it couldnt work, he said, explaining that research has yet to ascertain an adequate way to store these resources to meet immediate demands. You would have to telephone the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and say, I want to turn on a light.
The energy specialist cautioned that people should not be overzealous about advancements in renewables. Both wind and solar can have battery systems, but electric power systems do not run on ongoing research, they have to run on proven research, Siyamabalapitiya said.
When probed about his pessimism regarding renewables in a Q&A at the end, he explained, I was not pessimistic. I was merely trying to educate the audience because there are a lot of misunderstandings about renewables.
Because building a renewable energy plant can take years, he says these energy sources have a long way to go before they can be fully functional and reliable. In his opinion, it is vital, in the meantime, to continue using coal to maintain a baseline stability.
It will take some time, but until then, we have to live with the mix of traditional and emerging options, he said.
Chief Engineer at the CEB, M.B.S. Samarasekara echoed Siyamabalapitiyas sentiment, emphasising the complexity of the situation. We are looking at a whole system, not one particular source, he said.
Samarasekara believes power plants are an inevitable part of the future and calls for regulation rather than eradication. Mediate the impact, dont shut down the power plant, he said at the event.
Argument for change
In some cases, the power plants impact is not mediated. In April 2018, it was reported that Norochcholais Lakvijya coal plant was running without a proper environmental licence for nearly a year. Operating with a dysfunctional electrostatic precipitator (ESP) for over a month, the plant was releasing heightened levels of fly ash, killing nearby sea life and endangering those around the plant.
Containing heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium, among others, fly ash is associated with a host of health problems from respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis to cognitive problems to various kinds of cancer.
Even within regulations, coal can be detrimental to health. A 2017 study in China found that people who used coal to heat their homes in the winter had a lower life expectancy by three years. High cardio-respiratory mortality suggested the shortened lifespan was tied to inhalants in coal emissions.
And while stability is also important to environmentalists, they are quick to point out one thing that is urgently unstable: the environment. According to CEO at the Centre for Environmental Justice, Hemantha Withanage, Coal is not an option for Sri Lanka or any other country.
There is continuous flooding, continuous drought. There is inadequate rain for the dry zone, he said, elaborating on the consequences of climate change in Sri Lanka. Thousands of people are suffering.
Some argue that Sri Lanka is doing relatively well compared to high polluting countries, but Hemantha cautions against complacency. We think we can still produce more carbon, he said. Thats rubbish. In the end, all emissions are going into the same atmosphere, he explained.
Samarasekara said we have not explored our options, referring to nuclear energy, and Siyambalapitiya listed petroleum as another unexplored option, but Withanage argues CEB engineers are not doing enough thinking outside of the box with regard to renewables.
To meet the zero emissions goal, changes need to be drastic and immediate, says Withanage. Unless you start building those renewables right now, we dont have time to do it, he said.
Withanage said Sri Lanka has a lot of potential for wave power, but nobody is investing. Reservoirs are not being used to their water storage capacity. And energy conservation is nowhere to be found. If you go to any store, they are using about ten times the amount of light than they should, he said.
Financial debate
Few would argue against having a lowered monthly electricity bill from electricity conservation, but the fight over coal usage remains financially complex.
Some argue coal is cheaper and in order to stay relevant in the global market, Sri Lanka must compete with countries with cheap energy, like Malaysia. And if doing business in Sri Lanka easily precludes making business eco-friendly, the question becomes one of priorities rather than pragmatism.
But Withanage took issue with that stance. He said coal is becoming so expensive, the change to renewables could happen by market factors alone, especially because renewables are getting cheaper. Imported all the way from South Africa, coal is big chunk of the 56 percent of Sri Lankas energy that is dependent on outsiders. Focusing on renewables could shift some of the responsibility back to Sri Lanka, harnessing the power of the islands rich natural resources.
Withanage also raised the question of what all the energy is powering. These projects, he says, are not for the development of Sri Lanka and are, by socioeconomic measures, unsustainable. Essentially, he believes Sri Lanka is getting ahead of itself. He suggests there is much more to do domestically to better the lives of citizens before building five star hotels and world-class restaurants.
Such developments are for wealthy foreign businesses and tourists, he says, and he fears that with the opening of Colombo Port City, tourism may shift away from the more rural parts of the country that are currently benefiting from the inflow of funds from foreign visitors.
At the end of the IEPSL event, an impassioned audience raised similar questions. Why are we giving cheap energy to outside companies one particularly frustrated person asked, referring to foreign companies operating in Sri Lanka, You have a captive market, you raise the price, he added.
Concerns about Sri Lankas own development aside, if the focus is, indeed, upward growth, Sri Lanka may be in a stalemate. If there is inadequate infrastructure and energy to power tourism, the sector is sure to suffer, but if the environment is destroyed and species are devastated as a result of climate change, tourists might not come in the first place.
It is a heated debate, with health, financial and even cultural implications, and it is one that is sure to rage on.

Seven JICA volunteers here
The latest batch of JICA volunteers arrived in Sri Lanka on Thursday (2).
These young Japanese volunteers are here to provide services in their specific fields of expertise. JICA volunteers are sent to developing nations as a part of the Japanese governments Technical Cooperation Programme, and their activities are aimed at providing assistance in economic and social development at grassroots level.
All such volunteers undergo prior training in the languages of their host countries, and in the case of Sri Lanka, they will conduct their activities in Sinhala or Tamil, depending on the region to which they are assigned.
This new batch of seven JICA volunteers will be engaged in the provision of services in a wide range of fields which include pre-school education (in Badulla and Kilinochchi), IT (in Seeduwa), environmental education (in Mannar), primary education (in Vavuniya), elderly care (in Kurunegala), and soccer (in Hatton).
The volunteers will be attached to institutions under several ministries. Six of the seven volunteers will work in Sri Lanka for a period of two years. Currently there are 74 volunteers working across Sri Lanka, and since the introduction of the programme in 1981, over 1,100 JICA volunteers have served in Sri Lanka.
Three of the volunteers were introduced to their host organisations at an assigning ceremony at the External Resources Department (ERD), on Thursday. ERD, JICA and officials representing the volunteers host organisations and other institutions were present.

Sri Lanka secures US$1 bn Chinese loan
Sri Lankas central bank on Friday (Aug 3) announced it had secured a US$1 billion Chinese loan as the island, a key link in Beijings ambitious Belt and Road initiative, develops closer relations with Asias largest economy.
Central bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that first half of the loan will be released later this month and the balance will be received in October.
During consultations (with the Chinese over the loan) it was clear that they see us as a key strategic partner as far as the (Belt and Road) initiative is concerned, given our location, Coomaraswamy told reporters in Colombo. The eight-year loan by China Development Bank carries a 5.25 per cent interest rate with a three year grace period. Coomaraswamy said that the terms of Chinese loan were better than other international lenders and the country hopes to secure additional US$200 to US$250 million from Chinas domestic financial market by issuing Panda bonds.
Last month, China vowed to keep providing financial help, including loans, to Sri Lanka despite warnings about the island nations mounting debt.
Sri Lanka last year granted a 99-year lease on a strategic port to Beijing over its inability to repay Chinese loans for the US$1.4 billion project.
The port in Colombo straddles the worlds busiest east-west shipping route and also gives a strategic foothold to China in a region long dominated by India. China had said its loan portfolio in Sri Lanka was US$5.5 billion as of last month, just over a tenth of Colombos total $51.82 billion external debt.
China will continue to provide selfless support, including much-needed funds for the development of Sri Lanka, the Chinese embassy in Colombo said last month.
Chinas Belt and Road infrastructure project seeks to revive ancient trade routes through a massive rail and maritime network via US$1 trillion in investments across Asia and Europe.
The International Monetary Fund, which bailed out Sri Lanka in June 2016 with a US$1.5 billion staggered loan, has warned that Colombo over its heavy debt. Sri Lankas economy has been on the mend since the IMF bailout, but growth in 2017 at 3.1 per cent was the slowest in 16 years.The central bank had forecast 2018 growth at between 4 to 4.5 per cent, but Coomaraswamy on Friday revised his estimate for the calendar year to below 4 per cent.

T20 Blast: Finch & Roy lead Surrey with record stand
LONDON, Openers Aaron Finch and Jason Roy produced an exhibition of power-hitting as Surrey successfully chased 222 to beat Middlesex by nine wickets at The Oval on Friday.
Finch (117 not out) and Roy (84) put on 194 - a record partnership for Surrey in the T20 Blast.
Finch needed only 16 balls to reach his half-century and 45 for his hundred.
The Australians effort eclipsed that of Middlesex opener Paul Stirling, who hit 109 in the visitors 221-5. That score equalled Middlesexs record total in T20 cricket, and was made despite England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan being run out without facing a ball.
But Surreys powerful batting line-up made light of that target to reach 222-1 with four overs to spare.
Finch was 48 not out after three overs of Surreys run chase and the hosts were 98-0 at the end of the powerplay. His partnership with England opener Roy, which was the 12th-highest in T20 history and the second best in English domestic T20 cricket, surpassed their own Surrey record of 187, which they registered in 2016 against Kent.
The 31-year-old is the leading run-scorer in this seasons T20 Blast, with 462 runs in six innings at an average of 154.
Johann Myburgh scored a 42-ball century in Somersets 10-wicket victory over Essex at Taunton, while Worcestershire successfully chased 195 to end Durhams five-match winning run and overtake the Jets at the top of the North Group.
Durham were without South Africa leg-spinner Imran Tahir, who was stuck in traffic on his way to New Road and failed to arrive for the scheduled start time. Tahir had been allowed to travel separately to the rest of his team as he was due to join up with his side in the Caribbean Premier League straight afterwards. Kent are top of the South Group after bowling out Hampshire for 88 to win by 51 runs at the Ageas Bowl. Afghanistans Mohammad Nabi hit 86 not out off 32 balls in Leicestershires win against Lancashire, while Gloucestershire - chasing 202 to beat Glamorgan - lost by just two runs.

Implementing law on meters
Three-wheeler drivers question delay
Three-Wheel Drivers Union President Lalith Dharmasekara yesterday, questioned the delay in implementing the rule making taxi meters compulsory for three wheelers.
He blamed the government for the delay and said the delay has an ulterior motive of giving an undue business opportunities for taxi companies.
The delay in implementing the law will help thrive taxi companies and three wheel drivers who earn a meager amount to make their ends meet will not benefit from it, he said
Dharamasekera said the law is put off citing that three wheeler associations are against this move.
The Three Wheelers Associations do not oppose this move. Three wheeler drivers and the travellers get benefits by the move, he said.
Dharmasekera said his association stressed the importance of installing a meter to every three wheeler and a Sri Lankan company is now providing high quality meters
Dharmasekera asked whether some companies eying at introducing taxi meters to three wheelers have hand behind the delay.
He said it was his union that first introduced taxi meters on January 5, 2005. We supported the endeavour. Those who opposed to taxi meters previously, still maintain the same stance citing various reasons. But these types of regulations are necessary to protect honour and dignity of the profession, he said.
Dharmasekera said the law should be implemented in the Western Province initially, It can be made compulsory in other provinces later, he said .
The National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Spokesman said meters that can issue printed bills were made compulsory from August 1. Accordingly, all three-wheelers transporting passengers should have meters that issue printed bills. The gazette notification making taxi meters mandatory for all three-wheelers were issued in September 8, 2017. Since the law has been gazetted, the Police can take action against three-wheelers with no meters. We have given a grace period for the trishaw drivers since 2017 to fix taxi meters. Therefore, the law has to be strictly implemented by now, he said.
The Three-wheeler Associations have endorsed the government decision to make it mandatory for three wheelers.
All Island Professional Drivers Association General Secretary K.R.C.J Kumara said the law has to be implemented to regulate the three-wheeler industry.
We expect to eliminate various irregularities and shortcomings in the industry by implementing the regulations. It will help ensure a secure destination for commuters and eventually produce disciplined three-wheel drivers who would assure the safety of the commuter and the driver, he said.
It is the duty of the authorities to prepare necessary rules and regulations to safeguard the three-wheel industry and protect passengers. As a union, we are 100 per cent in favour of making taxi meters compulsory for all three-wheelers since it would pave the way to regulate the industry.
These regulations should be strictly implemented as many companies have come forward to produce and install the meters. However, the fines for the offence is not mentioned in the gazette. It should be done simultaneously with the gazette notification. Then, the Police will have the authority to enforce the law.
The National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Spokesman said meters were made compulsory from August 1. All three-wheelers transporting passengers should have meters that can print bills.
The gazette notification making taxi meters mandatory for all three-wheelers was issued on September 8, 2017. Since the law has been gazetted, the Police can take action against three-wheelers that have no meters, he said.

Top tips for growing healthy roses
A lot can be said for a healthy rose bush, and the sight of blooming roses in your garden really will brighten your mood each day. There are two very important factors when planting roses to make sure you give them the best chance to thrive  firstly, make sure they are in the right growing conditions and secondly, plant them properly. Once youve got that right your roses will have a much better chance of thriving.
1. Plant your roses in full sunlight  be sure that they never have less than four hours sunlight on them each day or you will notice reduced flowering.
2. Never consider growing roses in areas with a cold draught or in waterlogged ground.
3. Enrich your soil with organic matter, such as well-rotted manure, and plant your roses there. This will give them the best chance to thrive.
4. Before planting a rose bush, prune back all the branches to about 15cm (6in) in length to concentrate the plants energies on producing a strong root system.
5. Most roses prefer well-drained, neutral soil, and flower best on fertile, clay soil.
6. Roses are greedy, so for best results plant them in rich soil, mulch annually with compost, seaweed or manure, and feed in spring and summer with a proprietary rose fertilizer.
7. If you spot the first signs of black spot then make sure you treat it right away by removing diseased foliage and burning it.
8. Train climbers up sturdy supports, ensuring unrestricted air flow around the foliage to deter mildew.
9. Deadhead your rose bushes regularly to encourage more flowers to grow, leaving late blooms to form hips.
10. Pruning is essential for flowering, but varies depending on type, so ensure that you check what your rose bush will require when you buy.

Turn your small space into a big harvest
The urban landscape of Colombo is being rapidly transformed. Skyscrapers and high rise buildings have now become a way of life. With the amount of space rapidly disappearing in the city, going vertically when designing buildings has become a necessity. People have begun to realize the importance of greenery and home gardens. District Agriculture Instructor of Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office K.N.K. Jayathilake speaks to Green Thumbs on how Cultivation Tower and Cultivation Racks  Structures in Vertical Home Gardening can help to have a home garden even in a congested city.
Home gardening is extremely popular in rural areas. However we can see a growing interest amongst urban dwellers too. This is because these urban dwellers have realized the value of cultivating at home. The idea of mental satisfaction and physical health a home garden can bring is now gaining momentum, said Jayathilake.
A large percentage of Sri Lankas population dwells in urban and semi urban areas. There is an influx of villagers into urban areas. As a result of understanding the importance of greenery, they try to replicate the village environment in urban areas.
However the lack of horizontal space made it a problem. With the hectic lives one has very little time to devote to gardening. The idea then is to make time through time management. If there is a lack of horizontal space then the logical conclusion is going vertical. There are techniques to make the most out of your spaces. We need to plant vertically creating rooftop gardens and balcony gardens. For this perhaps you can use discarded containers, stated Jayathilake.
Living in a tropical country we have abundant sunlight. After identifying the spaces sunlight falls into, in your house or apartment, and how long sunlight falls, you can choose your crops. Some crops need more sunlight than others. You can use the shade for crops that require it. According to your family needs you can grow your crops. There is no point trying to maintain a home garden that yields more than you require or less than you require, he added.
Crops for the cultivation tower include eggplant, Chili, Tomato, Cabbage, radish, and leafy vegetables that can be grown in this structure. Pod vegetables can be grown in places with more sunlight and leafy vegetables can be grown in shady sites. What you need to consume will soon be available in your garden.
When planting in Cultivation Towers, you need to water the tower every day during dry periods. Liquid fertilizer can be used as required for an increased yield. There are many advantages in this form of cultivation. It can be erected in a small space and utilizing the vertical space. It also guarantees a clean production and less growth of weeds, explained Jayathilake.
Cultivation Racks too, are a popular way of utilizing vertical spaces. There are three main designs. They are Inverted V Shaped Racks, Single Sided Cultivation Racks and Vertical Racks.
When it comes to the soil mixture in cultivation racks, combining organic fertilizer and top soil in equal parts, you need to add coir dust and paddy husks. The mixture gets lighter and controls the amount of water retained, and prevents against any threat of fungal attacks, pointed out Jayathilake.
When selecting the right crops to plant in a cultivation rack, you need to keep in mind that leafy vegetables such as Centella, KanKun, Mint and Lettuce are the most suitable to be cultivated in Cultivation racks. You need to take well rooted healthy plants. You can cultivate sun light loving species on the top gutters and shade loving species in the bottom gutters of the rack. A rack must be made using wood or iron bars to hold these gutters. There also needs to be a proper drainage system,
explained Jayathilake.
When it comes to fertilizing in cultivation racks, if the need for extra fertilizers arises, you can use a liquid fertilizer for speedy growth. After harvesting, organic fertilizer must be used on the soil in the rack.
When it comes to maintenance and harvesting you need to place the cultivation racks in a spot with ample sunlight. A several species can be planted in one rack, and they can be harvested batch wise. After six months of planting and harvesting, refill the gutters with new soil mixture, added Jayathilake.
As in cultivation towers there are so many advantages to cultivation racks. Since there is no requirement for an area of land, cultivation racks are urban friendly. The crops are cleaner because they are grown above ground level.
The racks also can be moved depending on your wishes. Actually it is the mobility of cultivation racks that make them extremely popular.
Just like shifting tables and chairs in your house you can move it to any part of your garden. You can move it to places with lots of sunlight or lots of shade. In addition to this several species can be planted in one rack. So what you have is a multi-purpose mechanism. You can control the outcome of the weather. If it is the rainy season you can make it work for you, explained Jayathilake.

New study shows
War-affected women with disabilities seek equality
May 2009, the final month of the Civil War, marked an end to Sri Lankas armed conflict. For many women with disabilities, the end of the war has not significantly improved their lives. A new study, Out of the Shadows: War-affected Women with Disabilities in Sri Lanka, looks at the barriers that continue to exist for these women.
Out of the Shadows is, perhaps, the first study of its kind in any country. Dinesha Samararatne, professor of Public and International Law at the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo, and her co-authors never came across a study in all of their combined research, which delves into the barriers that war-affected women with disabilities face. Samararatne says the intersectionality of women with disabilities makes them one of the most marginalised groups in society: they have to negotiate barriers as women and as people with disabilities, and on top of that, the barriers of a post-war context.
The report draws from a variety of sources, including interviews that explore the daily lives and daily struggles of these women. In an effort to be inclusive, the interviews for Out of the Shadows were conducted by other women with disabilities, people who could relate to these womens lives, incorporating women with disabilities more directly in the data collection.
The report marks the first stage of their work, Samararatne said, which is to create space for further discussion about the issues of inequality facing war-affected women with disabilities. Because of the reports broad goals, it did not distinguish between women who had disabilities before the war, or those who acquired them during the war, thereby avoiding the contentious definitions applied for receiving reparations.
Because this kind of a report can be contentious, we thought it was best to focus on the findings and the recommendations, rather than the narratives at this stage, Samararratne said.
Another part of the authors rationale stemmed from the context of a war-affected area. Samararatne explains how war-affected areas create obstacles for all individuals with disabilities, irrespective of how or when they received those disabilities: If you already had a disability and had to live through the war, your safety is at risk. If you had to flee, you are going to hold people back. You are likely to incur more injury because of your disability, and the people who are with you are also likely to incur more injuries. If you need medical attention and you are at risk you may not be able to access that medical attention.
In developing societies and war-affected contexts, said Samararatne, the scarcity of resources creates choices that limit people with disability most of all: they often end up being the sort of groups in societies that have the least access to these resources.

Watering the pitch key to thrilling Edgbaston Test, reveals groundsman
As the players from the Indian and English camp drew praise for an exciting first Test, the real heroes were the ground staff at Edgbaston.
The head groundsmen at Edgbaston Gary Barwell revealed that the key was to keep watering the pitch and the outfield in the weeks leading up to the game.
Around 150,000 litres of water had been pumped in and spread around the ground through pop-up sprinklers under the outfield.
Moisture is the key here. Else, the pitch can crack up, said Barwell.
If you dig up to four inches, you will hit sand. We have been pumping water to keep is colour. If the outfield dries, the moisture would escape from the pitch. It literally cracks and it gets virtually uncontrollable.
This is different from normal sprinklers. These can pump in 47,000 litres of water in 35 minutes.
Two days before the game, we then decide how much grass to keep and carefully monitor the moisture levels.

Way forward for water
The world economic forum in 2016 has ranked the water crisis as the highest concern over the next decade. We in Sri Lanka are beginning to sense this crisis and the uncertainties in weather pattern further aggravate this issue. Different parts of the country experience shortages of water for day- to-day activities including drinking and for agriculture whilst the entire country is affected economically and environmentally by depleting levels of capacity to generate hydroelectric power. Its a global concern and this has led the entire world to be more vigilant about water use. So much so that various tools are being developed to estimate the water consumed to manufacture different products and also to provide different services to the mankind.
Water footprint
One such tool or a methodology is the calculation of water footprint. Water footprint refers to the amount of water used to produce different products or provide different type of services to the human beings. For example, the amount of water used to produce a shoe or a shirt is the water footprint of that particular article. It can be estimated for a product, a service, an individual, a country and even the whole world. An individuals consumption of fresh water based on the products and services he or she uses or consumes per year is that persons water footprint.
We use a lot of water in ways that we would never anticipate often referred to as hidden water in everyday products, such as in the production of clothing, i.e., the production of one cotton suit might require over 14,000 liters of water and almost 3,700 liters for a cotton shirt. The water required for manufacturing a cell phone may be as much as 916 liters. This includes the water necessary to make the raw materials /components of the product, the water needs of the human resources used during the manufacturing process and also water required to treat waste generated during the production process.
An individual may not drink, feel or see all the water he or she uses or consumes. This is called, Virtual Water and it actually makes up the most of our water footprint. The combined total of direct and indirect usage of water in the lifecycle of products and related services all play a role in the overall footprint calculation. Knowledge on the water footprint of a particular product or a service would enable us to make processes more efficient so that we could control the use of this valuable and limited resource.
There are three different types of water footprint, namely Green, Blue and Grey. Green Water Footprint refers to the amount of soil water, which is recharged by rainwater, required to produce a product. It is mainly relevant for forestry, horticultural and agricultural products. Blue Water Footprint refers to the amount of groundwater or surface water required to produce a product. Domestic water use, industry and irrigated agriculture can each have a blue water footprint component. The amount of freshwater required for incorporating and diluting the pollutants/waste water to meet a particular water quality standard as required by environmental regulatory institutions, e.g., Central Environmental Authority, is the Grey water footprint.
Water footprint of plantation crop produce
The plantation industry of our country is more than 150-years-old and the land extent utilized at present is around 1,000,000 hectares when crops found in home gardens are also taken into account. The families dependent on the industry both directly and indirectly is not well documented but could easily exceed a million. Since the water is a basic need in cultivation, processing, manufacturing and waste management the water footprint of the plantation industry has been a significant aspect in making decisions on the plantation economy.
Accordingly, the water footprint for different commodities and products of plantation crops has been calculated worldwide and well documented. This information could be of immense value to all stakeholders of the plantation industry today, since there is a debate on which crop consumes more water and hence whether such crops are suitable to be included in to the crop mix of the plantation industry in a country.
The concept of water footprint therefore provides more scientifically valid information for policy makers to take environmentally sound decisions on the development projects of the plantation industry which is still a vital industry in the Sri Lankan economy. Also, such information is of much use for each and every responsible citizen and organisation of the country that supports the development of the plantation sector to decide on sustainable development projects and to maximize community engagement in such projects through creating awareness with correct facts.
The green water component is the water received from precipitation that is stored in the root zone of the soil and evaporated, transpired or incorporated by the plants. When it is expressed in terms of cubic metres required for producing one metric ton of the crop produce, water use efficiency of the crop (i.e crop productivity per unit of water used) is also factored in to it.
Accordingly, among the different plantation crop produce, the green water component is lowest in Sugarcane and is followed by coconut, oil palm, tea and rubber. Hence the green water usage of 1,184 m3t on-1 for sugarcane is the lowest and this could be attributed to the fact that plant species having the C4 mechanism of photosynthesis for which the sugarcane belongs is much more efficient in water use than the plants with C3 mechanism of photosynthesis. Amongst the crops being discussed in this report the highest Green water footprint, i.e. soil water recharged by rain water, was shown by the natural rubber which is around 12,964 m3/ton. This is almost 300% higher when compared with crops like coconut and oil palm.
The government of Sri Lanka has taken a policy decision to plant 20,000 ha of oil palm as an import substitution strategy. If well managed this extent has the potential to produce 80,000 MT of palm oil annually. With a total water footprint of 4,970 cubic metres per metric ton the total water footprint for 80,000 MT will be 397.6 million cubic metres of water annually. A similar extent of natural rubber plantations has the potential to produce 50,000 MT of raw rubber. With a total water footprint of 13,747 cubic metres per metric ton of natural rubber the total water footprint for 50,000 MT will be 687.4 million cubic meters of water. Hence for similar land extents, the total water footprint is 173% higher in rubber when compared to oil palm.
The stakeholders of the entire plantation industry should make a concerted effort to adopt a more scientific approach towards the use of an invaluable natural resource like water more effectively and efficiently. Research and development can play a key role. Crop improvement for water use efficiency is one long term approach.
Genetic engineering to incorporate the gene responsible for the C4 photosynthetic pathway to all plantation crops would be the best ultimate solution though the progress of global research and development in this aspect is still slow. If such genetically modified plantation crops are cultivated in areas having favourable environments for them, e.g., the intermediate zone of the country, the crop water use will be less with no decline in production. In the short term we need to adopt new and correct technologies in management of plantations and in manufacturing industries.
Measuring water footprint and taking all the necessary steps to keep that level as low as possible is extremely important for mankind. This balance is urgently required because freshwater is vital to our daily life while the supply of freshwater is limited.
As the world population is growing, the need for fresh water is growing too. Experts predict that by 2030 the demand for global freshwater will exceed supply by 40 percent. And if we dont take measures to keep water footprint in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors at a low level, soon, we will be running short of drinking water.

What is the morally appropriate language
The following is Arundhati Roys W. G. Sebald Lecture on Literary Translation, commissioned by the British Centre for Literary Translation and the National Centre for Writing. It was delivered at the British Library on June 5, 2018.
At a book reading in Kolkata, about a week after my first novel, The God of Small Things, was published, a member of the audience stood up and asked, in a tone that was distinctly hostile: Has any writer ever written a masterpiece in an alien language In a language other than his mother tongue I hadnt claimed to have written a masterpiece (nor to be a he), but nevertheless I understood his anger toward a me, a writer who lived in India, wrote in English, and who had attracted an absurd amount of attention. My answer to his question made him even angrier.
Nabokov, I said. And he stormed out of the hall.
The correct answer to that question today would of course be algorithms. Artificial Intelligence, we are told, can write masterpieces in any language and translate them into masterpieces in other languages. As the era that we know, and think we vaguely understand, comes to a close, perhaps we, even the most privileged among us, are just a group of redundant humans gathered here with an arcane interest in language generated by fellow redundants.
English historian
Only a few weeks after the mother tongue/masterpiece incident, I was on a live radio show in London. The other guest was an English historian who, in reply to a question from the interviewer, composed a paean to British imperialism. Even you, he said, turning to me imperiously, the very fact that you write in English is a tribute to the British Empire. Not being used to radio shows at the time, I stayed quiet for a while, as a well-behaved, recently civilized savage should.
But then I sort of lost it, and said some extremely hurtful things. The historian was upset, and after the show told me that he had meant what he said as a compliment, because he loved my book. I asked him if he also felt that jazz, the blues, and all African-American writing and poetry were actually a tribute to slavery. And if all of Latin American literature was a tribute to Spanish and Portuguese colonialism.
Notwithstanding my anger, on both occasions my responses were defensive reactions, not adequate answers. Because those incidents touched on a range of incendiary questionscolonialism, nationalism, authenticity, elitism, nativism, caste, and cultural identityall jarring pressure points on the nervous system of any writer worth her salt. However, to reify language in the way both men had renders language speechless. When that happens, as it usually does in debates like these, what has actually been written ceases to matter. That was what I found so hard to countenance. And yet I knowI knewthat language is that most private and yet most public of things. The challenges thrown at me were fair and square. And obviously, since Im still talking about them, Im still thinking about them.
Many arms
The night of that reading in Kolkata, city of my estranged father and of Kali, Mother Goddess with the long red tongue and many arms, I fell to wondering what my mother tongue actually was. What wasisthe politically correct, culturally apposite, and morally appropriate language in which I ought to think and write It occurred to me that my mother was actually an alien, with fewer arms than Kali perhaps but many more tongues. English is certainly one of them.
My English has been widened and deepened by the rhythms and cadences of my alien mothers other tongues. (I say alien because theres not much that is organic about her. Her nation-shaped body was first violently assimilated and then violently dismembered by an imperial British quill. I also say alien because of the violence unleashed in her name on those who do not wish to belong to her (Kashmiris, for example), as well as on those who do (Indian Muslims and Dalits, for example), makes her an extremely un-motherly mother.
How many tongues does she have Officially, approximately 780, only twenty-two of which are formally recognized by the Indian Constitution, while another thirty-eight are waiting to be accorded that status. Each has its own history of colonizing or being colonized. There are few pure victims and pure perpetrators. There is no national language. Not yet. Hindi and English are designated official languages. According to the Constitution of India (which, we must note, was written in English), the use of English by the state for official purposes was supposed to cease by 26 January 1965, fifteen years after the constitution came into effect.

Worlds largest cheeseboard
The Dairy Farmers of Wisconsin assembled a cheese board with a 4,437-pound spread to break a Guinness World Record.
The group announced Guinness World Records has officially recognized the record for the worlds largest cheeseboard after the dairy farmers covered the custom-made board, measuring 35 feet long and 7 feet wide, with 4,437 pounds of cheese in 145 different varieties.
The event, which took over an entire street in Madison, included a visit from a Guinness adjudicator who certified that the cheese board was more than 1,000 pounds larger than the previous record-holder, which was assembled in Europe.
Some of the cheese was served to spectators, while some wheels were auctioned for charity and the rest were donated to the Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin. UPI
