Vehicle market to get stable
The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka and Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka summoning a joint press conference on Saturday welcomed the pledge made by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to waive the 10% vehicle re-export tax.
A section of vehicle importers who attended the meeting
The Finance Minister gave this assurance to vehicle importers when they met him on Saturday to discuss issues faces by the industry.
Sampath Merenchige President, Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka speaking to media at the press briefing held after meeting the Finance Minster said they appreciate very much the pledge given by Karunanayake to waive the 10% re-export levy.
Merenchige also said with the guarantee given by the Finance Minister that for two years he will not reduce taxes on vehicles and will maintain a static tax policy, the vehicle market will also get stable. He also said that the minister has promised that vehicle prices will not be increased in the next budget.
Used cars importers summoning a news briefing last month said they will restrict vehicle imports to the country. This was in the backdrop of the rupee exchange rate continuously depreciating and its negative effects hampering vehicle imports to the country.
Also in a communiqu issues recently the Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) alleged that despite meetings between the Finance Ministry, Customs, the CMTA, representing brand new franchise holders, and grey market importer associations, where feedback was called from all sides, the final decision on valuating vehicles was made by the Government behind closed doors and with neither the input nor the consent of importers.
Soon after the Budget 2016 was presented in Parliament by the Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, vehicle prices drastically increased as a result of import duties and taxes imposed on vehicle imports. In that context, the Budget had turned out to become a nightmare for those who were hoping to buy their own vehicle.

Philippines gets taste of Duterte anti-crime war
THE PHILIPPINES: Armed police are detaining crying children, bewildered drunks and shirtless men throughout the Philippine capital in a night-time blitz that is offering an authoritarian taste of life under incoming President Rodrigo Duterte.
The incendiary lawyer won last months elections in a landslide largely on a pledge to end or suppress what he said was rampant crime, warning the Philippines was in danger of becoming a narco-state and that tens of thousands of criminals would be killed in his crackdown.
Across the nation police have already reported killing more than 20 alleged drug suspects over the past fortnight, egged on by Duterte who has urged them to begin his war on crime even before he takes office at the end of this month. The efforts by police in Manila, a chaotic mega-city of more than 12 million people, to clean up the streets ahead of Duterte being sworn in casts a light on other controversial aspects of his law-and-order campaign.
Since winning, Duterte has said he will impose late-night bans on children walking the streets, alcohol sales and the national passion of karaoke singing -- insisting that his crackdown must start with the fundamentals of discipline in society.
Police in Manila, eager to burnish their tough-guy credentials for their new boss, have in recent weeks begun their own versions of such night-time curfews that have seen hundreds of people detained. - AFP

Sri Lanka 32 for no loss, chasing 362 to win
London, Sunday: Alex Hales again fell agonisingly short of a maiden Test hundred as England got the better of several close calls in the third Test against Sri Lanka at Lords on Sunday.
At tea on a rain-marred fourth day, England, 2-0 up in the three-match series, were 206 for six in their second innings.
That gave them a commanding lead of 334, with no side having made more to win in the fourth innings of a Test at Lords than the 344 for one posted by the West Indies against England in 1984 when opener Gordon Greenidge made a superb 214 not out.
This series had seen Hales come close to a century with scores of 86 and 83 in the first two Tests at Leeds and Chester-le-Street respectively.
The Nottinghamshire opener got closer still at Lords on Sunday with 94 before he was lbw to Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews shortly before tea.
England captain Alastair Cook was 32 not out and Moeen Ali nought not out at the interval.
After rain meant there was no play before lunch, England resumed on 109 for four, a lead of 237 runs.
Hales was 41 not out and nightwatchman Steven Finn six not out.
Hales had moved on to 45 when Sundays third ball saw him survive a confident lbw appeal from Sri Lanka paceman Shaminda Eranga.
Indian umpire S Ravi ruled in Haless favour but the Sri Lankans reviewed, only for a marginal umpires call verdict from the Decision Review System to spare the batsman.
Eranga did succeed in having Finn lbw for seven.
Finns exit brought in Cook who had been unable to open alongside Hales on Saturday after suffering a knee injury while fielding close in.
Nuwan Pradeep, who had taken three wickets on Saturday, knocked over Hales off-stump with a ball that kept low when the batsman was on 58.But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no-ball.
Replays suggested Pradeeps front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no-ball call by an umpire and Hales survived.
In February, a similar incident saw Australias Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no-ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth.
Cook, who made 85 in the first innings, had a let-off when on six he was lbw to left-arm spinner Rangana Herath but saw a review of Ravis decision go in his favour after DRS indicated the ball had pitched outside the line of off stump.
He came through another Herath lbw appeal on 11.
Sri Lanka opted against a review but replays suggested a challenge would have succeeded.
Hales drove Herath for six over long-on and next ball swept him for four.
Another swept four off Herath saw Hales into the 90s.
But six runs shy of aa hundred he was squared up and hit in front of his stumps by medium-pacer Mathews.
Hales reviewed Tuckers lbw verdict, more in hope than expectation, but the DRS umpires call ruling, which showed the ball clipping leg stump, had him trudging back to the pavilion.
The 27-year-old Hales, playing his seventh Test, faced 179 balls including 10 fours and a six.
Together with Cook, he put on 82 for the sixth wicket.
England declared after M. Ali was caught by Rangana Herath off Shaminda Eranga at 233/7.
Sri Lanka were 32 without loss, needing a further 330 runs to reach their victory target of 362, at stumps on the fourth day of the third Test against England at Lords on Sunday.
Dimuth Karunaratne was 19 not out and Kaushal Silva 12 not out.
Earlier, England captain Alastair Cook declared his sides second innings on 233 for seven.
Nottinghamshire opener Alex Hales made a Test-best 94 the third time this series he has made a fifty but not gone on to a hundred. England lead the three-match series 2-0.

Sri Lanka protest as wrong no-ball denies them wicket
Londres, Sunday: Sri Lanka complained to the match referee after an incorrect no-ball call denied them a wicket against England at Lords on Sunday with the tourists even using their national flag as a means of protest.
England opener Alex Hales had made 58 when he was bowled by a Nuwan Pradeep delivery that kept low during play on the fourth day of the third Test.
But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no-ball.
Replays suggested paceman Pradeeps front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no-ball call by an umpire and Hales survived.
When batsmen are dismissed, umpires in the middle can and do sometimes ask the TV official to check to see they havent missed a no-ball.
But under current International Cricket Council regulations, the third umpire is powerless to intervene in the type of situation that Sri Lanka and Tucker found themselves in on Sunday.
Sri Lanka team manager Charith Senanayake, a former Test opener, and coach Graham Ford approached match referee Andy Pycroft to register their unhappiness at Tuckers decision.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka flag was draped over the tourists dressing-room balcony for some 45 minutes in protest at the decision.
Flags traditionally fly above both dressing rooms at Lords and the flag on the balcony was eventually removed at the request of Marylebone Cricket Club, the owners of Lords.
Hales went on to make 94, with England, 2-0 up in the three-match series, 206 for six at tea -- a lead of 334 runs.
In February, a similar incident saw Australias Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no-ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth.
The ICCs cricket committee has called for a change in the regulations regarding the use of the Decision Review System to prevent such incidents occurring in future, but any alterations will need the approval of the global governing bodys full board.

Former England captain Donald Carr dead at 89
LONDON: Former England captain Donald Carr has died, at the age of 89, it was announced on Sunday.
The MCC flag at Lords, where England were playing Sri Lanka in the third Test, flew at half-mast as a mark of respect.
Carr played twice for England, once as captain, on the 1951/52 tour of India.
He made almost 20,000 first-class runs, in a 23-year career, was Derbyshire captain between 1955 and 1962 and a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1960.
But Carr became better known as a cricket administrator, serving as secretary of the Test and County Cricket Board  the forerunner of the current England and Wales Cricket Board.
Carr was also an assistant secretary of MCC, managed three England overseas tours and later became an International Cricket Council match referee.
Paying tribute to Carr, ECB chairman Colin Graves said: Cricket has lost one of its greatest friends; someone who gave a lifetime of service to our game; as a cricketer, a captain, a club secretary, an England tour manager, and, of course, as a senior administrator  serving MCC and the TCCB with distinction in a leadership role as the game moved into the modern, professional era; and always meeting the many difficult challenges he faced during this period with his customary good humour and charm. He will be hugely missed by those who worked and played with him, and we send our condolences and sympathies to all in the Carr family. AFP

Anderson reprimanded for breaching ICC Code of Conduct
England fast bowler James Anderson has received an official reprimand for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the third days play in the Lords Test against Sri Lanka on Saturday.
The 33-year-old was found to be in violation of Level 1 Article 2.1.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel which relates to conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game.
The incident happened during Sri Lankas first innings when Anderson showed disrespect to S. Ravi after the umpire had reminded the fast bowler not to verbally engage with Sri Lankan batsman Rangana Herath.
Anderson admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Andy Pycroft of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees. As such, there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charge had been laid by the on-field umpires S.Ravi and Rod Tucker, as well as third umpire Aleem Dar and fourth umpire Michael Gough.
All Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of a warning/reprimand and/or the imposition of a fine of up to 50 per cent of the applicable match fee.

Flag protest fires up Sri Lanka in Lords no-ball row

Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford called for all no-ball decisions to be taken by the third umpire as his side reacted to an incorrect call in the third Test against England with an extraordinary flag protest at Lords on Sunday.
At stumps, Sri Lanka were 32 without loss in their second innings, needing a further 330 runs on Mondays fifth and final day to reach an imposing victory target of 362.
More realistically, their goal was to prevent England, already 2-0 up in the three-match series, taking the 10 wickets they needed to complete a whitewash.
But England captain Alastair Cook, 49 not out batting down the order after a knee injury suffered while fielding, may not have been able to declare his sides second innings on 233 for seven had a few close calls Sunday gone Sri Lankas way instead.
Significantly, Sri Lanka thought they had Alex Hales -- who went on to make 94 -- out for 58 when he was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep. But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no-ball. Replays suggested Pradeeps front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no-ball call by an umpire and Hales survived.
In February, a similar incident saw Australias Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no-ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth.
Under International Cricket Council regulations, the third umpire is powerless to intervene in such situations.
There are proposals on the table to prevent a repeat of these types of incidents and Ford said: "The ICC have to look at it.
"It seems strange with the technology available that you can still get a line call wrong," the South African added.
"The best solution is for the umpires to worry about whats happening down the other end and let technology look after the line call. "The game has a funny way of kicking you when you are down. That was a kick we didnt need."
The Sri Lanka management reacted to Haless reprieve by draping the national over the tourists dressing-room balcony for some 45 minutes.
Ford said this wasnt so much a protest as a gesture of solidarity with the players out on the middle.
"At that stage we felt the boys were fighting hard and we wanted to show our support from the dressing room to boost their morale --only for us to find out thats not the done thing and we had to take it down," said Ford.
He added that Tucker had apologised to Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for his mistake.
"He got the news from the third umpire and he apologised to Angelo. It was very good of him to have done that and we move on."
Hales, for all his good fortune Sunday, was still left waiting for a maiden Test hundred.
The Nottinghamshire opener, out for 86 and 83 in the first two Tests, got closer still on Sunday before he was lbw to medium-pacer Mathews.
Somewhat ironically, in view of Sri Lankas earlier protest, Hales sought a review of the decision only for DRS to find in the tourists favour on this occasion.
"Its disappointing again to come so close," said Hales, whose 126-ball innings included 10 fours and a six.
"But it was pretty decent delivery and I had my fair share of luck -- bowled off a no-ball, umpires calls and edges -- I guess the luck ran out."
