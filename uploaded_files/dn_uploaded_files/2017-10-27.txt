Attempts to appoint Batticaloa GA through backdoor
The Batticoloa Government Agent (GA) post has been vacant for a month and an additional GA was not appointed for the last one year.
The Home Affairs Ministry Secretary had taken steps to appoint a GA through the backdoor ignoring the accepted procedure, the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) in a press release alleged yesterday.
The release signed by CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Tennekoon said politicians and civil organisation had relentlessly requested authorities to appoint a suitable person for the post. Instead of following a systematic procedure, 19 persons from a list obtained by the Ministry from politicians were summoned for interviews from time to time via telephone calls.
This showed that attempts were being made to appoint a person outside the accepted interviews process. Batticoloa district produced the largest number of suicide bombers during the ethnic war mainly due to its backward socio-economic factors.
Although housing and other mass-scale development projects were initiated in Batticoloa, the district was long suffering without a systematic administrative machinery and human resources shortage.
If the Ministry appoints a GA without following good governance principle, the entire Province will suffer, the press release said.

CASA on enhancing seafarer contribution
The government of Sri Lanka deposited the instrument of ratification of the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 (MLC 2006) with the International Labour Office (ILO) in January 2017, becoming the 81st ILO member state and the 16th Asian state to have ratified the Convention.
The MLC 2006 will enter into force for Sri Lanka on January 12, 2018. Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha, who deposited the instrument of ratification, said Sri Lanka looked forward to working closely with the ILO for capacity building and training in labour standards and labour inspection.
This ratification is all the more timely as it will allow Sri Lanka to improve labour conditions for its more than 22,000 seafarers and ensure that ships calling at its ports are inspected in compliance with the requirements of the Convention, thereby promoting quality shipping and providing additional protection for seafarers transiting within its waters.
Contribution of seafarers to the economy
In 2015 seafarers have contributed over $200 million per annum to the economy. Seafarers attract a higher income than any other Sri Lankan expatriate staff in the same level. For example when a domestic aid brings in a monthly income of close to $300, a seafarer at entry level would attract a monthly income close to $1000.
At the rank of Officer and Captain the salary scale is significantly higher. Therefore, by promoting Sri Lanka as a hub for seafarer recruitment the economy can expect a higher contribution. Foreign exchange earnings, employment opportunities and increased domestic spending would have a profound impact to the Sri Lankan economy.
Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents (CASA) has played a leading role, through its members, by engaging in training and development of seafarers, making them employable, and finding them employment opportunities.
Global outlook
The demand for seafarers will keep growing over the next 10 years with the growth of global trade. Expansion of the Panama Canal has also resulted in a demand for larger vessels which results in an increase in the demand for seafarers. China, Philippines, Indonesia, Russia and Ukraine are among the top 5 countries who train and supply seafarers (source: Manpower Report 2015 - BIMCO).
However, there is a shortage of marine officers in the world and the shortage is expected to increase over time. The forecasted shortage of officers will grow from 16,500 in 2015 to 147,500 by 2025 (refer figure 1).
The role of a seafarer has also changed over time. The adjustment in working practices from the command and control system at sea to the more collaborative management style and the technological disruptions in the maritime sector would require the seafarer to be equipped with a different skill-set.
For example, with the introduction of autonomous ships, ship navigation can happen ashore and will change the dynamics of the profession.
Seafarer training in Sri Lanka  opportunities and challenges
Sri Lankan employees are hailed globally for their work ethic and overall conduct, and therefore, Sri Lanka is preferred for talent sourcing.
This is mainly due to the sound education system in the country, which promotes equal opportunity for education, and our unique culture, which has moulded work ethics such as team work, reliability, dedication, honesty and integrity. This quality workforce is the greatest asset that should be capitalised by Sri Lanka.
CASA member institutes engage in training and development of seafarers while complying with the standards of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and therefore, is recognized internationally.
These institutes are equipped with state of the art technologies such as marine simulators and the qualifications are regulated by the Merchant Shipping Secretariat of Sri Lanka.
The government on the other hand is aggressively working on a shipping policy which will bring in consistent procedures for seafarer training. The government plays an active role in facilitation and enhancement of employment opportunities in foreign ships for Sri Lankan seafarers and ensures their safety. With the ratification of the Maritime Labour Convention, the government will have to be committed to improving labour conditions for Sri Lankan seafarers.
As we are competing globally to promote the Sri Lankan seafarer, it is noteworthy to look at some success stories. The Philippines government has passed new regulations to protect seafarers (Anti-Ambulance Chasing Act) and has gone to the extent of providing scholarships, housing and provident benefits to them.
They have also established a one-stop centre to expedite the processing of employment documents. These initiatives have helped the Philippines to retain its position among the top 5 countries who train and supply seafarers to the world.
It is important that consistency in policy is maintained by the government, as regular changes to syllabi, assessments, taxation etc. will adversely affect seafarer training. Duration of seafarer training is relatively longer, and therefore, abrupt policy changes will not help the industry.
Regular consultation with all stakeholders including ship owners, institutes and unions will help Sri Lanka create a competitive edge in seafarer training and development. Building awareness among Sri Lankans about this lucrative occupation at school level would also attract a wider audience and enhance the economic contribution to the country.

Ekeeya for Unitary recommended
A proposal has been made to the Government to include the word Ekeeya found in the Sinhala version of the new constitution in its English translation as well.
The English term 'Unitary State' used for Ekeeya Rajyaya has been found to be a weak term internationally.
Advisors formulating the new constitution have studied the term Unitary State in depth during the past week after taking into account the crisis in the Catalonia State in Spain.
They have pointed out that the word Ekeeya is very strong and it accurately interpreted the country's sovereignty which never allow a division of the country. They have also pointed out that the word unitary state mentioned in section 1 and 2 of the Steering Committee Interim Report English translation is also a very weak interpretation.

Officials in tender committees delay  awarding tenders for energy projects
The estimated loss of the Ceylon Electricity Board for the first six months of 2017 is reported to be Rs 30 billion and the CEBs debts to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was reported as Rs 40 billion for the first nine months of 2017, said Dr Harsha de Silva, Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs.
What that means is that someone has to pay these losses, asserted the minister making the keynote speech at the Energizing the Nation Framework for Energy Security Energy Forum 2017. He said there were delays in awarding tenders for energy projects and it was not the governments fault but because the officials who were appointed to sit in theses tender committees were absconding and not sitting in them and approving the projects. He said it was just like the CEB was not present at the forum held yesterday to discuss those matters.
Minister Dr De Silva expressing disappointment over the non presence of the CEB at the energy forum said the CEB must play a meaningful role in this national discussion and there was no room for the CEB not being a part of a forum of this nature. The current energy situation in the country cannot be called bad but it is not good. It is not a crisis but if we continue without action it will become a crisis. It is not a binding constraint but if we dont deliver it will become a binding constraint and cost tremendous disruptions, he said.

## Title: Time to change Sri Lankas ports business model

Time to change Sri Lankas ports business model
The dynamics of global ports and port management have changed in many ways since the beginning of the century. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority was constituted under the provisions of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act, No. 51 of 1979 (subsequently amended by Act No. 7 of 1984 and Act No. 35 of 1984) on the 1st of August 1979, effecting the merger of the Colombo Port Commission Department and the two existing statutory corporations.
This resulted in a unified organization with a streamlined structure to create an organization that would over look overall port activities of Sri Lanka as the economy was opened.
The visionary leadership was given by of late Minister Lalith Athulathmudali under the leadership of late President J.R. Jayewardene who took up the challenge to open the economy of Sri Lanka in 1977. Sri Lanka was the first country to do so in South Asia among many challenges 40 years ago.
The Minister of Shipping at that time was fast enough to recognize and to develop the shipping sector that would be an essential tool for a competitive open economy, which would also support exports and FDI to a strategically located island in the Indian Ocean. The Colombo port being the first container port in South Asia and a leading transshipment port in the world today has its success story well rooted behind these two courageous men who saw the need for transformation forty years ago in difficult circumstances. Since then, the framework for advancement has been lethargic, add-hoc except for partial liberalizing of the shipping sector in the early90s and opening for PPPs in terminals in the new century.
However, the country has failed to become a major maritime hub, but remains as a transshipment Centre due to the location factor. The speed of legal and business model reforms has been very slow and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, compared to its global competitors has gone behind in many ways and years as a business entity.
World of shipping has changed
The last forty years has seen a huge transformation in the shipping industry as world trade has increased many folds accounting to USD 50 trillion by 2016, out of which exports constitutes USD 20 trillion. The container shipping industry has been the fastest in transformation from being 250 TEU vessels passing the 20,000 TEU vessel size and has remodeled the ports industry with new opportunities and challenges.
The often spoken about Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) and DP World Group of Dubai which emerged much later than SLPA along with other major port operators have moved forward leaps and bounds ahead in terms of modelling themselves as global port operators. Unfortunately, the SLPA was never transformed to be a global port operator although it had the skills, knowledge and the ability to do so. Instead it became a party that had to share its own business in a very minority stake in the operations of containers terminals in Sri Lanka and the current model it operates is further diminishing its competitiveness.
Singapore port handles 33 million TEUs annually with its terminal operating partners in Singapore. However, PSA has invested in many global ports and handles over 39 million TEUs through its expertise in other global ports and terminals. Similar is the story with other major port operators. Many would not know, that even Philippines, through international container terminal services incorporated has over 27 destinations managing global container traffic to capture offshore business.
SLPA has missed the bus and is struggling now to compete even though as early as year 2000, former Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel, when he was the shipping minister took the decision to corporatize JCT with the industry advise to make it a viable terminal operator. This was done for name sake in 2003 without any teeth to move forward, and was never pursued as a proper business model by governments that followed.
Now that Sri Lanka has three major port development projects, namely Colombo Hambantota and Trincomallee, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority must be re-designed and re-engineered to the benefit of the country where already partial landlord model has been established due to circumstances the sector has fallen into. The SLPA cannot be a regulator, operator and the landlord at the same time. That will only further delay the maritime aspirations of this country. Sri Lanka doesnt have to re-invent the wheel, but our East Asian neighbour, Singapore has already created a conducive model which we can follow and adopted to facilitate the maritime economy of Sri Lanka. Nobody needs to have ego to follow a good model like the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore as we need major set of reforms legally and structurally both for the Merchant Shipping Division and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority to take this country to the next level of shipping, ports and logistics.
The focus is needed from Prime Minister as the Minister in charge of Policy and Economic Affairs and a dedicated support from Minister of Ports and Shipping and The Presidents newly formed National Economic Council to make a commitment to do the challenging changes. It is no better time as the Sri Lanka Ports Authority has embarked on a national maritime and a logistics policy for the country. Country requires to be put on a new footing to achieve the growth and investment targets recently announced 2025 vision of the government.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) returned to the US dollar bond market with the pricing of a $1.5 billion 10-year global benchmark bond issue, proceeds of which will be part of ADBs ordinary capital resources.
This strong outing with broad sponsorship from investors globally, which allowed us to simultaneously tighten the pricing of the transaction relative to the initial guidance and upsize to $1.5 billion, highlights the esteem for ADBs credit and mission, said ADB Treasurer Pierre Van Peteghem.
The 10-year bond, with a coupon rate of 2.50% per annum payable semi-annually and a maturity date of 2 November 2027, was priced at 2.595% to yield 19.55 basis points over the 2.25% US Treasury notes due August 2027.
The transaction was lead-managed by Citi, Daiwa Securities, HSBC, and J.P. Morgan. A syndicate group was also formed consisting of DBS, Deutsche Bank, ING, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, and RBC.

Ah Taj..!
Love transcends religion, caste and other manmade barriers! Much prose and an equal number of lines of poetry have sprung from the hearts of writers and lovers expressing this emotion called love! But, the greatest symbol of love is the Taj Mahal in Agra! Millions fly across the ocean, to gaze in awe at the magnificent structure a grief-stricken ruler built for his beloved dead wife. The moonlight glaze, the marble sheen, the minarets all speak of an eternal love, that lives on through this spectacular structure, But,
In the Indian state where the Taj stands, a bachelor Chief Minister discovers a sentiment, which in his mind is greater than love, The Taj, he says, should remind us of thousands of laborers who built it!
He sees not love. He feels not grief, but hears the sound of pickaxes on stone, craftsmen on marble, and the monument in his mind is dedicated to those workers.
Not to love.
Sir, says a local as a foreign couple get their picture shot with the Taj in the background, What do you feel as you stand over here
Love! says the tourist, A love I would strive night and day to ignite into our relationship!
Sir, but this is about Kishorebhaithe mason!
Whos that asks the tourist, as his eyes and those of his wife gleam with love for each other.
Kishorebhai, was the one who worked under Prakashbhai!Kishorebhai carried the stones to Prakashbhai, and Prakashbhai cut them into blocks, which Kishorebhai carried back and laid as the foundation!
Very good! says the foreigner as he asks someone to take another picture of his wife and him, hugging.
And sir, those tombs you saw inside..
Ah, we cried to see those graves of Shah Jahan and his wife, together even in death!
Was made by Kishorebhais brother! continued the local, In fact Prakashbhai it is rumoured also had his brother-in-law working with Kishorebhais brother on the tombs!
Oh really! said the foreigner as he disengaged himself from the loving embrace of his wife and they both looked adoringly at the Taj. Beautiful! whispered his wife, Will your love for me be like this!
I wish I could pluck a flower from these gardens and give you my beloved!
Ah sir, meet Harishbhai, the gardener! says the local, It is his gardening labour, you have come to see isnt it
The tourist and his wife walk arm in arm towards the edifice of love. They do not see masons, nor hear artisans, but only what true love is. A love which they feel is available for every couple, and whos expression in its majestic awesomeness is found in the Taj.
Did you tell them about Kishorebhai and Prakashbhai asksthe locals wife to him that night.
But they were only interested in love! he sighed wearily. Somebody should tell the Indian Chief Minister that..!

Arrest warrant issued for Nawaz Sharif
PAKISTAN: A Pakistani court on Thursday issued arrest warrants for ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in two cases of corruption spiralling from the Panama Papers leak, his lawyers said.
Sharif is currently in London with his wife Kalsum as she undergoes cancer treatment, and has not returned to Pakistan since he was indicted in the corruption allegations earlier this month, despite reports he would do so.
The accountability court issued bailable warrants for the former prime minister in two cases of alleged corruption today and adjourned (the) hearing until November 3, one of his defence lawyers, Zafir Khan told AFP. In late July the Supreme Court sacked Sharif following an investigation into corruption allegations against his family, making him the 15th Premier in Pakistans 70-year history to be ousted before completing a full term.
The claims against the Prime Minister stemmed from the Panama Papers leak last year, which sparked a media frenzy over the luxurious lifestyles and high-end London property portfolio owned by his family.
Sharifs eponymous ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has doggedly stuck behind their leader, but as the legal pressure builds cracks are beginning to appear in their unity ahead of general elections due to be held sometime next year.
Federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination Riaz Pirzada became the most high profile voice of dissent to speak out publicly last week when he called for Sharifs younger brother, Punjab provincial chief minister Shahbaz Sharif, to take over the party leadership.
We dont object to Nawazs leadership but we are concerned how the party will win the next elections, Pirzada said as he repeated his call this week to Pakistans Geo News.
The Supreme Courts ruling also banned Nawaz Sharif from political office. In the days after his ouster he swiftly named a replacement, current Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, and designated Shahbaz his eventual successor.
However there has been no move towards securing a federal seat for the provincial minister, which would then open up elections for the leadership of Punjab, the Sharif dynastys powerbase.
Instead Sharif fielded his cancer-stricken wife Kalsum in a by-election to fill his old seat in Lahore in September.
She won the vote, seen as a key test of the PML-Ns popularity after Sharifs ousting and ahead of the general election, but the partys soul-searching continues as it seeks a way forward. There is a very visible split in the party, which has clearly been divided into two groups behind each brother, political analyst Rasul Bukhsh Raees told AFP.
Nawaz Sharif has faced -- and come back from -- similar challenges in the past. In 1993 he was sacked from his first term as premier for corruption, while in 1999 he was sentenced to life in prison after his second term in office ended with a military putsch.
Following the coup he was allowed to go into exile in Saudi Arabia, returning in 2007 before becoming prime minister for a third time in 2013. - AFP

Barnaby Joyce: Australia deputy PM disqualified from office

Australian Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce and four other politicians were wrongly elected because they held dual citizenship, a court has ruled.
The High Court of Australia decision means three of the politicians, including Joyce, are disqualified from office. The others quit in July.
Australia's constitution prohibits dual citizens from being elected.
Joyce's exit strips the government of its one-seat majority, but he could return through a by-election.
The deputy prime minister, who renounced New Zealand citizenship in August, has pledged to re-contest his lower house seat.
"I respect the verdict of the court," Joyce said immediately after the verdict.
"We live in a marvellous democracy, with all the checks and balances they have given us all the freedoms we see. I thank the court [for] their deliberations."
The other four politicians - Fiona Nash, Malcolm Roberts, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam - had been elected to the Senate.
Another two politicians under scrutiny, senators Matt Canavan and Nick Xenophon, were ruled to have been validly elected.
The dual citizenship saga has captivated Australian politics since July, prompting dozens of MPs to publicly clarify their status.
What did the politicians argue
During three days of hearings,the government told the courtthat only Roberts and Ludlam should be disqualified,arguing the others did not know about their dual citizenship when they were elected last year.
Roberts claimed he had tried to revoke his citizenship. Ludlam and Waters,the only MPs to resign over the saga, did not offer a defence - arguing all seven should be ineligible.
What did the court say
The seven-judge bench deliberated for two weeks before ruling that five politicians were ineligible as a "subject or citizen of a foreign power", under to the constitution'ssection 44(i).
The court ruled that Canavan and Xenophon were not dual citizens, according to the constitutional definition.
The court was not satisfied that Canavan had attained Italian citizenship through descent, while Xenophon's class of inherited UK citizenship did not give him full rights and privileges.
What does it mean for the government
With Joyce disqualified, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's numbers slip to 75 in the 150-seat House of Representatives - meaning he is now overseeing a minority government.
However, Turnbull could regain his 76-seat majority if Joyce wins the by-election on 2 December. Joyce is eligible to run now he is a citizen of Australia alone.
Under a minority government, Turnbull will require support from independent MPs and minor parties to pass legislation in the lower house.
He has also reshuffled his cabinet because both Joyce and Nash held ministerial portfolios.

B:Hip Global launched in Sri Lanka
B:Hip Global, a health and wellness brand developed and produced in the United States, launched in Sri Lanka. B:Hip Global's arrival to Sri Lanka makes it the 41st country in which the products, including gender-specific energy supplements made in the United States and cosmetics and skincare products made in Scandinavia, will be distributed.
Allan Nielsen, a former footballer from Denmark and the CEO of B:Hip Global's Middle East and South Asia region, inaugurated the launch at the Movenpick Hotel alongside Nishan Herath, the company's Sri Lankan representative. The products range in price from USD $20 to $70 and are supposedly made of all-natural, organic ingredients.
However, little time was spent discussing the actual products, which Nielsen admitted might not be the world's best, but are very good. Instead, it was the brand's model of network marketing, also known as multi-level marketing, which Nielsen spent most of his introduction emphasizing.
Advertised to people who are looking for part-time or flexible work, network marketing is a business model which requires a distributor network and in which payouts occur at more than one level. For B:Hip Global, this means recruiting local product distributors, or ambassadors, rather than traditional retail outlets to market and sell the products, with the marketers making commission for each sale.
In his pitch, Nielsen espoused countless empowering if overly general platitudes to explain why such distributors or ambassadors would want to work with B:Hip. In doing so, he presented working for B:Hip as the solution to a person's professional and personal, woes.
B:Hip is a global online system. You can build your own business, have your own organization, work from where you want, with whom you want, as much as you want. Which is to say, be your own boss.
Nielsen added, We try to open up people's minds and tell them there is another way, you can have it. You are good enough, you are strong enough. We make people see. We show them, you can have it all.
Yet when pressed, no statistics were presented to evidence the average a B:Fit ambassador makes, nor ones that would confirm whether or not the switch from active work, such as a regular, office-based job, to passive work, which Nielsen categorizes the B:Fit ambassadorships as, is beneficial for most people in the long-term.
In response to these queries, Nielsen reiterated that the network marketing and direct selling industry is not for everyone.

Bimputh Finance joins LankaPay Common ATM Network
Bimputh Finance in a move towards enhancing customer convenience, recently joined LankaPay Common ATM Switch. Established in 2007 as a licensed non-banking financial institution that operates with the prime objective of uplifting the living standard of marginalized communities by providing them with affordable access to financial services, Bimputh Finance have come to a firm footing with 19 branches and 31 service centres offering services to customers, mainly micro, small and medium entrepreneurs in Ampara, Jaffna, Monaragala, Puttlam, Kalutara, Gampaha, Batticoloa, Badulla, Hambantota and Colombo Districts.
The partnership with LankaPay Common ATM Network brings in synergies that provide unparalleled convenience to Bimputh Finance customers by providing them with the ability to access their accounts from over 4,000 ATMs islandwide.
Chamindra Gamage, Deputy Chairman of Bimputh Finance stated, Bimputh Finance is very excited to join the LankaPay network as it gives our clients access to much needed reach and convenience. Although we have over 50 physical branches and service centers islandwide, we have embarked on many new initiatives which will provide unparalleled digital services to our clients.
As one of the few finance companies providing access to LankaPays ATM network, we are committed towards enhancing our customers experience and are delighted that our customers can now use their debit cards at any ATM connected to the LankaPay network to avail cash withdrawals.
While congratulating Bimputh Finance for coming onboard as the latest member of LankaPay Common ATM Network, Channa de Silva, GM/CEO of LankaClear stated, Partnering with Bimputh Finance, a non-banking financial institute that has shown commitment in providing access to much needed finances for customers of all walks of life, is an important milestone in our journey towards empowering every Sri Lankan with faster, convenient, secure and affordable payment options. Over the past four years, our network has grown to connect 99.5% of the total number of ATMs in the country, thereby enabling customers of any member bank to, literally, access their account from any ATM in the country irrespective of their bank. By providing a common platform and a network, we are creating a level playing field for all financial institutions irrespective of their size or the financial prowess they possess whilst optimizing the resource utilization.
The Common ATM Switch is the first phase of the LankaPay Common Card and Payment Switch, which is envisioned to be the backbone of all domestic electronic payments in future.
The launch of LankaPay Common ATM Network in 2013 marked a significant milestone in the countrys banking sector through common usage of resources generating greater economies of scale whilst enhancing customer convenience. Consequently the transaction cost to the banks and customers have come down drastically by almost 10 fold, saving the country billions of foreign exchange that would have otherwise drained out of the country.

Cancer awareness among public is low: Kassim
Sri Lankan people's response towards cancer prevention, early detection, awareness etc is very poor. Once a cancer awareness raising programme was held at a village in Ampara and only 15 persons attended it. Around 35,000 people live in that village, Deputy Health Minister Fizal Kassim said.
According to the Deputy Minister, among those 35,000 villagers, at least 10,000 can be women, but the response of them towards the cancer awareness programme was very low. He was addressing a ceremony held at the National blood Transfusion Centre on Tuesday to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month (October).
Deputy Minister Kassim pointed out that the people's ignorance is very pathetic. People are not interested in obtaining various valuable services offered to them by the government free of charge. Early detection saves lives. But people come for treatment with cancer in later stages. this is because of their ignorance.
"Unlike in the past, now modern medical treatment is available for cancer and the limit allocated by the Government for cancer treatment drugs for patients has been lifted now by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. Unlimited funds are offered by the government for cancer patients now. Earlier the maximum limit was Rs. 1.5 million," he added.

CID Sleuths trailing Anika's complaint - IGP
Police yesterday refuted media reports that two Ministers have forced the IGP to halt CID investigations into the purported death threats on Anika Wijesuriya, a witness in the Treasury Bond Commission.

New education system vital for rapid development
As a principal and a parent, I fully agree with the statement of Special Assignments Minister Dr Sarath Amunugama. He reiterated that the current unemployment crisis is due to the improper educational system. Although we speak highly of a 93 percent literacy rate, in comparison the dividend we get from education is almost the lowest where we release 90 percent of unemployed youth from schools and universities. This has been an alarming scenario witnessed though all the governments tried their best to make unemployed the employed. It is a severe burden to the countrys growing economy.
The prevailing education system keeps the youth from getting sustainable jobs when they leave schools or universities. Since Independence, Sri Lanka hasnt made the educational system conducive. It continues as a textbook oriented education system from the primary to the secondary. The schoolchildren carry a big bag of books and they are compelled to confine to the classrooms listening to the monotonous lectures. The students are not made to practical learning where they can find a vocation after leaving school. Even after learning science, a science student cannot change a bulb at home or fix a switch or a plug when it is needed. That is the sad situation of our educational system.
Every year nearly 47 percent of the students manage to pass the GCE O/L examination and the rest discarded to the streets and venture as tuk-tuk drivers, restaurant waiters, boutique salesmen and unskilled workers abroad. In Advanced Level too only about 42 percent pass and 15 percent are admitted to the universities. After the graduation, quite a number of students become jobless as they depend on Government employment which is limited. They are unable to find employment even in private sector since most of them lack English knowledge.
As the minister stressed, there should be a new system of education to produce youths who fit into the countrys development process.
I request the Education Minister to formulate a new educational system immediately to cater to the present needs of the country where youths could be involved in the countrys development work rather than producing white-collar workers who would confine to offices killing the precious time and money.

Clarification
Attorney-at-Law Shanika Abeywickrama in a letter to the Daily News clarified the news item titled Illegally Obtaining Electricity-Case Against Former LITRO GAS Chairman, carried on the October 17, 2017 Daily News issue.
The letter: I write on the instructions of my client Mr. Shalila Moonasinghe of Etulkotte. I am instructed that the aforesaid heading in the said article is defamatory per se and by innuendo and I am instructed that the said heading in the said article which attempt to portrait through the heading is absolutely false and distortion of the truth. The electricity meter fixed at the premises at No.941/12B, 6th Lane Ethulkotte had been faulty on many instances and therefore many complaints were made to LECO by my client, the tenants that occupied the said premises and also the meter reader.
First of such complaints was in the year 2010 by the tent of my client, who was occupying the said premises in the year 2009 and 2010 and responding to above complaint, the technicians of LECO had examined the said meter and even a test meter had been fixed consequent to the said inspection.
Thereafter, in November 2013, the Meter Reader and my client both made complaints regarding a fault in the meter.
Responding to the above complaints, a team of technicians of LECO had visited the said premises and the said technicians after an examination of the said meter had been of the view that the said meter is in order.
However, my client and the meter reader had not been satisfied with the said finding since the meter had been functioning properly and therefore further complaints had been made my client and the meter reader regarding the meter and the bills. Therefore, another team of technicians have visited the said premises in February 2014 and thereafter examining the meter had alleged that my client has tempered with the wiring of the meter but the documents issued by both the teams of technicians that visited the said premises in November 2013 and February 2014 clearly indicate that the seal of LECO in the said meter are intact. Despite the above, LECO together with the Welikada police proceeded to institute action in the Magistrates court of Colombo against my client is contesting as he has done no wrong and is in possession of evidence to prove that the allegations are false.

CPC eyes strategic projects to cater to future demand, cut costs
While seeking the governments intervention to support several upcoming mega projects earmarked by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Chairman Dammika Ranatunga underscored the need to take proactive policy initiatives to take the CPC towards a pathway to progress, at a press conference at the Hilton Colombo yesterday.
The CPC has currently undertaken a plethora of strategic plans which include infrastructure modernizations and expansion, aviation industry supply expansion, islandwide storage and distribution enhancement, overall sourcing and service improvements, etc.
Sharing insights into these strategic projects, Chairman Ranatunga stressed that most of the projects earmarked by CPC will be undertaken with internal financing and the CPC is seeking the governments support through budgetary allocations only to finance some of the mega projects.
To this end, CPC has held discussions with the Finance Ministry to take these projects forward in a speedy manner. According to Ranatunga, the CPC is waiting for a positive response from the Finance Ministry in this regard.If we can expedite these projects with the necessary financing, we will be able to improve our financial performance and hope for a better future.
The CPC has accrued financial losses amounting to billions of rupees due to fuel concessions afforded to the country in the midst of increased fuel import costs, rupee fluctuations and non-payment of monies due to it from state-owned enterprises.
Despite these impediments, the CPC is taking aggressive steps to increase profitability, productivity and savings in the immediate future.
The resulting profitability and its benefits in the short and long-term will be passed on to the public.
Giving a bleak picture of the CPCs financial position, Chairman Ranatunga stated that non-payment of dues by the state-owned institutions exceeded Rs 60 billion.
The CPC currently owes a thumping amount to two state banks and the main cause, according to Ranatuga, is that the CPC sells all the products at a cost lower than the import price.
Under this circumstance, the CPC is currently paying a massive monthly interest for these loans. The foregone revenue due to price concessions the CPC has to offer currently stands at Rs 68 billion for the first nine months of 2017.
Furthermore, Ranatunga stated that the CPC has not made a formal request similar to the request made by Lanka IOC to increase the price of fuel and the current policy of the CPC is to manage the expenditure without passing the burden onto consumers.

Sapugaskanda refinery capacity to be expanded
Disclosing future plans in relation to the Sapugaskanda refinery, CPC announced that in order to meet the growing demand for fuel in coming years, existing capacity at the refinery will be expanded and the proposed project will result in the CPC saving US$ 400 million per annum.
The cost of the expansion will be US$ 2.3 billion and it would also enable the refinery to supply 100% of the national requirement by 2025 - approximately 120,000 barrels per day.
According to the CPC, the capacity can be increased to 140,000 barrels per day, depending on the changes to demand that may arise in the future.
Also, upon the completion of the new terminal at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), CPC intends to install a state-of-the-art fuel hydrant system to supply fuel to planes that are parked there.
It is expected that the proposed projects will increase efficiency, enabling one aircraft to be served in a much shorter time and expanding capacity at the BIA.
With these initiatives, the CPC intends to uplift the current international rating of the BIA refueling terminal issued by the Joint Inspection Group (JIG) from Good to an Excellent rating.

Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Mustapha said that a decision to request to establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu will be taken only after having discussions with all relevant political parties in that area.
All political parties should agree unanimously to make a change, said the Minister addressing the media today at the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government.
People have been demanding for a separate Pradeshiya sabha in Sainthamaruthu, from the Kalmunai Municipal Council area since 1988.
However, it gained momentum only after Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe promised during his election campaign that he would declare Sainthamaruthu Pradeshiya Sabha on the request of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauf Hakeem.
Minister Mustapha said that the Prime Minister is still with stance to establish a Pradeshiya sabha in Sainthamaruthu and added that there are issues to declare as there are suggestions to divide the Kalmunai Municipal Council into four Pradeshiya Sabhas.
"Therefore, a final decision pertaining to declaring Samithamaruthu Pradeshiya Sabha cannot be taken without the consent of all political parties in that area," he said.

Defence Ministry seeks Australian expertise to prepare viable defence policy
The Ministry of Defence has sort Australian expertise in preparing its own white paper and viable defence policy.
The creation of a viable defence policy would allow us to make an appraisal of the security environment we live in and adapt our military capabilities in proportion to what is required, said Chairman of the Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) and the Secretary of Defence, Kapila Waidyaratne addressing a workshop held from October 23-25 in collaboration with the Australian High Commission at the INSSSL premises.
The Acting Australian High Commissioner, Tim Huggins, former Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis J.L. Sinniah, Chief of National Intelligence  DIG (Retd.) Sisra Mendis, senior Sri Lankan military officials and senior staff from the Ministry of Defence participate in the event.
The workshop was conducted by an Australian team comprising both senior military and civilian officials, led by - Commodore Aaron James Ingram, Captain Guy Blackburn, Ryan Buchanan, Ben Carroll and Australian Defence Attach Captain Jason Sears. The team had previously worked on the Australian Defence White Paper of 2016 and brought it to fruition in the Australian Parliament. Their aim was to impart the Australian knowledge and experience to the Sri Lanka defence establishment.
An effective defence policy would enable Sri Lanka as a country to use the resources and capabilities it has to a more effective degree when protecting our national interests, and to maintain our preventative capabilities against threats that are both external and internal. This would remain a key defence priority for the country based on the experiences we have faced in the last few decades, said the Defence Secretary further.
President Maithripala Sirisena in a recent visit to Australia signed a Joint Deceleration under the heading security and defence cooperation. This workshop thereby expands on the core tenants of this joint declaration - of a shared interests in regional security in the Indian Ocean, a commitment to closer cooperation and to a global rules-based order.
We sense that eight years on from the conflict, Sri Lankas own security interests are evolving and the time is right to considera new outlook that might take into account Sri Lankas broader regional interests, and policy priorities including freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean, noted Waidyaratne commenting on significance of the white paper.
The Director General of INSSSL, Asanga Abeyagoonasekera in the meantime said, Australia is seen as a neutral power in the Pacific and Sri Lanka could be a stabilizer in the Indian Ocean protecting and creating a peaceful surrounding at a time of the rise of China and emerging India happening in Asia.
He added, the defence white paper could assist to resolve the complexity of the nations defence strategy and thereby help to abate public apathy.

Definitely unforgettable!
In 2011 they broke the barrier and their dream came true when they were victorious at the All Island Shakespeare drama festival organized by YMCA in collaboration with the Rotary Club of Colombo. Dramatic Moves features Girls High School Kandy whose creativity and innovations, along with their zeal for drama and hard work have made them admirable thespians.
I need to mention Mrs. Halpe who had helped us a lot. I would also like to thank Anoji Madasekara the subject coordinator for English and Shyamali Pussalla, the teacher in charge of LMD society for their support and encouragement. Our victory took place after 19 years! We bagged almost all of the trophies. We were absolutely elated and over the moon. That was a shining milestone, said English teacher, Teacher in charge of Junior and Senior Drama, Sumudu Dhanapala.
Dhanapala is mainly involved with the juniors. They are still growing up and are very active according to their age. When I look at the seniors I remember how they were when they were juniors. I have seen how they have improved year by year up to now. They have their own personalities.
A/L English Literature teacher, Teacher in charge of Shakespeare drama, Shyana Naseem said that it was mainly the hard work put in by the girls that has produced favorable results. She stated that they are very active and practice makes perfect. The girls have had their ups and downs but have taken it all in their stride.
Our girls are remarkably versatile writing their own scripts. In 2014, Dhakshika Wijesekara wrote the script for the play the Company which came all island 1st. I definitely think that drama makes personalities. It develops speech and rhetoric. You learn posture. Definitely it contributes to all spheres of student life in school. I have seen with my own eyes, children changing. You learn to face rivalry and opposition. Drama I feel is essential, said Naseem.
Naseem stressed that what these girls learn and what they achieve have an influence on their university entrance. It is education at its best, education that can be obtained by doing drama.
The girls are very good at doing their own thing  costumes and lighting. One thing Professor and Mrs. Halpe taught us was not to be too extravagant with the costumes and props. So we have had to adapt at some competitions which required minimal props. And we had to have something good and simple. Mrs. Halpe really taught us a lot. They advocated local attire because they said that Shakespeare is universal, pointed out Naseem.
Naseem also pointed out that there is such a thing as the hot-seat! Where one girl has to get into character while the other thespians question her! She is given an opportunity to get into her role. They question her and she responds. If she is Bassanio, they ask her questions about Bassanio and get her to be Bassanio. They touch on very personal thing such as his likes and dislikes and tastes! They touch on his attitudes. That is called the Hot-seat!
Friendships for life
Literature, Music and Drama Society, President Sayuri Mohotti, said Anne of Green Gables is definitely unforgettable to her. In fact they won the all island first place. It was very memorable because most of the actresses were students in the same class.
The girls did Merchant of Venice in 2016. Shakespeare fans would remember the vengeful Shylock demanding his pound of flesh and the extremely intelligent Portia. The irony of the play and the outrage of Shylock are so enthralling. It certainly is a play where right or wrong is not in black and white but there is a grey area, the reviled shylock seeking his justice for how shabbily he is treated in society.
In most of our dramas at Girls High School we are very independent. Last year we did Merchant of Venice for Shakespeare (2016). At first I must say that I had stage fright. But my years of doing drama have tempered me. And now I am able to go up on stage and face the audience. Drama can help a young girl a lot. I have learnt a lot of patience because doing drama means everyone has something to say. I have made new friends from all age groups. All these friendships are friendships for life, said Mohotti.
The last scene in Bernarda Alba made her very emotional because there was such sadness in the play.
Overwhelmed by emotion
Shakespeare Drama cast member, Samadhi Kasthuriarachchi started her drama career in grade five. She is extremely experienced at drama having seen it take place at college.
It has been a great privilege for me doing drama at Girls High School because the amount of information you gather and the amount of experiences you receive, it is mind blowing. What you learn stays with you. It makes you a better person. I have worked with my akkis and they have taught me a lot, said Kasthuriarachchi.
Both Kasthuriarachchi and Mohotti took part in the Merchant of Venice and found it challenging because the language is different. Portraying Shylock needs an extra effort since Shylock is the focus of the drama. The teacher in charge and the girls all agreed that Shylock is a difficult role to enact. Not only is he a male but a complicated male at that!
I was also very timid and shy and drama gave me the opportunity to interact with people. We get to know people more when getting involved in drama. During certain performances some scenes have made me cry. Our girls were so good at one drama it made me cry. They were the older batch and they were that good! We have had girls overwhelmed by emotion before dramas, said Kasthuriarachchi.
Practices can be tedious but it is very educative because of the camaraderie and because the teachers always try and inspire the girls. Both girls agreed that initially it is hard because you need to learn the lines.
When it came to Shakespeare the language is different so they had to constantly ask their teachers for the meanings. You cannot act if you do not know the lines. The Shakespearean characters are different from people you might meet today even though you do see these characters in society. You get plenty of Romeo and Juliets in life.
Both girls have dreams of becoming lawyers. They have the ability to address a crowd and have become more observant than they were before.

Devapriya on SLFP party organisers
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said that senior SLFPers are discussing whether it is possible to reinstate party organisers who were removed and offer them the opportunity to contest the upcoming Local Government election through the SLFP.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo on Wednesday, he said the SLFPs stance is that Sri Lanka should remain a unitary country. We agreed with the proposal of devolving more powers to Provincial Councils, but we are against any merger of Provincial Councils.
The Governors should be appointed in consultation with Chief Ministers and they(Governors) should not be limited to ceremonial activities in the area, he said.
The President should remain as the head of Cabinet while retaining all the powers regarding the defence.
Devapriya further said that several communal minded politicians are trying to misguide the people and the Maha Sangha by distorting facts of the statment made by the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwathu-Asgiriya Chapters.
Our stance is that the new Constitution should only please Sri Lankans from the North to the South and not the Tamil Diaspora. The President is also of the view that there should not be a referendum. He added that that President will resolve the SAITM issue once he returns to the country.

Englands Broad plays down Ashes war
London: England paceman Stuart Broad is refusing to rise to Australia opener David Warner's declaration of "war" as Joe Root's men prepare to fly out to defend the Ashes.
The pugnacious Warner said earlier this month he would "dig deep to get some hatred" for the England team ahead of the series, adding: "As soon as you step on that line it's war."
Like Warner, Broad is familiar with the hostilities of the old rivalry but as England prepare to head Down Under, he is keeping calm. "I don't have to hate them," he told the Daily Telegraph. "It's a game of cricket, not war."
The Australian public, urged on by coach Darren Lehmann, heckled Broad throughout the 2013-14 series over his failure to walk for a clear nick in the previous series in England -- during which Warner was the designated villain after throwing a pre-series punch at Root. "Actually I loved that trip, I liked the pantomime villain stuff," said Broad. "As a cricketer it was as close as you get to being a footballer playing away from home. (Lehmann) needed something to unite the public and media behind the Australian side and he chose me."
It was football that provided Broad's inspiration on that tour as he drew on another fierce rivalry -- former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira's animosity with Manchester United counterpart Roy Keane and manager Alex Ferguson.
"Because I knew it was coming, I prepared for it," said Broad. "I read Alex Ferguson's book about how he'd once told Patrick Vieira, who'd had dog's abuse from the Old Trafford crowd, 'they wouldn't be abusing you if they didn't respect you'.
"Whether Aussies meant it that way, that's how I decided to take it. They were only doing it because they were scared of me." Australia captain Steve Smith has targeted England's inexperienced batting line-up this time around, with Mark Stoneman, James Vince and Dawid Malan in line to feature in the top five while doubt surrounds the participation of all-rounder Ben Stokes for disciplinary reasons. But Broad said: "When you go to Australia you have to have a genuine belief in your team that you can win. And I have that. I believe we can win.
"The (Andrew) Strauss-led side that got to number one in 2011 was the most efficient, disciplined group I've ever played with, but this team now is the most exciting.
"Moeen (Ali), Jonny (Bairstow), Stokesie: you don't know what will happen. But something will. True, we're not as consistent. But we can win games out of nowhere."AFP

Environmentalists commend DWC decision
Environmentalists who commended the Department of Wildlife and Conservations (DWC) decision to limit the number of jeeps entering the Yala National Park (YNP) asked that Department officials be allowed to enforce the regulation without any interference.
The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) of Sri Lanka which held a media briefing on the subject stressed that it was important that vehicle numbers be restricted in the park to conserve both wildlife as well as tourism.
If it continues in the way it does and the tourist numbers grow, the park will not last for very long,Vice President of the Society, Ranil Peiris said.
He was addressing the media at the BRC Clubhouse. Around 70 percent of tourists who visited Yala said they would not return though they were able to spot animals because they had a uncomfortable experience, added WNPS Committee member Rohan Wijesinghe who insisted that the government needed to focus on improving the tourism experience in the country, if the tourism numbers are to rise.
DWC sources stated that in 2016, Yala had a total number of 658,277 visitors to the park in over 700 registered jeeps; the most frequently visited national park in the country. Given such pressures put on the park, the Prime Ministers Office appointed a Committee in 2016 headed by former DWC Director General Dr.Sumith Pilapitiya to look into ways of reducing the number of visitors.
One of their main recommendations was to limit the number of vehicles entering the park and to enforce driver discipline, Dr. Pilapitiya said.
Their recommendation to limit vehicle numbers was thus implemented when the Park was reopened on October 23, almost a week earlier than expected.
The DWC had earlier decided to close it for two months, due to the prevailing drought.
The sudden limits imposed on the jeep drivers however drew wide protests from the Jeep Drivers Association with many insisting that their incomes would be effected and have launched a boycott of Block 1 in Yala, he said. Dr. Pilapitiya who was part of the proposal however pointed out that the action plan prepared by his team had been implemented too soon and in an unsystematic manner. He blamed political interferences in the recent protest with the jeep drivers and stated that there would be no problem if officials and jeep drivers were allowed to come a mutually beneficial settlement.
Wildlife has become highly political in the last 10 years, as a former DG, I know that we cannot do the job properly due to political interferences,he said.
Since 2008 vehicle numbers to the park have been on the increase, with numbers rising by over 1,000 percent from 2008-2016, Dr. Pilapitiya said.
In 2015, the reawakening Yala programme was designed and in 2016 we started to implement it. We were able to successfully implement that because the Department did not allow political interferences. For example, in the early months of 2016, former Park Warden Suranga Rathnayake banned over 70 jeeps and no one protested.
This was because we implemented the law for all equally, Dr. Pilapitiya said.
He stressed that it was important to implement these programmes with the social aspect of livelihoods in mind and that jeep drivers welcome such changes as it would improve the long term viability of their own profession.
The only grievance they have is that the law is not applied to all drivers equally, the former DG said.
Dr. Pilapitiyas committee had suggested 31 short term actions, nine mid-term and two long term but he pointed all of these had to be implemented without political interference and in a systematic manner.
The fastest possible decision to implement, he said would be the improvement of driver discipline.
You cannot impose such rules immediately. The situation is very complex, it is better to have discussions and come to a common agreement that is beneficial for all,Dr. Pilapitiya said.

Erosion threatens fishing industry in Ampara
The Thirukkovil coast is badly affected by sea erosion. Due to erosion the beach area has been completely disappeared.
The Thirukkovil Divisional Secretariat Division in the Ampara district supports the fishing industry.
The land from Thambaddai to Sangamankandy are being swallowed by the sea due to erosion over the past few weeks.
The fishing camps of the fisherman, fishing boats and other equipment have been damaged due to erosion and the fishing industry in the area is paralysed.
The fisherman have no place to park their fishing boats due to erosion of the beach. Further, more than hundred acres of coconut estates on the sea shore have also been damaged.
Sea erosion is common to the coastal area, but after the Oluvil Port construction, erosion has increased at an alarming rate . Due to this, villagers are fearful of their properties being engulfed by the sea.
There are many fishermen in the Ampara district coastal area who are engaged in shallow water fishing and deep sea fishing industry.

Facial contrast key in women looking young
Women can look younger by darkening or colouring their eyes or lips to make them stand out, say scientists who found that facial contrast decreases with age in women across a variety of ethnic groups. Facial contrast refers to how much the eyes, lips and eyebrows stand out in the face in terms of how light or dark they are or how colourful they are, said Aurelie Porcheron, from University of Grenoble in France.
Previous studies have shown that increased facial contrast is a cue to perceiving increased health, youthfulness and femininity. However, most previous studies have involved Caucasian faces or Caucasian observers, making it difficult to know if the findings are applicable to other ethnicities.
While people of different ethnicities can have different skin colours, age-related changes in skin colour tend to be similar. Researchers speculated that the relationship between facial contrast and ageing might be similar across different ethnicities.
To test their hypothesis, they studied images of women of different ethnicities, including Chinese Asian women, Latin American women, South African women and French Caucasian women. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, focused exclusively on women.
The women were aged from 20 to 80, and the researchers analysed their facial images using computer software to measure various facial contrast parameters. The research team found that while there were some small differences, several aspects of facial contrast decreased with age in all four groups of women, including contrast around the mouth and eyebrows.
This indicates that at least some aspects of facial contrast naturally decline with age in women from around the world. The researchers then investigated whether people from different cultures pick up on these changes when perceiving how old someone is.
To test this, they used photographs of women of a variety of ages, from the same four ethnic groups. This time, they used computer software to generate two versions of each face, one with high contrast, the other with low contrast. The research team invited male and female volunteers from two different cultural backgrounds, France and China, to choose the younger-looking face between the two versions of each face.
The participants chose the high facial contrast face as the young face almost 80 per cent of the time, regardless of the cultural origin of the participant or the face. People of different cultures use facial contrast as a cue for perceiving age from the face, even though they are not consciously aware of it, said Porcheron. The results also suggest that people could actively modify how old they look, by altering how much their facial features stand out, for example by darkening or colouring their features, she said.

German university delegation briefed by BOI
A delegation from Osnabruck University of Applied Sciences visited the BOI to study Sri Lankas investment climate and opportunities for investment in the country.
The delegation was led by Prof. Dr. Oliver Tillman, Lecturer in Taxes and Private Law, at Hochschule Osnabruck University of Applied Sciences, who visited the BOI with a team of 16 students from a variety of disciplines.
The University team who briefed by Dilip S Samarasinghe, Director (Media & Publicity) of the BOI assisted by other officers of the Board.
Osnabruck University of Applied Sciences is a university in Lower Saxony, Germany, located in city of Osnabruck. It was opened in 1971 and has a student body of 13,552 and an academic staff of 300.
The university team was visiting Sri Lanka on a week-long study tour and prior to their briefing at the Board, had visited the German BOI enterprise., Kramski Lanka (Pvt) Ltd at the BOIs Katunayake Export Processing Zone. This enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of steel and high precision moulds.
The University delegation's visit to Sri Lanka and to the BOI is a reflection of the growing interest on the part of visitors from the EU to the BOI since the restoration of the GSP+ facility to Sri Lanka. GSP+ will emerge as a major incentive to investors, since it offers duty free access to Sri Lanka made products to enter the EU market with a 100% duty waiver.
Germany is Sri Lankas second largest investor from the EU and many of the German companies operating in Sri Lanka are global leaders in their field of specialization and investment.
German companies had invested an estimated US$ 98 million from 2005 to 2016. Their investments represent projects in steel and high precision moulds, windsurfing sails, chemicals, foundations garments, knitwear, tools, garments electronic items, rubber-based products, coir products, toys, gems and jewellery and tourism.
Sri Lanka is very keen to attract German investments and targeting areas such as the IT and IT-enabled services, research and development, textile and apparel, higher education skills development, agriculture and food processing, tourism, infrastructure and automotive components.
One potential attraction for German enterprises is the growing market access that Sri Lanka enjoys through Free Trade Agreements. These include the Indo-Lanka FTA which opens up the Indian market of more than 1 billion potential ensures to potential investors in Sri Lanka.
The Pakistan-Sri Lanka FTA provides access to the Pakistani market of more than 160 million consumers and the future FTA with China will open up Chinas market of 1.4 billion consumers to potential investors in the future.
In addition, Sri Lanka enjoys the GSP+ facility which opens up the EUs market of 510 million consumers.
German companies may find Sri Lanka an attractive investment destination due to the much lower costs when compared to those in Germany.
Also German companies who are already investing in Asian may decide to invest in Sri Lanka to strengthen their presence in the Asian region.
Finally, the availability of some raw materials in Sri Lanka could also be a deciding factor in influencing German companies to opt for future investment.
Prof. Dr. Tillman commenting on what he had experienced during this stay in the Island stated, I think Sri Lanka is a very promising country and surely will have a bright economic future.

Grab this last chance
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has this propensity of swimming against the tide. This was witnessed even at the height of the separatist war. At a time the mood in the south was one of anger, due to the regularity of bodies of soldiers returning in polythene bags, from the theatre of war in the north, he launched the Sudu Nelum movement which sought to pacify this anger, while distinguishing between the terrorists and innocent Tamils civilians. Unpopular, though, the move may have been, the campaign, which received the full political backing of the Chandrika Government, succeeded in containing the emotions of the majority, that were obviously running high.
Similarly, Minister Samaraweera, has, today, risen in the defence of the new constitution, when there is a strident cacophony of voices to halt the process. Issuing a statement on the remarks made by Wimal Weerawansa and Retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne, on bombing parliament, and, killing those voting for the new constitution, respectively, Samaraweera recalled the clear mandate received by the Unity Government, in 2015, to introduce a new constitution and usher in peace. He stressed that no one could stop the ongoing efforts of the government to usher peace and reconciliation and develop the country.
This emphatic statement from Samaraweera comes at a time when certain members of the SLFP, which is part of the ruling alliance, are speaking at variance on the proposed new constitution. Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya says that the SLFP was opposed to a new constitution and they were only for amendments brought to the present constitution. He says the SLFP was against doing away with the executive presidency. Even the Ven Athureliye Rathana Thera, who entered parliament on the UNP national list, has viewed the new constitution with a jaundiced eye. These folk are only providing ammunition to the racist elements, now on the war path, to torpedo efforts to usher in a new constitution. This, in the absence of any final document and what was tabled in parliament being only an interim report.
Sections of the Buddhist clergy, too, have taken a stance against the new constitution, as if they were privy to its entire contents. It is significant that the monks who form the anti-constitution brigade are drawn from elements well known for their allegiance to Mahinda Rajapaksa. In fact, some of them, at one time, functioned as Advisers to the former President, and, had, virtually, the run of Temple Trees.
A serious matter, such as constitution making, is certainly out of the scope of Buddhist clergy. It is a function strictly in the hands of the government and should be of no concern to the Bikkhu community. The Sangha can lend their advise and offer counsel to the government, but it should not get involved in the function of running the country. It was the Buddhist clergy who led the agitation at Rose Place, forcing S.W.R.D. to tear up the Banda-Chelva Pact.Had he been a stronger personality, and went ahead with the Pact, it would have prevented the rivers of blood that was to flow in the country in subsequent years. Are the members of the Sangha attempting a similar stunt, for which the country will pay dearly in the future
The government is being accused of trying to divide the country, by Joint Opposition members and their Bikkhu pals. They charge that the government is about to implement the agenda of the Tamil Diaspora. What will be the political future of the President, Prime Minister, if, indeed, this is what they plan Will they be able to face the masses, at an election, again Why cannot those chanting this sell out slogan get this simple reality into their heads
Besides, the interim report is primarily based on the raft of views and opinions of a wide cross section of citizens and movements, and not those of the government. The paradox of it all is that the most virulent opposition to the new constitution emanate from those elements who were hellbent on changing the present constitution. They claimed that it was the fount of all evil that had beset the country, with Mahinda Rajapaksa even leading pada yatras to force the government to change the constitution.
Be that as it may, this is the first time that a wide section of disparate forces have come together to frame a new constitution that seeks to ensure all communities and groups live with dignity, sharing equal rights .Hence, the government should grab this opportunity with both hands and turn a deaf ear to the chants of racists and bigots, who are working to a political agenda. President Sirisena has declared that he would consult the Maha Sangha to clarify all doubts. The Prime Minister has also assured that the proposals were open for discussion and nothing was engraved on stone. Hence, there is little doubt that a comprehensive document will emerge, composed of all points of view, dispelling fears, where such exist, that will take the country on the road to progress, prosperity and ethnic harmony.

Haley rushed out of UN South Sudan camp
SUDAN: US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Wednesday was quickly escorted out of a UN camp she was visiting in South Sudan when protesters angry with President Salva Kiir turned up, officials said.
Haley, the most senior US administration official to visit Africa, was in Juba to meet with South Sudanese civilians affected by the nearly four-year war and has traveled on to Kinshasa as part of a three-nation Africa tour.
A group of several hundred protesters approached the site, the US mission said. The group was not protesting Ambassador Haleys visit, but rather South Sudanese President Salva Kiir. Diplomatic security agents determined that the site was no longer secure and escorted Ambassador Haley and her traveling party out of the site, cutting the event short by a few minutes, the mission added.
After meeting with Kiir, Haley said the United States was disappointed with South Sudan after investing $11 billion (nine billion euros) in the country under Kiirs leadership.
We are disappointed by what we are seeing, this is not what we thought we were investing in. What we thought we were investing in is a free and fair society where people could be safe, and South Sudan is the opposite of that, Haley told local radio.
But we are not going to give up on the South Sudanese people, we are here to fight for them, we are here to help, to do whatever we have to, to make peace and security become a permanent part of South Sudan, she added.
There was no comment from Kiir after the meeting.
Haley said last month she wanted to salvage a tattered 2015 peace deal that collapsed in July last year, as regional mediators launch a fresh bid to revitalise the agreement.
South Sudan won independence in 2011 with strong support from the United States.
The conflict erupted in December 2013 when Kiir accused his former deputy, Riek Machar, of plotting a coup.
Initially a war pitting ethnic Dinka supporters of Kiir against Machars Nuer people, the conflict has since metastasised to include different groups and local interests.
Last week the regional Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) said it had finished consultations with a wide range of parties and is expected to announce a new round of peace talks.
Brian Adeba of the Enough Project advocacy group that closely follows the South Sudan conflict, told AFP that the new peace push came as government was particularly intransigent to peace.
It believes it has won the war, it has taken a lot of territory and the opposition is not in a position to retaliate, he said. - AFP

Halterm Terminal to boost ultra-class box-ship handling capabilities
Canadas Halterm International Container Terminal revealed plans to extend its container and reefer handling capabilities with AUD 10 million worth of new equipment over the next twelve months.
The move comes after the terminal saw increased container traffic through 2016 and the first half of 2017.
The developments are expected to support the terminals existing five ship-to-shore crane operation, providing carriers congestion-free operations over more than a kilometer of the quay, at three berths between 14-16 meters draft.
Halterm provides global container carriers with access to eastern Canada and the Halifax supply-chain reaches far inland and to the US Midwest.
After significant ship-to-shore crane investments delivered into the operation in early 2014, it is the right time to bring on new rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) which will be arriving in February (1) and October (2) of next year, Kim Holtermand, CEO of Halterm International Container Terminal, said.
Halterm, which is capable of handling Ultra class container-ships of 10,000+ TEU size, is in the process of optimizing its existing container yard, which involves the removal of three redundant 1970s era ship-to-shore crane assets and the addition of new reefer capacity  an increase of more than 25% to over 600 reefer plugs.
The three new 1 over 5 RTGs from Konecranes are to be delivered in 2018. They will span six lanes and allow Halterm to stack containers five-high across import and export zones  an increase in yard capacity of 160,000 TEU, up 40% overall.
Halterm maintains a basic workforce of more than 100 longshoremen, handling services for Ocean Alliance partners (CMA CGM, Evergreen, Cosco and OOCL), Zim Integrated Shipping, Maersk Line, Tropical Shipping, Eimskip, Melfi, TMSI and weekly domestic service to Newfoundland with Oceanex.

Harsha slams CEB
Policy Planning and Economic DevelopmentDeputy Minister Dr.Harsha De Silva repeatedly criticised the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for what he called an abdication of its duty.
He was speaking at the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lankas (PUCSL) Energy Forum on Thursday evening.
In his keynote speech and the panel discussion, De Silva called out the CEB for not attending the event, for failing to cooperate with the PUCSL, for neglecting the governments pursuit of renewable energy, and for inefficiencies in tender procurement, losses incurred, and over-inflated salaries.
He began his speech by excoriating the CEB for not attending the Energy Forum. The Ceylon Electricity Board General Manager is not here. We are talking about electricity at this Energy Forum 2017. This is organised by the regulator. I am here, the Chairman is here, the invitees are here. Where is the CEB General Manager What is the anxiety attack the man has got
De Silva emphasised the governments deep disappointment that the Ceylon Electricity Board has been very unprofessional by not participating in the forum".
Repeatedly throughout the forum, he took the CEB to task for not doing their jobs, leading to incomplete procurements.
How can we complete the procurements if those members of the procurement committees are not sitting on those procurement committees
He specifically mentioned the proposed LNG power plant at Kerawalapitiya, blaming the CEB for delay.
I have sat in multiple CCM meetings and multiple excuses have been given about why it is delayed. Six people bid, five people were disqualified, only one person was selected and that person didnt have a proper bid. What happens now Now what has happened is that no CEB engineer is sitting on the procurement boards. Thats a hell of a how-do- you-do. Are we being kept to ransom by certain people
De Silva acknowledged that there are disagreements between the CEB and the PUCSL as a regulating body regarding the Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan, but said that these were technical differences without bearings on tender procurements and should have been sorted out by now.
And he took issue with the way in which problems with the CEB turn into allegations against the Government, which he says are without merit.
It is not the decision of the Cabinet or the Minister in charge, or the Prime Minister or the President, to go ahead and order a tender. It must be done by those who have been appointed to do it. If those who have been appointed to do it are absconding and not sitting in these tender committees and approving these projects, then how is it the fault of the Government
It is just like the CEB is not present here to discuss these matters. They are running away from the responsibilities they have been tasked with in going through the proper procedures and selecting who needs to be given these tenders so that the plants can come online, De Silva said.
De Silva also criticised the CEBs Rs. 30 billion loss for the first six months of 2017. He argued that Sri Lankan citizens end up paying for that through taxes on bread or sugar or milk powder, as well as the CEBs Rs. 40 billion debt incurred to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in the first nine months of this year. He said these losses might be owed in part to the salaries of various CEB employees, which he called very high.
De Silva conceded that the Government carried some responsibility for not implementing proper reforms, but he insisted that the Government is trying in its attempts to reform not just the CEB but the entire energy sector.

India and Sri Lanka signed two Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) today to construct 1,200 houses through 50 model villages, using Indian grant assistance of Rs. 600 million.
The MoUs were signed by High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu and Housing and Construction Ministry Secretary W.K.K. Athukorala in the presence of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, The signing took place during a special ceremony held in Hambantota for vesting to the beneficiaries the Santhosagama model village completed under the Gram Shakti Model Village Housing Project where the High Commissioner participated as a Special Guest.

Indian, Sri Lankan Navies to conduct Phase II of oceanographic survey
The Indian Navy and Sri Lanka Navy are conducting Phase II of the joint oceanographic survey off the Southern and Western Coasts of Sri Lanka from October 26 to December 21. The survey will be undertaken by Indian Naval ship INS Sutlej, which is an indigenously designed and constructed vessel that is fitted with the latest state of the art survey equipment.
This would be the second survey tasking that would be undertaken by Sutlej in Sri Lanka.
The ship was deployed to Galle and Colombo in 2004 in the aftermath of the Tsunami to survey both the harbours.
Phase II survey would be more complex and detailed than previous surveys undertaken and would focus on waters closer to the coast as well as the coastline features.
As in the past, personnel from Survey Branch of the Sri Lanka Navy took part in the conduct of the survey. Consolidation training would also be conducted for Sri Lanka Navy personnel so that the knowledge during previous interactions could be built upon. This deployment of the
ship presents an opportunity for both navies to learn from each other in the highly specialised field of Hydrography and would serve to build on the strong professional bonds that exist between the two Navies. During its deployment, INS Sutlej will also undertake a series of community welfare activities, sports and professional training exchanges with Sri Lanka Navy personnel.
It may be recalled that in May 2017, the one and half month long Phase I of the joint oceanographic survey was successfully completed by both the navies. INS Darshak, an Indian Naval survey vessel had visited Sri Lanka for the purpose. The joint survey resulted in generation of extensive oceanographic data that is currently being used for updating all information and navigational charts covering the Southern Sri Lankan waters so as to make navigation safer for all users of the sea.

India's $32 bn bank bailout isn't enough
India just gave its banking system a $32 billion shot in the arm.That's how much cash the Indian government plans to pour into state-run banks that are saddled with mountains of dodgy loans.
Official estimates show 12% of all loans made in India - $150 billion worth - have gone bad.
The government, which announced its intervention on Tuesday, has repeatedly faced calls to shore up the banking system.
Analysts hailed the cash injection as a "significant" and "much needed" move that should help revive the country's flagging economy.
Investors agreed. Shares in State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, gained over 26% Wednesday on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Punjab National Bank gained 46% and Bank of India advanced by 33%.
Yet some analysts questioned whether the government bailout is big enough to fully repair the damage caused by bad loans.
Indian banks need a much larger infusion of $65 billion to comply with new international regulations that will come into force in 2019, according to Fitch Ratings. The fresh government funds should be enough to tide the state-run banks over for a couple of years, but analysts say more uncertainty awaits.
"I think they probably will need even larger-scale [infusions] beyond the next two years," said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics.
The current bailout also doesn't guarantee that public sector banks will be in a position to give their customers new loans, analysts say.

Kalhari wins nine export awards in 10 years
The Kalhari Group which has been engaged in the recycling and export of waste products with the dual objectives of environment conservation and foreign exchange earnings, has won nine export awards in the past ten years.
The most recent was at the National Export Awards organised by the National Chamber of Exporters which celebrated its Silver Jubilee at the Hilton Hotel in Colombo. Kalhari won the award in the Industry Sector Small Category.
Kalharis Chairman and Managing Director, Indhra Kaushal Rajapaksa provides dynamic leadership to a team of dedicated staff that rallies round him throughout the year to ensure both success in business and industry recognition.
The Kalhari team bagged an award for the ninth time in the past ten years at the NCE National Export Awards.
Kalhari which has its head office in the rural village of Heiyantuduwa - seventeen kilometres from Colombo  also has factories in Mahara and Minuwangoda. Having begun operations in 2003 with the recycling of PET bottles, the company has now grown to a group of three companies engaged in the export of recycled tyre waste, rubber waste, post-consumer PET bottles and steel dust.
Kaushal Rajapaksa is a visionary and pragmatic leader always on the lookout to widen his horizons. At Kalhari we satisfy our customers by providing goods and services to exacting standards, and empower rural Sri Lanka by providing as many people as possible with a livelihood while protecting the environment at the same time, he explained.
Today, the world is severely challenged by the changing climate and increasing natural disasters. Driven by new technology, consumerism has become a way of life. The waste produced as a result is varied and in very large quantities. Recycling and safe disposal of waste have become an absolute necessity. We have therefore stepped in to harness the latest technologies to protect the environment.
Rajapaksa is also a Director of Building-A-Future Foundation - an organisation dedicated to the training of youth in ocean-based activities. He is also a Director of Sail Lanka Charter, the leading yacht chartering company in Sri Lanka, and Baff Polymech, which manufactures yachts in Sri Lanka. Kalhari will be expanding its activities further by setting up units in the Anuradhapura district, and next year, we will be setting up a fibre-glass recycling unit, says Kaushal Rajapaksa.

Kim wishes Xi  great success
SOUTH KOREA: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un wished Xi Jinping great success in a congratulatory but comparatively restrained message after the Chinese president cemented his grip on power at a landmark Communist Party Congress.
Kim's note offered Xi sincere congratulations after he was formally given a second term as the head of China's ruling party, state-run KCNA said on Thursday.
The message, sent on Wednesday, also expressed conviction that the relations between the two parties and the two countries would develop in the interests of the peoples of the two countries, KCNA said.
But the brief, four-sentence missive was a notable contrast to the fulsome terms in which Kim praised the Chinese leader and his country when Xi ascended to power five years ago.
Ties between the two neighbours have soured in recent years as the North staged a series of nuclear tests and missile launches despite opposition by Beijing -- its sole diplomatic ally and economic lifeline. In 2012 Kim described the two nations as friendly neighbours linked by the same mountain and rivers and bilateral ties as the common precious wealth associated with the wisdom and efforts of the leaders of the elder generations. Beijing has been reluctant to impose sanctions harsh enough to rattle the North's political status quo over fears that its collapse could send an influx of refugees across their shared border and place the US army at China's doorstep.
But in a sign of irritation at its unpredictable neighbour, Beijing cut all its coal imports from the North earlier this year and voted in favour of broader UN sanctions imposed on Pyongyang in recent months. - AFP

KURUPPUS marathon unbeaten 201
He was the first to score a century on debut and follow it up with the first double hundred. He was DON SARDHA BRENDON PRIYANTHA KURUPPU,a classy cricketing star to emerge and shine in the Lankan cricketing firmament as a wicket keeper/batsman and enter his name in the record books.
As a youngster taking to the game very early in his cricketing career at Ananda College he showed immense potential as a competent right hand opening batsman and capped it by being a stylish and safe wicket keeper.
As a right hand batsman he was stylish, always in line before executing and had the supreme elegance and was a treat to watch when he began to unwind his repertoire of strokes all-round the wicket. He had the ideal technique and temperament for an opening batsman.
Responsibility
On opening batsmen falls the responsibility to see the side to a formidable start so that the batsmen following will have the right platform to launch out and see the team to a formidable score. In the four Test matches he played he put on show this essential requirement.
It was pity that KURUPPU did not have the opportunity of playing more Test cricket than the four Tests he played. Yet in those four Test matches he excelled he had the fortune of playing in more Test matches would have gone to leave an indelible mark.
KURUPPU was born on January 5, 1962 and had his education at Ananda College where in addition to his studies, he showed immense potential as a promising opening batsman and wicket keeper and when he scored heavily in school cricket and later for Bloomfield C & AC and Burgher Recreation Club, national honours were not long in coming.
Memorable outing
And when that great day dawned what a memorable outing he made debuting against New Zealand at the CCC Ground facing the pace and swing of that great Kiwi all-rounder RICHARD HADLEE who was later knighted for his astonishing performances for country and the English county he played for Nottinghamshire.
Hadlee was one of the best all-rounders of that era. He had a lovely run up and even lovelier action and with a little leap at the wicket he delivered express speed and had the ability to move the ball both ways and cap it all with a vicious bouncer and to survive his blitz was an achievement.
That Kiwi attack had another fine mover of the ball in Ewan Chatfield. His accuracy was his hall mark. And they also had a vicious left arm spinner in Stephen Bock. KURUPPU faced all their wiles in compiling his unbeaten double ton  201
Amazing powers
KURUPPU showed remarkable and amazing powers of concentration in batting for 777 minutes and facing 548 balls which was also a world record. When he scored the double ton as a wicket keeper batsman on debut, he also became the third to do so in Test cricket history. The other batsmen who had performed this feat earlier were R.E. Foster and Lawrence Rowe.
That was the Test match that had to be abandoned before going the full distance because the terrorists exploded a bomb near the Pettah Bus Stand and most of the Kiwi cricketers who were shaken by the explosion urged the management to send them back pronto.
It was a travesty of justice that he played Four Tests and 54 one day internationals. He played in the 1983 World Cup in England and in one of the games he made 72 against Pakistan. In the historic victory against New Zealand he made a fluent 62 that helped Sri Lanka beat New Zealand.
Match winning knock
I covered that tour for the Daily Mirror and the Times of Ceylon and in the company of Sports Minister of that time Vincent Perera watched him make that match winning knock. On hanging up his boots KURUPPU served as selector, manager of the national team and in many other positions.
He also had a stint in Maldives as their coach. He was the son of Stanley Kuruppu who was an outstanding cricket promoter and umpire.
KURUPPUS STASTICS:

Lakers win gives Ball last word on Wizards Wall
Los Angeles: Lonzo Ball and the Los Angeles Lakers had the last word on John Wall and visiting Washington after days of NBA trash talk, prevailing 102-99 in overtime Wednesday.
Brandon Ingram scored 19 points, Larry Nance Jnr added 18 and each grabbed 10 rebounds while teen rookie guard Ball had six points, eight rebounds and 10 assists to spark the Lakers.
The Wizards missed out on their first 4-0 season start since 1978.
We were a half-step slow all night, said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. The fourth quarter we were just standing around. They played better than us down the stretch. They made big shots. They deserved to win.
Lavar Ball, Lonzos famously outspoken father, began the verbal fireworks after a Sunday loss to New Orleans, saying of the Wizards, They better beware. Because Lonzo aint losing again. Not in the same week.
Wizards center Marcin Gortat tweeted in response that JohnWall will torture (Ball) for 48 minutes.
Wall vowed no mercy to the Washington Post and added, His dad has been talking... that makes me want to go out there and lead my team and play the best I can play.
It didnt work out that way. Wall had 18 points on 7-of-22 shooting with nine assists, missed a tying 3-point attempt at the final buzzer and lost the ball out of bounds on a drive to the hoop late in overtime, his appeal for a foul unrewarded.
A lot of contact. I thought I got fouled, Wall said. Weve got to learn how to close them out. We had the game in our hand.LaVar Ball praised his sons performance despite Wall producing more points.
When he goes off, people get stuck on them points, the elder Ball said. He does a lot more things than score points all the time to get the team to win. Hes versatile.Russell Westbrook produced his 81st career NBA triple double to spark Oklahoma City over visiting Indiana 114-96, helping Paul George win his first game against his former club.
Westbrook had 28 points, 10 rebounds and 16 assists while Carmelo Anthony netted 28 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and New Zealander Steven Adams added 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Thunder.
George, who fouled out with 6:13 remaining, managed only 10 points on eight shots in 19 minutes.
Once I got traded, thats out of my control, George said in playing down the revenge factor. Im no longer an Indiana Pacer. I enjoyed being there, but this is where my focus is.
LeBron James stung Brooklyn for a triple double but the Nets hung on for a 112-107 victory over Cleveland.
Spencer Dinwiddie, who had a career-high 22 points, sank a 3-pointer with 43 seconds remaining to give Brooklyn the lead for good.
James, moved to point guard for the second consecutive night, struck for 29 points, 13 assists, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots.
Cleveland surrendered 17 3-pointers for the third game in a row.
The last one Spencer hit was pretty deep, but we definitely got to (defend 3-pointers better), James said. Thats what this league is now.
Houstons Eric Gordon sank a 3-pointer from the left corner at the buzzer to give the Rockets a 105-104 victory at Philadelphia.
Youve just got to be prepared to try and knock down shots like that, Gordon said. We needed a spark. We needed this game.
Gordon scored a game-high 29 points, James Harden added 17 points and 13 assists for the Rockets.
J.J. Redick scored 22 points and Joel Embiid 21 to lead the 76ers while Australias Ben Simmons added 14 points, nine rebounds and seven assists.
Stephen Curry scored 30 points and Kevin Durant added 29 as the defending champion Golden State Warriors (3-2) downed Toronto 117-112. AFP

Lankan construction  industry could benefit  from India's EXCON
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in association with Ceylon Chamber of Commerce organised a preview on EXCON 2017  South Asias largest event for the construction equipment industry and invited Sri Lankan companies, the SME sector and even engineering students to attend it.
In its ninth edition, it is South Asias largest construction equipment fair. This mega business event will take place from December 12-16 at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre, Bangalore, India.
With a gross display area of 25,00,000 square feet, the five-day international exhibition organised by the CII would attract over 1,000 exhibitors including 300 companies from abroad. The event is expected to attract over 40,000 business visitors.
In his address at the roadshow, V.G. Sakthi Kumar, member, EXCON 2017 Steering Committee and Manageing Director, Schwing Stetter Sales and Services said that Excon is set to put Indias construction equipment industry, which is expected to grow from US$ 3 billion in 2016 to US$ 5 billion by 2020 in value terms, on the global map.
Sri Lankan companies in the infrastructure and construction sectors have a very distinct advantage in not only sourcing equipment from India at competitive cost, but also offer best-in-class aftermarket service which forms a large part of the operating cost, he further added.
He also spoke of the geographical proximity which reduces downtime for spares and quicker delivery of world-class products for the construction fraternity in Sri Lanka. He was of the strong view that the India sourcing of construction equipment and spares by Sri Lankan contractors and infrastructure companies will definitely lower the cost of the projects.
We are entering into the ninth edition of EXCON, which has a 17-year strong legacy, having been organized since 2000. With each passing edition, EXCON has witnessed immense growth both in quality and participation. EXCON has grown from Indias biggest to South Asias largest construction equipment exhibition at present. With over 1,000 Indian and overseas exhibitors coming under one roof, EXCON 2017 has witnessed a 26% growth in terms of number of exhibitors compared with the 2015 edition.
So, while this will be the largest event on all counts including the number of domestic and overseas visitors, exhibition area and new project launches, the biggest difference will be the enhanced presence of foreign players  300+ participants. There will be country pavilions including from leading economies like Germany, Italy, China, South Korea and United Kingdom, he said. (SS)

## Title: Leading cement brands come to settlement over trademark dispute

Leading cement brands come to settlement over trademark dispute
Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC agreed to a settlement over a suit filed against Ruhunu Lanka Cement (Pvt) Ltd in the Commercial High Court of the Western Province.
Tokyo Cement, one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of cement in Sri Lanka, alleged infringement with regard to the similar trade names of the brands that the two companies distributed under.
The plaintiffs company, Tokyo Cement, distributes under various brands including Tokyo Super, Mitsui and Nippon. The company stated that it was in joint venture with Japans Mitsui Mining Co Ltd (now Nippon Coke and Engineering Company Ltd), and used its brand name Mitsui and Nippon in its distribution brands.
The defendants company, Ruhunu Lanka Cement, is part of distribution conglomerate, Hansagiri Group of Companies and is the sole agent in Sri Lanka for DG Cement Industries (Pakistan). It distributes under cement brands such as Ruhunu Cement, Maha Cement, DG Cement and Mitsuki.
Thus, the plaintiff said that the defendants brand name 'Mitsuki Cement' was confusingly similar to the plaintiffs own brand 'Mitsui Cement' along with the prominent green and red horizontal lines and blue lettering, which were in both brand logos.
The plaintiff, who was represented by Eraj De Silva, instructed by Anusha M. Fernando, declared that the aforesaid stylized presentation and trade name had come to be used exclusively by the plaintiff for which they have gained a market reputation, and stated that the defendants were "attempting to piggyback on and usurp the goodwill of the plaintiffs products."
The plaintiff argued on the basis that the defendants trade name was contrary to honest practices and that it can cause confusion and mislead the public with respect to the plaintiffs activities and thus sought an action of an interim injunction to stop the defendant from trading under their brand name 'Mituski', as well as demanding a recovery sum for losses and damages suffered.
The defendants counsel was led by Manoj Bandara with Hasitha Gamage, instructed by Sudath Perera Associates.
It was argued that the intellectual property right of the trade name 'Mitsui' belongs to Mitusi & Co Ltd of Japan, which the plaintiff had allegedly been using without the authority of Mitsui & Co Ltd. It was also questioned whether the plaintiff actually had any intellectual property rights in Sri Lanka in respect of the 'Mitsui' trade name, since they were not seen to be registered as a licensee of any 'Mitsui' trademark.
Further in regard to the confusion of the two similar names, it was stated that since the plaintiff was abandoning the brand 'Mitsui' and changing to 'Nippon', therefore 'Mitsui' and 'Mitsuki' would not be seen in the market at the same time.
The dispute came to an end as it became increasingly evident that the defendants brand had established its own goodwill under 'Mitsuki' with its own distributors and customers in the market.
Both parties mutually agreed to a settlement; thus the defendant, Ruhunu was able to continue to retain their trade name 'Mitsuki', putting any allegations of trademark infringement to rest.
However, in order to ensure no confusion would arise again, the defendant, in the settlement, declared that they would no longer use the aforementioned green and red horizontal logo getup in their packaging/trade dress. Nevertheless, the defendant would continue to distribute the remaining stock of cements with the aforesaid logo within a given time period.
Cases such as this are evidence that a growing number of businesses in Sri Lanka are becoming more active in protecting their intellectual property rights.
Nevertheless, it is important to note when there is a likelihood of confusion between trademarks a number of factors need to be considered.
This includes the type of goods and services, customer base, purchasing channels, packing/trade dress and so on, and not just the noticeable similarity of the trade names.

Licensed banks to enhance  minimum capital by end 2020
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka with a view to ensuring a stronger and dynamic banking sector has increased the minimum capital requirements for licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and licensed specialized banks (LSBs).
The capital considered for this purpose is largely represented by high quality capital, which has higher loss absorbing capacity. Enhancing minimum capital requirement will support the implementation of Basel III framework in Sri Lanka to strengthen the resilience of banks and may lead to consolidation in the banking sector. Accordingly, with immediate effect, new banks to be established or incorporated in Sri Lanka are required to meet following capital requirements:
A time period of over three years has been granted for existing banks to enhance capital and to meet the minimum capital requirement. During this period, banks are expected to formulate and implement new capital infusion plans and to take necessary measures to re-structure or consolidate, if necessary. Accordingly, commencing December 31, 2020 the minimum capital requirement for existing banks will be as follows:
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka expects that this enhancement of minimum capital requirement will lead to stronger banks thus preserving the viability and stability of the banking system and the interest of the national economy.

Lies nailed to the counter
Proposed new Constitution has become a hot topic for public debate between the Government and the Opposition. However, the Opposition criticism is limited to their attitudes and platitudes on one or two articles in the Constitutional draft presented to Parliament for discussion, which they consider to be non-negotiable. Even then they fail to substantiate their claim. The Government also merely repeats the same story that those non-negotiable articles would remain so and deny any attempts on its part to change or modify them. Beyond that there is no substantiated discussion.
Amidst the thunder and fire of the Oppositions mounting campaign against the draft Constitution a serious observer could see a range of lies, damn lies and suspicions. Let us see what these lies and suspicions are.
Lie No. One: No party in Parliament has a clear majority. Hence, there is no mandate of the people for a new Constitution. Therefore, the whole exercise is illegitimate.
Though no party received a clear majority the people voted for a change in the Constitution. The UNP clearly manifested its intention to bring in a new Constitution and the group that joined it with President Sirisena concurred with them. The UPFA had been campaigning and promising a new Constitution since 1978. It was in their election manifestos throughout the period including the last Presidential election.
Tamil Parliamentarians did not support both 1972 and 1978 Constitutions as they were kept out of the Constitution making process. So there was no question of their demanding the retention of the existing system. Thus there was an absolute mandate for a new Constitution. The SLFP change of heart came after the new government was formed and its former leader sat in the Opposition benches in Parliament with a group of dissident SLFP MPs and began a campaign against the new Constitution. Even then President Sirisena has so far refrained from endorsing the new SLFP thinking.
If one accepts that Constitution cannot be changed since no single party has an absolute majority in Parliament, it would take aeons to do so. International experience is against it. Nepal did draft a new Constitution after years of hard work despite the fragmented nature of its Parliament or the Constituent Assembly.
Lie No. Two: There is no participation of the public in the Constitutional reform exercise.
The reality is that a special Committee held peoples consultations at national and regional levels to obtain popular suggestions and recommendations. It published its report which included a wide range of proposals. On the other hand, the existing Constitution which the Opposition wants to preserve was rushed in Parliament in a matter of days with no public participation in its making.
Lie No. Three: The views of University teachers, lawyers, doctors etc. were not sought for the purpose.
The actual fact is that such views were sought but few of the professionals responded while the response of the ordinary public was substantial. It would be a sad mistake to call those who made representations to the above Committee as foreign agents or NGO representatives.
New Constitution
Lie No. Four: A federal solution would inevitably lead to separation.
It is not federalism that would lead to separatism and bifurcation of the country. It is the denial of human rights and repression of a particular community or group of people that would lead to separatism. Our own experience shows that the unitary state is no bar to separatism.
Federalism is being misinterpreted separatism to dupe the people. Even our Supreme Court has ruled that federalism is not separatism. Actually in the present world there is no Chinese wall separating federal and unitary states. While federal states such as India have unitary features unitary states such as the United Kingdom have federal features. Like everything evolves concepts too evolve and change over time. Hence, one cannot expect to rigidly cling on to stereotyped or ossified concepts.
Birth and development of capitalism
Lie No. Five: Sri Lanka has been a unitary state from ancient times.
Both States and unitary states were historical concepts that emerged during the birth and development of capitalism. It is in the 1972 Constitution that the term unitary state was used for the first time. To call it historic would be an untruth.
Of late an attempt is made to make people believe that there is almost universal acceptance of the term and it is taken as unchangeable by the public. This view was also expressed by a legal luminary this week. To believe so would exclude majority of the entire population of the North and East and sizeable sections of the population elsewhere in Sri Lanka.
The Joint Opposition campaign against the new Constitution is based not only on lies but also on suspicions. One of the main allegations against the Government is that it proposes to do away with the privileged position afforded to Buddhism in the Constitution.
There are two formulations concerning the same in the draft proposals of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly. They both have the following statement: Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana 
They say, however, that it will be dropped in the final version on the insistence of outside powers and the NGOs. This is mere suspicion.
Similarly they suspect that the term unitary state has been replaced by the Sinhala term "Ekeeya rajyaya" in the English text and "Orumitta Nadu" in the Tamil text to deceive both the Sri Lankan people and the international community and Sri Lanka would be considered a federal state by the latter. In fact some of them have overnight become linguistic experts on the Tamil language, interpreting the Tamil term in a biased manner.
Some extremist elements including a section of the Maha Sangha ask why the Constitution should be replaced and what are the problems that Tamils have which the Sinhalese do not have.
They seem to be born again. We have seen continuous agitation against the new Constitution, of course with its ebb and flow, ever since it was enforced in 1978.
Similarly the discrimination that still continues in the use of Tamil language in public sector institutions and the administration, the still continuing occupation of private lands by the Armed forces and the unexplained disappearances of Tamil youth are some of them. It was only recently that the President said that the people in the North and East suffer most. A Household Income Survey recently disclosed that there the average income is half that of the national average. Do we need to say more

Love animals and awaken your soul!
After having helped many stray animals through Animal Welfare Trust over the years, its founder Irangani De Silvas current focus is on the legal side of animal welfare.
De Silva who has been an animal rights activist since 2005 says that currently court cases keep her occupied.
It is a pathetic situation, she said.
I have faced very bad situations with officers from dog pounds in the past when we were focusing more on animal rescue. When my husband was the Health Minister, my daughter pressured him into speaking to the President about banning animal slaughter. My daughter was disgusted by how the strays were being treated in our country, she recalled.
De Silva says it is indeed great to find many animal activists in the country unlike in the past.
I thought I will carry on with addressing the problems at courts. Most of the time I have to attend many court cases, especially Cattle Cases in areas such as Badulla, Ambilipitiya, Ambalangoda, Minuwangoda, she explained.
She argues that the existing laws are insufficient to protect animals.
I am very happy about what I was able to do on behalf of animals. However Im not satisfied with laws and regulations existing in our country. In 2009, an amendment was made for the animal welfare act yet still people are not acting by it. Im the only person who spends all my time going to courts to release cattle. Even after doing so much, there is no appreciation for any of the work, she said regretfully.
De Silva explained how Sri Lankans should work together to make the country a better place for animals.
We have to create awareness. We are expecting the animal welfare bill to solve most of the problems. If it is published, we dont really know how some people will react. They might have a different attitude towards it. In my thoughts the future generation has the capability to bring about a change, she said.
However she feels Colombo is a far better place today for animals.
Colombo is a much better place now as there are fewer problems. Many people are aware and we see many animal lovers. People read and feel for animals over here. In rural areas, they are still killing many animals. Even now many elephants and dogs are being killed. It will take many years for those areas to improve, she added.
Stressing on the legal system and the laws regarding animal protection in Sri Lanka she says Its definitely not sufficient. We have included all the new laws in the animal welfare bill. After it is introduced in Parliament I think there will be an improvement. Elephant cases will have to be addressed more strictly. The fines and charges are not enough. Everyday there is a court case regarding cattle. They must raise the standards and laws and charge higher fines.
England was the first country to implement laws to protect animals in 1911. The British Government had publicly stated that animals are important beings not merely commodities. Many countries including Germany, Switzerland, Slovania, Brazil afford constitutional protection to animals.
We are also trying to do this in Sri Lanka. We should adapt these from other countries. Wild animals need to be protected. Even India takes strict actions against slaughter of cattle and they no longer send any elephants to different countries. Comparing to other countries we are very much behind and we need to come forward. We have to refrain from sending animals abroad, De Silva said.

Elephants and humans are not getting along in Sri Lanka, it is more apparent than anywhere else. Each year in Sri Lanka 50 people are killed by elephants. At the same time, many poor farmers haven't changed their daily lives for hundreds of years but their crops and villages are being threatened. As urbanization comes into play, the elephants have no where else to go and end up in fields searching for food.
Stressing on this matter she says Humans are to be blamed completely. The fault is ours. There should be a national policy to overcome this situation. We have been telling the government from the beginning that we need a national policy to protect the wild. People are taking up the lands elephants live and expecting the animals to be silent. Im totally against elephants being blamed. All this is man made conflicts. We need to maintain international standards.
The Animal Welfare Bill is pending for over 10 years. It was recommended by the Law Commission in 2006 to replace the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance of 1907 which is a weak law that cannot deal with the enormous animal cruelty issues which are on the increase. The fine for animal cruelty in the Ordinance is Rs.100 and the Ordinance does not apply to all animal species. The Animal Welfare Bill on the other hand, has very stringent penalties and recognizes a variety of new offences and defines animal as any living being other than a human being  a very wide definition. The Bill also provides for a National Animal Welfare Authority with a lot of powers to prevent animal cruelty.
Its enactment has been hampered by groups with vested interests such as those in the animal slaughter industry who say that welfare provisions will affect their businesses. The poultry industry says it will even affect the economy of the country. When irresponsible statements like that are made it is very sad. What is the message this gives to the world That Sri Lanka, a Buddhist country, is dependent on the meat industry for economic survival. We have discussed the need to get the Bill passed soon with many persons including Cabinet Ministers, Parliamentarians, and officials. A group of us has even sought relief from the Court of Appeal to get the Bill expedited. The court is monitoring its progress, she said.

LVL Energy Fund to launch IPO to further expand operations
The LVL Energy Fund as part of its ongoing efforts to further expand operations will be launching an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the coming months.
Part of the funds raised from the IPO will be channelled towards investment in three new hydro power projects in Sri Lanka and Nepal. Speaking on future growth plans, LVL Energy Fund Limited CEO, Sumith Arangala said, We look forward to successfully growing and expanding LVL Energy Fund in the near future and contributing to the development of Sri Lankas power and energy industry as well as the countrys economic growth at large.
Beginning from a small investment of Rs. 32 million in the sector at Lanka Ventures, LVL Energy Fund has come a long way since its inception. The robust diversification strategy that the company employs has remained its strong point over the years, and it is the same strategy that has elevated the company to the summit of the local energy industry.
Following several rounds of fund raising which culminated in a total fund base of nearly Rs 2,700 million last year, the company is now in a better position to explore more prospects and markets. Over the past 11 years, the company have gained immense stability and rooted ourselves in various strategic locations across Sri Lanka, and we have successfully tapped into two key overseas markets in Bangladesh and Nepal. As part of an ongoing effort to maintain its growth momentum as well as its significant lead in the market, LVL Energy Fund has several new developments and projects in the pipeline. As the potential in the local hydro power market is gradually diminishing, the company will look overseas for investment in hydro power as it has done in the case of the 10 megawatt hydropower project in Nepal that will be funded out of IPO proceeds. To further stabilize its operation, the company is looking to invest in a 100 megawatt thermal power plant in Bangladesh.
Furthermore, the company is considering investing in two new wind power projects of 20 megawatts in Jaffna Peninsula. Lastly, as part of its next chapter of diversification, LVL Energy Fund will actively pursue opportunities to add solar power projects also to its portfolio in Sri Lanka. Generating electricity and power from renewable energy sources instead of relying solely on fossil fuels, offers significant environmental and health benefits to the public and it also supports sustainable economic and industrial growth. LVL Energy Fund has investments in six operating local hydropower plants in Belihuloya, Aranayake, Ginigathhena, Galle, Norton Bridge and Bogawantalawa. The company also has investments in two operating wind power plants based in Kalpitiya peninsula in Puttalam district. More recently, LVL Energy Fund also invested in two thermal power projects in Rajshahi and Comilla, in Bangladesh.

Major scam in Maligawa land sale
Disposed off with title deeds for over Rs.92 mTemple received only a paltry Rs.730,000Agreement signed without mentioning the status of land
Traditional Rajakariya lands belonging to the Temple of the Tooth Relic have been sold for millions through dubious means, Police investigations reveal.
Rajakariya, is a traditional system of land tenure in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) until the early 19th century in which land was granted in exchange for services rendered. The traditional Rajakariya lands in Peradeniya, Udawatte and Malnaidage Chena with a total extent of 6 acres, have been sold with title deeds for Rs 9,287,0000 (Rs 92mn).
According to the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance, traditional Rajakariya lands can be sold, but at the time of sale, it has to be mentioned that they are Rajakariya lands, and that they come under the governance of the Temple of the Tooth.
Documents obtained by the Police have shown that when these lands were sold, the agreement was allegedly signed by Diyawadana Nilame Nilanga Dela Bandara but the deeds did not state they were Rajakariya lands.
Though the sale had brought in an income of Rs 92 million the Temple had received only an insignificant sum of Rs.730,000 into its own coffers.
According to the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance, Section 27, you can transfer land belonging to the authority but soon after the land is transferred to a third party, he has to inform of the change in ownership to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs. But investigations show that none of the buyers have informed the Commissioner of the transaction, the main reason being that the title deeds prepared for the lands did not mention that they were Rajakariya lands belonging to the Temple.
According to evidence obtained by the Police, the buyers were not made aware that these were Rajakariya lands or that Rs.730,000 of the sale had been deposited with the Temple for its activities.
The crux of the matter was that both these lands had been blocked and resold and the money earned through such fraudulent means were hidden, with a small amount deposited with the Temple.
The scam is of a serious nature as these traditional lands were bestowed under the guardianship of the temple in perpetuity.
Furthermore, the corrupt deal also sought to conceal the true market value of the lands in the sale documents.
The above case is being heard in the Kandy Magistrates Court under Case No B 34983/2015, filed on May 29, 2015.

Merlins Cave
Juliet Coombe goes on a Rock and Roll boat trip to search out the truth about Merlins cave...
If you like 18th Century bawdy humour crossed with Monty Python sketches then a 15-minute boat trip to Merlins cave for a fiver, four quid or even a tenner, depending on the time of year, with Remond Rossi nicknamed Rem will be one you will never forget in his boat appropriately named Nemesis.
Extremely witty
Having bought into the sales must do boat trip jargon outside the Red Lion pub with lines like pay when you get back or not at all if you hated the tour to Merlins mystical waterfall and cave, I could not see a better way to find out more about Clovelly Devons picture postcard village, festooned with fuchsias and geraniums than with a character like Rem. Well says Rossi as he takes my hand to get onto his boat do you want to know the real story of the village that has been in the same family since 1738 which is a place effectively owned by one man Johnny.
As he tells me about the area he drops into the conversation that he wrote a book called The Arthurian Legends of Clovelly, which you can buy on Amazon for 1.50. I say book, more of a pamphlet but it tells you all about Merlin and the waterfall, which got its name in truth because of a hermit with had an incredibly long beard, hanging out in a cave there some 300 years ago. Villagers tell, in hushed whispers, that Merlins body is walled up behind the waterfall.
If boats are not your thing you can do a stony, pebbly ten minute rock walk to the sparkling Merlin falls, which cascade down the cliff only a little more precipitously than the village does! Of course Rem does not tell anyone this when you meet him on the Quay, as he wants you to go on his extremely witty 15-minute boat tour that could be half an hour or longer depending on his mood. In his book he, of course, reveals the truth of the matter, which is that Arthurian magician Merlin was born there. Walking under the magical falls one could half believe this is true as the place does hold some kind of magic to it.
Shakespearian accent
Pointing to the forest above the village, looking very much like the hair of prehistoric man, he says you know youve really made it in the big city when you can afford to come down here and shoot a pheasant at 37.50 a bird. On average every year 50,000 birds get killed this way and why Well I have a theory you become a celebrity, get rich and do it as some sort of rite of passage. Bag a pheasant and somehow youve really made it, it is weird if you ask me and afterwards they book my shanty band Fifes Ruse named after one of the rocks along the coast and the late Fife, a good ole boy from the area who died around the time the band formed. I only do the booking as it is amusing to terrorise these bird killers for a few hours.
Besides being the captain of the Nemesis, and out all night on the band circuit, Rem is also a part time film negotiator for the area and he has worked on plenty of exciting productions like the Dianna Rigg 1920s period drama for the BBC and has even appeared in a few big blockbuster movies himself. Irish Jam being his favourite as he plays alongside the delectable Anna Friel in an extremely lively Irish band sequence in St. Agnes in Cornwall, which was meant to look just like a good old fashioned Irish Tavern. As more people have come to film in the area, he says proudly, we set up an extras production house and provide all sorts of fat, pretty or whatever extras. Of course as a negotiator I tell them they are going to need quite a budget. I mean closing Clovellys ancient harbour for a few days costs hoards in lost tourist dollars and the multi-million pound fishing industry and of course there is also a lot of poetic licence in this, but thats the movies, you have got to be creative and expensive or why do it
Pointing to the top end of the village he says, We have our very own celebrity actor living here among us, Joss Ackland, who orders lobsters from me.At first when he called me saying You must have lobsters, in a truly Shakespearian accent, I thought that was him acting and now, after rather a lot of beer sessions to see if he can sway the price on delivery, I realise that is what he truly sounds like. Of course I know being plied with beer is a ruse to get me so drunk I forget altogether about collecting the payment. It is Joss he says proudly who made the film about the history of Clovelly and its 600 year old Quay that was built in the 14th century and extended in the 16thcentury by George Cary for a mere 2000 pounds, which included building all the harbour cellars, warehouses and other edifices. A film is shown every 20 minutes each day at the visitors centre, that covers this and more about the areas rich history and when I asked why he is not in it, he replied well I cant be in everything and really I am a gown and town kind of guy admitting on the quiet that he was originally a London townie who came here 40 years ago and simply fell in love with the place.
The high season
Rem asks me on the way back to the town how old I think the white bearded skipper is. Before I can reply he says, 103, possibly older and the only way we can be sure is by cutting his head off and counting the rings. He also doubles as Merlin and maybe he is the one you see on the Internet promoting Clovelly
On longer trips and in the high season lots of wildlife can be seen like pilot whales and porpoises, not to mention it is an excellent spot to go fishing for cod, herring and maybe some left over treasure from one of the hundreds of wrecks in the area. Of course to be sure of wildlife you need to take a boat to Lundy Island about an hour offshore and always in these high seas there is an adventure and a half, especially if in an electric boat.
Rem tells us to check out Clovellys little fishermans cottage showing how hard things were in the 1930s and the Kingsley museum. The boat tour ends as suddenly as it started and we clamber back up the steep beach stone steps to the quay and as he waves goodbye to us, his patter starts again for the next trip, hailing passersby to come on the next exciting tour of a life time, only turning back to us for payment and pulling a bit of change from his pocket he says I hope to see you at my gig at the Red Lion pub on Monday night at 9. I ask how many people will be playing with him five maybe 10 he replies nonchantly as some of them are so old they have either died or might simply forget to turn up. If you cannot make the gig check us out on You-tube we do an excellent version of What do you do with the drunken sailor and with a wink and a doff of his invisible cap he says in his typical gallows humour, We are like Ebola, we have gone viral.

The National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaraweera said today NFF members were ready to sacrifice their lives to defeat any attempt of dividing country.
Addressing the media at the NFF office, MP Samaraweera said that the proposals in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly would completely weaken the power of the Central Government and the Parliament.
Once these proposals will be passed in the Parliament, the validity of the Parliament will become questionable, he said.
The MP also urged Maha Sangha to visit the homes of MPs and make a request not to support these proposals. Having 75 votes is enough to defeat these proposals in Parliament, he said.

Pakistans Foreign Secretary visits Gangaramaya Temple
Foreign Secretary of Pakistan Tehmina Janjua, during her visit to Sri Lanka for 5th Round of Political Consultations, visited the historic Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo.
She was accompanied by the Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra and other officials.
Chief Incumbent of the Gangaramaya Temple Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera warmly welcomed the Foreign Secretary and briefed her about the Temple and several social services under the patronage of the Temple.
Janjua said Pakistan prides itself to be the motherland of Buddhism and Gandhara. She added that the relationship between the two peoples and cultures exists from time immemorial taking a firm shape through 2,500 years of ties established during the golden eras of Gandhara and the rise of Buddhism. She said that Pakistan, despite being a predominantly Muslim country has been celebrating Vesak at Taxila since 2016 as an annual festival that shows Pakistans commitment and harmony towards other religions. Pakistan has been the proud cosponsor of the UN Resolution of 1999 for declaring Vesak as one of UN annual days.

Lankas wretched batting form continues into the T20s
Pakistan wins 1st match in a canter
Thursday: Sri Lankas wretched run in one-day cricket continued when they were outplayed by Pakistan by seven wickets in the first T20 International played at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Thursday.
Invited to bat first Sri Lanka came up against a varied Pakistan bowling attack and were put out for a disappointing 102 in 18.3 overs once again failing to go the distance as they had in the fifty-over one-dayers.
Pakistan knocked the runs in 17.2 overs losing three wickets to canter home with 16 balls to spare.
Ahmed Shehzad (22) and Shoaib Malik (42 not out off 31 balls) put together the highest partnership of the match 46 for the third wicket to see Pakistan home after Sri Lanka had captured two early wickets for 18. Mohammad Hafeez made 25 not out.
A lot was expected of this Sri Lanka side under a new captain Thisara Perera after several players pulled out of the team not wanting to go to Lahore, but the same problems seemed to persist despite the changes.
The rate at which the Sri Lankan batsmen got out was even too rapid for the electronic scoreboard to keep pace with. Before the board could complete putting up the new batsmans name he was already making his way back to the pavilion. Such was the dismal display of batting that the Lankans put up.
One has to give credit to Pakistans bowling line up which had enough variations up its sleeve to cause discomfort to the batsmen. Mohammad Hafeez in his first over broke the back of the batting with a double strike sending back Mahela Udawatte and Dasun Shanaka in one over that was also a maiden.
Hasan Ali was once more the tormentor of the Lankan batting with three wickets for 23, but one has to give credit to the rest of the bowling for their ruthlessness and unrelenting approach, something which we have not seen from past Pakistan sides.
Sri Lanka needed a good launch pad if they were to be competitive, but they lost Dilshan Munaweera off the third ball of the innings for a duck and although Danushka Gunathilaka and Sadeera Samarawickrama raised the total to 29 and Sri Lanka reached 51-2 in the ninth over, the batting failed to gain momentum and they lost the remaining eight wickets while the score was doubled.
Samarawickrama and Seekkuge Prasanna who hit a couple of lusty blows for sixes towards the end top scored with 23 apiece, but the rest of the batting was disappointing.
Sri Lanka will have to seriously think about their batting order because such big hitters like Perera, Shanaka and Prasanna should be sent up the order instead of adopting a conventional approach that proved rather detrimental to the batting in its overall context.
The second match of the three-match series will be played at the same venue today.

His Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray:
On the path to the Sainthood
Thomas Benjamin Cooray was born on December 28, 1901, to a humble but a greatly devout Catholic family in the hamlet of Periyamulla in Negombo as the fifth child and the third son. From his early age, he showed himself to be a child of piety, of serene temperament, much devoted to his studies, and much liked by his neighbours.
However, at the age of twelve much to the surprise of his mother, the young boy decided on embracing a religious vocation and joined St. Aloysius seminary at Borella. There, he excelled in studies attending St. Josephs college and wound up with a B.A. from the London University offering English Literature, Botany and Latin. Ever since the love of plants and environment was much in his list of hobbies.
As a student, he had even helped Fr. Le Goc OMI, the rector, himself a Botanist, to compile a book on Tropical Botany. The diocesan phase in Colombo that initiated seven years ago, the inquiry needed for him to be presented to sainthood is now being concluded and the documents are ready for dispatch to the Vatican for further review and approval.
First years of ministry and challenges
After his brilliant career as a student at St. Josephs College, he entered the Oblate Missionaries (OMI) novitiate training himself to be a Religious, taking his first vows in January 1925. His superiors having taken notice of his intellectual acumen, profound religious demeanour and crystal character, decided to send him overseas to Rome, the centre of Catholicism for his further training for the Priesthood and for higher ecclesiastical studies. He returned as a new Oblate priest at the age of 28 in 1931, to join the staff of St. Josephs College having won academic laurels with two doctorates in Philosophy and Theology to his credit, both with summa cum laude.
The young priest eventually was appointed warden of the Catholic Hostel and later for nine long years worked as the religious superior of the Oblate major seminary in Borella where he led the formation programmes for the young men who wished to become oblate priests. It was at this time in January of 1945 he received news of his nomination as the Co-adjutor to the then fifth Archbishop of Colombo, Most Rev. Jean-Marie Masson OMI.
With his sudden demise, the young Co-adjutor took over the Archdiocese of Colombo on July 28, 1947.
The appointment of a Ceylonese to the highest church office was significant since this first Ceylonese archbishop was to be entrusted with the leadership of the Catholic Church in the newly dawned independent era. The indigenization of the Catholic Church was thus officially signaled even by the Vatican. The trend continued into his activities right during the 30 long years of his active episcopate in Colombo and as an illustrious religious leader in independent Ceylon. The crowning of his Episcopal career took place with his being created as Ceylons first ever cardinal, the fifth in Asia in February 1965. Thus he was able to expand his concerns and vision far beyond this little isle to furthest lands of Asia and to the entire Catholic world sharing closely in the government of the church with the Pope, who is the Head of the universal church. Having accomplished much, he went into retirement in 1976 at the canonical age of 75. Many have known how he spent his last years in profound joy, serenity and tranquility of soul, cordially welcoming whoever came to see and greet him. Right through his 63 years as an Oblate Religious, 59 years as a priest, 42 years as a bishop and 23 years as a Cardinal, his first priority in life was the pursuit of sanctity giving himself totally to the service of the archdiocese and the global Catholic world, remaining faithful to his priesthood to the end.
The era of independence was fraught with many a transformation and upheaval in the country. There was the rising spirit of nationalism and the Buddhist renaissance, political trends that were both capitalist and pro-western, a rising leftist trend of socialism mixed with communist ideologies. Elections were fought along these extreme lines many a time. There were swings in government from right to left and vice-versa. Religion too played a crucial role in politics. It has been the trend ever since, even to this day. The role and place of religion could be at the heart of a constitution and government. In this milieu, Archbishop Cooray had to face many a challenge and crisis. Most notable was the Schools Take over in December 1960 which created disturbances in the country with Catholics and Catholic associations rising strongly against the move.
The Archbishop argued that Catholic children need a Catholic education. To achieve this end, there is the need for a Catholic atmosphere in the schools with a well-educated Catholic band of teachers and good administration that ensures discipline in the students and stability of the institutions. The Catholic bishops vehemently opposed this move and meeting with the highest echelons of the government raised their cry of opposition. At the end of the battle, the Catholic Church could save only a few Grade I and II schools. Of the more than 600 island-wide Grade III schools that were under Catholic management, Colombo archdiocese lost over 250. It was a great blow to the Catholics and brought much pain of mind to Archbishop Cooray. He had referred to the Schools take-over as the fiercest persecution the Catholic Church suffered ever since the religious persecution under the Dutch colonial power when Catholicism was forbidden, Catholics oppressed and priests deported.
Interest in Church and the Nation
Among the other issues was the refusal of visas to foreign religious sisters serving in leprosy asylums and government hospitals. This was followed by visas not being renewed for foreign Catholic priests working in the island. Colombo diocese lost quite a few of them, who decided to leave without burdening the Archbishop who would have had to pay a visa tax for those who would remain. There was at the same time a land bill that restricted the acquisition of lands for the building of churches and charitable institutions.
There were even slanderous issues such as publications that would dishonour catholic beliefs. The background to some of these contentious issues was the Buddhist commission that was proposed by the Buddhist Congress at that time exerting many a pressure to bear on non-Buddhists. Catholic Workers movement and Young Christian Workers Movement (YCW) were looked upon with suspicion. Many are of the opinion that Archbishop Cooray was a man of principle and would go any length to safeguard them, particularly when it came to defending and protecting the fundamental human rights and issues of social justice. He did not hesitate to repeatedly keep writing to prime ministers and relevant ministers about the injustices that were being meted out to his flock. While he strived to maintain good relationships with those in government, he was quick to point out impending dangers in some of their political decisions and short-sighted policies. He was much concerned about Marxist infiltration into government and universities.
His Eminence Cardinal Cooray was swift to pay his respects to the father of the nation, D.S. Senanayake when his untimely death took place and did not hesitate to congratulate all political leaders who led their parties to victory in elections as they became the legitimate rulers of the people through the democratic process. He wished to see wise representatives and those with long-range vision in the seats of power taking into consideration always the common good of the greater majority of the citizens. Archbishop Cooray relentlessly defended the freedom of religion, the right to free education, respect for democratic reforms etc which would take Sri Lanka to the highest level in the international community of nations.
His Eminence Cardinal Cooray himself was a humble, compassionate and wise personality. He was a man of vision but attuned to everyday grass-root realities. He responded to the sufferings of the poor and the pain of the sick. This is shown very well during the floods of 1950s and that of the 1960s. Fisher-folk and their urgent needs concerned him deeply. To help alleviate their lot Archbishop Cooray initiated Fishermens societies in and around Negombo whilst providing them with the newest methods for fishing and training them the art of saving.
He was swift to organise relief services, raising funds, taking a special interest in the migrant fisherman in the east, who were displaced by these calamities. He would personally visit them and distribute provisions and make his presence a source of consolation and hope to those who fell victims to these natural disasters.
When settlements were opened up in the north-central province, Archbishop Cooray encouraged farming families from his flock to venture into the cleared areas and helped them with the where-with-all to launch agriculture and farming. It was a service to the nation towards self-sufficiency. This also helped the beginnings of the formation of stable Catholic villages. While he welcomed the birth of a new constitution in 1972, he also sent out an ardent appeal over the radio and print media at the request of the government that youth desist from violence and take to paths of patient dialogue to achieve their demands for better education for all and decent employment.
His Eminence Cardinal Cooray was much concerned about the skill and vocational training of the youth for which he donated a big land in Bangadeniya (Chilaw) for rehabilitation of JVP youth and later opened centers such as the Radio/Electronic lab in Kotahena, technical schools in Negombo and opened the Boys Town in the Ragama area. Thinking of higher education, he opened Aquinas College of higher studies in Borella, in which he saw the seed of a possible Catholic University open to students of all races and religions. Today, it is a prestigious centre for higher learning and well-adapted to modern times. Health for all too was one of his plans as he dreamt of a fully equipped catholic hospital making a modest beginning with a humble clinic in the area of Borella.
Milestones
The translation of the Sacred Scriptures into local languages was an urgent need for which he chose a well-equipped band of qualified priests to undertake that enterprise. Keeping in line with Vatican II, the great Catholic world Council (1962-1965) that brought in renewal and reform within the Catholic Church, he proceeded systematically to study the social, cultural and national context in which the Church has to live and work by calling for renewal seminars and encouraging church workers to do social analysis while speeded up the use of the vernacular in the Liturgy in churches. He was convinced that the Church is not of the world, but is in the world and for it. In the imperative of the Gospel of Christ, she had to be the light of society, salt of its earth and leaven of the world. A clean environment and social harmony were uppermost in his concerns.
Everyone today speaks about His Eminence Cardinal Coorays love for trees. The complexity of verdure that one beholds around the Basilica Shrine in Tewatte bears fine witness to it.
His Eminence Cardinal Cooray was a man of deep spirituality, a man of prayer and contemplation, a man given to the sacred. This was the rock-foundation on which he had over the years built his versatile personality. To become a man of God and to lead others to a God-experience putting them in touch with God was his greatest preoccupation. For this purpose, he sacrificed his life, time, talents and all God-given other spiritual and human potential. He was a person filled with compassion who took upon himself the failures of others and was prodigal in his capacity to be humble and to forgive. Often he was hurt when those of his close collaborators were unduly maligned.
When problems confronted him, in addition to seeking counsel from those who were competent and knowledgeable, he would spend hours in the silence of his private chapel in prayer seeking for enlightenment and Gods will. His spirit of poverty shines out in the kind of last will he had written in which he says that he has nothing on earth to bequeath to anyone. Once when questioned by the Press about his assets, he had very plainly explained how all in his dwellings are the property of the archdiocese and not his own. His outreach to the global world was note-worthy, for, in addition to him being president of the Catholic Bishops Conference for well over 30 years, the Vatican called him to serve in three international commissions: that for the Evangelization of Peoples, commission for Eastern Churches and the commission for the revision of Canon Law. He reached out to Asia by pioneering Radio Veritas in Manila and becoming one of the prelates to lay the foundations for the forming of the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences (FABC) which provides all the Bishops in Asia to chart out relevant strategies for a mission of love and service to the teeming Asian populations. It would, later on, move along oaths of inter-religious dialogue and social justice in responding to the characteristic multi-faceted religiosity and wide-spread poverty of Asia.
The Servant of God His Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray wields indeed an exceptional portrait. He rose to such august heights as a man of God because of his spiritual stature that made him live a life of heroic virtue. It was this that led Pope Paul VI in February 1965 to confer upon him the dignity of a Cardinal. As a Cardinal, he brought honour and prestige to this little pearl of the Indies, the Taprobane of beauty.
The ceremony of the closure of the diocesan phase of inquiry will be presided over by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith at the Basilica in Tewatte in late October. It was officially initiated in 2010. If raised to the Sainthood, His Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray will go down in history as the first son of the soil to be numbered among the saints of the Church.

The Ceylon Workers Congress supporters together with the public staged a protest in Hatton against the decision of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry to change the name of the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre.
The centre was renamed as Pool Bank Vocational Training centre, recently. As a result, CWC supporters launched a protest causing heavy traffic congestion in the Hatton town, yesterday.
The protesters demanded that the name should not be changed and it was reported that supporters from all parts of the hill country participated.
The vocational training centre was established in 1998 by the late Sawmiya Murthi Thondaman with the help of the then German Ambassador to Sri Lanka. After the demise of Sawmiya Murthi Thondaman, Arumugam Thondaman opened the centre and named it Thondaman Vocational Training Centre.
The training centre was established to make vocational training in Tamil medium more accessible to plantation youth.
The protesters said since its establishment, the name remained as Thondaman Vocational Training Centre and now the new government is trying to change the name.

Rag Returns!
Rag  The Musical is a work of fiction inspired by the experiences of its creator Jehan Aloysius and his University batch-mates, and deals with the topical issue of ragging sensitively and intelligently. The musical, which is filled with memorable melodies and meaningful lyrics, presents a positive message of non-violence and unity which is relevant to students in all educational institutions. The three nights limited engagement at the Lionel Wendt theatre will be staged on November 2, 4 and 5.
The shows creator Aloysius states, The cast has come a long way over the last few months. CentreStage Productions always promotes new talent in the lead roles, rather than relying on a star system of regular leads. As a result, we feel were constantly adding to the talent pool of performers of the English and Sinhala theatre by training new performers to become stars. Its a risk and extremely hard work for the director. Yet its one worth taking  especially when the new talent finally blossoms by delivering an excellent performance! The absence of the star-system also allows for a generous sharing of ideas, skills and advice without any barriers of egos.
The cast believes that Rag, being a home-grown original musical, would be a radical counterpoint to the more glitzy foreign imports.
The musical is written and composed by Jehan Aloysius. Avanti Perera performed the music tracks and orchestrated Aloysiuss melodies and score. The choral arrangements are by Deshan Cooray and Eshantha Peiris.
The key singing roles are played by newcomers Dion Nanayakkara, Julian Anderson and Keminda Heethawaka Arachchi, as well as experienced performers such as Stigmata Frontman Suresh, Jazz sensation Tanuja Perera and classical soprano Dmitri Gunatilake.
As usual with CentreStage Productions, the cast is a vibrant mix of singers, actors, dancers and acrobats who have been given training at workshops in various aspects of musical theatre  from singing, dancing and acting. Many of the newcomers who have never danced or sung before, have discovered that they have been able to pick up the complex choreography, stage fighting and choral singing essential for this musical. Visit and join the Facebook Page and Event for Rag  The Musical for more details, and behind-the scenes information.
The show will be a fund-raiser for theatre-based humanitarian work conducted through the troupes 'StageHands' and 'Power of One' projects, which includes volunteer workshops for students on the issue of bullying and ragging.

Rampant Wozniacki  credits aggression for success
Singapore: A rampant Caroline Wozniacki said a more assertive approach is fuelling her spectacular start to the WTA Finals after she thrashed world number one Simona Halep in straight sets on Wednesday.
The 27-year-old stunned Halep 6-0, 6-2 in just 63 minutes in Singapore to storm into the last four of the year-end tournament for the loss of just four games.
Wozniacki, a renowned counter-puncher, said she has enjoyed playing a more aggressive game in the round-robin format.
"Even if you lose the first match, you still have nothing to lose," she told reporters. "It's just a nice cushion to have. I think that kind of motivates me to start off strong and just go for it.
She added: "I just ran a lot of balls down and I played aggressive and I mixed up the pace. Everything I wanted to do was going my way."
The Dane said she was well suited to the slower court of Singapore, where she was a semi-finalist in 2014.
"I think this court is great for the all-round player, who can play both aggressive and defence," she said. "I just have been feeling good and am playing at a high level."
It was a bitterly disappointing evening for Halep, who was impressive in her opening victory over Caroline Garcia.
"I made too many mistakes and she didn't miss," Halep said. "It was one of my bad days. During the points I missed too many and I wanted to over-hit the ball."
The 26-year-old will ensure qualification to the semi-finals if she beats Elina Svitolina in a crunch match on Friday.
In the other match of the evening, world number eight Garcia kept her WTA Finals campaign alive with an epic three-set victory over Svitolina.
Down 5-3 and on the brink of elimination, Garcia dug deep and reeled off four straight games to prevail 6-7 (9/7), 6-3, 7-5 in two hours and 44 minutes. It was the pair's second consecutive marathon following Svitolina's victory earlier this month in Beijing.
Garcia turned the tide through her high-voltage groundstrokes, enjoying a sizeable 58-33 advantage in winners.
It means Garcia, Svitolina and Halep will battle for the final semi-final position from the Red Group. It was a stellar comeback from Garcia, who blew two chances to win the first set tie break.
An emotional Garcia went back to her chair and started crying but regathered herself to eventually pull out a victory.
"On court I was obviously feeling nervous," she said. "I'm very happy to be through with a win. It was an up-and-down match like the one we played in Beijing."
Garcia still has a chance to top the group if she beats Wozniacki and Svitolina defeats Halep. A disappointed Svitolina said it was a "terrible feeling" to have lost after being in a commanding position. "I missed my chances. I mean, my game was completely off," she said.
"Unfortunately, I cannot go back in time."
Svitolina will need to defeat Halep in straight sets coupled with a Wozniacki win to qualify. AFP

Ranatungas Case postponed for fifth time
The case filed against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife was yesterday postponed for trial by the Colombo High Court for the fifth consecutive time.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke, the Court re-fixed the case for trial to be heard on February 14 citing that the Court has assigned time for another trial.
At the previous occasion (August 23), the defence counsel sought a new trial date citing that his client wants to attend Parliament sessions.
The case had been fixed for trial on five occasions (October 7 last year, January 26 this year, May 23 this year, August 23 this year and October 26) for various reasons.
When the case was taken up for trial yesterday, the key witnesses, virtual complainant and his wife were present in Court. The first and second witnesses were advised to appear in Court on the next trial date.
Meanwhile, the High Court yesterday permitted Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife Maureen Ranatunga to go abroad (Australia) between December 10 and December 22 for a period of three weeks.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, his wife Maureen Ranatunga and another person on the charge of threatening a businessman over the phone and demanding Rs.64 million.
On a previous occasion, Colombo High Court decided to proceed with the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife in absentia of third accused Naresh Kumar Fareek who was evading Courts from the beginning of investigations.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek based on charges of committing offences during the period between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015.
In addition, the AG has named 65 witnesses and included 35 articles as Courts productions against three accused in this case.
The prosecutors maintained that businessman Gehard Mendis who purchased a 2.5 acre land in Meethotamulla sometime back had allegedly requested the former Chief Minister to evacuate the unlawful occupants of that land and fill it with soil.
The prosecutors alleged that the former Chief Ministers wife along with two others had entered into an agreement with the businessman and the latter had already paid Rs.15 million to the former for the services.
Mendis had lodged a complaint with the FCID saying that the former Chief Minister had threatened him over the phone demanding the rest of the money involved in a promised deal.
The prosecution maintained that the investigations revealed that the accused had misappropriated Rs.15 million and the voice recordings of the alleged incident had been listed as a production item.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Anil Silva appeared for the accused.

Rock and roll legend  Fats Domino dead
US: Fats Domino, one of the most influential rock and roll performers of the 1950s and 60s, has died aged 89.
The American rock and roll artist was best known for his songs Ain't That A Shame and Blueberry Hill.
The New Orleans singer sold more than 65 million records, outselling every 1950s rock and roll act except Elvis Presley.
His million-selling debut single, The Fat Man, is credited by some as the first ever rock and roll record.
An official from New Orleans coroner's office confirmed the death, which was earlier announced by Domino's daughter to a local television station.
Fats Domino - whose real name was Antoine Domino Jr - was one of the first rhythm and blues artists to gain popularity with a white audience and his music was most prolific in the 1950s.
Domino had a string of number ones and more than 30 top 40 hits. His music is also credited as a key influence on artists during the 1960s and 70s.
Elvis Presley referred to Fats Domino as "the real king of rock n roll" and Paul McCartney reportedly wrote the Beatles song Lady Madonna in emulation of his style.
In 1986 he was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but by his later life Domino would no longer leave his Louisiana hometown - not even to accept the award. New Orleans-born musician and actor Harry Connick Jr is among those who have paid tribute to Domino on Twitter, saying he had "helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players".
Antoine "Fats" Domino Jr was born in New Orleans on 26 Feb 1928, the son of a violinist. His parents were of Creole origin, and French Creole was spoken in the family. He was musically inclined from an early age and learned piano from his brother-in-law, the jazz banjo player, Harrison Verrett.
He was given his nickname by bandleader Bill Diamond for whom he was playing piano in honky-tonks as a teenager. He said the youngster's technique reminded him of two other great piano players, Fats Waller and Fats Pichon.
Domino left school at the age of 14 to work in a bedspring factory by day, and play in bars by night. He was soon accompanying such New Orleans luminaries as Professor Longhair and Amos Milburn.
In the mid-1940s, he joined trumpeter Dave Bartholomew's band, and the two co-wrote Domino's first hit The Fat Man. Suddenly, the New Orleans sound became popular nationwide.
In an interview with the BBC in 1973, Domino spoke about his early life.
He said: "I was 17 when I made my first record in 1949. I never thought about being professional. I used to work in a lumberyard and that's where I first heard a number on a jukebox and I liked it. It was a piano number. It was called 'Swanee River Boogie' by Albert Ammonds."
Despite both musical heavyweights coming from New Orleans, Fats Domino said he only met Louis Armstrong twice in his life.
He told the BBC in a later interview: "I liked the way he was singing 'Blueberry Hill'. See, a lot of people think I wrote 'Blueberry Hill' but I didn't.
"That number was wrote in 1927 and I recorded that song in 1957. We just put a different background and I just sing it the way it would fit me and it came out great for me."  BBC

Royal out to preserve their record, but  Thomians ready to wrest back the trophy
The annual 48th Royal-Thomian Boat Race and the 44th Regatta will be worked off on October 28 at Colombo Rowing Club, commencing at 1.p.m. The traditional Boat Race is considered the most prestigious boat contest in Sri Lankan school history and inaugurated in 1962 as a 1000yards competition. Royalists won the inaugural Boat Race and what began as an annual event later went on to become a much loved tradition in both schools.
The Boat Race is a 5-man event, usually rowed by the most experienced and fittest oarsmen of the two schools. The winners will walk away with the Royal Thomian Boat Race Trophy, also known as the Crossed Oars among the rowing fraternity. The Boat Race is the most prominent event in the regatta as it offers 12 points (highest for an individual event) for the overall championship.
The Royal-Thomian Regatta was introduced four years later in 1966 with a line up of six events. The regatta is the oldest inter-school regatta in Sri Lanka and also the third oldest sporting encounter between Royal College and S. Thomas College, lining up behind the Battle of the Blues Cricket Encounter and Rugby Encounter. At present the regatta includes seven events, offering 40 points divided among them.
The two prominent schools possess a great sporting history where as rowing was introduced to Royal College in 1953, making Royal the first Lankan school to do so. Thomians stepped into rowing few years later and continued with traditional rivalry with their arch rivals. The overall winner of the Regatta is awarded the T. Noel Fernando Memorial Trophy while trophies will be awarded to each and every event category winners of the regatta.
Royal rowing captain Hashen Hettigoda said: The entire team is motivated and committed and is in complete anticipation to compete and win the Roy-Tho Regatta. Training was different this year compared to last year, so in terms of preparation it was different to 2016. We had three coaches last year and two coaches this year but the intensity of training was the same. We also had a new trainer who is really training us hard with the use of new techniques and we look forward positively towards the Saturdays big event.
Thomian rowing skipper Arjun Wickramanayake went on to say that they have been training very hard since the beginning of 2017 for this Regatta and it has been quite a challenge for them to strike a balance between their studies and commitment towards training. This year we have a good mix of freshers and senior rowers that formed a well balanced team and we are ready for Saturdays challenge Arjun explained.
Ried Avenue school will be the favourites for this years crown as they have recorded two back-to-back thumping victories in the recent past. Royal won the regatta in 2015 by 48-4 points which was the biggest margin and broke that record in 2016 to emerge victorious by scoring 50 points against only 2 points by St. Thomas College.
Royal rowing teams this years performance won them several titles including Ranfer Regatta (beating Colombo Rowing Club and STC), Over 18 overall at nationals (against Forces) and several club trophies (Gordan Armstrong ,Vanlangenberg, RCYC and Herman Sirimanne and V. A. Julius)

Senanayake urges legal action against Nilame
The President of the Sri Dalada Jathika Viyaparaya R. S. P. B. Senanayake in a written complaint to the Buddhist Affairs Commissioner has requested him to institute legal action against the Diyawadane Nilame and remove him from his post.
He had said he made this complaint because an investigation made by a committee appointed by the Sustainable Development and Buddhist Affairs Ministry had established that a sum of nearly Rs. 262 million had been transferred to Myanmar as the cost of two tuskers presented to the Maligawa by the Myanmar Government, by showing a false invoice. This amounted to an act of money laundering, he said.
Senanayake addressing a press conference in Kandy, said copies of the complaint had been sent to the President, Prime Minister, Sustainable Development and Wildlife and Buddhist Affairs Minister, Foreign Minister and the Attorney General. He said he had requested them to see whether Maligawa funds had been misused for this transaction.
Senanayake said the Karaka Sangha Sabha of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters headed by the two Mahanayake theras had the responsibility to look into this complaint. If the money did not belong to the Maligawa, the Diyawadane Nilame should disclose as to whose money was spent.
Diyawadane Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela when contacted said not even a cent of the Maligawa funds were used for this purpose.
It was a complete distortion of facts to say that a money transaction had taken place, going by the value of the two tuskers gifted mentioned in the transfer papers.

SL still obsolete for smart board
There are tremendous changes happening around the world to prepare the young generation for the modern world. The developed countries have already taken the necessary measures to update their education system because they are financially strong enough to invest a huge amount of money on education. But in Sri Lanka, we are comparatively behind schedule in introducing the latest technology of the education sector.
We are not that much rich enough to introduce the latest technology in our education system. Earlier this year, the Education Ministry launched the Cloud Smart Classroom at the Sri Jayawardenapura Maha Vidyala, Kotte, with the help of the Chief Executive Officer at Codegen Dr Harsha Subasinghe. This is a paradigm shift of education sector to introduce the cutting edge technology in our school system. The government has also allocated Rs.100 billion for education in the Appropriation Bill. All these revolutionary measures have been taken to improve or introduce the innovative technology of the countrys education system.
All these effective measures will not yield proper output owing to drawbacks in the education system. The governments, elected at different times, are used to change the education policy of this country.
Upgrade our education system
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has recently stated: English medium education was introduced in Sri Lanka before many other countries. However, Sri Lanka could not sustain it. Other countries which introduced English medium education after Sri Lanka had managed to benefit more than Sri Lanka.
For example, Singapore used to be identified by people as an island of mosquitoes in the late 1970s. But today, the same country has emerged as one of the most beautiful countries in the world owing to the strong and permanent education policy. Thus it is highly advisable for our country to form a strong and permanent education policy which can be followed by the successive governments.
The government spends millions of rupees every year on education to maintain around 10,000 schools with 4.5 million students and more than 200,000 teachers. Of course, we have achieved several milestones in the education. In the meantime, we have to update and upgrade our education system so as to compete with the international community. This is why we need to bring in changes in methodology in the teaching and learning process. The innovative technologies used at present in the classrooms in the world are more effective than the methodologies used in our classrooms.
Hence this is high time for Sri Lanka to introduce and install a smart board in Sri Lankan classrooms. Before introducing any latest technology or innovative system to the schools, it is necessary to upgrade and update the teaching staff in order to absorb the new technology. Then they will be familiar with technology. This is where the Sri Lankans tend to make blunders.
We introduce the technology without preparing our teachers to use that technology. Introducing technology without a proper plan will be an utter failure as it has been proved so in the past in our country. The principal, teachers and the students of the Sri Jayawardenapura Maha Vidyalaya are quite happy about the Smart Classroom. The teachers claim that it is easy to prepare and teach lessons for the students.
The students in the meantime also responded positively. They do not need to carry textbooks since all the lessons have been already saved on the smart board. Teachers added that this has increased the percentage of the student attendance. The class management has become easier as students are more attentive in the smart classroom than the normal classroom with chalk and talk.
Revolutionising teaching methodology
The new technology will bring a lot of benefits for both the teachers as well as the students. The real problem here is they have selected 17 students from Grade 7 English medium classroom. Every official  well including the Prime Minister - has given positive statements that the Smart Classroom is successful.
When choosing students from a metropolitan school, especially in English medium, it is obvious and it will be definitely successful. The students and teachers are from Colombo surroundings and they can handle English and computer comfortably. But how far is it possible to implement this revolutionising classroom teaching methodology in the remote and rural schools across the island There are many schools functioning in the remote areas without a single English teacher. For instance, there is a national school in Kalpitiya in Puttalam district with only two English teachers for over 2,500 students. The school now badly needs at least six teachers to fulfill their needs. This is the real situation in Sri Lanka.
That said, before introducing the latest and innovative technology into our classrooms it is better to improve our students English competence. Then the students will be able to understand the latest technology themselves with the proper guidance of teachers.

SLC allocates windows for each tournament
Sri Lanka Cricket featured some of the plans for the upcoming domestic tournament which will run for six months and has allocated windows for each and every tournament conducted on behalf of SLC.
"Every tournament has a window so that the provincial associations, clubs as well as the players would know exactly when the tournaments are coming up.

The Division three tournaments we have entrusted to the district cricket associations to conduct the preliminary rounds, the final rounds will be conducted by the provincial cricket associations where the provincial champions will be allowed to go one step ahead to the next tournament, Dissanayake said.
A structure has been prepared for the Premier tournament which will start around the first week of December under three segments league, ODI and T20 and itll be in two stages, the inter club tournament where they will play three-day matches followed by the provincial tournament where the players will play four-day matches using pink balls. The season will conclude around April or early May.
It was also stated that Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara had appointed a committee to look into the schools cricket as well as domestic structure and to advise him on how it should conducted.

Some of the tournament's details are subject to change, with a cricket committee appointed by the Sports Ministry adding their inputs.
We had a very good exchange of views and as far as I know the committee has not completed the final report, but its recomandations for the betterment of the sport will be co-operated into the tournament structure immediately, said Dissanayake.
Earlier the Premier tournament clubs played friendly matches on their own and at their own expense. He further added that SLC has taken that into account and the clubs will be given an opportunity to play friendly matches with a substantial amount of Rs. one million per club for the 24 clubs playing in the first-class tournament.

Martynenko made these remarks during his visit to Colombo where he attended the Graduation Ceremony of new BCS.
"I attended the Software Awards on Friday night. I was hugely impressed. Because the topics they were talking about were the same I could see some of the major countries discussing. I would say fabulous. What I was looking at in terms of small software companies, opposed to big software companies producing advanced software. Fantastic. It was really good. The other thing about software is that it's global. Anyone in the world could write a programme. And Sri Lanka has a very good education system; you have a lot of good programmers and good system. I think it's a great opportunity and IT is your 5th most important industry and is wildly growing," Martynenko said.
The president of BCS also mentioned about Sri Lanka's potential as a country in the field of IT.
"You have a clear focus on education. I read that in your daily press. So while I've been here, I've been reading your business news and your government has a clear focus on skills and skills development education. On Friday (during the graduation ceremony), Mr Harin Fernando (Minister of Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure) talked about his plans for schools and plans for putting technology in to schools. Brilliant. It is really enabling people to use technology. The more people you have, the better. It's a skill. It's not about being stronger than anybody else, not that you need any natural resources. It's not that. It's about people's skills in IT. His plans I think are ones that you should really support."
The BCS is the only Chartered Institute for Information Technology (IT), leading professional and educational society in the field of computer and information systems in the UK and now offers the chartered status to masters of the field.
"We are not a regulated profession like doctors, but we do now have chartered status which is helping people identify that people who have this chartered status is signed up to a code of conduct. It is not regulated by the code of conduct but can have their chartered status removed if they don't behave properly and they are signed up to do an honest and ethical job, That's good progress," Matrynenko said.
The number of people involved in IT related professions are in millions and BCS has over 73,000 members around the globe. Sri Lanka represents 10% of the total member population. It provides a unique service to established practitioners, students as well as those in the early stages of their careers. The regional institute in Sri Lanka has always campaigned for greater recognition and excellence in the IT profession in the country, carrying forward the noble cause of arming the masters in IT through education, training and development.
Martynenko also highlighted the importance of being responsible for the job done by a professional: "In the UK, there are 35 professional engineering institutes, and it took them quite a long time to get there. In our first 60 years, we've made good progress. We've got a good base. We have a good set of qualifications but we still have a lot of work to do. As we move from engineering the back office to maintaining the payrolls, sales ledgers and online transaction processes, we are now working more closely with the public. So providing systems which help Doctors, Lawyers we as computer professionals have to take greater responsibility."
The President of BCS concluded by saying: "Should we engage in discussions with governments, about regulations and rules whether we could help make sure things are open. Our job is to make sure those standards and skills are maintained. So the public and other professions can trust us. But we're a young profession. Sixty years is not that long, it's only one lifetime! Sixty years ago there was no IT. We've gone from that point to where we are now and we've got lot to catch up. This is what we want to do."

The development cycle engaged the management team of South Asia Textiles through a highly inclusive process of strategic planning consisting of eight stages namely, scope, scan, sights, strategy, structure, staff, sustainability/social responsibility and systems.
Given the dynamic, fast-paced and intensely competitive nature of the global fashion industry, the implementation of the strategic plan will enable South Asia Textiles to respond more effectively and profitably to the fast-changing dynamics of the industry.

Commenting on the implementation of the five year strategic plan, Murali Prakash - Group Managing Director/CEO of Lanka Century Investments said, From a Group perspective, for the next five years, South Asia Textiles main focus will be on expanding capacity, quality performance, increasing productivity, innovation and implementing best practices along with techno driven efficiency improvements for management of costs. This exercise has given clear guidelines on the actions and areas that South Asia Textiles needs to focus on, to be more profitable in light of the increased global competition.
In an industry where global markets are shrinking and competition is intense, MTIs 360 degree approach to strategic planning has given South Asia Textiles a good guidance on the actions that need to be taken to take the business forward amidst the dynamic changes taking place in the industry. By implementing the action points agreed, we will be able to create that sustainable competitive advantage South Asia Textile requires in order to compete within the global industry, said Prithiv Dorai  Managing Director/CEO of South Asia Textiles Limited.

Senadeera also said that Cabinet approval has been granted for the setting up of this institution in coordination with the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB), the Geology Department of Peradeniya University , under the supervision of the Disaster Management Centre.
Senadeera added that three experts from each institution would join together to take decisions to be implemented during a three month period, to minimize disasters in the area. He also added that the institution will be established for a period of three months and be extended if required.
Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project - Project Director Dr.Sunil de Silva said the leakage at the Uma Oya Project could be minimised by the end of January, since the measures that have already been taken have proved successful.
He added that an unexpected leakage of 1400 litres of water, per second, has been reduced to about 400 litres per second.
Senadeera added that quick remedial measures taken on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena with experts brought from Norway and Switzerland proving to be a success.
However, theres another 5 km long tunnel that has to be built and the time frame cannot be predicted as the progress is a little bit slow due to the new mechanism, Dr.Silva said. The water table is rising with grouting the leakages and the water levels in the wells would come back to normal when the leakage is brought to Zero, soon. Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Kingsley Rodrigo was also present.

## Date: Friday, October 27, 2017 - 01:00
Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation marks twenty fifth anniversary
The twenty fifth anniversary of the Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation falls in 2017 and during the two-and-half decades the Institute has come a long way in promoting awareness of the subject of taxation in Sri Lanka.
Today taxation has become not only a complicated subject but an indispensable part and parcel of economic activity in the country requiring a thorough knowledge of its legal contents and practical application.
Historically the Institute started modestly and was initially the brain child of a few former colleagues of the Inland Revenue Department particularly Anil Amarasekara. His close association when he was working Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania with Inthiran Chelvathurai, then Secretary General of the Commonwealth of Tax Administrators (CATA) in London, as well as the British Institute of Taxation helped to initiate the project.
On June 22, 1992 he and a few other colleagues including Messrs. C.P.E. Gunasingam, M.S.M.T. Samarathunga, Y. Karunasinghe, A.C.S. Perera, S. Balaratnam and the late Messrs. D.C. Jayakuru, Stanley Fernando and A.C.S. Perera among others initiated the project and after much deliberation and effort succeeded in incorporating the Institute under the Companies Act No.17 of 1982, the certificate of incorporation being issued on October 28, 1992.
The first Council consisted of the above mentioned persons with A.B. Amarasekara as first President of the Institute.
Subsequently, after a lot of further effort they with the assistance of the late Minister Bernard Soysa and after his demise Weerasinghe de Silva MP, introduced the Incorporation Bill in Parliament and the Institute was incorporated under Act of Parliament No.21 of 2000 certified on June 19, 200.
The Institute has come a long way since then and has today become one of the leading institutions in the field of taxation in Sri Lanka. In fact it is the sole institution which deals primarily and exclusively in the field of taxation which is its main and only field of activity.

The objectives of the Institute can be
summarized as follows.
<U+F06E> To create awareness of the subject of taxation among the members of the public and to promote and advance the study of the law and practice of taxation and the principles of economic and political science in relation to taxation and public finance.
<U+F06E> To hold examinations and to grant certificates to persons who have satisfied the Examiners and the Council of the Institute as to their knowledge and ability in the subject of taxation.
<U+F06E> To promote and co-ordinate the dissemination of tax awareness and knowledge with the respective revenue authorities of Sri Lanka.
<U+F06E> To facilitate the exchange of information and views on taxation and the creation of a well informed public opinion on the subject.
<U+F06E> To provide opportunities for the acquisition and dissemination of useful information concerning taxation in Sri Lanka and other countries.
<U+F06E> To make recommendations for the improvement or simplification of tax law and practice, to highlight anomalies in laws relating to taxation and to comment on proposed changes in the laws.
In pursuit of these objectives the Institute has engaged in a number of activities. Primarily it conducts study courses for students of taxation at two levels;
<U+F06E> the Diploma level
<U+F06E> the Professional level
Both these study courses cover the following subjects together with a Case Study.

<U+F06E> Tax Administration
<U+F06E> Principles of Tax Law and Business Law
<U+F06E> Taxation of Individuals and Partnerships
<U+F06E> Value Added Tax and Nation Building Tax
<U+F06E> Taxation of Companies and other entities
<U+F06E> Computation of business profits
<U+F06E> International Taxation
<U+F06E> Tax Case Law and Back Duty
<U+F06E> Tax planning and Anti Avoidance provisions
<U+F06E> Accountancy

A few subject exemptions are available for those who are qualified in accountancy and law. Those who qualify at the Diploma level are admitted to the Professional level and those who are successful followed by an evaluation are awarded certificates and become members of the Institute.
There are basically two types of membership;
<U+F06E> Fellow Member (FTII)
<U+F06E> Associate Member (ATII).
Those who succeed in obtaining membership of the Institute have several professional advantages and avenues. They are officially recognized and are able to engage in professional practice of taxation and are recognized as authorized representatives under Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as well as under section 195 of the new Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017for the purpose of representation for taxpayers in the Inland Revenue Department.
Lectures at the Institute are conducted by trained and qualified professionals in taxation as well as high officials and past officials of the Inland Revenue Department versed in various fields such as accountancy, tax law, appeals, tax administration procedures and other relevant topics.
Apart from the Diploma and Professional study Courses, the Institute has stepped in to assist business, tax practitioners and tax payers to secure a knowledge of the practical day to day problems involving taxation by conducting short courses in such fields as VAT, Simplified VAT, Nation Building Tax (NBT).
Apart from issues in the practical fields of preparing tax returns, submission of tax returns online, conducting appeals, payments of taxes, penalties. These have proved to be extremely popular. Apart from the conducting of lectures, examinations and training tax professionals, the Institute has created public awareness in taxation by holding a number of seminars and workshops for the public on issues of current interest particularly during Budget time and amendments to various tax laws annually.
The Institute during the preparation of the government annual budget forwards its proposals to the Ministry of Finance on various aspects of taxation for consideration in the Budget.
The institute has also participated as institutional partners in international taxation seminars and conducted workshops in the training of foreign tax officials, one example, being the workshop on Tax Appeals conducted by the Institute for Maldivian Tax Tribunal officials in Colombo.
The Institute has also since its inception produced an annual Journal titled the Sri Lanka Tax Review containing numerous articles on relevant topics and current tax issues written by knowledgeable experts in their relevant fields. It also conducts upto date information on such matters as Double Tax Treaties, International Tax News, current Tax data and rates of tax and a Tax Bibliography among others. This has proved extremely useful for students, tax practitioners, academics and taxpayers alike.
The Institute has the potential and capacity to provide assistance in a number of other ways as well. A body like the Institute could focus attention on a wider scope and perspective in relation to fiscal policy and administration at a macro level as well as provide expertise both technical and legal on such matters at a micro level.
The Institute could also provide advice and assistance to the tax administration and the government in making periodic assessment on the functioning and impact on the tax structure to facilitate revenue collection and streamline the tax administration.
From another perspective, the Institute provides a much needed forum for public discussion and the airing of views and grievances of the taxpaying public in relation to fiscal matters in general and specific measures in respect of policy and administrative regulations and procedures impinging on the public.
The Institute thus provides the public and interested socio-economic groups to put forward their views and proposals on fiscal matters in a systematic, methodical and scientific manner which the authorities could take cognizance of.
In marking the 25th anniversary therefore, the Institute of Taxation of Sri Lanka holds great promise for the future with a wide range of activities before it for the benefit of the public. It has also the necessary talent and expertise to fulfill these expectations.
The Institute is currently located at Galle Road, Dehiwala and it also operates a website where information of its activities and facilities are available www.slitaxation.lk or on email [emailprotected].

Surplus.lk, a B2B or B2C construction portal, is designed to simplify the way buyers and sellers with excess supply connect more quickly, dispose their stock and turn their surplus stock into immediate profit, said Riyad Ismail, Chairman of Surplus Web Portal, at a event held earlier yesterday at the official launch and press conference of the Surplus.lk site.
The official launch was done by the Board of Surplus.lk; Anasuya Gunasena, General Manager - Marketing demonstrated the sites features and buying and selling options at the event.
The site was officially unveiled to the general public at the Construct Exhibition 2017 and generated much interest.
Surplus.lk provides an ideal solution for individuals and corporates to transact and benefit from selling, buying or renting construction and industrial inventory and services in one unified website, where they can display any product to interested clients for an unlimited time. Surplus.lk also includes a rating system where the buyer can rate the sellers or service providers based on the quality of the item and the service received.
The sole aim of Surplus.lk is to provide interested sellers or buyers an opportunity to eliminate their surplus inventory and similarly offer potential buyers the opportunity of sourcing of surplus items and services for a fraction of the original cost. The site would also act as a perfect platform to encourage business opportunities between sellers and buyers.
The site offers a vast range of building materials and building products such as bricks, welding rods, ready mix and even excavators and forklifts are listed on the site.
The site thus covers the entire breadth of the engineering sector; the platform offers categories such as services and resources, building material, building products, industrial, tools and equipment for rental or permanent use.

The three prisoners at the Anuradhapura prison will continue their hunger strike for 30 days demanding the adjudication of their cases without any further delay. The National Movement for the Release of Political Prisoners (NMRPP) conducted a protest to release these prisoners who had been transferred from the Vavuniya prison to Anuradhapura prison on October 22 by the Supreme Court.
Convener of NMRPP, Father M. Saththiwel told the Daily News that the matter on prisoners should be solved politically. We want to know the reason for delaying of the process. Relevant authorities have failed to take necessary steps to solve the problem within the 9 years after the war ended. The government cannot take the matter lightly, he said.
Madiarasan Sulakshan, Darshan Ganesh and R. Thirawarul are Tamil prisoners who are held at the Anuradhapura prison. A discussion to ascertain their present status was conducted by NMRPP yesterday at Gurumedura.

The three petitioners stated that the indictments have been filed against them under Section 291 (a) PTA.
They stated that they do not have any relatives or friends in Anuradhapura. They further stated that they speak only Tamil language and it will be hard for them and their family members to retain a lawyer of their choice to the Anuradhapura High Court. They said owing to these reasons they believe that they will be denied a fair trial in the Anuradhapura High Court.

Unemployed graduates should be absorbed into provincial state service
A Medical Degree costs around Rs. 1.8 million. A sum of Rs. 1.5 million has to be spent to obtain a Special Degree, while one has to spend around Rs. 600,000 to get an ordinary Degree. On the other hand a very limited number of students gains entry to the state universities and earn a degree utilizing a massive amount of national wealth. However, thousands of graduates have to hold demonstrations throughout the country demanding employment after earning a degree under tough conditions which is a tragic outcome for the nation, Southern Provincial Councillor (JVP) Nalin Hewage said.
He was speaking at the Council meeting on Tuesday.
He made the above statement particularly to draw the attention of the House over a demonstration launched by a group of unemployed graduates demanding suitable jobs from the respective administrators. The graduates without jobs held the relevant protest in front of the Southern Provincial Council Secretariat at Kalegana , Galle while the council meeting was in progress.
"The rulers of the country do not have the needed perception to make use of the knowledge and brainpower of the educated young generation for the benefit of the country. They do not have a suitable strategy to absorb these learned graduates to the economic process of the country," the SP Councillor pointed out. "After 2012 graduates have not received job from the government. At present there are 75,000 unemployed graduates in the country out of which 14,000 graduates without jobs are from the Southern Province. The Southern Provincial Council should make arrangements to recruit these unemployed graduates when filling the existing job vacancies of the provincial state service," Nalin Hewage said.

Union Bank records impressive 9 months performance in 2017
In the third quarter of 2017, Union Bank continued its strong growth momentum, adding further traction to its strategic business focus of core banking growth and profitability.
As a result of focused efforts on portfolio expansion, the Banks Loans and Advances grew by 22% Year to Date (YTD). The Net Interest Income (NII) rose to Rs 2,318 mn in the 3rd quarter of 2017- an impressive increase of 40% year on year (YoY). During the period under review, the Bank continued to focus on improving NII through prudent management of the net interest margin (NIM) coupled with Total Asset growth.
Union Banks well executed strategic initiatives for Fee Income growth continued throughout the reporting period, resulting in a healthy growth of Net Fee and Commission Income to Rs 495 mn, a 21% increase YoY. This can be mainly attributed to the increase in trade and remittances related fees, deposit related fees as well as loan processing fees collected during the reporting period.
The Banks treasury performance was notable and recorded Rs. 106.1 mn surge in capital gains YoY, which is a significant increase of 88%.
A change in the Asset Mix of the Bank resulted in a dilution of the Net trading income as funds were shifted to Interest Earning Assets from investments in units,
triggering a resultant decline in the income from investment in units by 45% YoY to Rs. 193 mn. Consequently, the total trading income decreased by 15% to Rs. 300 mn. Other operating income fell by 24% YoY to report Rs. 182 mn, largely due to the decline in foreign exchange income.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis has arrived at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea, on the first day of his visit to South Korea.
Mattis will visit Observation Post Ouellette at the heavily-guarded border, where he will be briefed by US and South Korean Joint Security Area Commanders Lt. Col. Matthew Farmer and Lt. Col. Kwon Young-hwan. Earlier on Friday, Mattis visited two US military installations, Osan airbase and the Yongson garrison in Seoul.
The secretary had come to South Korea from Thailand, where he attended the funeral of former King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Mattis' trip to the region comes ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to Asia next week.
Trump will most likely forgo a visit to the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea when he visits Asia, a senior White House official said earlier this week, bypassing what has been a symbolic opportunity for US commanders-in-chief to stare into the Hermit Kingdom.
Citing scheduling conflicts in an already jammed itinerary, the official did not rule out entirely a visit to the demilitarized zone.
But, speaking to reporters, the official downplayed the importance of stopping at the DMZ, which the past three US presidents have visited during trips to South Korea.

FROM VLADIMIR TO VLADIMIR- 100 years since October Revolution
RUSSIA: Vladimir Ilyich Lenin  one of the worlds foremost proponents of revolution  set out to replace Russias feudal social order with a dictatorship of the proletariat.
Lenin ruthlessly cracked down on dissent using the Red Terror, carried out by the Cheka secret police, and his propaganda of lies for strategic advantage.
A century later President Vladimir Putin has expanded Russias territorial boundaries with the annexation of Crimea, and has allegedly manipulated European and American elections by using cyber warfare to spread propaganda.
One century ago the Russian Revolution  an attempt to create a more just nation  sealed the fate of the Romanov dynasty, formed the Soviet Union and led to more than 70 years of communist rule. Today, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenins embalmed body lies in a Moscow mausoleum.
The centenary Revolution Day* presents a dilemma for Russias current President Vladimir Putin. He reveres the Soviet Union, which he served as a Communist party member and KGB officer, but hates the concept of the popular uprising that created it.
Last year Putin ordered Kremlin strategist Sergei Kirienko to tell Russias state media companies to play down the occasion -- it should be discussed only by experts and historians. However, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation plans a series of events in St.Petersburg in November.
*The October 24-25 anniversary of the revolution is officially celebrated on November 7 in Russia because the country switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar following the revolution.
It is 100 years on Wednesday, using Russias old calendar, since Vladimir Lenins Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace in what is now St Petersburg and took power. Not a lot has changed.
Well, not in economic terms, according to research by Renaissance Capital, an investment bank specializing in the region. It says the Russias of 1917 and 2017 have more in common than might be expected.
Take, for example, debt. Just before the Red October revolution, around a third of Russian debt was held by foreigners. Same today.
Pre-1917, foreigners got 5-8 percent dividend yields from Russian utility shares. Same today.
Pre-Soviet Russia lagged the major world powers in industrial might, but was considered on a par with Brazil and Mexico. Pretty much the same as today.
Raw materials were pre-1917 Russias mainstay, comprising two-thirds of its exports. It is still two-thirds in 2017, Renaissance, an emerging markets-focused investment bank, says.
Finally, Russia was the worlds biggest exporter of grain back then. The bank calculates that over 2015-17, the countries of old imperial Russia were again the worlds biggest exporter of grain.
This is not to say, of course, that nothing has changed. The Soviet era, for example, brought widespread literacy, although RenCap economist Charlie Robertson notes todays most successful areas in Russia are where 1917 literacy was the highest.
The Soviet Union also saw industrialization, albeit uncompetitive compared with Britain, the United States and Japan.

While the company ended the quarter with an order intake of EUR 1.35 billion, up from EUR 1.13 billion reported in the same period a year earlier, its net sales increased by 9% to EUR 1.17 billion from EUR 1.07 billion in the corresponding periods.
For the nine-month period ended September 30 Wrtsils order intake was up by 15% to EUR 4.13 billion from EUR 3.6 billion seen in the first nine months of 2016. Net sales for the same period increased 7% to EUR 3.47 billion from EUR 3.24 billion.
I am pleased with the continued growth in order intake. In addition to good demand for our power generation solutions, we received an order to build our third LNG terminal in Finland, which will be located in Hamina. The project will provide cleaner fuel for both marine transport applications and local industry, Jaakko Eskola, President and CEO, said. A favourable contracting mix in the marine markets supported order intake growth in Marine Solutions, according to Eskola.
He added that the high level of activity in the cruise segment over the past few years has lengthened delivery times for both yards and equipment suppliers, while the continued demand for long-term service agreements resulted in order intake growth also for Services.
The companys total order book at the end of the review period was stable at EUR 5.07 billion, compared to EUR 5.02 billion seen a year earlier. The Services order book totalled EUR 1.19 billion, surging by 16% from the same period last year due to increased demand for long-term service agreements. The Energy Solutions order book increased by 10%, while the Marine Solutions order book decreased by 12%.
Wrtsils third quarter operating result was EUR 130 million, against EUR 122 million seen in 2016. For the review period January-September 2017 the operating result was EUR 327 million, rising from EUR 301 million.

Weerawansas remarks were a tirade against democracy: Wijenaike
National Organizer of the National Freedom Front (NFF), Piyasiri Wijenaike yesterday, denounced the comments made by his own Party leader Wimal Weerawansa MP that a bomb attack should be launched on Parliament.
Addressing a media briefing in Yakkala, former Minister Wijenaike said that he had confronted the NFF Secretary and sought answers to the comments made by Weerawanse.
As the National Organizer of the NFF, I questioned the Party Secretary as to why our leader had made such a comment when the Partys Central Committee had taken no such decision. The comments made by Weerawansa were wrong. I can assure you that the comments made by him were not the Partys view. Maybe they were his personal views, Wijenaike said.
The NFF National Organizer went on to say that Weerawansas remarks were a tirade against democracy.
I think stating that a bomb attack should be launched on the Parliament of a peaceful country is also an attack against democracy. As the National Organizer of the NFF, I say that this comment is wrong, even if it was made by our own party leader. I can assure you that this is not the Partys stance.
Wijenaike also said that as the National Organizer of the NFF, he would wish to apologize to the entire Parliament for the derogatory comments made by one of his party members.
Wijenaike further noted that the comments made by his party leader could be detrimental to the country which was now marching on the path towards peace after defeating the scourge of terrorism which plagued the country for nearly three decades.
Weerawansa's comments have garnered severe criticism from many quarters during the last few days.
Meanwhile, the Speaker has informed that as soon as Parliament meets again, MP Weerawansa's threat would be brought to the Parliament's attention and further action would be taken.

West Ham stun Spurs to reach League  Cup quarters, Chelsea win
London: West Ham completed a stunning turnaround on Wednesday, roaring back from two goals down against Tottenham Hotspur to reach the League Cup quarter-finals while Chelsea saw off the challenge of Everton.
Slaven Bilics much-changed side were trailing 2-0 at the break after an insipid first-half display but a brace from Andre Ayew and a third from Angelo Ogbonna shocked the Wembley crowd and completed an astonishing comeback for the Premier League strugglers.
Spurs, who also made multiple changes, were quickly in control through an early goal from Moussa Sissoko, who strolled through the middle of the defence and stroked the ball past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian after a pass from Son Heung-Min.
They doubled their lead with about eight minutes remaining in the first half when Dele Alli curled the ball into the net via a deflection off the unfortunate Declan Rice, again following good work down the left from the impressive Son.
But the game came alive within 10 minutes of the re-start when Ayew pounced to poke home from close range after Spurs keeper Michel Vorm failed to hold a powerful Edimilson Fernandes shot from the edge of the area.
West Ham, who crashed 3-0 to Brighton in the Premier League on Friday, were level just five minutes later when Ayew applied the finishing touch to a cross by Manuel Lanzini and astonishingly took the lead when Ogbonna rose to head home Lanzinis corner with 20 minutes to go.
We could not wait for the game to start and I would hope the Brighton game was a one-off, said Bilic. We have composure, players back from injury and this is the standard of play (we expect).
I said I am calm and glad when we win in this way, he added. You see the team is very alive and we are very stubborn in a positive way. There is no time and place to go large now. We have done a lot, but considering the season, we have done nothing.
Spurs made seven changes to the side that thumped Liverpool 4-1 at the weekend, leaving out the likes of Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen from the starting line-up while Cheikhou Kouyate and Lanzini were the only survivors for West Ham from their defeat to Brighton. Disappointed Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said his side showed a lack of aggression to concede three goals in 15 minutes.
Maybe we thought the job was done, he said. The second half was not the same and it is difficult to accept.
Chelsea win
At Stamford Bridge, David Unsworths first match as Evertons caretaker manager ended in a 2-1 defeat for his much-changed side at the hands of Chelsea.
The club favourite, who has spoken of his desire to permanently succeed the sacked Ronald Koeman, presided over an improved performance.
Everton played with confidence and energy and repeatedly threatened but were 2-0 down following goals from Antonio Rudiger and a late strike by Willian and could only manage a consolation from substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin deep into time added on.
Unsworth told BBC Radio: Nobody likes losing games.
Im a bad loser but I have to say Im proud of the performance, they were terrific. We are disappointed to lose. We think we had chances to get something from the game.
Chelsea made nine changes to the side that beat Watford in the Premier League at the weekend, handing a debut to former Leicester City midfielder Danny Drinkwater.
West Ham and Chelsea join Arsenal, Bournemouth, Bristol City, Leicester City, Manchester United and Manchester City in the draw for the quarter-finals on Thursday. AFP

West Indies A looking for  winning formula for final test
KINGSTON, Jamaica: Windies A Team head coach Graeme West said his players needed to revisit the blueprint for winning the first Test against Sri Lanka A to find the formula for winning the final match of their series that began on Thursday under lights at Sabina Park.
The three-match series is level 1-1, after Windies A won the first Test by an innings and 13 runs at the Trelawny Multiplex on the Jamaica north coast two Saturdays ago, and Sri Lanka A recovered to win the second Test by 280 at the same venue a week later.
West said his side had done a number of things correctly in the first Test, but they had failed to maintain the good habits in the second match, leading to their downfall, and now faces a major challenge to win the final game to achieve their goal of a series victory over competitive opponents on home soil.
First, the bowlers need to continue doing what they have been doing, he told CWI Media. The pace bowlers have been aggressive, but they have also maintained good lines and lengths, and the spinners have been probing and when the conditions have allowed, they have been able to attack, so we need a lot more of the same there.
In the field, we need to be a little bit sharper with our close catching. In front and behind the wicket, we missed a number of half chances, but they do make a difference. But its the batting, we need to go back to the first game, where he had a hundred, half-centuries and hundred partnerships, and players make solid contributions down the order.
The first innings is going to be crucial for us to be able to set up the game, whether we bat first or second, and we need to make 300 runs-plus in the first innings to get ourselves into a good position in the game. I have now been involved in eight games with Sri Lanka A in four-day matches and the two in which we have been successful are the two in which we made more than 300 in an innings, so thats a good indication of what we need to do.
On the failure in the second Test, West said: To their credit, the bowlers performed pretty well in line with the first game, but the Sri Lankan batsmen applied themselves a little bit more. We had to work harder for our wickets, but our batting unit let the side down in both innings, particularly the first innings.
In four-day matches, the first innings is always important and having dismissed Sri Lanka A for under 300 on a reasonably good pitch, we batted way below where we needed to be and put ourselves under a lot of pressure, and it was downhill from there.
It was a little unusual the way we batted. We lost many of our wickets in the first innings playing defensively and we lost most of our wickets in the second innings playing attacking shots, so clearly we failed to find the right balance of a good defence and making good decisions about when to take on the bowling, particularly Malinda Pushpakumara.
Our method of trying to play Pushpakumara is something we had to go back and revisit because he dominated pretty much every time he came on to bowl. If we are going to be competitive and eventually successful in the third game, this is an area with which we will have to handle.
On what has excited him most about his sides performance, West said: It was exciting to see Oshane Thomas bowl in only his second first-class match. He bowled with pace, but given his lack of experience, he dealt very well with the conditions and the batsmen against whom he played.
Also, Oshanes ability to bowl quite a long spell in the second innings was a huge credit to him. With the right support, he is someone that could really progress.
Rahkeem Cornwall is getting better with every game that he plays. Hes coming off a period of shorter form matches and he is beginning once again to develop that ability to bowl long spells, sustain pressure and take wickets at the same time.
Sunil Ambris has also handled himself very well with the bat in both matches. He has looked accomplished and a level above most of the batting that has been on display in the games.

Wimal threatens to bomb Parliament
Attempts to prevent adoption of new Constitution:Govt attacked for carrying out peoples mandate:
National Movement for a Just Society Convener Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya urged the Government not to give way to the pressures of racist and extremist elements trying to sabotage the Constitution making process.
Speaking to the Daily News, Prof. Wijesuriya called on the Government to go ahead with its pre-election promise, observing that the people have given a clear mandate to formulate a new Constitution.
Speaking out his opinion over the recent offensive comments against Constitution making by Retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne, Retired Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa, Prof. Wijesuriya said it is high time President Maithripala Sirisena, the Common Candidate who pledged to bring in a new Constitution, takes a firm and bold stand against racism.
Two former military personnel who held high ranks had stated that those who support a new Constitution must be condemned as traitors and killed. MP Weerawansa had stated that Parliament should be bombed. These comments prove their anti-democratic stance. They are trying to instigate terror and encourage blood-shed in the country again, Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya said.
Emphasizing that Constitutional reforms are needed to achieve meaningful reconciliation, Prof Wijesuriya said the country cannot move forward without national reconciliation.
Common Candidate Sirisena asked for a peoples mandate on January 8, 2015 with the pledge to abolish executive presidency. Reconciliation and power sharing were among other things highlighted. A new Constitution is needed to achieve the above three goals. Even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has made the promise to abolish Executive Presidency. The Joint Opposition members who agitate against the new Constitution are well aware that no draft has been prepared and all proposals are still at discussion level. What they are trying to do is to spoil the peoples mind-sets to cater to their own political agenda. I see the ugly head of racism behind this vicious campaign, Prof. Wijesuriya said.
Ven. Dambara Amila Thera of the Bhikkhu Front for Good Governance in the meantime was of the view that the recent outburst was a result of Weerawansa and his supporters being attacked at the right place, they have become unsettled and angry, he said.
Their masters are expected to be arrested and brought before courts on charges of murder and corruption. To avoid that, all they can do is oppose everything the government does and try to derail their programmes and try to topple the government, Ven. Amila Thera said.
When it comes to Constitution making, Ven. Amila Thera was of the view that they were trying to intimidate all by saying that they will bomb Parliament and that all those who engaged in it are traitors.
Their main aim is to topple the government to fulfill their own personal interests, Ven. Amila Thera said.
Commenting on Major General Kamal Gunaratnes statements, the Thera observed that it was noteworthy that the statements were made on a stage where the former Defence Secretary too was present.
At a time when we have allegations of human rights violations against the country and it is a risky time for us internationally, we have a Major General who fought the war in the presence of the former Defence Secretary making such statements of killing traitors. Such statements make people wonder and cast aspersions on the Major General if he would have actually fought the war. Many can think that they might have committed crimes, given their statement, Ven. Amila Thera said.
These two are clearly motivating people to violence and violating the laws in the Penal Code and such threats even amount to terrorism. We need to stress that action should be taken against these people in future, Ven. Amila Thera added.
Senior Lecturer at the Department of History, University of Colombo, Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri too reiterated that Major General Kamal Gunaratnes statement needed to be taken very seriously.
It is a threat to people who operate with a conscience. The threat to kill traitors because they dont agree with him has to be condemned by any democratic citizen, Dr. Dewasiri said.
National Bhikku Front, Secretary Ven. Walamulle Uditha Thera delivering a special statement to the media said not only legal action must be taken on Wimal Weerawansas statement but he should also be subjected to a psychiatric examination.
Weerawansa is a paranoid person, he looks at everything with fear and suspicion. A person who does not believe in democracy cannot make such a statement in a democratic society. This statement is a serious one. It has to be definitely investigated into. This is similar to someone making a threat against someones life. They can kill them or not. The government should also find out where they can source these bombs, Ven. Uditha Thera said.
He further stated that Weerawansa and his supporters were a group who have lost power, and fallen. And they have come to the point where they think that they should acquire power with the aid of bombs. That is why they are making such statements. They have understood that if they do not somehow get into power, they will have no escape from all the cases lodged against them. The Joint Opposition is a group of people who have all the crimes to their name, perhaps they are uttering such statements to distract the people from their own dirty laundry, said Ven. Uditha Thera.
A law abiding citizen cannot make a statement saying he is going to bomb the supreme body of this country. Of the 23 million people living in this country, why does he have such destructive and violent thoughts The government should look into his mental state, said Uditha Thera.
General Secretary Aryange Ekamuthuwa, Ven. Bendiwewe Diyasena Thera in the meantime said Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa was only promoting terrorism by suggesting that a bomb attack should be made on Parliament to prevent this adoption of a new Constitution. Although the joint opposition group led by Weerawansa had tried to topple the government through various means in the past and their efforts had miserably failed, he said.
Ven. Diyasena thera said the threat posed by Weerawansa clearly proved their inner feelings despite their open pronouncements about democracy.
He said the Joint Opposition should announce its stand on Weerawansa's anti-democratic statement without remaining silent.
Founder Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) Dr Pakiyasothy Saravanamuttu asked that the Speaker of Parliament take stern action against the Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Weerawansa over his irresponsible and offensive statement made on the new Constitution.
Dr. Saravanamuttu said that being Parliamentarians they should be very responsible and should not make such statements and the task of Constitutional reform should be continued.
In the meantime Government Nursing Officers' Union Chairman Saman Rathnapriya said that it was high time that a new Constitution is brought. He added that there was wide acceptance that a new Constitution was required for establishing permanent peace, reconciliation and development. He also added that it was compulsory as 6.2 million people gave their mandate to elect President Maithripala Sirisena to keep his pledge of bringing about a new Constitution.
He further said that Weerawansa's statement ridiculed the Parliamentary system. Being a member he suggested that Parliament be destroyed rather than being willing to contribute to the new Constitution by way of proposals. "It is natural for him to have such destructive thoughts as his brother-in-law too was involved in a bomb blast in Parliament," Rathnapriya said.
Rathnapriya said that even Retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne had made such a similarly violent and racist statement. "Wimal Weerawansa and Kamal Gunaratne are in the same group of Mahinda Rajapaksa who are attempting to come into power," Rathnapriya said. "The people in the country should realize that if their statements are so violent even when they have no power, imagine how brutal they would be when they get power So we think they would be dealt by law over their statements, said Rathnapriya.
Two former military personnel who held high ranks had stated that those who support a new Constitution must be condemned as traitors and killed.
MP Weerawansa had stated that Parliament should be bombed. These comments prove their anti-democratic stance.

Yala under threat
The most frequently voiced complaint against Yala National Park on all international travel sites is that it is overcrowded. Lacontessa1 from Maryland, USA wrote on Trip advisor in September 2017, that she would love to visit the Park but was worried that all reviews of the park were discouraging and complained about noisy tourists, crowds of vehicles, revving engines and a long wait to enter the park.
Unsurprisingly, she is not alone. According to Rohan Wijesinghe, a committee member of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) of Sri Lanka, 70 percent of tourists to the park said they would not come back because though they spotted game, the experience was so bad that it was not worth it.
We need quality experiences so that tourists will keep coming back, he said addressing a media briefing at the BRC clubhouse on Wednesday (25) evening.
Overcrowding at Yala National Park, the most frequently visited national park in the country has been a major concern for many years. According to the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC), in 2016 Yala, a park of 378 square miles had a total number of 658,277 visitors enter the park in over 700 registered jeeps. In comparison, Kruger National Park in South Africa, which extends over 7,523 square miles only had 950,000 people visit it annually.
H.M.M.C. Senevirathna and P.K.P. Perera in their journal article Wildlife Viewing Preferences of Visitors to Sri Lankas National Parks: Implications for Visitor Management and Sustainable Tourism Planning note that Heavy visitor arrivals to national parks are known to cause negative impacts such as interruptions to the behaviour of wildlife including habituation, littering, damages to vegetation and increased cases of visitor non-conformities with environmental standards and park policy.
In addition, limited perceptions of wildlife viewing can lead to the devaluation of biodiversity in a particular protected area, and this in turn can lead to negligence of valuable biological resources for conservation by state agencies, stated Senevirathna and Perera.
The problem according to the former DWC Director General, Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, started in 2008 and by 2016, the number of visitors to the park had grown by over 1,000 percent.
These numbers have helped the park increase their income substantially with the park earning over Rs. 612 million in 2016 alone, compared to Rs. 168 million in 2011. In addition, a recent study done by Srilal Mittapala, a past President of the Hotel Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) showed that the economic value of the park was over Rs. 8 billion annually to all stakeholders with the hotels in the area earning close to Rs. 7 billion. Block 1 alone is stated to have 1,400 beds surrounding it. More importantly, Mittapalas research showed that jeep drivers earn close to Rs. 527 million a year, approximately 86 percent of what the Park makes in a year.
The increased revenue for both parties however, has come at a high cost to the flora and fauna which sustain the park.
Saving the Park
If it continues the way it does and the tourist numbers grow, the park will not last for very long, said Vice President of WNPS, Ranil Peiris.
His concerns have been shared in many quarters and it led to the Prime Ministers Office in 2016 appointing a Committee headed by Dr. Pilapitiya to look into ways in which visitor numbers in Yala could be reduced. Their report titled An Action Plan for Improving the Overall Wildlife Tourism Experience in Yala National Park (Block 1) was submitted to the Prime Ministers Office in March this year. They proposed 31 short term, nine medium term and two long term solutions to solve overcrowding in the park.
Prior to recommending solutions, we studied the issues which led to this and analysed the obstacles for implementation, said Dr. Pilapitiya.
The committee had unanimously agreed that the best way to lessen overcrowding was to limit the number of jeeps which entered the park and to enforce driver discipline. The fastest solution to implement was also to ensure divers adhered to set driving regulations.
They had also suggested that surrounding national parks such as Lunugamvehera and Bundala be further developed so visitor concentrations in Yala can be reduced.
The main obstacle to implementing such regulations, according to Dr. Pilapitiya, was political interference and lack of systematic planning in rolling out the regulations.
His remarks turned out to be accurate as the wildlife authorities who reopened the park which was closed for almost two months due to drought, a week earlier than scheduled, decided to implement limitations on jeep entry within a span of five days.
According to reliable sources, a meeting held on October 18 with the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, Department of Wildlife and the Prime Ministers Office, decided that the park would be reopened early and that the Department would have to roll out limits on jeep entry by October 23. A press release issued by the DWC stated that the park was opened early due to a request made by the Minister of Housing and Construction, Sajith Premadasa.
This sudden and unplanned programme, said Dr. Pilapitiya was the reason that the Department faced such a backlash from Jeep Driver Associations.
Decisions made too soon
On Monday (23), Jeep Driver Associations launched a protest against what they saw as an unfair attack on their livelihoods. Kadiripura Jeep Association, Secretary Wasantha Vithanage speaking to Daily News stated that many of the drivers had bought their jeeps on lease and that if jeep numbers were reduced they would be affected and demanded that the usual number of jeeps be allowed to enter the park.
Secretary to the Ministry, R.M.D.B. Meegasmulla explained that there was no reason for drivers to protest according to their plan. The Ministry together with DWC had proposed that there be three sessions each day with 100 vehicles being allowed from the Palatupana entrance and 50 from the Katagamuwa entrance during each session. Thus, 450 jeeps would be allowed to enter the park each day.
This would also ensure that all 600 jeep owners registered with us enter the park every other day, said Meegasmulla.
We can amend the system as we go on, assured the Ministry Secretary. He added that the DWC had also taken steps to develop the roads in Block 3,4, and 5 so that people would explore those areas, thus reducing the traffic within Block 1 and 2.
The animals in 3,4 and 5 are still not used to human presence but we think that as more go in there they will get used to it. These Blocks have a similar number of game to Block 1 and 2, said Meegasmulla.
Wildlife Director General, M.G.C. Sooriyabandara who has been busy trying to resolve the crisis held discussions with the Driver Associations on Thursday evening and said they would resolve the matter once they come to a final solution with the minister.
Minister Perera in the meantime, speaking to Daily News said they were open to discussions with the drivers but they were firm in their decision that 600 jeeps would not be allowed to enter Yala daily.
We have to control this. There is a World Bank project being carried out in Yala, CITES heads are coming to visit in January and we also have to implement the plan from the Prime Ministers Office. We cannot let this go on. I have explained this matter to Minister Premadasa too, said Minister Perera.
He is expected to meet with the Driver Associations this morning (27) to come to a final agreement.
The issue could have been avoided 
As the Jeep Driver Associations and government fight over numbers, former DG Wildlife, Dr. Pilapitiya stated that the problem could have been easily avoided if the officials were allowed to carry out their job without political interferences.
In 2015 we had the Reawakening Yala programme, in 2016 we started to implement it. We were able to successfully implement that because the Department did not allow political interferences, said Dr. Pilapitiya.
For an example, in the early months of 2016,Yala Park Warden, Suranga Rathnayake was able to ban over 70 jeeps and we did not have a single protest, he said.
Dr. Pilapitiya stressed that the difference between then and now was that the drivers knew then that the law was being applied to all equally, with no political preference in mind.
Rathnayakes actions though beneficial to the Park, had political consequences and he was soon transferred out and Dr. Pilapitiya explained that such political interferences led to his own resignation from the Department.
Government officers need to be given a free hand to enforce the law and the right environment to work in, he said.
As the Chairman of the Committee appointed to look into visitor numbers in Yala, he also explained that the Department needed to have been given more time to implement the programme and that would have given it a greater chance of success.
Commenting on the system proposed this week, Dr. Pilapitiya noted that it was a positive step to not have all 600 vehicles in the park at the same time, but it also opened up questions of how these vehicles would be monitored during each session and ensured that only the set number enters each time.
The DWC, he said faced grave challenges in monitoring the actions of errant drivers due to limited staff, We had 500 approved cadre positions which were not filled because the Treasury had not approved their salaries, said Dr. Pilapitiya.
The easiest method to have compliance thus, was to have drivers themselves conform to the rules.
We cannot create a social problem as we set out to solve an environmental one. Vehicle numbers have to be limited progressively and done in a manner which will not affect their livelihood.
Jeep drivers do not have problems with the rules. They only want the law to apply to all equally. It is easier to get an agreement with jeep drivers than politicians, said the former Wildlife DG.
