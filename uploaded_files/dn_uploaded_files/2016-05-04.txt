Young drives EZY Racing to podium in New Zealand
Whangarei, New Zealand: EZY Racings Mike Young, the youngest driver in the FIA Asia Pacific Rally Championship (APRC), made a strong come back after being classified last on day one to finish third overall at the first round of the championship held at the International Rally of Whangarei this weekend.
23-year-old Young showed tremendous pace during Fridays recce run where he raised hopes of a miraculous victory against the superior MRF Skoda R5 team.
Unfortunately, local favourite Young had his hopes for a good finish fade after an electrical problem with his Cusco EZY Racing Subaru Impreza meant the car lost all power at the start line of the first Super Special Stage on Friday night. Young was forced to miss the stage and incur the subsequent 14 minute time penalty to get valuable championship points.
This is obviously a disappointing start to the rally for us. Were still not entirely sure what happened but as soon as we turned the spotlights on, the car just died. The team at Cusco are working on it and were sure itll be ready to go again tomorrow, said a hopeful Young, on Friday. However, The Kiwi Duo Mike Young and Malcolm Read with their mad skills fought back hard to gain new ground with a strong display of the Sri Lankan teams passion and guts. Young, battled his way through eight stages to be placed third, only 14 minutes and 10 seconds behind race leader Gaurav Gill, making those wonder if Young could have won the rally if not for the unfortunate 14 minute penalty on day 1.
With road conditions changing several times throughout the weekend, from dry and dusty on Saturday, to wet and muddy on Sunday, Young and Read were able to stay consistent due to the near-perfect set up of the Cusco EZY Racing Subaru Impreza.
Commenting on the brilliant comeback, the elated founder and CEO of EZY Racing, Shafraz Hamzadeen said Mike continues to prove that he is a contender to be taken seriously,with prodigious driving skills that were displayed over the weekend. Kudos to the boys at Cusco for giving us a brilliant car that could challenge for the championship. The penalty was unfortunate, but it also meant Mike threw in his all for the rally.
EZY Racing Team who since partnering with Cusco and Mike Young in 2015 have had a podium in every International Rally they have completed were given a strong start for the 2016 Rally Championship.
The New Zealand and Australian roads encourage fast and sweeping driving styles. It is encouraging to note that we are able to finish within 10 seconds of the rally leader over a 2 hour long rally time. Its going to be a long season and we are eagerly looking forward to Australia to see how we could consolidate this new beginning of ours. said Mike. The next round of the Asia Pacific Championship Rally is based around Australias Sunshine Coast at the International Rally of Queensland on June 18 and 19. It is the second round based in the Pacific region and will see crews battle it out over 16 closed special stages across 240 kilometers.

The benefits of playing in England
Touring is all about learning and educating oneself on the pitches, conditions and culture of the people in the country. It is an education in itself and there is no better place to learn them than in England.
Many past cricketers have confirmed that no international cricket career is complete without a tour of England.
So the 17 players selected to represent Sri Lanka in the three-match Test series of the upcoming tour to England should consider themselves lucky to be a part of that elite lot.
It is not everyone that gets a chance to be picked for a tour of England. There have been many international cricketers who have shone on the field but were extremely unlucky not to make a tour to England.
Why the experts insist that a tour of England is a must is because of the challenges it throws up for every batsman and bowler due to the constant change in the climate and subsequently the pitches.
In the subcontinent once you have got your eye in and settled down you know the ball will not do anything unusual unless there is something wrong with the pitch. You can be certain that unless you make a mistake there is a hundred for yours for the taking. Similarly the bowlers know after a few overs how best to bowl on the surface and what it offers for them.
But in England even after you have settled in and have set yourself up for a hundred the next ball can either beat you or get you out. The batsmen could suddenly be wondering whether he has just walked into bat because even after spending hours in the middle and having got on top of the bowling you will still be open to the elements that could get you out.
That is why playing cricket in England is an education in itself because it teaches you to discipline yourself and test your concentration to the limit.
A good example of how a season in England could tighten your technique and make you a prolific run-getter is Aravinda de Silva, arguably the best batsman produced by Sri Lanka thus far.
De Silva had all shots in the book including the hook shot which one rarely sees batsmen play in modern day cricket. The problem with De Silva was his temperament and his shot selection. He was referred to as Mad Max because he used to tear the bowlers to pieces in the initial part of his innings and then throw his wicket away when a hundred beckoned him.
A full season with English county side Kent made a world of difference to De Silvas approach to the game. He had turned himself into a disciplined cricketer knowing which balls to hit and which balls to leave alone. Gone were those rash shots that had led to his downfall. The transformation in his batting was immense.
He scored 13 of his 20 Test centuries after his stint with Kent and that included two instances of scoring three consecutive centuries in a Test series against Pakistan and against India. He signed off his career with a double century against Bangladesh. However the high point of De Silvas career was playing two classic knocks in the semi-final against India at Kolkata and in the final against Australia at Lahore that helped his country win the Cricket World Cup in 1996.
If you are a bowler the conditions and pitches teaches you how to swing the ball in the air and to get your line and length right, if not the batsmen could hurt you. It has always been advisable to bowl a fuller length in England where the bowler gets the opportunity to make the batsman to edge the ball into the slips cordon. English conditions have always encouraged swing bowling especially in the early part of the summer where Sri Lanka are touring.
At times even the England captain can get flummoxed by his own weather. In 1984 when Sri Lanka made their maiden Test appearance at Lords, David Gower, the English skipper called correctly and invited Sri Lanka, then the minnows of Test cricket to bat first.
Gower had his reasons for inserting the inexperienced opponents in for when he went out for the toss there was a heavy cloud cover that would encourage swing bowling and England had in their ranks the likes of Jonathan Agnew, Ian Botham, Richard Ellison and Paul Allott. But two days later Gowers team was still on the field chasing down boundaries as Sri Lanka rattled up an impressive 491-7 declared.
Paul Downton the England wicket-keeper summed the situation up nicely when he said, It was a classic London morning: overcast, a patchy forecast and the pitch looked a little green.
If things went right they could have been four or five down by lunchtime. But we were fooled by the conditions.
Literally as we walked out, the clouds parted and the sun shone. There was no swing and the ball wouldn't go past the bat. The rest is history.

Joy as Hazard brings Leicester historic title
Londres, Monday: Leicester City completed their fairytale Premier League title quest on Monday after Tottenham Hotspur could only manage a 2-2 draw in a pulsating game with outgoing champions Chelsea.
With Leicester's players gathered at the home of striker Jamie Vardy to watch the match on television, Spurs went 2-0 up, only for goals from Gary Cahill and substitute Eden Hazard to bring Chelsea level and complete one of the most astonishing stories in professional sport.
"It's an unbelievable feeling. I've never known anything like it," said Vardy, who was shown jubilantly celebrating Spurs' result with his team-mates in a video posted on Twitter by left-back Christian Fuchs.
"We were scrapping to stay in the league last season and on Saturday we'll be lifting the trophy.
"It's the biggest achievement in the history of a great club and we all feel privileged to be part of it."
Claudio Ranieri's side, 5,000-1 outsiders who were at the foot of the table just over a year ago, can now look forward to a title party when they lift the trophy at their King Power Stadium home following Saturday's game with Everton.
The modest Thai-owned club are England's first new title-winners since Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest side of 1978 and their surge to glory in the world's most-watched football championship has won them admirers across the globe.
"I'm so proud," Leicester manager Ranieri said in comments published on the website of the club he joined in 2015. "I never expected this when I arrived. I'm a pragmatic man."
"The players have been fantastic," the Italian added. "Their focus, their determination, their spirit has made this possible. Every game they fight for each other and I love to see this in my players. They deserve to be champions." Leicester's previous best season in the English top flight was a second-place finish in 1929 and their last piece of silverware had been the 2000 League Cup.
"I've never known a spirit like the one between these boys. We're like brothers," said Leicester captain Wes Morgan, who scored the equaliser in their 1-1 draw at Manchester United on Sunday.
"Saturday can't come quickly enough. I can't wait to get my hands on the trophy."
Leicester's former striker Gary Lineker, who promised to present the BBC's flagship Match of the Day television programme in his underwear if they won the title, said their achievement was "impossible". "I can't think of anything that surpasses it in sporting history," said the former England striker. "It is difficult to put over in words."
Fans in the east Midlands city of Leicester gathered to watch the game in bars and pubs, roaring on Chelsea, the outgoing champions, as if supporting their own team.
There were scenes of delirium at Hogarths pub, near the cathedral where 15th-century monarch Richard III was reinterred in March last year, supposedly sparking the team's rise to glory.
Supporters spilled into the surrounding streets afterwards, chanting the names of Ranieri and 22-goal top scorer Vardy, who was named the Football Writers' Association (FWA) Footballer of the Year earlier in the day. Algerian winger Riyad Mahrez was previously elected the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Player of the Year, becoming the first African player to win the award.
Mauricio Pochettino's young Spurs team needed to win all three of their final games, starting with Monday's match at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground, to stand any chance of claiming their club's first league title since 1961.
But having been held 1-1 by West Bromwich Albion on their previous outing, they failed to close out victory again.
"I want to congratulate Leicester and Claudio Ranieri and all the players," said Spurs head coach Pochettino.

Australia stretches lead over India
Australia has opened up a six-point gap over India at the top of the MRF Tyres ICC Test Team Rankings following the annual update with the results from 2012-13 no longer included in the calculations and outcomes from the 2014-15 series weighted at 50 per cent.
India now leads third-placed Pakistan by just one point. Pakistan has benefitted from the annual update as defeat against South Africa by 3-0 in 2012-13 no longer counts, while the 2-0 loss to Sri Lanka in 2014-15 has its weighting reduced to 50 per cent.
The annual Test update has resulted in South Africa dropping from third position to sixth after conceding 17 points. This is due to South Africas victories over England, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan in 2012-13 all being dropped from the rankings calculations.
The annual update has also affected the West Indies, which has retained its eight position but has dropped from 76 points to 65 points. This is because its victories over New Zealand, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 2012-13 have all been dropped from calculations.
The gap between the West Indies and ninth-ranked Bangladesh has been slashed from 29 points to just eight points.
With Sri Lanka and Pakistan visiting England this summer for three and four Tests respectively, Australia traveling to Sri Lanka in July for three Tests and South Africa hosting New Zealand in August for two Tests, the series outcomes may well result in significant movements on the MRF Tyres ICC Test Team Rankings
Some of the key series results from 2012-13, which are no longer in calculation include: West Indies v New Zealand (WI won 2-0); England v South Africa (SA won 2-0); Sri Lanka v New Zealand (1-all draw); Australia v South Africa (SA won 1-0); India v England (Eng won 2-1); South Africa v Pakistan (SA won 3-0); India v Australia (Ind won 4-0); New Zealand v England (0-0 draw).
Some of the key series results from 2014-15, which are now reduced from 100 per cent to 50 per cent, include: England v Sri Lanka (SL won 1-0); West Indies v New Zealand (NZ won 2-1); England v India (Eng won 3-1); Sri Lanka v Pakistan (SL won 2-0); West Indies v Bangladesh (WI won 2-0); South Africa v West Indies (SA won 2-0); Australia v India (Aus won 2-0); West Indies v England (1-all draw)

Kiwi Vatuvai on medical leave over pill scandal
Wellington, Tuesday: New Zealand Warriors winger Manu Vatuvai was placed on medical leave Tuesday amid a prescription drug abuse scandal rocking the Auckland-based club.
The veteran is the most senior of a group of players from the club who allegedly took a cocktail of sleeping pills and energy drinks while on a night out last week.
Six players were subsequently dropped from last week's Warriors game in Australia' National Rugby League and from international Test matches taking place this weekend.
Warriors managing director Jim Doyle said Vatuvai, 30, was placed on medical leave after consultations with doctors. "Following medical advice received today, Manu is now on leave," he said in a brief statement.
"We would ask that everyone respects his and his familys right to privacy at this time."

JO was protesting against Fonsekas speech on MRs security
An unfortunate incident occurred when the Joint Opposition(JO) protested when Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka rose to speak in Parliament to answer the question on the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Joint Opposition Leader, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He added that Fonseka who started reading out of a prepared speech, criticised Mahinda Rajapaksa and it was this that the Joint Opposition protested against.
Gunawardena made these statements at a media briefing at Battaramulla yesterday and mentioned that despite them asking the Speaker not to allow Fonseka to speak thus, the former simply did not heed their request and chose to leave his seat instead.
He explained that the situation got heated as Fonseka kept addressing the Chamber even after the Speaker had left his seat.
MP Udaya Gammanpila said that they were simply interrupting the illegal speech of Fonseka which was not in line with Parliamentary procedure.
Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma came in and hit MP Prasanna Ranaweera and it is then that a fight broke out. The fight has caused minor injuries to many. We came to Parliament to solve problems through the exchange of ideas, thus the people are watching as to what action the Speaker and government would take with regard to this. We will not be subjected into silence or make us forget about the danger to Mahinda Rajapaksas life,he said.
MP Bandula Gunawardena said that Rajapaksas life was under threat from the LTTE diaspora and local and international separatists.
