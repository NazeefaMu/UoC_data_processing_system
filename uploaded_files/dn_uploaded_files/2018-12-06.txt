Frozen 2     wont take place     in Arendelle
The Frozen sequel may already have its Let It Go.
We have a new song that I think is an evolution, Jennifer Lee, co-director of the first and second films said.
Its its own songBobby [Lopez] and Kristen [Anderson-Lopez] just delivered it three weeks ago. Weve been working with them for two years and this song just came in and I love it.
Lee, who is co-writing the follow-up with Hidden Figures screenwriter Allison Schroeder, said the song is one of four already chosen for the movie. We have three more to go, she said.
Lee also teased that the new film will, of course, focus on Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell), but it will be bigger, more epic than the first: Theyre going to go far out of Arendelle.
Disney announced last week that Frozen 2 will be released on November 22, 2019, a week earlier than its original November 27 date. Variety

Parties should disclose fund sources
Transparency International Sri Lanka Director General Asoka Obeyesekere yesterday said that political party representatives should file declarations as to where their campaign financing came from.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, he said his organisation had stressed that political parties must disclose where their funds came from for campaigning.
There should be legal consequences too, if these declarations are made inaccurately, he said.
Obeyesekere said that parties should also disclose the ways they receive support aside from monetary assistance.
He added that parties may receive assistance in form print media or TV commercials, and that there should be a mechanism to include them in the declarations.
He confirmed that the disclosure of assets of public representatives for scrutiny does not clash with privacy rights and data protection.
Asset declarations of public representatives are a powerful tool to prevent corruption, Obeyesekere said.

Aloe vera for beauty purposes
*A skin healing mask
Aloe vera is wonderful for not only healing acne scars but also for moisturizing the skin and keeping it youthful. Its easy to make a healing facemask with nothing more than the gel of one to two aloe vera leaf halves. Mix this with some essential oil if you like for a nice scent (mint, thieves, and lavender are nice) or simply use it plain. Apply for 30 minutes and let it sit. Its mild in scent on its own and has a particularly wonderful cooling feel.

* A sunburn healing gel
As many people know, aloe vera is wonderful for helping with sunburn. Youve likely seen those sunburn gels at drugstores with aloe vera, but the better option that will provide many less chemicals is to just use real aloe leaf. It can help reduce redness and pain associated with sunburn fairly quickly and can be applied liberally as much as needed. You can apply the gel plain or can mix it with a carrier oil, such as coconut and hemp, for extra moisturizing and healing benefits.

* Minor skin burns
This is the reason my grandmother always kept aloe on hand. Apparently she knew that her 12 grandchildren would have a few burns here and there. She was also a cook and liked to use it around if she touched a hot stove every now and then. I remember her always using aloe on our burns as children and though we thought she was weird, it always worked quickly.
Aloe veras moisturizing and healing benefits transcend into the skin to reduce inflammation and aid in repair of the skin fairly quickly. To use it on a burn, apply just enough to coat the burn and cover with a bandage so it can do its job. Leave overnight and it should be better in the morning. The pain goes away almost immediately upon application, however.

* Cuts and wounds
The gel of the aloe vera plant contains polysacharride fibers, which is essentially why its used as a digestive aid (but that also makes it problematic for some people).
These fibers also help to seal wounds and its natural cooling properties help soothe pain from cuts and wounds. Apply aloe to minor skin cuts and wounds after youve cleansed the area with a warm cloth and some peroxide (yes, that part stings).
Then seal it up with a bandage and let it sit to heal overnight or for a day.

* Itching or skin irritation
Psoriasis and skin irritation can both be a pain to deal with (literally) and can also be hard to manage. Many prescription creams and over the counter creams dont work, and those that do often contain excess chemicals that are not best for our skins to absorb (parabens are common ingredient in these creams).
Aloe is one of the best to relieve itching and irritation because it contains glycoproteins which help reduce inflammation upon contact.

At the apex of decision making
The hallowed halls of Hulftsdorp will be where the fate of Sri Lankas most complex constitutional crisis is decided in the coming weeks, if not days, as major political parties map out strategies and counter strategies in their bid to gain control of government.
The battleground has now decisively shifted from unruly scenes in Parliament, the home of the legislature, to the courts of law, the home of the judiciary. Meanwhile, the executive continues to engage with different political parties but a quick resolution of the impasse appears as evasive as ever.
The current situation developed after President Maithripala Sirisena decided to remove Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister, swearing in Mahinda Rajapaksa to that office on October 26. This has precipitated a series of events such as the prorogation of Parliament, its subsequent dissolution by the President, the opposition challenging the dissolution in the Supreme Court and the court granting an interim order against it.
As a result, Parliament continued its sessions where several votes of no confidence were adopted against the new government and new Prime Minister. After a few unruly sessions where there were fisticuffs in the chamber, the government decided to boycott sittings, a practice it has maintained since then.
A vote was also adopted curtailing expenses to the office of the Prime Minister. The government contends that the votes adopted against it are not valid as proper parliamentary procedures have not been adopted. It is against such a backdrop the battle shifted to Hulftsdorp.
Premiership issue
Late last week, speculation was rife that President Sirisena was close to formulating a solution out of the current deadlock. That was after the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) wrote to the President stating it would support a return to the status quo that existed prior to October 26, where the United National Front (UNF) held the premiership.
We will also support the appointment of a nominee of the UNF who in the opinion of Your Excellency is able to command the confidence of parliament as Prime Minister, the party told the President, prior to discussions with him. This was in response to assertions being made by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) that the UNF and its main constituent, the United National Party (UNP) too lacked majority support to form a government.
The inability of the MP who was appointed as the Prime Minister, to prove that Parliament has confidence in him as Prime Minister and the votes of No Confidence passed against him pertaining to his claim to be the Prime Minister have created a controversy in the country as to whether the country is without a Prime Minister, a Cabinet and a lawfully constituted government for more than a month, the TNA noted in its letter to the President.
In the ensuing talks with the TNA late last week, President Sirisena informed the party that Parliament should adopt a motion requesting him to appoint a new Prime Minister in view of the fact that incumbent Premier Mahinda Rajapaksa does not currently seem to have a majority in Parliament.
President Sirisena also met Speaker Karu Jayasuriya where he assured Jayasuriya that he would meet with UNF representatives as well to seek a resolution of the crisis. The meeting with the UNF leaders was initially scheduled to be held last Sunday but was then postponed to Monday.
Call for general election
Meanwhile, also on Sunday, issuing a statement as Prime Minister, Rajapaksa renewed his call for a general election. In the lengthy statement which cited historical instances where Parliament had been dissolved without the concurrence of the Prime Minister in other countries, Rajapaksa argued that a general election was the only means by which stability could be restored.
The only way to restore stability to a destabilized democracy will be through a general election. According to our Constitution, sovereignty is vested in the people and not in Parliament. The manner in which the people exercise their sovereignty is through the franchise. I invite all those who respect democracy to give careful thought to these matters, he said.
However, by the time the President met with the UNP on Monday, the circumstances had changed drastically following a ruling from the Court of Appeal which inquired into the Quo Warranto petition submitted by the collective opposition, challenging the Prime Minister, cabinet ministers and other ministers continuing to hold office when votes of no confidence had been passed against them in Parliament.
While not making a final determination on the issue, the Court of Appeal bench comprising of President of the Court of Appeal Justice Preethi Padman Soorasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekera granted restraining orders against the Prime Minister and other ministers from functioning in those capacities. Further hearing has been fixed for December 12 when the respondent ministers have been noticed to appear in court.
Rajapaksas response to the Court of Appeals decision was prompt. He declared that he disagreed with it and an appeal was lodged in the Supreme Court on Tuesday. It was evident that even though a final determination had not been made, the courts decision to issue a restraining order came as somewhat of a surprise to the government.
Held against such a backdrop, President Sirisenas discussions with the UNF were not fruitful. The President maintained that he would not be appointing Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister even if all 225 Members of Parliament endorsed it. The UNF delegation maintained that its nominee for the premiership was Wickremesinghe and no one else and the talks remained deadlocked on that issue.
Current crisis
President Sirisena was to re-iterate his assertion that Wickremesinghe would not be reappointed as Prime Minister at the convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) on Tuesday evening. In his speech, the President was optimistic that the current crisis would be resolved within a week. Earlier that day, he had met with secretaries of all ministries to instruct them to ensure that ministries functioned without disruption, in view of the restraining order issued against all ministers.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court which is hearing the fundamental rights petitions challenging the dissolution of Parliament resumed hearings on Tuesday, with a seven-judge bench. The hearings will continue today and tomorrow. The interim order against the dissolution is effective only until tomorrow, unless further extended by the Supreme Court.
While recent political developments constitute a crisis, the government previously functioned, albeit with a new Prime Minister and a new Cabinet. With the Court of Appeal decision to issue a restraining order, effective government has been reduced to the President who has enabling constitutional provisions that empower him to take over the functions of ministries. This is what will occur now.
It is clear from the current imbroglio that the prevailing state of affairs cannot be sustained over a period of time and a resolution to the constitutional crisis needs to be expedited. However, with the matter being canvassed in several different courts by many interested parties, it is difficult for politicians or their parties themselves to evolve a workable solution.
Any resolution must await answers to the legal issues raised, not only because they are relevant in the current predicament the country finds itself in but also because it will become a landmark for the conduct of future Presidents and governments as well. The only silver lining in all this, as noted in these columns previously, is that dissent, by and large has been democratic and expressed in the appropriate manner, rather than being destructive- save for a few shameful days in Parliament.

Aussies dump Mitch in the Marsh
Adelaide, Wednesday: Australia sprang a surprise by axing all-rounder Mitch Marsh on Wednesday for the first Test against India, as Usman Khawajas return was confirmed despite the shock of his brothers arrest.
Batsmen Travis Head and Peter Handscomb were preferred to Marsh, piling more pressure on the bowlers, while Marcus Harris will make his debut as opener.
Captain Tim Paine said Marshs omission was due to a lack of consistency and he would benefit from returning to Sheffield Shield cricket to find form again. Handscomb edged him out after two half-centuries last week and a century for Victoria the week before that.
Mitch Marsh has not been as consistent as he would like and we would like, said Paine at his pre-match press conference.
We know the talent that Mitch has and we know that most likely at some stage in this series we will need him.
We are taking the opportunity at the moment to go back and play a Shield game and get some cricket under belt.
Debutant Harris will open alongside Aaron Finch, with Khawaja, whose brother was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly framing a colleague with a fake terror plot, coming in at first drop.
Khawaja, who is returning after ankle surgery, was not seen in the nets on Wednesday after his family crisis, although he is known to only take on a light workload the day before a Test. Shaun Marsh will bat at four with Handscomb at five and Head at six.
The dumping of Mitch Marsh will add an extra burden for Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and spinner Nathan Lyon, who will have to take on more overs in what are forecast to be scorching hot conditions in Adelaide.
We obviously have a lot of confidence in Nathan Lyon bowling a lot of overs if we need to, said Paine.
And probably the fact that all our three quicks go in real fresh. We have confidence in them, particularly at the start of the series. AFP

When you have an acne outbreak, apply a paste of 1 tbsp milk, 1 tbsp sandalwood powder, and a pinch of turmeric powder. Wash off after 30 minutes.
Troubled by acne, blemishes, or dry skin Instead of going for commercial beauty products, opt for sandalwood powder, which has been extensively used in ayurveda as a holistic way to treat skin conditions. Its numerous health and beauty benefits can treat skin rashes, blemishes, acne, and many other skin problems. Here are the benefits of sandalwood powder for your skin.
1. Removes blemishes and warts
Blemishes caused by pimples, acne, rashes, or injuries can leave a mark on the skin, which can sometimes be permanent. Sandalwood is known to remove stubborn blemishes and spots. Sandalwood may also be effective in the removal of warts, especially genital warts caused by HPV virus.
Method
Mix 1 tablespoon of turmeric, 1 tablespoon of sandalwood powder, a small tablet of camphor, and 1 teaspoon of milk into a paste.
Gently massage it on the affected area and leave it overnight.
Wash off the next morning with cold water.
Doing this regularly helps remove blemishes and warts by relaxing your skin.
2. Prevents and cures pimples
When the skin produces sebum and oil in excess quantities, impurities, dirt, and germs clog the skin pores. This traps the sebum and oil below the skin surface and results in pimples. Sandalwoods anti-bacterial properties also help your skin fight the acne-causing bacteria, making your skin look flawless.
To Cure Pimples
Mix 1 tablespoon of sandalwood powder, 1 teaspoon of milk, and a pinch of turmeric powder into a paste.
Apply the paste on the skin and leave it for 30 minutes. Wash it with cold water.
The medicinal properties of sandalwood and turmeric heal the affected areas and make the skin glow.
To Prevent Acne
Apply a face mask of 1 tablespoon of sandalwood powder and 1 teaspoon of milk.
Wash it with cold water after 20 minutes.
Then gently dab your skin with cotton wool dipped in rose water.
3. Removes sun tan
Sandalwood powder helps remove suntan and reduce sunburns. Since the powder has a soothing effect, applying it on irritated sunburnt skin also helps.
Method
Mix 1 tablespoon of sandalwood powder and 1 teaspoon of honey or milk into a paste.
Apply the paste on the skin.
Keep the mask on for 30 minutes and wash off with cold water.
Doing this thrice a week removes suntan and evens out skin tone.
4. Reduces wrinkles and signs of aging
Exposure to sun, dust, and pollution can lead to premature skin aging. Even washing the face frequently with face wash to remove the dirt and grime does not help, as essential oils may be lost due to frequent washes. This causes wrinkles, sagging, dryness, and other skin conditions that make the skin appear older. Sandalwood powder is an effective method to reduce signs of aging, as it minimizes the damage caused by free radicals.
Method
Mix 1 tablespoon of honey, 2 tablespoons of sandalwood powder, and 1 egg yolk into a paste and apply it on your face.
After 1 hour, wash it with cold water.
Use this technique regularly to improve the skin elasticity and prevent the skin from sagging.
5. Heals dry skin
Dry and flaky skin can cause itchiness and frustration. The oils found in sandalwood can help cure these skin problems and leave your skin supple, soft, and moisturized.
Method
Apply the sandalwood paste twice a week for 30 minutes.
Wash it off with cold water.
Gently pat the skin dry.
6. Enhances skin brightness
Instead of using chemical-filled creams that promise instant radiance, opt for sandalwood powder. Regularly applying sandalwood powder can increase the glow and the brightness of the skin.
Method
Mix a pinch of turmeric, 1 teaspoon of milk, and 1 tablespoon of sandalwood powder.
Apply it on your face and neck.
After 30 minutes, wash it with cold water for a radiant skin.
7. Exfoliates the skin
Exfoliation is crucial for healthy skin and must be done using natural products for effective results. Sandalwood powder, when mixed with chickpea powder, is one of the best ingredients for skin exfoliation.
Method
Mix 1 tablespoon of sandalwood powder, 1 tablespoon of black chickpea powder, and rose water or milk into a paste.
Gently massage this paste on your face in a circular motion.
Let the face pack dry for 30 minutes.
Wash your face with cold water.
Sandalwood powder can add years to your skin, making it look and feel younger. Just make sure that the sandalwood powder you buy is genuine and is from an authorized trader. Due to the high demand for sandalwood powder, the market is often flooded with cheap, adulterated imitations.

An outline on the legal issues relating to the dissolution of parliament:
Between the policy and the law
An outline on the legal issues relating to the dissolution of the Parliament is of value to the general public in order to understand the constitutional ramifications. Hence, I will proceed to provide the background, the nature of constitutional law, the rules relating to constitutional interpretation and finally deal with the interpretation of articles 70(1) and 33(2) which impinge on the dissolution of the Parliament.
Since attaining Independence in 1948, Sri Lanka had three Constitutions, namely, Soulbury Constitution 1946, First Republican Constitution 1972 and Second Republican Constitution 1978. All three Constitutions differed very much from one another.
Soulbury Constitution adopted the Westminster model of Government and His Majesty King George VI of Great Britain was retained as Head of State. Late Sir Ivor Jennings, who drafted the Soulbury Constitution for Ceylon, incorporated section 29(2) from the Irish Constitution to protect minorities. In the Privy Council Lord Pearce held in Queen vs Liyanage (1965) that the ad hoc and ad hominem Criminal Law (Special Provisions) Act 1962 is ultra vires the Constitution, as the Soulbury Constitution recognized the doctrine of separation of powers. This case is cited in many Commonwealth countries for constitutional interpretation.
The First Republican Constitution 1972 transformed Sri Lanka from a Monarchy to a Republic. Her Majesty the Queen was no longer the Head of State. Instead, under 1972 Constitution, we had a non-executive President. It made several changes to our constitutional order by providing a chapter on Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy. It also gave foremost place to Buddhism. Under this Constitution, the Public Services ceased to be independent from the executive arm of the government.
The Second Republican Constitution 1978 transformed Sri Lanka into a Executive Presidency very different from the Westminster model. It has been called a Presidential Parliamentary System of Government. Professor A. J. Wilson called it the Gaulist Constitution. However, the 17th Amendment reduced the powers of the President by requiring the President to act on the advice or on the recommendations of the Constitutional Council. This legislative technique made 17th Amendment operative with a two-thirds majority in Parliament without a Referendum.
The 19th Amendment did not change the Presidential System to a Parliamentary System of Government as intended, but repealed some of the provisions of the 18th Amendment and added the Right to Information as a Fundamental Right. It expanded the provisions of the 17th Amendment but did not regulate the use of executive powers of the President in relation to the Legislature.
In this context, it is useful to analyze whether the dissolution of Parliament is legal and legitimate by reference to the 19th Amendment of the Constitution. Before dealing with this issue, it is important the nature of constitutional law.
NATURE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
Constitutional law is a mixture of law and politics. The Constitution cannot be interpreted and applied without taking into account constitutional conventions, practices and politics which have played an important role in constitutional interpretation.
The 1978 Constitution has a constitutional conundrum as a expounded by late Dr. N. M. Perera. He said that if the President and Prime Minister belonged to two different political parties, it can lead to a piquant situation or deadlock. This defect has not been remedied by the 19th Amendment although it was intended to transform Sri Lanka into a Westminster model of Government in some form or the other.
The poet, T. S. Elliot said that between the policy and the law, falls a shadow. In the 19th Amendment, there is a shadow of uncertainty in relation to the dissolution of Parliament by the President.
It is intended therefore to unravel the shadow of uncertainty by reference to the Rules relating to the Interpretation of the Constitution and interpreting the relevant provisions relating to the dissolution of Parliament in the 19th Amendment.
RULES RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
In dealing with the shadow of uncertainty in relation to the legality and legitimacy of the dissolution of Parliament, it is useful to understand the rules relating to the interpretation of the Constitution.
Rules relating to the interpretation of the Constitution can be described as Lex Specialis or sui generis (of its own kind). These rules are classified as the Literal Rule, Mischief Rule (today referred to as Purposive/Contextual Rule) and Golden Rule (today referred to as the Dynamic Rule or Judicial Activism).
The Honourable Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has adopted all three rules to interpret all three Constitutions of Sri Lanka since the attainment Independence. In relation to judicial review of legislation vis--vis the Constitution, especially in regard to fundamental rights, Purposive and Dynamic Rules have been adopted in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.
The Literal Rule provides certainty to law. In the USA, it is referred to as textualism. If the constitutional provisions do not have any ambiguity, the words alone reflect the intention of the Parliament/Constitution as propounded by Justice Tindal, CJ in Sussex Peerage Case (1844).
Late Justices Amerasinghe and Mark Fernando have used the Literal Rule to interpret various provisions of the Constitution for sake of certainty of the law. In Somawathie vs Weerasinghe (1990) and Faiz vs Attorney General (1995), the Literal Rule was applied.
In Faiz vs Attorney General (1995), Justice Mark Fernando said Jurisdiction cannot be expanded by twisting, stretching or perverting the constitutional provisions. Likewise, late Justice Antonin Scalia who was a Judge of the Supreme Court of the USA said in his famous book On Reading Law (2012)  The descent into social rancor over judicial decisions is largely traceable to non-textual means of interpretation. He further said Non-textual interpretation which makes Statesmen of Judges, promotes the shifting of the political blame from the political organs of the Government to the Judiciary. These words of late Justice Scalia is of value to the Courts in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.
However, Justices Ahron Barak, Bagawati, Bandaranayake and Siripavan have used the Dynamic and the Purposive Rule in relation to the interpretation of fundamental rights, as such rights need to be adapted and dovetailed to changing social needs and demands. Chief Justice Ahron Barak of Israel has called the Purposive Rule as the ultimate legal principle in statutory and constitutional interpretation.
In Sriyani Silva vs Iddamalgoda (2008) and Noble Resources International Pte Ltd vs Ranjith Siyabalapitiya (2016), Justice Bandaranayake and the Chief Justice Siripavan have adopted the Purposive and the Dynamic Rule to fill gaps in the 1978 Constitution. Hence, any gap in article 33(2) could be filled by reference to other provisions in the 1978 Constitution.
In the UK and other Commonwealth countries, the Purposive Rule has been introduced by way of legislation or judicial activism. For example, in Australia, sections 15A and 15B of the Interpretation Act adopted the Purposive Rule in an elaborate manner for the benefit of the statute users. Likewise many Commonwealth countries have amended their Interpretation Acts to adopt the Purposive Rule of Interpretation. Sri Lanka has not done so up to now.
In the UK, Pepper vs Hart (1993) is a landmark decision which adopted the Purposive Rule by way of judicial activism. It empowered the Courts to consult extrinsic material such as the Hanzard to ascertain the intention of the Parliament.
Hence, the Purposive Rule has gained some dominance in statutory and constitutional interpretation.
The Supreme Court has recently rejected the draft clause 200 of the Inland Revenue Bill 2017, which introduced the Purposive Rule to interpret any ambiguous provisions of the Inland Revenue Bill 2017. The Supreme Court held that this provision is inconsistent with the sovereignty of the people, but gave no reasons.
Nonetheless, all three Rules and their permutations in regard to statutory and constitutional interpretation are necessary to interpret the constitutional provisions relating to the dissolution of Parliament, especially when there are two provisions colliding with each other head-on in relation to dissolution of Parliament.

British Govt. loses key Parliament Brexit vote
UK: Britains Government suffered a stinging rebuke from MPs ahead of Tuesdays momentous Brexit debate, exposing Prime Minister Theresa Mays lack of support in parliament.
The House of Commons voted 311-293 to censure the government for failing to publish its full legal advice about the divorce deal May struck last month with the European Union.
The outcome forced Mays team to promise to release the full tome ahead of next Tuesdays vote on the contentious Brexit agreement.
This house has now spoken and its of huge constitutional and political signficance, said opposition Labour Party member Keir Starmer.
The rebuke underscores the struggles May faces as she tries to keep Britain from crashing out of the worlds largest single market in March without any firm trade arrangements.
The government suffered another blow just one hour later when parliament also voted in favour of an amendment that will give greater decision-making powers to MPs if, as expected, Mays deal is voted down next week.
May was set to kick off five days of debates later on Tuesday by saying her vision of a future apart from the other 27 EU member states reflected the wishes of voters.
The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted, May was due to say.
But that message of unity suffered a setback from Tuesdays parliamentary vote.
Downing Street argued that Mays government had a right to receive confidential opinions that were unhampered by political considerations.
The government is upholding an important point of principle, the prime ministers spokesman said.
Yet the texts full publication is unlikely to impact a Brexit deal vote that faces resistance from all sides of a bickering House of Commons.
Pro-European MPs pressing for a second referendum on staying in the EU received a sudden boost from an opinion issued by a legal adviser to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
Advocate General Campos Sanchez-Bordona stated that Britain could halt the entire process without the agreement of other EU countries.
That possibility continues to exist until the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded, he said.
Downing Street reaffirmed on Tuesday that May has absolutely no intention of doing so -- and that the ruling was in either case only advisory.
It does nothing, in any event, to change the clear position of the government that Article 50 is not going to be revoked, Mays spokesman said.
But the Scottish National Partys Alyn Smith -- one of several MPs who brought the case -- proclaimed: We now have a roadmap out of the Brexit shambles.
The vote next week has huge implications for Britains future and that of May herself.
Left-wing Labour said Mays defeat next Tuesday would likely trigger a confidence vote to bring down her government.
She has also been constantly challenged by hardline eurosceptics in her own party and might face an internal leadership contest as well.
Hardline Conservative Brexiteers say Mays compromise deal does not represent enough of a break with Brussels.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) -- the Northern Ireland party propping up Mays government -- also objects to special provisions for the province. Many of Mays critics want her to go back and renegotiate. - AFP

CALL UNP CONFAB TO DECIDE A PM
President Maithripala Sirisena has reportedly received a letter sent by several UNP public representatives requesting that if a Prime Minister were to be appointed from the United National Party, that he (PM) shall be appointed on the basis of consensus and with approval from all UNP segments - the UNP Parliamentarians, Provincial Council members and Local Government members.
Three UNP Parliamentarians, 24 UNP Provincial Council members and 43 UNP local government members had presented this letter to the UNP Secretary General.
The members have reportedly called on the UNP heads that in case they were planning to nominate a UNP member for the post of Prime Minister, that member shall be elected by way of a vote that must be held with the participation of all UNP members represented in the Provincial Councils and Local Government bodies.
Drawing their attention to the current political climate, the UNP representatives have also called on their upper echelons to convene a party conference urgently to decide on the matter of who would be their nominee for the office of Prime Minister in case of any eventuality.
UNP sources said that they have no problem in deciding whether it will be MP Ranil Wickremesinghe or MP Sajith Premadasa, who should be their leader in any upcoming election. But to decide on who shall be named for the position of Prime Minister from their party within the current political climate, could be of great importance considering the UNPs political future, the sources pointed out.
They also said there is nothing wrong in convening all their members to a party conference as it is from such a conference that the UNP Working Committee derives power.

CBSL disputes rating agencies latest rating decisions
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is of the view that the decisions by Fitch Ratings on December 3, 2018 and Standard and Poors (S&P Global Ratings) on December 4, 2018 to downgrade Sri Lankas Long-Term Rating from B+ (Stable) to B (Stable) are based on uncorroborated facts on the countrys macroeconomic fundamentals.
In spite of the recent developments in the countrys political sphere, an array of measures have been taken by the CBSL and the Government to minimize any potential impact from the recent political developments on the economy, especially with regard to external financing requirements and debt payment obligations. In meeting the Governments external liabilities of International Sovereign Bond (ISB) maturities of USD 1 billion in January 2019 and USD 500 million in April 2019, the authorities have already built a buffer fund from proceeds of non-strategic asset divestment and recently contracted Syndicated loan, in addition to the space provided under the Active Liability Management (ALM) initiative not exceeding a limit of Rs. 310 billion.
The issuance of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) of around USD 750 million to USD 1 billion during the remainder of the year and in early 2019 sourced through enhanced credit lines for state banks from the Middle East and East Asia is nearing completion. Further, the enhancement of USD 500 million to the syndicated loan arrangement by February 2019 is also in progress.
In addition, further support could be expected from the proceeds of about USD 600 million expected as disbursements from bilateral and multilateral agencies during next year. These proceeds together with the available funds would more than cover all the ISB payments due in 2019.
Meanwhile, with the aim of further strengthening the reserve adequacy, the CBSL has initiated negotiations with central banks and regional funds such as SAARC Swap Framework to obtain foreign currency SWAP facilities. These measures would not only further strengthen the countrys foreign reserve adequacy, they would also enable timely servicing of external obligations while providing the space for intervening cautiously in the foreign exchange market to prevent excessive volatility. It is noteworthy that there has been a favourable adjustment in the exchange rate during recent days supported by rising foreign currency inflows which would be further enhanced in the upcoming holiday and new year season. In addition, the fiscal and macro prudential measures that are already in place are expected to result in an improvement in the external trade balance as well, thus reducing pressure on external reserves and the exchange rate.
Meanwhile, domestic financing conditions have shown considerable improvement through spaces created and debt management strategies introduced recently. This has reduced the roll-over requirement of Treasury bonds and SLDBs in 2019, 2020 and in the medium-term. Notably, the new acquisition of government securities by the banking sector has increased by only 1.5 per cent in 2018 as against the trend increase of around 5 per cent in recent years.
It needs to be further reiterated that Sri Lankas banking and financial sector remains resilient to both domestic and external vulnerabilities. Even though the operating environment is challenging, the banking sector is subject to a stringent supervisory and regulatory framework. The commitment of the banking sector to adhere to higher levels of capital and liquidity requirements demonstrates its resilience in facing these challenges, thereby creating a stable outlook for the banking sector.
Given these parameters, the CBSL is of the view that the recent rating actions by Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings are unwarranted. Such an action only on the premise of heightened political uncertainty, with no evidence of slippages in macroeconomic policies or fundamentals, cannot be justified. The soundness of the underlying macroeconomic conditions was reinforced by the fact that staff-level agreement in principle was reached with the IMF (26 October 2018) on the fifth review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).

CDS released on bail
Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Ravindra Wijegunaratne who was arrested and remanded last week, was yesterday granted conditional bail by Colombo Fort Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
This is in connection with allegations of harbouring former Navy Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi and abetting in the abduction and forced disappearance of 11 youths in Colombo.
The Magistrate released CDS Wijegunaratne on two sureties of Rs. 1,000,000 with conditions. The Magistrate also pointed out that Wijegunaratne should not interfere with the investigations and not use his position to pressurise Navy witnesses.
CID ASP B.S.Tissera informed court that they recorded a statement from CDS Wijegunaratne inside the Welikada prison. According to the statement given by Wijegunaratne, CID stated that he had revealed that Wijegunarathne used an official room in the 7th floor of the Navy Headquarters.
CID also stated that they recorded a statement from Rear Admiral Udaya Deshapriya Hettiarachchi regarding this incident. According to his statement, he worked as the Navy secretary of the CDS Wijegunaratne. Hettiarachchi further stated that he never paid Rs.500,000 to Chandana Prasad under the instruction of CDS Wijegunaratne. CID also stated that they were unable to get permission from the Navy Commander to check the room which had been used by the CDS Wijegunaratne.
Attorney Achala Senevirathne appearing on behalf of the aggrieved party informed court that there are threats against him.
The Magistrate informed that the fort police also filed a case with regards to the Admiral Wijegunaratne threatening the main witness of the case: Laksiri Amarasinghe.
Senior Presidents Counsel Anuja Premarathne appearing on behalf of the CDS informed court that Rs.363,240.23 for Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi as a salary arrears.
PC Anuja Premarathne also stated that there are 722 Officers in the Navy and his client could not remember everyone, PC Premarathne added. PC Premarathne further stated that his client had no personal links with Commander Laksiri Amarasinghe.
Fort police officials informed the court that they commenced an investigation with regard to the complaint lodged by Lakisiri stating that CDS Wijegunaratne had attempted to shoot and abduct witness Laksiri Amarasinghe at the Naval Restaurant in Navy Headquarters.
Anyhow, the Magistrate stated that the fort police has not mentioned the reason as to why they commenced investigations into the B report submitted by them.
The Magistrate asked the Fort police OIC if they would name Wijegunaratne as a suspect in this case or not
Responding to the Magistrate, the OIC said they recorded 14 statements from Navy officers and no one had revealed about this incident. Police stated that there is no sufficient evidence to name Wijegunaratne as a suspect at this moment. The Fort Police also said the CCTV cameras in Navy headquarters were replaced with new CCTV cameras.
The Magistrate informed Western Province Senior DIG to appoint a new investigation officer to conduct this investigation.The Magistrate has removed this investigation from the Fort Police. CID officials informed court that they have no reason to reject bail. The Magistrate fixed further inquiries for January 16.

Safety of the peoples sovereignty shall be the highest law
The Supreme Court is the highest court of Sri Lanka. The Supreme Court is the highest and final judicial instance of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The Court has ultimate appellate jurisdiction in constitutional matters, and takes precedence over all lower Courts. The Sri Lanka judicial system is a complex blend of both common-law and civil-law. In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the Republic for clemency petitions.
The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka was created on April 18, 1801 with the Royal Charter of Justice of 1801 of King George the 3rd establishing the Supreme Courts of the Island of Ceylon by the British, who controlled most of the island at the time, excluding the inland territory of Kandy. This creation was repealed in 1833 and replaced by a new Charter covering the whole of the island. In 1972 the country gained its independence as Sri Lanka and adopted a new Constitution.
The court consists of the Chief Justice and not less than six and not more than ten other Judges, appointed by the President, upon the Presidents recommendation for such appointment to the Constitutional Council is approved by the Council.
The Chief Justice, The Justices of the Supreme Court and The Justices of the Court of Appeal are addressed as Your Lordship and receive the title The Honourable Justice.
In the current divisive political environment, the Supreme Court deserves to be seen as above the fray to preserve its legitimacy. The politicization of legal ideology might hurt the judiciary of this country.

Consummate professionals, magical instincts and pure skills that transcend
Rugby World Cup 2019 kicks off the worlds greatest impact tournament yet.
Japanese edition of the worlds most anticipated, watched and followed rugby event on the planet.
Admittedly the game is in such good condition and the future even brighter.
My deckchair sits comfy as the World Rugby player of the year steps up for his award...and with him a nation unites in absolute celebration, as only the Irish can.
Johnny Sexton adding another no. 10 to that holy grail of awards.
World Rugby have seen fly half centric with Dan Carter and Beuden Barrett sharing five of those.
Step up Sexton for the 6th fly half and massive pride to the Irish...
Firstly, to outclass NZ and also outshine Barrett - favourite again by miles.
Naturally the guineas will be cheered and plenty to sing about as Ireland run away with their greatest capture of World Rugby awards in their history.
Coach of the year Smchidt, player of the year Sexton, and what a grand Christmas for Ireland as team of the year.
Definitely an Irish season for giving the world some scintillating rugby ...team Irelands achievement will take some beating....and what a mesmerizing World Cup it promises to be in Japan next summer.
Magical thoughts about facilities, atmosphere, Japanese rugby culture and club network... boasts of over 1000 playing clubs islandwide.
Little surprise then when talisman coach Eddie Jones inspired Japanese meteoric performance that constituted their arrival on world leader board.
When Japan outran South Africa to that most incredible victory.... the hallowed corridors of the world game ...echoed loudly as the faithful cheered and stood to herald the arrival of an Asian world power.
The game now had a new contender .... a giant leap for the global game.
Locally with the Dialog league cup 1st round ....the players have shown what it entails to play premier division in Sri Lanka.
Army simply stepped at Police Park to stun an unlucky CH...beaten in the last 5mins again....as they were pipped by CR and Havelocks almost the same script.
Coach Ronnie will need to be sharper and skipper Yoshitha will be hungry for performance against defending champions Kandy this weekend.
Police missed a fabulous opportunity against Havelocks and encouraging for coaches Shamly and Rodrigo...to see the Police backs and forwards combining... also good to see a full ground at Police Park.
Easily the best running surface in club rugby and well complimented by the 50+ total.....
Havelocks need to tighten up, kick less and use their forward five a lot better.
Reza holding the ship together with his educated boot.
On that specific note ...quite remarkable the close results and last gasp finishing.....especially Ratwatte at CR, sharp accuracy with his kicking boots,
Samuel Maduwantha at CH carrying on his phenomenal form from the spot every time he has been trusted. He is a treat to watch under pressure and a great example to young hopefuls.
Similarly the Thilina full back attacking skills for Kandy that make him a force for the champions.
All in all only Havelocks, Kandy and Navy remain unbeaten...
CR despite doing almost everything right ...except their lineout calls, were well outclassed by Kandy in the last quarter of the game.
Kandy were full on, great work rate from Lemma Pathirana, Udangamuwa, Danush, Ranjan, and the lions at home.
I still maintain that Kandy will be beaten this year....but getting past them at home ...an entirely diff story.
Colombo will test them...most significantly Havelocks, CH, Navy and CR.
Great hook for our resident experts to line up practical advice for Sean Wijesinghe and his Kandy management team.
At the current rate ...we may all be up for ER advise ...from the rapidly expanding experience of our experts...whose voracious reading skills must be hailed from the endangered mangrove tree tops.
In Dubai at the Sevens stadium, purpose built for the 7s world cup, New Zealand easily outran a phenomenal USA team rapidly announcing their arrival on the HSBC circuit.
Good to see Australia, England, South Africa, Fiji and Samoa right up there ...
Unfortunately for us in Sri the world series remains a distant dream and needs fresh thinking to change our 7s DNA ..not an impossible task for current top brass at Sri Rugby...chairman Lasitha, able vice chairman Nazeem Mohamed, Rizly Dida Iliyas, selection head Rohan Abeykoon...vast knowledge and Rohan Gunaratne as executive director.....plenty of impact lining up for our island game.
Again my prayer ....for us to be a force in Asian rugby... 7s is our fundamental DNA to get us there and beyond.
Bula bula our Sri dream and those who believe!

Cooks Oval farewell ton shortlisted for Greatest Sporting Moment Award
Alastair Cooks final Test century, an emotional 147 at the Oval against India in September, has been shortlisted for BBC Sports Personality of the Years Greatest Sporting Moment of the Year award.
Cook, who announced that the match would be the last of his illustrious Test career beforehand, drew a rapturous standing ovation from the crowd upon reaching his 33rd and final Test century in Englands second-innings.
It had appeared that the opportunity of a perfect farewell had passed him by when he fell for 71 in the first-innings. Nevertheless, the left-hander was able to bow out in style with a typically battling knock in his second dig at the crease, reaching three-figures in front of a packed house.
The former England captain waved goodbye as Englands leading run-scorer in international cricket, helping his side to a 4-1 series win over the visitors.
Cooks century faces competition from England Netballs gold medal at the Commonwealth Games, Englands penalty shootout win over Colombia at the mens FIFA World Cup, Tiger Woods win at the Tour Championship, and Tyson Furys fightback from two knockdowns against Deontay Wilder.

Disruptions and democracy
The pattern of history cannot be changed. We are the progeny of progression across time and space that shifts from small scales to big ones and back again.
John Lewis Gaddis, On Grand Strategy
The masterpiece TheRise and Fall of the Great Powers by Paul Kennedy, clearly identifies the shift from the US imperial overstretch and its position to remain as the bastion of global democracy, and its decline. Kennedy explains, It has been a common dilemma facing previous number one countries that even as their relative economic strength is ebbing, the growing foreign challenges to their position have compelled them to allocate more and more of their resources into the military sector, which in turn squeezes outproductive investment and, heavier taxes, deepening domestic splits over spending priorities and a weakening capacity to bear the burdens of defense.
In 415 BC Athens, a maritime power, Pericles strengthened democracy and built a wall to defend the city state. He underestimated their relative decline of strength. It was an overstretched Athenian power that attacked Sicily and took a hard lesson in defeat. It was the beginning of the decline, recorded Thucydides. The expedition was launched on the pretext of their being in danger of being ruled themselves, if they ceased to rule others.
In late 2018, the power of the USA is not in calculation with its strength. Further, its own democratic structure is in question. The elected President has decided to go against the very foundation and norms of the nation. His rhetoric of nationalism, protectionism and disruptive foreign policy threatens the world order as we know it.
US hypocrisy is clear in most places they intervened to install democratic values in the recent past, including the Middle East. Western intervention was clearly seen after the end of the Sri Lankan civil war in 2009. This was seen as interfering with the sovereignty of the nation during Rajapaksas regime. Today, they are disturbed by the recent moves by President Maithripala Sirisena in dissolving Parliament and calling for elections. On the other hand, the Executive had completely lost confidence to work with the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has in turn requested international assistance to restore democracy. One should also not forget that in January 2015, Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Prime Minister in a politically amoral way, despite not holding the majority in Parliament.
Meanwhile, China gives a clear signal that it will not intervene in Sri Lankan domestic political issues. The Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan visited and congratulated the newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. According to local media, out of the 43 foreign missions, the diplomats of the US and Europe stayed away from a recent meeting with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister in Colombo. This move is in protest of President Sirisenas decision to dissolve Parliament. US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Ambassador Alaina Teplitz attending Parliament to observe the proceedings the day after the Supreme Courts ruling, tweeted that she is glad that the institution is functioning constitutionally.
Looking at the Sri Lankan situation, a senior US administration official said, I would say speaking about countries generally, not just the country were talking about, one of the key tenants of President (Donald) Trumps Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) concept and our Indo-Pacific Strategy is to protect the sovereignty of countries all across the region. The FOIP introduced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, now supported by Trump, will be used to contain Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific. FOIP targets nations such as Sri Lanka and the Maldives which have pledged support to Chinas grand strategy of Belt and Road according to some scholars.
Chinese and Indian influence
Chinas economic security and Indian Ocean ambitions are deeply ingrained in the Indian Ocean littoral states. The Maldives and Sri Lanka are clearly two island nations within the Chinese sphere of influence. Maldives newly elected President Ibrahim Mohamed Solihs plans to restore democracy and balance the Indian and Chinese regional presence, is yet to unravel.
The Presidents actions may be seen in comparison to Sri Lanka President Sirisenas 2015 plans for a balance and non-aligned foreign policy.
The geo-politics affecting small island nations has to be calculated closely in this century. To small island nations, China and India represent a rising power and an emerging power, from the same continent. India is positioned 32km from Sri Lanka and 700 km from the Maldives. That internal instability is caused only by internal politics is a badly under-evaluated statement.
N. Sathiya Moorthy analyses the Indian position on Sri Lanka as, Unlike in shared neighbour Maldives, where India played all its cards in the name of democracy, on the current crisis in Sri Lanka, New Delhi has been holding the cards close to its chest. The return of traditional Indian pragmatism seems to have influenced not only post-Cold War European friends, at least up to a point, of whom some were seen as scaling down their criticism of the SirisenaRajapaksa duo, until rumours of imminent dissolution of Parliament began doing the rounds on Friday, November 9.
In the Maldivian case, President Solihs predecessor Yameen was labelled as an autocrat who signed MOUs to strengthen the Maldives relationship with China and support the Belt and Road Initiative. Through this, the Maldives departed from an India-first policy. This is similar to the manner in which Rajapaksa was labelled with the same Chinese affiliation and support. Will President Solih renegotiate the Chinese projects And if so, how much will he succeed is the question.
In the Sri Lankan case, it was clear that the renegotiation skills of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe failed. This ended in the leasing of the strategic port for three generations. I opine that this is connected to Wickremesinghe eventually losing his own portfolio a few days ago, perhaps not only because of the lease to China, but his strategy of rebalancing China with other powers which threatened the national security of the nation.
In a related geo-strategic incident taking place on Sri Lankan soil, a feasibility study was to be conducted by the Indians to lease out the strategic military airstrip belonging to Sri Lanka.
How did the previous election promise of investigations into Chinese projects end up as a futile exercise In an article in January 2018, I expressed that the dragon cannot be contained. Will the same situation like Sri Lanka unfold in the Maldives President Solihs new governments plans for democratisation could be weakened from within their allies in the coalition who are neither democratic nor progressive, just like Sirisenas which weakened from inside and failed to balance the spheres of influence from outside.
Sri Lankan domestic politics
Internal instability is an opportunity for external powers who will take an upper hand to intervene. Most nations that opened their door to Western powers to restore democracy have seen their countries shatter into further political instability and economic decline. Libya and Iraq are the best case studies.
Argentina in 1913 was the worlds tenth richest country, but from 1930 to mid-1970 the country experienced six military coups, alongside political instability, three separate bouts of hyperinflation which exceeded 500 percent per year, while economic growth rates sank below zero for several years.
The Argentinean government failed to think long term. Among the factors limiting a countrys growth is clearly political instability and short-term thinking. This is a lesson to many nations in the present day with political instability and short-sighted policy as explained by Dambiso Moyo, the internationally renowned economist in her book Edge of Chaos.
Sri Lanka is no exception to this and is already at the edge of chaos. The Unity Governments with its new bipartisan model was a failure as the two ideologies  centre left and centre right  did not create the required space to accommodate diverse opinion.
Consensus within the coalition yahapalana government failed at many turns since its inception in 2015. What resulted was a constitutional gridlock between the Executive and the Legislature.
In a shocking move, the Sri Lankan President ended up making Wickremesinghes opponent the Prime Minister. President Sirisena, perhaps accused of constitutional disruption and disloyalty, has placed national interest and the cry for political and economic stability as the priority in installing a Prime Minister with the same political ideology.
What Ranil Wickremesinghe failed to do during the last three years was to work his own strategy. His Prime Ministership was ceased twice on national security grounds. His Finance Minister was dismissed for investigation on corruption. Another of his Ministers, who working as a consultant, wrote a book on the Central Bank bond scam, allegedly accepted funds from the bidders of the bond scam. His close friend, the former Central Bank governor, went missing after the bond scam of Rs. 11 billion. These were serious blows to his office.
The present position is a divided House with a majority with which Wickremesinghe will attempt to claim his legitimacy, while the Executive will dismiss this claim sticking to the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. This position of the President will not change and the Legislature will need to give into the Presidents decision at one point or the House will be in continuous turmoil as one faction will surround the Speakers chair and another will surround the Prime Ministers chair to secure the position. The son of the former visionary leader Ranasinghe Premadasa is a popular choice of many for the leadership of the UNP.
Sajith Premadasa is also clearly seen in this scenario perhaps waiting patiently just like his father who came to power after President J.R. Jayewardene.
It is time for all party leaders to come to a consensus to allow the masses to cast their ballot to choose the new Prime Minister.
Yet again, the people of Sri Lanka await stability. Grand geo-strategies of powers looking seaward weigh in, thus, entangling the local to the global, to a measure it cannot be fully understood without one another.

Eyeing  Malayalam  films
Janhvi Kapoor, who recently made her debut on the silver screen with Dhadak, is crazy about watching films from the golden era. She wishes she could have worked with Guru Dutt and says she would love to work in a Malyalam film.
Set to begin shooting soon for her next film Takht, Janhvi revealed that she notices a major change in films today in comparison to films and the actors of the golden era.
I feel the story telling of that era was so very different in comparison to todays films and actors. I genuinely feel that today cinema has become more commercial. We are trapped more in commercials. The acting and the concept of the films were much more ahead of times then.
Responding on the female centric tag to movies today, Janhvi says, In those days films like Mother India, Sita Aur Gita, Chalbaaaz, Bandhini and Sujata were stories mainly on females. The character in these films also projected how a woman needs to live and survive in the society, etc. But such cinema was never tagged as female oriented unlike todays times. If the intriguing tale represents the life of a female lead.we conveniently tag the film as women oriented.

Fonseka alleges violations at 2010 Presidential polls
Parliamentarian Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday revealed that there were violations of election laws during the 2010 Presidential Election, where former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, rather than scoring a victory, used thuggery to stop vote counting.
Fonseka, reading out two letters issued on January 26, 2010, said both letters pertain to such election violations.
One of the aforementioned letters had been faxed at around 2 am on the said date by Election Duty Officer K. Herath to the North Central Province DIG complaining that there were thugs attacking agents carrying ballot boxes in the vicinity of the vote counting centre, Anuradhapura Central College.
The second letter had been faxed around 3.45 am by the Election Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake to the IGP at the Police Headquarters demanding that police protection be given to Anuradhapura Central College as thugs were disrupting the vote counting.
In the letter, the EC said that if the police do not bring the situation under control, the Commission will stop the counting process and make a media statement to the public revealing the difficulties.
Accordingly, Fonseka questioned if Rajapaksa really won the election or Rajapaksa violated election laws to win while making the then Election Commissioner to work under heavy pressure.
He was speaking in response to a recent statement by President Maithripala Sirisena who, according to Fonseka, has said that if Fonseka was elected President in the 2010 Presidential Election, he (Fonseka) wouldnt have allowed any discussion in a politically tense situation like the one prevailing in the country at present.
Fonseka said there was no case of if when it came to the result of the 2010 Presidential Election.
He also said that if he was made President in 2010, he would not be acting like President Sirisena does at present.
The Field Marshal said he has never used public money for foreign tours. I only went to India once were the Indian government sponsored my entire visit as I was supposed to deliver a lecture. he said.
Referring to the United States of America as an exemplary country, Fonseka said it would be worthwhile if someone can amend the Constitution or bring in a new Act where all the high-ranking leaders of the country such as the President and the Army Commander should undergo an annual evaluation of mental capacity.
In those countries, the persons who hold posts such as President and Army Commander hold the keys to their nuclear stockpiles. So it is crucial for them to undergo this test. Likewise, I propose that we also have such a test to make sure that the operations in the country are properly carried out, he said.

Go green with your beauty  routines
Not many of us would have given this cactus-like plant a second glance years ag. However aloe vera, also described as a wonder plant, is known for its numerous health and medicinal uses today. This plant is also a miracle beauty saviour and does wonders to your skin. Its loaded with antibacterial properties and can be used to tackle many beauty woes.
Health benefits of aloe vera
The anti-inflammatory properties of aloe vera help reduce the oxidative damage caused by free radicals in the body. Moreover, the antioxidants present in the gel have been proved to be useful in managing arthritis and rheumatism.
Aloe vera juice is said to be a good digestive. A cupful of the juice can help relieve stomach problems like constipation. Aloe vera causes cells to produce nitric oxide and cytokines that give the much-needed boost to your immune system.
Aloe vera is said to improve the effectiveness of your diet and maximise your weight loss potential.
Aloe vera is also majorly used in Ayurvedic preparation that is useful in correcting disorders like anaemia. It is known to increase the red blood cell count that keeps your haemoglobin levels in check.
Growing aloe vera
The first step in aloe vera plant care is to realize that this plant is a succulent. Like cacti, succulents do best in dry conditions. Plant them in a cactus potting soil mix or a regular potting soil that has been amended with additional perlite or building sand. Also, make sure that the pot has plenty of drainage holes. Aloe vera plants cannot tolerate standing water.
Make your own aloe vera gel at home
Instead of buying aloe vera gel, you can easily make it at home. All you need to do is invest in a healthy aloe vera plant. Simply cut off some leaves of the plant. Place the leaves in an upright position for a few minutes and let the dark yellow resin drain out.
Once it is drained, wash the leaves and start peeling the thick skin with a knife. To preserve the gel for a longer period, blend the gel with a few drops of Vitamin C powder, Vitamin E oil or some essential oil in a blender.
Now, pour it into a clean glass jar, which you can preserve for months in the refrigerator. Make the most of this wonder gel.

Healthy  eating  tips
A healthy diet should include a wide variety of nutritious foods for sufficient intake of all nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. Foods to include are breads, pastas, lean meats, fish, fruits and vegetables. A healthy diet can help you maintain a healthy body weight and decrease your risk of many diet-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.
Healthy diets contain a variety of foods
In general, we should include a range of nutritious foods and eat:plenty of breads and cereals (particularly wholegrain), fruit, vegetables and legumes (such as chickpeas, lentils and red kidney beans)low-salt foods, and use salt sparingly small amounts of foods that contain added sugars reduced-fat milk and other dairy products. It is also important to drink an adequate amount of water.
Physical activity and healthy eating
A good balance between exercise and food intake is important, as this helps to maintain muscle strength and a healthy body weight. At least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity, such as walking, is recommended every day.
Keep fat to a minimum
Adult diets should be low in fat, especially saturated fat. Saturated fat, which is the main fat in animal products, fried foods, chocolate, cakes and biscuits, is more easily deposited as fat tissue than unsaturated fat. Saturated fat can also be converted into cholesterol and cause blood cholesterol levels to rise.Dietary fat helps with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). Small amounts of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats may have some health benefits when they are part of a healthy diet. Monounsaturated fats are found in nuts, olive oil and avocados, and may help to lower the bad type of cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein or LDL). Polyunsaturated fats are generally thought to lower blood cholesterol levels. Polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, nuts and seeds, are thought to have an anti-clotting effect on blood, to reduce the risk of heart disease and to possibly lower blood pressure.
Eat and drink less high- kilojoule foods
The total amount of energy-dense (high-kilojoule) foods you eat may be as important as the total amount of fat in your diet. To reduce the energy density of your diet, you need to increase the amount of plant foods, such as wholegrain breads and cereals, fruit and vegetables that you eat.
This will provide essential nutrients, help to make you feel full and also reduce the amount of fat in your diet. High energy drinks such as sports drinks, cordials, soft drinks, fruit juice, energy drinks should also be limited.
betterhealth Eat foods rich in calcium and iron
It is important for all Australians to eat foods which contain iron and calcium. In particular:
Calcium  is important for bone health especially for infants, women and girls.
Iron  carries oxygen around the body and is especially important for women, girls, vegetarians and athletes to reduce the risk of anaemia.

The second most deciding match between Army SC and Seylan Bank ended up with 71 to 70 in favour of Seylan.
Army did not qualify for the next round as Seylan blocked their way. But some controversial decisions by the referees decided in favour of Seylan.
Army Coach Hycinth Wijeyasinghe blamed that the match was officiated biased to Seylan Bank and they are going to lodge a protest over refereeing to the Sri Lanka Netball Federation.
She further said the match was officiated by a B grade umpire and main umpire also is a player in the Police Netball team. Also the Seylan Bank head coach Yamuna Sadamali is the head coach of Police SC. We are not satisfied as a B grade referee officiated A division match. We have lot of qualified referees but why they allowed a B grade referee to officiate this important match. She said.

A huge relief
It appears there is light at the end of the tunnel after a month long period of darkness for a bemused public unable to comprehend the turn of events unfolding in the country since October 26, with President Maithripala Sirisena, this time saying in no uncertain terms, that he would ensure that the current political crisis would be brought to an end within the next seven days.
Addressing a special convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on Tuesday, the President assured the nation that the current political instability would be resolved in one weeks time. Prior to this too time frames had been announced to end the political gridlock during meetings with UNP and TNA delegations. Members of these delegations leaving the Presidential Secretariat, the venue of these meetings, in their plush limousines assured the media that the President had assured them that the crisis would be resolved within a day or two. A UNP MP, after one such meeting, told the media last week that they were given an undertaking that the standoff would be brought to an end within the next 24 hours. Nothing came to pass though.
However, there was finality in the tone of the President on Tuesday making it almost certain that normality will be restored within the next seven days. Perhaps, the President was anticipating the verdicts of the Supreme Court on the dissolution of Parliament and the writ matter that stayed the appointment of the Prime Minister (and the Cabinet), which is to be delivered anytime soon, before making his next move.
No doubt there would be speculation as to what exactly the President was contemplating and which form the solution would take. The President once again made it clear that he would not, under any circumstances, re-appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. In his address the President also said he would take a decision bearing in mind the countrys future and also its unborn generations. This statement has to be seen in the light of the Presidents insistence that he would not re-appoint Ranil as PM and equally, the UNPs determination that it would not compromise on this score.
Was there a hint that the President is contemplating a Presidential Election, if everything else fails Even the UNP has called for a Presidential Election first, as against a General Election, or, insists that both polls be held together. With the President determined to break the political logjam and return the country to normality in the quickest possible time, would this be an option if he fails to reach a compromise vis-a-vis insisting on an alternative to Ranil as PM, from the UNP
Of course the President may have other options, depending on the court rulings, and the public, no doubt, will have their fingers crossed until such time. Be that as it may, the country cannot afford to remain on tenterhooks in anticipation of a final solution. The crisis has already cost the economy dearly while the state machinery remains semi-paralyzed. It is in this backdrop that the Presidents directive to all Ministry Secretaries to carry on as before is to be welcomed. This is in the aftermath of the Court of Appeal interim order temporarily removing all ministers and deputy/state ministers from office.
The President issued clear instructions and guidelines to secretaries of ministries to carry out public services without disruption in keeping with the existing laws and regulations. Even at the outset of the crisis, the President issued directives to all members of the Public Service, Armed Forces and police to perform their duties and responsibilities relentlessly on behalf of the State, security, the country and the public, in a situation of this nature.
It is time for all civic-minded individuals to contribute their mite to ensure the country in no way suffers due to the current political impasse. With the Presidential assurance that the crisis will be brought to end within a week, public officials should take the cue and get on with their duties and functions to keep the State machinery going. There has understandably been a reluctance on the part of many officials to commit themselves to tasks in the present political climate. This is more so given the various court cases now being heard where public sector officials had been arraigned for carrying out instructions that were deemed illegal.
Certain UNP MPs have been repeating ad nauseam since the beginning of the crisis that public officials would be held accountable for carrying out instructions issued during this period. This, to any sane mind, is uncalled for since public officials are bound by the Establishment Code to carry out duties on behalf of the State. The UNP edict to public officials to desist from carrying out their official duties is akin to the Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya, the armed wing of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, ordering public officials to lay off work on pain of death, during the height of the 1989-90 second JVP insurrection. We certainly need not go back to that mentality again.

JAAF Unveils new logo and launches new corporate website
Sri Lanka Apparel during its existence in the last four decades grew and set itself as the leading manufactured product exporter of Sri Lanka representing 43% of industrial exports and 40% of merchandising exports.
With a contribution to the GDP in the range of 7% during the last decade and employment opportunities for 40% of the active labour force in the country, Sri Lanka Apparel supports and enriches the lifeline of millions of families directly and indirectly.
Known as the most visible industry in the island, it is an active forerunner for being a self-regulated and monitored industry based on ethical practices and sustainable green initiatives; a recognition given worldwide. Inspired by the worlds best practices brought through foreign direct and indirect investment and the pro labour regulations prevalent in the country, the industry has been able to win the confidence of international brands as a dependable partner providing total solutions to the apparel business.
Extreme competition during the quota regime, the paradigm shift of sourcing resulting from the removal of the multi-fibre agreement, the withdrawal of GSP+ and continuous civil disturbances did not deter the growth of this industry though the picture portrayed nationally and internationally was very bleak for the future of it during those times. The industry challenged the obvious and has continued to thrive by taking proactive decisions and actions. It has evolved from a contract manufacturer to having the capability of offering seamless solutions where the entirety of the supply chain from innovation, designing to delivery at a back end now is being offered.
In its eternal desire to dream and innovate, the industry today is launching a new image through the launch of the new website and logo at the 15th Annual General Meeting of the Joint Apparel Association Forum.
This logo brings out the strength of our ethos by the use of the face of a lion, an animal symbolic of our culture. Highlighting our diversity, the lions mane sports several colours. These include maroon, saffron, orange and green, which can be seen on our national flag and which represent the rich mosaic of ethnic and religious identities in our motherland.
Moreover, the lions mane has 10 elements, representing not only our multi-ethnic character, but also our position as a global hub for apparels on comprehensive fronts related to our business starting from education, conceptualisation, design, supply chain management, digitalisation and creativity, making, finishing and logistics embracing the entire value chain providing seamless solutions.
On this occasion, the industry aligns itself to be the forerunner in the national development spreading the message Sri Lankan brand image based on its ethical sustainable and compliance footing.

The JICA group also entertained the gathering to a Japanese song and made a Japanese delicacy called Okonomi Yaki for the Sri Lankans.
Among those who attended the event were Galigamuwa MOH Dr. N.M.D.B. Nayakaratne, Dr. Tharanga Egalla, PHI Anoma Jayantha Pieris and other health staff attached to the MOH office.
Sakase who spoke in Sinhala, organised the event herself and made the invitation cards in the Sinhala language.
Speaking on project planning, she said, A proper plan is a prerequisite to achieve an objective. You need time to execute such a plan. First, dissect the plan into separate sections and move forward with each section leaving out the difficult ones. There will be another day when you will be able to implement the remaining sections and believe that you will fulfil your objective completely some day.
Miss Sakase said her stay in Sri Lanka had been very satisfying and considered Sri Lankans a friendly people.
She said her country was also in a state of destabilisation after the Second World War. But the Japanese people moved forward courageously and rebuilt their country to make it a developed nation.

Kandy SC overcome CR hurdle
Kandy Sports Club continued the defence of their league title by beating another top club CR & FC in a Dialog rugby championship match played at Nittawela last Sunday.
It was Kandys fly half Nigel Ratwatte who ran a couple of ploys, due to the good work done by the forwards. It was the forwards who won the match for them. Ratwatte with good ball coming from the forwards really upped the pace and Thilina Wijesinghes kicking was pretty good.
Kandys were quite direct in their forward play. They made CR & FC tackle and that made them tired.
The first half took its toll on the Red shirts. Tarinda Ratwatte kicked three penalties in a row, and every time they went forward they tried their best to make it one way. In the second half they failed to do so. CR & FC besieged the Kandy line early on but a huge effort from the home side gave them the opportunity to clear. The home team were finding it difficult on and off to gain territory but their defence continued to hold firm and what possession they had in hand they moved steadily forward. Kandy continued to find half gaps and put CR & FC in their place due to which they were unable to cut through cleanly.
After being equal in the first half 14-all the Kandy team showed character. They were up against a very good defence and sometimes that takes a huge effort. CR & FC were excellent at the breakdown but the willingness of all the carriers in the team; they were brilliant right until the end of the game.
CR & FC arrived in Kandy hoping to build on the promise to win their fourth game of the season but as the game wore on, the pace of Kandy proved too much and CR had to surrender the lead.
The table at the end of the fourth week: 1. Kandy SC 4/4/0/24 pts, 2. Havelock SC 4/4/0/22 pts, 3. CR & FC 4/3/1/16 pts, 4. Navy SC 4/2/2/13 pts, 5. Army SC 4/2/2/11 pts 6. CH & FC 4/1/3/9 pts, 7. Police 4/0/4/3 pts.

Knit  together  in love
Their eyes say it all. When you look into the eyes of children you see such trust and such desire to receive affection. And intentionally or unintentionally that trust can be shattered by adults. And when that vital trust is shattered the child starts to fear and the presence of fear within them is what leads them to become a toxic person or more correctly a person whose behavior is toxic and who subsequently falls into toxic relationships. At SOS, some children have lost both their parents, some have come from broken families, in some cases the single parent has been deemed unfit to raise the child and sometimes the case is that the family is poverty stricken.

Fortunately SOS Childrens Villages are ready to intervene and take these children into their families. Daily News recently attended the No Child Alone Campaign, which focuses on raising awareness about the needs of the children and help spread the message. 
The Family Strengthening Programme is specifically to help children who are at the risk of losing parental care due to poverty. We at SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka believe that the best environment for a child to be raised is the biological family. Hence, as prevention measure SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka is working with the families who earn less than one USD a day by supporting the education and the nutrition of the children for five years. Parents are taught skills which help them to become financially self- sufficient over time so that they can look after their children.
Children are admitted to SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka through a court order or the Probations Department instructions. There are many different parties who will take on this role of a whistle blower, including the Probation Department, Police Department and Civil society. However SOSCVSL will take on a child only through a court order or the Probation Department instructions.
SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka try to help a single parent to become financially strong through the Family Strengthening Program as mentioned above. The children at SOS villages are able to grow up in a loving family and community where they are cared for and nurtured.
Deputy Director, Fund Development and Communications, Hasangika Seneviratnepointed out that this is the Christmas season, but tragically some children in our country wont receive love which is part of the Christmas message and which is the meaning of Christmas.
The No Child Alone Campaign held by SOS Villages Sri Lanka intends on continuing the discourse on the challenges that this segment of the youth are facing so that we can ensure that these children receive the love and care that they are entitled to and become pillars of society tomorrow. So SOS has been providing care for these children for the last 37 years. But we need the support of society itself. So we are looking at this solution(children who have already lost parental care) as well as preventing this problem from occurring through family strengthening, said Seneviratne
Brand Ambassador, SOS Childrens Villages, Pooja Umashankar,said that she has never lacked proper guidance in her life having the best of teachers that has contributed towards her becoming an outstanding individual. However Pooja experienced the absence of her parents. She recalls as a child she was insecure and pessimistic. She was a child who was always scared and was very reluctant to talk in a gathering.
Today my friends would not recognize the person I am today. Over time I got over this because I had amazing teachers. When someone for the first time told me about SOS I had no idea that there was such a thing in Sri Lanka. I did not know about their great and commendable work. I did not know about their family strengthening program. That was superb to know about. Initially we got funds from abroad. But now the international response is that we need to look after our children. The people in our country are earning enough so this is fair. So funds can be diverted to poorer nations. By 2023 Sri Lanka has to be self- sufficient, explained Umashankar.
Vice Chairperson of the committee on the rights of the child, Dr. Hiranthi Wijemanne,a mother and grandmother herself stated that in her experience children are extremely precious and that a country should put its children first in the family and community. She said that the development of a country cannot be judged by the number of skyscrapers it has or the number of luxury shops. The development of a country is judged by how that country looks after its children.
If we look after our children we will automatically be looking after the future of our nation. Today children throughout the world and our country are in jeopardy. Today we see that families are having problems and there are many broken families. There are a lot of single parent families with the single parents unable to cope because of insufficient income and most children are in institutions. Most children are not orphans and have at least a single parent and most times it is the mother. In many cases the child loses contact with the mother, said Wijemanne.
Wijemanne added that when the child becomes a young adult of 18, the boy might join a street gang and the girls situation is no better. So the child is in an extremely vulnerable situation. So fortunately SOS Childrens Villages have stepped in to provide protection for these children and try and prevent children from having to go to institutions. National Director, SOS Childrens Villages, Divakar Ratnadurai has firmly stated that admitting children to SOS or any other institution must be the last resort. The first resort is to keep the child in the biological family with the biological mother or father. Prevention is better than cure and the family needs to be kept together and the family needs to be supported.
We know as adults that what matters to us most is our family. Not having a family is one of the worst things that can happen to a child. The last resort is SOS which provides a mother and a caring family for the child to grow up in. I know for a fact that in our jails, we get prisoners who are there because as children they did not have the support of a parent, explained Wijemanne.
Sociologist, Dr. Nishara Fernando said that the family is the first introduction to the socialization process when it comes to a child. The child learns about values, norms and culture from their family. This is why parents are so important.
So what happens if children do not have their parents These are critical social issues in Sri Lanka that we have to deal with. What is alarming is that the children will pass down the characteristics they learn from their parents to the next generation. So what we have here is a serious problem. We need to break this cycle. These children who are orphans or single parent children come under a lot of stress. They are also not in a position to successfully cope with it. As a result they end up in institutions. So when they are in these institutions they must be treated with sensitivity and understanding. We need to help them to help themselves build a secure life in the future. I fully endorse what SOS Childrens Villages are doing and I pledge my support for their activities, said Fernando.
Fernandos comments are indeed relevant when he says that these children must be able to build a secure life for themselves. This is the entire philosophy of SOS childrens villages.
Managing Partner of BDO Partners, Sujeewa Rajapakse,a father of two daughters has visited SOS villages and in his address he commented on how the youth go astray. Some of them have parents, so one can imagine the plight of those youth who have no parents.
On Television we see enough and more stories about how young people get caught to crime and various patterns of misbehavior. I feel every child has a right to love and care by his or her parents. At my firm I have interviewed many young boys and girls. I have experience with youth who have difficulties who I have come into contact with. With my daughters I am open, and we discuss various things. I feel that now talking about divorce and such subjects is normal unlike years ago when people did not want to discuss those subjects. I think as businessmen we have a responsibility to society. The world is now progressing at a very fast rate. Society is changing and we must look after the young ones. We need to have compassion. We need to invest in worthy causes. We need to feel. I am going to support SOS Childrens Villages. That is my duty, said Rajapakse.
National Director, SOS Childrens Villages, Divakar Ratnadurai,is father to many at SOS Childrens Villages and has 33 grandchildren.
There is a percentage who have not done well but 95 percent of our children are employed and doing well in society. More than 600 boys and girls have got married. We have never allowed a child to be alone. We have always been behind them. They have someone in SOS to fall back on. The SOS mother never abandons them. She is retired and living in SOS. At SOS Childrens Villages the bond with the adoptive mother and the family is never broken. It is forever till death. The mother is always there for advice. The siblings have a bond with each other and that too is forever. Our team is working hard to reach the 2023 deadline. Helping SOS is not only through money it can be through education/ counselling. You can support in different ways, said Ratnadurai.

Kohli taking nothing for granted against Australia
Adelaide, Wednesday: Superstar skipper Virat Kohli on Wednesday played down suggestions Australia are vulnerable after the ball-tampering scandal, as his India side try to win a series Down Under for the first time.
Australia begin the opening Test in a scorching Adelaide on Thursday on a run of poor form and without batting powerhouses Steve Smith and David Warner, who remain banned.
Without them, India could have a golden opportunity to break their series drought.
But dangerman Kohli -- who electrified viewers with viral footage of a pre-Test batting exhibition in the nets -- said he was taking nothing for granted.
I personally dont think any Australian side is vulnerable at home, Kohli said at his pre-match press conference, as he named a 12-man squad that included a recall for veteran opener Murali Vijay.
You cannot take any side for granted. Whatever happened, the skill level is still there. However much you talk or behave, its your skill that counts.
They still have the skill to dominate at home. Were not taking anything for granted.
Vijay, who was dropped following a pair in the second Test against England this year, won back his place after promising young opener Prithvi Shaw was ruled out after suffering ankle ligament damage in a warm-up game.
In the same match, Vijay hit a century and will face the new ball with KL Rahul.
India opted to hold back the naming of their final XI until the morning of the Test as they mull whether to play all-rounder Hanuma Vihari or hard-hitting batter Rohit Sharma.
Ishant Sharma, Mohammad Shami and Jasprit Bumrah will lead their pace attack -- ranked among the countrys strongest ever -- along with off-spinner Ravi Ashwin. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Umesh Yadav missed out.
The guys (bowlers) feel that they are at the peak of their skill levels at the moment and they are looking forward to this challenge, said Kohli.
The bowlers are of the mindset that whatever the conditions or however hard it might be, they are just looking forward to performing. AFP

LAUGFS Terminals to receive first commercial cargo from Dec. 15
LAUGFS Terminals Limited, a unit of the Sri Lankan LAUGFS Gas Plc, has commissioned the LPG Transshipment Terminal at Hambantota port and will receive its first commercial cargo from December 15.
This is adding to a growing list of companies building LPG terminals in Asia.
LAUGFS Gas Chairman W. K. H. Wegapitiya told S&P Global Platts that discussions are ongoing between the company and suppliers for LPG term supply contracts.
Fruitful discussions are also ongoing with prospective partners, for usage of the terminal, he added. Sri Lanka needs around 480,000 mt/year of LPG, he said.
The $80 million LPG import and export terminal on the southern tip of Sri Lanka will support LAUGFS Gas rapid expansion plan in the region, towards making it an integrated regional LPG player in the Indian Ocean Rim, it said.
The first phase of the project was completed with a 30,000 mt storage terminal. It can receive and store refrigerated propane and butane separately or in mixed form, via very large gas carriers and pressurized vessels.
Plans are underway for capacity to be extended to 45,000 mt with the completion of the second phase project of 15,000 mt, making the new LAUGFS LPG Terminal a hub for LPG importing, re-exporting and supply to retailers, it said.
The terminal caters to LAUGFS Gas demand in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as well as serves as a regional LPG hub for many Asian LPG firms, the company said.
LAUGFS has also invested in improving their LPG-related infrastructure in Bangladesh, where it is expanding its existing storage terminal at Mongla port.
LAUGFS presence in the sector ranges from LPG downstream activities in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh by LAUGFS Gas, to LPG ocean freight services and related logistics with its own LPG fleet by LAUGFS Maritime Services Ltd., while energy trading is handled by Dubai-based SLOGAL Energy DMCC.
Asias growing LPG market and increased global supply sources have prompted several companies to build LPG terminals in recent years.

Likuid Spaces - The latest addition to Colombos co-working spaces
The world of freelancers and entrepreneurs is not what it was ten years ago. The advent of the gig economy and ultra-competitive start-ups have given rise to a considerable independent self-employed workforce, and along with it has risen the need to accommodate this growing sector. The exigencies of the self-employed are not what it used to be either. The need for networking, growth, healthy workspaces and social needs of the self-employed are better understood now than it was a decade ago. The way we work is changing, and so are the spaces we work in.
Enter co-working spaces, a novel and ingenious concept revolutionising the way freelancers and entrepreneurs work. What started as a financially prudent alternative to working in seclusion at home or in coffee shops in Silicon Valley has now become a global trend combining independence with the structure and community of a traditional office space.
Beginning in the mid 2000s in San Francisco, co-working spaces were incepted in order to foster the needs of the growing freelance workforce in Silicon Valleys expeditiously growing start-up community. Since then the trend has proliferated to Europe, where it caters to 35 percent of the worlds freelancers, and Asia with 28 percent. The popularity of co-working spaces in Asia is considerably noteworthy, the trend taking hold in India, China, Singapore, Hong-Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. Tech capitals in particular, with its legions of self-employed freelancers and entrepreneurs and lack of accommodations, find co-working spaces essential. The demand for co-working spaces in India is growing too. Over the last year the country has seen a swell of co-working spaces popping up, with as many as 200 spaces already in the country.
Likuid Spaces is a new, innovative and exciting start-up venture that embodies the ideals of co-working spaces. Making a splash in Sri Lankas co-working market, Likuid Spaces flourishingly outcompetes the rest. Embellished with themed rooms for gaming, *board meetings or workshops (other themes)* it is ideal for freelancers, entrepreneurs and start-ups to exercise their creativity, network and grow, all the while maintaining a healthy and fun atmosphere sure to ensure ones wellbeing. Providing digital marketing solutions, Likuid Spaces rents spaces for events and classes, along with handling all marketing related aspects of events conducted in their spaces.
The demand for co-working spaces can be understood better given the alternative of working in seclusion. Beyond the convenience of space, co-working spaces bring a host of other benefits to the table. It allows freelancers and entrepreneurs to be part of a community, which they could use to network and grow. With people of multiple disciplines, backgrounds and perspectives collaborating in one space, it fosters creativity and innovation. Co-working spaces have been proven to improve wellbeing too. Along with doing away with feelings of isolation that comes with self-employment, the constant interaction with like minded individuals gives us motivation, which in turn enhances creativity.
Recently, Likuid Spaces hosted their open day. A cheerful day full of events, gaming, workshops, as well as, popcorn, candy floss, yoga, and a deck with a delicious BBQ on the roast. It was open for all interested to discover an exciting and valuable co-working space and a day filled with festivities. It was the perfect occasion to check out Likuid Spaces for those looking for a workspace, and for those seeking to attend different classes and experience something new. It was a day of music, fun and laughter, so join the Likuid team to change the way you work.
Likuid Spaces was also joined by their partners Prana Lounge Colombo, Isso, Workout.lk, Raffles Colombo, Bandwagon, Surge Global, LoveBoxx, Pendi, Igniter Space, 3D Concepts, Yakoob MMA & Fitness, Mindful Travels, Bakes by Bella and Paan Paan for their open day. A panel discussion with the Director of Growth from coworker.com, Loshini Selvarajah, and other co-working space proprietors, was also conducted later in the evening.
No longer do we see workspaces as drab and mechanical. Traditional offices dont exist anymore, and co-working spaces are the future of freelancing and entrepreneurship. The way we work is changing.

BRAN CASTLE IN BRASOV, ROMANIA
Bran Castle, popularly known as Draculas Castle, is the perfect spot for those looking for something magical with also a lot of myth and mystery surrounding it. According to bran-castle.com, the fictional story goes that Dracula, a Transylvanian Count and the OG vampire (you know before Twilight hit the teen reading scene), has a castle located way up high in the mountains.
Although the myth is totally just something from the depths of our human imaginations, its fun to think about when taking a trip to this vision in the valley. During your visit, you might want to grab a bite at the tea house. Transylvania isnt on everyones bucket list, but now you have a beautiful reason to go.

MR need not hold onto office - SLPP
Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna MP Gamini Lokuge said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took on the Premiership at a difficult time in Sri Lankas history only because he wanted to do something for its people and has no desire to hold onto office by force.
We have utmost respect for the judiciary and will accept any decision or order given by the courts, he said. We dont need to hold onto power by force.
We are in fact calling on all political parties to allow the people of this country to make their own choice. Let people have their say.
MP Lokuge said they were appalled at how Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was conducting parliamentary proceedings. This is a prorogued parliament and it remains so. Even attending the sitting might be unlawful. If court determines that it is, then there is no use in any of the No Confidence Motions (NCMs) that have been passed thus far. We call on him to act with restraint and remain neutral, as he should be.
The MP said that the SLPP had no qualms about an NCM in parliament but added that there were parliamentary procedures to be following including holding a party leaders meeting and including it in the Standing Orders.
MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said the only way out of this crisis was to call for an election. The President has repeatedly said that even if all MPs in parliament ask in writing that Ranil Wickremasinghe be appointed PM, he will not make that call, he said. When the President is very clear about his intentions, which he has expressed several times, it is only pragmatic that he chose a premier who he is able to work along with.
He said that he felt disappointed that he too was a signatory for the 19th Amendment. When we voted for it, we believed that it would strengthen and empower the independent bodies and commissions that were to be set up under the amendment. We didnt think that it would plunge the country in to chaos and anarchy. We are dismayed that this bill which we voted for has created such a mess.
MP S.M. Chandrasena charged that in 2007, the JVP faction went and sat in the Opposition, the ruling government at the time did not obtain the majority. However the Speaker at the time W.J.M Lokubandara did not act arbitrarily. It took us two months to get those numbers again and the speaker at the time acted in a very dignified manner even through he too represented another party, MP Chandrasena said.
MP Sudarshani Fernandopulle speaking at the press conference held at the SLPP said the brutal murder of two police officers in Batticaloa was a harbinger of things to come. The LTTE surfaced with the attacks on police officers.I was schooling at the time the incident was reported but to-date we all know of it, because it signified the start of the this separatist war. These brutal murders of the two police officers are tell-tale signs that terrorism is on the rise.
She added that her family had paid dearly with the loss of her husband Jeyaraj Fernandopulle killed in an LTTE suicide attack. During the times that Ranil Wickremasinghe served as a premier, not only were foreign powers embolden enough to interfere in matters sovereign to this country but terrorists used those opportunities to cause harm, she said. If Ranil Wickremesinghe had been in the government in 2009, we would not have been able to end this senseless war.

The All Island Bus Passengers Association urges the National Transport Commission (NTC) and authorities to decrease the minimum fare to Rs.10 before December 21. Issuing a press release, the Association claimed that the NTC has had a special discussion with the All Island Bus Owners Association yesterday and agreed to postpone the revision of the bus fares till December 21.
According to the release, although the price of a diesel litre was reduced by Rs. 19 on three occasions successively, the NTC has failed to pay attention regarding this matter so far.
The Association also accused the NTC of neglecting the passengers rights by holding only the discussions with the heads of the Private Bus Associations but, doing nothing for the passengers.
Earlier, the All Island Bus Passengers Association performed as the Colombo District Bus Passengers Association.

NZ face uphill battle after Azhar, Shafiq hit hundreds
Abu Dhabi, Wednesday : Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq hit centuries to leave Pakistan in command of the third and final Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi despite a batting collapse that curtailed their first-innings lead.
Azhar hit an attractive 134 for his 15th Test hundred while Shafiq scored 104, but debutant New Zealand off-spinner Will Somerville took four wickets to restrict Pakistan to 348 all out.
Pakistan appeared set to build a huge lead before collapsing from 286-3 to lose their final seven wickets for the addition of just 62 runs.
The 34-year-old Somerville finished with 4-75 while left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel took 2-100 and pace spearhead Trent Boult chipped in with 2-66.
That gave Pakistan a 74-run lead -- the same advantage they held in the first Test at the same venue before losing by four runs.
New Zealand were then reduced to 26-2 at stumps with Kane Williamson unbeaten on 14 and nightwatchman Somerville on one not out to leave them trailing by 48 runs with eight wickets intact.
Paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi trapped Jeet Raval for nought while leg-spinner Yasir Shah had Tom Latham caught for ten, his 199th wicket in Tests.
Yasir needs just one more wicket to become the fastest to 200 wickets, in his 33rd Test, a record currently held by Australian leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett who reached the milestone in 36 Tests, 82 years ago.
Shafiq said Pakistan must limit New Zealand in their second innings after his side failed to chase down 176 in the first Test.
Its always nice to bat with Azhar, said Shafiq. But it was disappointing that we couldnt get a big lead. It happens in cricket and you have to give credit to the bowlers.
We need to get them out quickly tomorrow so that we dont need to chase a lot of runs.
Azhar and Shafiq put on 201 for the fourth wicket, but once they were dismissed only Sarfraz Ahmed (25) and Babar Azam (14) offered some resistance.
Azhar edged medium pacer Colin de Grandhomme through the slips to complete his first century since May 2017 against the West Indies in Dominica - and his first hundred against New Zealand. AFP

UPFA boycotts Parliament for fifth consecutive time
Parliament sessions were held yesterday without the participation of United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MPs, with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya presiding. This is the fifth consecutive time that the UPFA boycotted the Parliamentary session since October.
Meanwhile, UNP-MP Mayantha Dissanayake notified Parliament that the motion scheduled for yesterday would not be moved.
The motion was scheduled for debate in Parliament yesterday and was in the Order Paper to be the first business of the day. However, Mayantha Dissanayake gave no specific reason for withdrawing the motion or any future date that it may be resubmitted.
The motion in question, was filed by seven UNP lawmakers Wijepala Hettiarachchi, Harshana Rajakaruna, Mayantha Dissanayake, Mujibur Rahuman, Ajith Mannapperuma, Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne and Hirunika Premachandra proposing that the House take action in terms of Article 48 (2) of the Constitution.
The motion held that, the appointing of MP Mahinda Rajapaksa by the President as the Prime Minister on October 26, 2018 and when a No-Confidence Motion minus the first paragraph of the motion was passed on November 14,2018 was moved to the House on November 16,2018 against MP Rajapaksa and the Government, it was passed; whereas, the first paragraph of the motion passed on November 14,2018 had been removed accordingly.
It also held that the motion passed on November 16 is substantially a No-Confidence Motion against Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Government; and the Cabinet of Ministers stands dissolved in terms of Article 48 (2) of the Constitution.
Meanwhile, the Adjournment Motion was moved in Parliament by the JVP-MP Nalinda Jayatissa and was taken up for debate.
He said that due to the string of incidents that took place over the past five weeks, the country has been plunged into a state of anarchy and uncertainty and that the Parliament should focus attention with regard to the impact on the people, state mechanism and democracy in the country.
He proposed that Parliament should mediate in bringing the country out of this state of anarchy and instability and establish stability in the country.
Had the President acted in accordance with the powers vested in him and in a Constitutional manner, this issue could have been resolved. Our country had a reputation of upholding democracy and democratically elected leaders.
But due to the unconstitutional and high-handed actions of the President, the country has come to disrepute before the world, he said.
He noted that many tourists had cancelled their trips to Sri Lanka and as a result the tourism industry is in jeopardy.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath seconding the motion told Parliament yesterday that President Maithripala Sirisensa now claims that he had taken these decisions as measures against corruption.
If he was against corruption, then he should have appointed a Commission to investigate the Bond scam within a week of it happening and based on its report, he should have punished those involved. However, to date he has not punished those who were involved or implemented the recommendations of the report. The president did not punish wrongdoers but instead he gave them ministerial positions, he said.
Participating in an adjournment debate on the current political situation, the MP said that the President had breached the constitution in number of occasions.
The President continued to violate the Constitutional provisions. The way he sacked Ranil Wickremesinghe from the Premiership was unconstitutional.
The appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa was also unconstitutional and the dissolution of parliament was also not constitutional, MP Herath said.
He noted that Mahinda Rajapaksa was better off with his flower bud party instead of having fallen into this trap that has destroyed his political ambitions and brought him into disrepute, Herath said.
Parliament was adjourned until 1.00 pm on December 12.
Countrys Constitution is being violated - Kiriella
President Maithripala Sirisenas statement that he would not appoint MP Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister even though all 225 MPs requested was a humiliation to Parliament, UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella said.
Speaking in Parliament at the commencement of the sittings yesterday, the MP pointed out that the Executive must be accountable to the Legislature.
He further said that the judiciary with its interim order on December 3 reinforced Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas ruling that there is no PM or Cabinet in the country. We congratulate the Speaker on this achievement.
Today, the countrys Constitution is being violated every day.The President even did not heed what the judiciary said. For the first time, the country does not have a valid PM or Cabinet. In such a situation, we admire the Speakers efforts to maintain stability in the country, he added.
UNP MP J.C. Alawathuwala said the President had no authority to order Ministry Secretaries and that he only has the authority to order Secretaries of Ministries under him.
UNP MP Sujeewa Senasinghe inquired from the Speaker as to why he could not offer the PMs seat to Ranil Wickremesinghe observing that his removal was illegal from the outset.
He also pointed out that the appointments of Chairmen to state institutions after October 26 were illegal and that those appointments should immediately cease.

THE 19TH AMENDMENT IS NOT AN ALTERNATIVE CONSTITUTION!:
PRESIDENCY, PARLIAMENT, JUDICIARY & THE SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION
The General [de Gaulle] devised a strong executive presidency in 1958, and introduced direct elections to it four years later, precisely in order to remove power from the hands of political parties and bring stability to French institutions...the original source of French presidential legitimacy: the direct mandate of the people, introduced by de Gaulle.
Biography of Charles de Gaulle, The Economist (2018/07/26)
What is at stake in the battles in the courts is whether or not the Constitution has been up-ended by the 19th amendment, even though a two thirds majority and a referendum were not held in order to do so. Mr. Wickremesinghe had sent an ambitious draft which was challenged in the Supreme Court, which ruled that certain provisions either had to be removed or required a two thirds majority and the referendum. The SC pointed out that these provisions as they stood, infringed upon if not devalued the peoples franchise, an entrenched clause or more simply, the very basis of the Republican Presidential Constitution. These were in fact excised.
But when the truncated 19th amendment was passed, Mr. Wickremesinghe was not a happy man. In his address to the parliament he said that the new 19th amendment was a temporary measure and that a new constitution which abolished the Presidency would be brought soon enough. Now Mr. Wickremesinghe wishes to act as if this has already been done and that we live in a new Constitutional system, in which the Presidency has not merely been reformed and partially restricted, but has actually been turned into a lame duck while the parliament has been exalted into the centre of the political system, which is only nominally presidential.
All this simply because of a case of sour grapes on his part, because he ran for the president twice and failed, and knows that if there is another such election, he may have to vacate in favour of a more popular personality. Mr. Wickremesinghes peeve against the Presidency was manifested as far back as 2001-2003, when President Kumaratunga complained on the record to the foreign press, that he ignored and bypassed her at first and then tried to usurp her powers-- and therefore she was constrained to kick him out.
Presidential system
Combined with this is the TNAs long standing compulsion or drive. The TNAs political ancestors were afraid that universal suffrage would confer upon the majority its natural weightage in electoral politics and that the minorities would also be punching their natural weight. Thus the TNA carries an antipathy towards electoral democracy in its political genetic code. It preferred Prabhakarans tactics and strategy because that cut through the electoral advantage of the majority. Today the TNA prefers a Parliament in which it is the king-maker, to a Presidency which is directly elected by the nation as a whole.
What however is the logic of the Presidential system As is well known JR Jayewardene modeled the 1978 Constitution, and indeed his original advocacy of such a system in 1966 and 1972, on General de Gaulles French constitution. What then was the logic of that parent model
The Economist (UK) carries an essay of the French Presidency in the form of a review of a new book, by the British historian Julian Jackson. It was published in the Books and arts section of the print edition of The Economist, under the headline Jupiters father. Here are key extracts which shed light on the inspiration and animating spirit of the 1978 Sri Lankan Presidential republic:
de Gaulle is remembered above all as a heroic figure: a leader who refused to admit defeat, and persuaded the French that their true spirit, uncrushed by submission to Nazi Germany, would ultimately prevail
The general devised a strong executive presidency in 1958, and introduced direct elections to it four years later, precisely in order to remove power from the hands of political parties and bring stability to French institutions. In 2016 Mr. Macronwas able to defy the might of the two mainstream parties thanks to the original source of French presidential legitimacy: the direct mandate of the people, introduced by de Gaulle.
The review essay significantly entitled Jupiters father in The Economist gives the deep reasoning and the intellectual-psychological background of the French Presidency, and is directly relevant to comprehending the Sri Lankan Constitution, which modeled itself on the Gaullist:
De Gaulles unwavering belief in his ability to embody the nation, and his modelling of a constitution topped with a near-monarchical presidency, also shaped the heavy expectationsand the disappointmentsthat have surrounded his successors ever since. Some of them explicitly embraced the Gaullist legacy, notably Jacques Chirac, who denounced the American hyperpower, urged a counterbalancing multi-polar world, and relished the strong, centralised presidency. Others, or more accurately Franois Hollande, flinched at grandeur. After the whirlwind years under Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007-12, voters were at first drawn to the normal presidency that Mr. Hollande sought to embody, as he headed off on holiday by train and adopted the forgettable posture of a middle manager. But the French soon realised that they like their head of state to look grand after all.
It was while he was working as an adviser to the normal President Hollande that Mr. Macron began to develop his theory of a Jupiterian presidency. The loss of the king and the post-revolutionary Terror, he argued, had created an emotional, imaginary collective void at the centre of the French republic. This left the French feeling insecure, and in need of a leader who invested the presidency with a certain aura and mystique. If German political leadership is defined by the application of law, he contended, French society, historically structured around the Catholic Church and the monarchy, needs clear vertical authority and a president who incarnates power.

19th amendment
The 19th amendment was not an alternative Constitution or even a mini-Constitution! It cannot change an existing Constitution into a new one. It cannot change the pre-eminent institution, whose pre-eminence derives legitimacy from popular sovereignty, as the sole institution directly elected by the people taken as a whole, into an institution that is co-equal to or even subordinate to the legislature composed of the political parties.
The whole logic of the French Presidential republic is the combination of the republican character and the Presidential character. At the root is popular sovereignty and popular sovereignty is primarily represented not through Parliament but through the directly elected Presidency, because The People considered as one, as a whole, a totality, superseded the arithmetical addition of the people broken up into localities and political parties. It is only the directly elected Presidency that is representative of the people taken as a single entity.
It is that which enables Sri Lankans to think of themselves as a single nation. It is only in that moment that we are regarded as one: when the whole country votes together, to elected its leader, the President.
The Parliament is a kaleidoscope of shifting coalitions elected as and from a patchwork of localities.
The President is elected by the island taken as one unit, a single entity. That is also precisely why the President is our leader; not the Parliament; and the directly elected Presidency is the apex of our state form, our state system and structurenot the parliament. The 19th amendment modified the architecture of one corner of our state system. It did not, could not, abolish, reverse or invert it.

An inquiry has been initiated by the Railway Department into the detachment of the coaches of the Yal Devi on Monday afternoon in Vavuniya while it was running, Railway General Manager Dilantha Fernando said.
The compartments of the Colombo Fort-bound Yal Devi express from Kankesanturai and Jaffna detached on Monday afternoon between Vavuniya and Irattai Periyakulam railway stations along the Northern line, while it was running at a considerable speed.
A passenger on the train had filmed the incident and uploaded it on social media.
The General Manager said the inquiry is being conducted under the supervision of Chief Engineer (Motive Power).
Preliminary inquiries revealed a technical defect to be the cause of the detachment, he said. Detachments can take place due to different reasons, but no harm to the passengers was reported, Fernando said.
However, passengers claimed that the railway authorities should take steps to prevent such incidents which could turn into disasters with fatalities, and ensure passengers safety.
Similar incidents where the trains became detached were reported recently from the main line and also from the Kelani Valley line. Most of them were trains in which office workers travelled.

Speaker summons Media Secretary, SLBC Chairman
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya summoned Mass Media Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi and Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) Chairman Dr Somaratne Dissanayake to Parliament yesterday.
The Speaker summoned them due to concerns raised in Parliament on the State media behaviour and particularly the sudden stoppage of live broadcast of Parliament proceedings by the SLBC.
During the meeting, the SLBC Chairman had made an apology and promised to resume live broadcasting of Parliament.
The Mass Media Ministry Secretary too has undertaken to give necessary instructions to the SLBC, SLRC, ITN and ANCL (Lake House) to be responsible and independent when reporting. UNP MP Dr Harsha de Silva drew to the Speakers attention that Parliament website still refers to MP Mahinda Rajapaksa as the PM, adding that this was a violation of the Court order. The Speaker replied that he has already instructed to correct it.
UNP MP Ajith P Perera raised a privilege matter in that regard at the commencement of the sittings.
MP Perera pointed out that the SLBC has violated the agreement that it had signed with Parliament and said this was unfair as Parliament had paid money to the SLBC for live broadcast of sittings.
The Speaker, agreeing with the MP, said the SLBC Chairman has acted in an arbitrary manner and three reminders were sent to him by the Parliament Secretary General. He added that action would be taken against the behaviour of the SLBC Chairman.
The MP further requested the Speakers attention to the behaviour of all state media after October 26, adding that some of them ignored the rulings of Parliament and carried defamatory stories.
UNP MP S M Marikkar pointed out that the ITN allocated half an hour from its prime time on Tuesday to provide live coverage to an adhistana pooja near Independence Square, adding that this was a misuse of public property.
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake said that a motion with regard to state media behaviour has been submitted to the Speaker and requested it be taken up in the House as early as possible.
UNP MP Kavinda Jayewardena pointed out that SLRC Chairman Sarath Kongahage is also an advisor to the President and therefore his appointment is questionable.

In order to immediately save our country from the present peril and predicament for the sake of the unborn, our bounden duty is to preserve an economically-sound state, a country where democracy flourishes and peace prevails, and ensure that there is self-respect for all citizens and that the polity lives with prestige, the Speakers Office stated in a release.
We call the attention of the President and all stakeholders to put the country back on the right track and ensure that truth, justice and prosperity prevail, the release added.
Following is the statement:
It is our duty to draw attention to the ruling given by the Court of Appeal on December 3 and the change of the political scenario that took place on October 26. We need to express our deepest love for our motherland. We consider this the best hour to provide our thoughts to what had transpired within the past few weeks in Parliament.
With the changes occurring the day after, i.e. October 27, the Speaker advised the Secretary General of Parliament to provide all facilities to the newly appointed Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, though contrary to the law of the land and tradition but in pursuit of the Gazette of the President and responding positively to his special request.
The Speaker also pointed out the importance of showing the strength of the new government and the majority it commands within a week in Parliament in the name of democracy. He requested the President to take immediate steps in this regard. As the dissolving of the then government was not done in accordance with the accepted norms and traditions, it was the duty of the President and the new government to show to the world its strength.
The President, who showed a positive response to this request, decided to call the sitting of the new government on November 7 and make way for the new government to show its strength. However, due to various reasons, this was not materialized. While the sitting of Parliament rescheduled to November 14, 122 members of four political parties out of six represented in Parliament, refused to recognize the new government and submitted a No Confidence Motion to the Speaker.
Under the prevailing circumstances, the best course of action of the new government was to show its strength. But for whatever reason within that period, a shameless scheme was on the move to buy MPs by bribing them and promising to pay them Rs. 300 million upwards as well as offering Ministerial posts to those MPs crossing to the newly formed governments side.
We are pleased to note that the Bribery Commission has taken immediate action to investigate the alleged bribery charges of buying Members of Parliament.
Respecting the request of the majority and the President's official call to commence Parliamentary sittings on November 14, a decision was taken to waive the Standing Orders and create the necessary atmosphere to allow the new government to show its strength. This step was taken in keeping with the provisions of 136 and 143 of the Standing Orders, considering the need of the hour.
If the support was extended by the new government, steps would have been taken to count the vote by name.
For reasons one cannot understand, within the three days of November 14, 15 and 16, a disturbance was caused in Parliament preventing the conduct of a vote in a peaceful atmosphere. What we experienced was agitation and violence in the House and the unbecoming behaviour of MPs which forced the Speaker to take a voice vote.
There have been instances even in a peaceful environment where a voice vote was taken in Parliament. The Speaker accepted the majority voice vote approving the No Confidence Motion and the outcome of the No Confidence Motion was duly communicated to the President.
It is clear that on December 3, the Judiciary approved the process followed by Parliament in this regard. We are much encouraged by the backing of the Judiciary over the stand we have taken all along and approving the course of action we have taken in Parliament.
We seek indulgence to express our deep appreciation to the Judiciary in this regard. All allegations and diabolical lies brought against the Speaker and Parliament are thus dismissed.
This is the explanation of what happened in Parliament so far. Allegations that giving a hearing to the voices of 122 MPs shows bias, is ironic. Apart from the UNP, MPs from the JVP, SLMC, and TNA, the four political parties out of six represented in Parliament, were within that voice vote taken into account.
We must state that we have taken full responsibility to what we say and have faithfully followed the highest Parliamentary Standing Orders and traditions observed by the International Parliamentary Association, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and also the legal opinion expressed by local and foreign constitutional experts.
The role played by the Speaker is not meant or expected to strengthen or weaken an individual, a party or group. But we want to stress that all steps taken by us were based on policy. However, if someone does not approve our work or role done in good faith, they should not keep on criticizing the Speaker and Parliament in every nook and corner, but instead, bring a No Confidence Motion against the Speaker and remove him from the post.
All those holding responsible positions, including the President, should realize at this crucial, decisive and challenging hour - owing to what happened in the past few weeks - that the situation heavily contributed to worsening our economy and our social and political life at large. In order to immediately save our country from the present peril and predicament for the sake of the unborn, our bounden duty is to preserve an economically-sound state, a country where democracy flourishes and peace prevails, and ensure that there is self-respect for all citizens and that the polity lives with prestige.
We must also ensure that national and religious harmony and reconciliation prevail. It is our foremost duty to see that nothing harmful enters to destroy the existing peace and harmony, and does nothing to destroy national reconciliation prevailing among all communities.
Leaders of all political parties representing Parliament should ensure that there would not be a repetition of events of the recent past which tarnished the good name of Parliament. They must also take immediate steps to stop MPs from being sold for money and positions. Parliament should commit itself to do everything at hand to stop the ugly and disgraceful acts. We bring these proposals in good faith and with no other ulterior motive, either personal or political.
We call the attention of the President and all stakeholders to put the country back on the right track and ensure that truth, justice and prosperity prevail. Our sole purpose of this statement is to draw the attention of the state administration to act in the best interest of citizens and correct the flaws.

TECH ONE SANJE, MICROSOFT BUILDS UP CORPORATE CONFIDENCE TO MOVE TO CLOUD
Tech One Sanje and Microsoft introduce the cloud platform to corporations through an event entitled: Move to Cloud with Confidence.
This event aimed to help companies leverage and create co-sell opportunities through positioning Microsoft Azure as a secure cloud platform.
72 participants have gathered composed of IT Solutions Architects, IT Managers, and Senior Technology Practitioners from 21 companies across Sri Lanka to gain insights and learn the opportunities that Microsoft Azure has for the local market.
Ruwan Hewawitharana, Microsoft Sri Lanka Director Sales Corporate Accounts for Sri Lanka and Maldives and one of the speakers of the event, emphasizes the importance of leveraging such cloud technology for the local market. With a highly unpredictable market that is very receptive to tech trends, having a sturdy cloud platform that speaks flawlessly with newer technology is a must. If it is not Microsoft Azure, I dont know what it is, Hewawitharana said.
With the reality that both newer and redefined technologies such as cognitive search and Artificial Intelligence (AI) penetrating the market, Jude Perera, Team Lead for Service Delivery of Tech One Global and one of the speakers of the event, points out that it is not enough just to know these technologies. It is also a must that tech front-liners to be the first users of these technologies tied in with the cloud.
Apart from being certified experts or be known as knowledgeable as specialists for these technologies, using them is another story, as it is the only avenue we can see how the technology work in full view. And us, having that perspective, should be the first sparker of change and pass it on to future generations, said Perera.
The presentations were then followed by an open forum to further discuss the potential of Microsoft Azure to the local market.
Azures capabilities transcend the limitations of a typical cloud storage, harnessing every bit of newer technology available in the market, thus, positioning it as a cloud platform addressing almost all types of customer reservations is one way we can leverage it for the local market, shared Perara to a query about the edge of Microsoft Azure against other cloud service providers.
Tech One Sanje believes that moving to cloud should be a hand-in-hand journey with the experts to attain such confidence to build up digital transformation throughout Sri Lanka. The company promised to organize more events like this to cater the concerns of co-sellers and the industries.
Tech One Sanje is part of The Tech One Global Group. Tech One Global is a leader in digital transformation. Established in 2003, the company has provided innovative solutions to both small business and enterprise clients ranging from Microsoft licensing, Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Enterprise Content Management (ECM), document scanning services, content services platform (CSP), Enadoc and Cloud Solutions.

Wedding gate crashers learn lesson
Four youths who were in the habit of attending weddings without being invited learnt a lesson when they were caught by the relatives of the bride and groom at a wedding held at Modara, recently.
According to guests, the father of the groom had become suspicious of four youths who were emptying a couple of liquor bottles at a table. He had inquired about the connection they had to the married couple and the youths had told him that they had come upon the invitation given to them by the mother of the bride.
The mother of the bride seated at the next table heard the conversation and had intervened. She informed the father that she had not invited the youths.
At that time, others attending the function had realised that the four youths were gatecrashing and had the habit of consuming food and drinks at functions such as these. They were beaten by relatives of the bride and groom and had to flee without their shirts from the venue.
However, the youths had already emptied a couple of liquor bottles and some scrumptious dishes including desserts.

Wickrema Bids Adieu
Sri Lanka is the poorer due to the passing away last Tuesday of Dr Wickrema Sena Weerasooria. There were so many aspects to his life, and he was so many things to so many people, that it is difficult to know where to begin. Most Sri Lankans who can yet recall the J.R.Jayewardene presidency remember Wickrema as the all-powerful Secretary to the Ministry of Plan Implementation, one of the few ministries of which the President was the subject minister.
Wholly trusted by JRJ, Wickrema ran his ministry in effect as chief executive, simply keeping the President informed of the more important goings on. The ministrys mandate was all-encompassing, and he wielded the power of his office with an effectiveness that has not since seen parallel. Things simply got done, and as was the need of the times, his focus was largely in rural development and healthcare, from family planning to child nutrition.
Wickrema earned his stripes in the Jayewardene administration through his signal contribution to the election campaign of 1977, of which he was the architect, when the UNP came in from behind to secure a five-sixths majority in Parliament, entrenching the party in office for almost 20 years.
His father, the celebrated Queens Counsel N.E. Weerasooria, had been a close friend and associate of J. R. Jayewardene, which led in turn to the President affectionately treating the youthful Wickrema as his protg. And so skilful was Wickrema in delivering one electoral victory after another that many forgot that he was, if you peeled away his political exterior, an eminent legal luminary in his own right.
Born in 1939 and having schooled at Royal College, Wickrema went on to secure his LLB from the University of Ceylon, leading his batch with first class honours. After being called to the bar, he took to practising law while lecturing, first at Peradeniya and then at Vidyodaya.
It was while at the former that he met Rohini Dissanayake, a student at Peradeniya, who shortly thereafter became his wife. She herself was the daughter of Andrew Dissanayake and the sister of Gamini Dissanayake, at that time a fledgling opposition MP who would go on to become one of the most outstanding ministers of the Jayewardene Government and Leader of the Opposition, meeting his untimely death aged just 52 at the hands of the LTTE while contesting Chandrika Kumaratunga for the Presidency in 1992.
Having obtained his PhD from the London School of Economics in 1972, Wickrema took up an appointment as a lecturer in banking law at Monash University, returning to Sri Lanka to engage in the overthrow of the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government in 1977. Having served a decade as a permanent secretary, he was made High Commissioner in Canberra in 1986, in which post he served until 1990, when he returned to Monash as an Associate Professor of Law, serving also as Director of the Banking Law Centre established by the National Australia Bank.
Wickrema devoted much of his time to charity, especially in support of the blind. His specialization was in the law of banking, a subject on which he was to author several scholarly textbooks, both in Sri Lanka and in Australia.
In retirement he continued with lectures in this discipline, to would-be bankers, accountants and managers. The access teaching gave him to young minds was something he continued to relish right up to his death. Meanwhile, he served also as Insurance Ombudsman and an active member of the University Grants Commission.
He was impish to the end, and chuckled as he told me only two weeks ago that he had had to wait until he was almost 80 years old to be fired from a job for the first time: as advisor to President Maithripala Sirisena, a post to which he had been appointed in early 2015.
The fellow didnt even have the guts to tell me to my face, said Wickrema, waving the noxious missive at me. He just sent me a letter of termination. And this was the same joker who only four years ago used to hang around here asking for tips on how to win elections.
Wickrema never knew how to relax. There was always a queue outside his study at home, which was an unholy mess, cluttered with books, papers, notes and assorted memorabilia. From there he directed operations, calling on his extensive network of contacts to help solve the problems that were brought to his desk. People came to him because they knew he could get things done. From these duties he could be dragged away only by his three grandchildren, of whom he could never have enough. His last words were, Wheres Ayaan, his oldest grandson.
To pigeon hole Wickrema as a public servant, a diplomat, a lawyer , a philanthropist or an academic would be to miss the spirit of this astonishingly versatile man. His was an extraordinary humanity, finely blended with just the right amount of mischief to always keep one on ones toes. They dont make them like him anymore.
