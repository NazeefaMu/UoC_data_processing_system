ADB forecasts 6.5% growth in developing Asia
'South Asia will remain fastest growing subregion in Asia and Pacific'
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecasts that economic expansion in developing Asia will accelerate to 6% in 2017 as stronger than expected exports and domestic consumption fuel growth. Excluding Asias newly industrialized economies, growth is now expected at 6.5% this year, according to a new ADB report.
In a supplement to its Asian Development Outlook Update 2017 report, ADB upgrades its 2017 growth domestic product (GDP) outlook in the region by 0.1 percentage points compared to its September 2017 forecast, while its 2018 forecast remains unchanged at 5.8%. An unexpectedly strong expansion in Central, East, and Southeast Asia has offset a downward adjustment in South Asia.
Developing Asias growth momentum, supported by recovering exports, demonstrates that openness to trade remains an essential component of inclusive economic development, said Yasuyuki Sawada, ADBs Chief Economist. Countries can further take advantage of the global recovery by investing in human capital and physical infrastructure that will help sustain growth over the long-term.
Combined growth for the major industrial economies is revised upward to 2.2% for 2017 and 2% for 2018, due to robust domestic demand in the euro area, and in Japan due to private investment and net exports. Growth projections for the United States remain unchanged at 2.2% in 2017 and 2.4% in 2018.
By subregion, growth for East Asia is revised upward to 6.2% in 2017, from 6%, while 2018 projections of 5.8% are unchanged. Growth prospects in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC)the worlds second largest economyare revised up on resilient consumption. Growth in the PRC is now expected to expand by 6.8% in 2017 and 6.4% in 2018.
South Asia will remain the fastest growing of all subregions in Asia and the Pacific, despite a downward revision from previous projections from 6.7% to 6.5% in 2017, and is expected to pick up to 7% in 2018. GDP growth in Indiathe subregions largest economyis revised down to 6.7% in 2017 and 7.3% in 2018. Although the strong manufacturing expansion helped the economy reverse 5 consecutive quarters of deceleration in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the recovery is more subdued than assumed earlier due to rising crude oil prices, soft private investment growth, and weather-related risks to agriculture.
Growth for Southeast Asia is picking up faster than earlier forecast with GDP set to expand by 5.2% in 2017 and 2018, compared to September 2017 forecasts of 5% and 5.1%. The subregion is benefiting from stronger investments and exports, with accelerating growth for Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Infrastructure investment continued to play an important role in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Robust domestic demandparticularly private consumption and investmentwill continue to support growth in the subregion, according to the report.
The outlook for Central Asia this year has further improved as stronger domestic demand and exports in some countries have fueled recovery in the subregion. Growth is expected to reach 3.6% in 2017 compared to the 3.3% originally projected. The 2018 forecasts for Central Asia are unchanged at 3.9%.
Growth in the Pacific is expected to remain at 2.9% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018 with Papua New Guineathe subregions largest economycontinuing its gradual recovery due to rebounding mining and agriculture industries. Post-disaster reconstruction and tourism are expected to drive growth further in the subregion, particularly in Fiji and Vanuatu.
Meanwhile, rising commodity prices have not yet driven inflation across the region, with consumer price inflation tame and stable. Price inflation is unchanged from previous projections of 2.4% in 2017 and 2.9% in 2018. (ADB)

This petition was filed through senior counsel K.S. Ratnavale and counsel Senaka Perera.

Wonder Womans Patty Jenkins, Mudbounds Dees Rees and Lady Birds Greta Gerwig were all left out. Additionally, while Get Out did earn two nods for Best Motion Picture and Best Actor, director and writer Jordan Peele was left out.
Veep: Not only did the series get shut out, star Julia Louis Dreyfus also did not get any recognition. Dreyfus has taken home six consecutive Emmys but still has not won a Golden Globe.
Evan Peters: Year after year, Peters wows in American Horror Story, but Cult was an entirely new ball game and its shocking to see hes once again not included after his performance playing multiple roles. The Big Sick: The critically acclaimed, pull-at-your-heart-strings true story was completely shut out. If anything, most were expecting star and writer Kumail Nanjiani to get some recognition. Tracee Ellis Ross: While black-ish and Ross costar Anthony Anderson were recognized, she was left off the noms list.

All-rounder Marsh in line for Test recall - Smith
Perth: Skipper Steve Smith says he is leaning towards playing all-rounder Mitchell Marsh as Australias fifth bowler in Thursdays potentially Ashes-deciding third Test against England in Perth.
Smith declined to finalise an Australian XI at his Test-eve media conference Wednesday as selectors mull over the merits of struggling batsman Peter Handscomb and local star Marsh.
Handscombs place is under threat after a total of 62 runs in three innings in the series after a difficult Adelaide second Test in which his batting technique came under the microscope.
If recalled, it would be the first appearance for Marsh since a shoulder injury mid-way through Australias Test series in India earlier this year.
His chances have improved through his ability to provide a fifth bowling option to support Australias pace attack on what is expected to be a flat WACA wicket.
If we do go down that route its purely for the reasons we think we need an extra bowler on this wicket - nothing to do with anyones batting, Smith said.
The stats suggest over the past couple of years that bowlers have had a pretty heavy workload out on this wicket. Were probably leaning down that way at the moment.
It will depend on what we think the wickets like tomorrow and if it is going to be hard and fast and bouncy, that might change our thinking.
England, rattled by off-field booze-related incidents, face the prospect of losing the series in Perth where they have not beaten Australia since 1978. They were heavily defeated in the opening two Tests in Brisbane and Adelaide.
Smith admitted that changing a winning team while leading 2-0 in the five-Test series would be a tough call on Handscomb, who averages 47.35 in his 12 Test appearances.
Despite criticism of Marshs consistency at Test level where he averages just 21.74 in 21 Tests, Smith said he has seen signs in his recent batting to suggest hes a changed player.
Hes tightened up his defence quite a lot, Smith said.
I know speaking to him when he was back in the team a little while ago, we spoke about softening your hands up in defence and those good length balls -- not going so hard at them.
Ive seen that watching him the last couple of days in the nets and watching some of the Sheffield Shield games, that in defence he has actually softened his hands up.
Hes still putting away the bad ball. He hits the ball as hard as anyone Ive ever seen. Hes a strong lad.
Smith said the groundsman had been working to get more pace into the WACA wicket ahead of the Test.
I think hes got more grass on it than he previously has to try and get that pace on the wicket, he said.

Arpico to add 100,000 sq ft of green retail space
Richard Pieris Distributors Ltds mission is to add 100,000 sq ft of retail space to the modern trade market, asserted K A S Lasantha, General Manager, Richard Pieris Distributors.
These are upgraded, high level, retail operation models tested and proven in Europe. Fifteen years ago, Sri Lankan modern trade customers were served in 2,000-3,000 sq ft outlets under the supermarket label. Arpico came up with a new concept called Arpico Supercentres with 20,000-30,000 sq ft size.
Our intention was to upgrade the Sri Lankan modern trade customers living standards to the next level of the day and 15 years ago we had given the right leadership to the retail business in Sri Lanka, said Lasantha. From that point onwards we have continuously kept on adding as a trend setting company that wishes to lift the bar of the industry.
He said that when everybody was working towards turnover and profitability, they as a responsible company, by thinking of global sustainability, had taken a lot of green initiatives.
For example, whatever buildings we are putting up are green buildings, coming with a green certification. All our roofs are filled with solar panels; 35-40 % of our energy is being generated on our own through our solar systems.
Similarly, he said, whatever equipment they use is energy saving equipment and they make sure there is no waste. When considering lighting arrangements, they only use LED bulbs. All used water goes under a purification process before being discharged into the environment.
By all these initiatives, we give the right leadership to the industry as a trend setting company. Right now we have 25 large format outlets and our requirement is to give the right retail space to the customers, Lasantha said.
The General Manager said they intend to open five more large format outlets in 2018 with 100,000 sq ft of total retail space in Katugastota, Kegalle, Kundasale, Wattala and Moratuwa.

Ayurvedic drugs to be tested on NCP kidney patients
It is intended to commence providing Ayurvedic drugs and treatment for kidney patients in the Ayurvedha Hospitals Network of the North Central Province (NCP) from next January.

Bandara, Provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulasena, Provincial Ayurvedha Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis, Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Palitha Bandara, and a number of western and Ayurveda-specialised doctors participating in it. It was decided at the meeting to adopt and practice Ayurveda treatment.
Drug courses are being followed at the special kidney diseases treatment clinic in Kebitigollewa, where patients are given medicine and health care services free by an integrated team of western and Ayurvedic doctors headed by Dr. Nishantha Kumarasinghe (MBBS/PhD), a senior lecturer at Kotelawala Defense University. This traditional indigenous treatment is based on some precious ancient prescriptions revealed to Dr. Kumarasinghe by late Veteran Ayurvedic Physician Ven.Waharaka Abhayarathanalankara Thera. It is revealed that during the first year and a half since the Kebitigollewa free kidney diseases treatment clinic commenced, hundreds of kidney patients including CKDu patients, have been cured using the ancient prescriptions.
NCP Chief Secretary H. M. P. Bandara told the Daily News that it is decided to open special ailments treatment clinics based on the Kebitigollewa module in the Anuradhapura Ayurvedha Provincial Hospital, Rambewa, Padaviya, and Medirigiriyaayurvedic Hospitals as an initiative for the benefit of kidney patients who are in abundance in those areas.
A particular series of drugs will be manufactured at the Anuradhapura Thelhiriyawa Ayurveda drug-manufacturing plant on a large-scale for treating a number of patients. A sum of Rs. 2.5 million would be allocated as the first step to start the manufacturing process, and the provincial council would extend its support to obtain 23 herbs required for the manufacturing of these drugs by providing essential infrastructural facilities. It is a good omen to see that both western and Ayurvedic doctors have united to rescue the province from the kidney disease menace at this juncture, Bandara said further.

Beauty benefits of Tea Tree oil
UK's Prince Harrys fiance and soon-to-be Duchess, Meghan Markle has revealed this natural remedy  tea tree oil  is her go-to skin care remedy. Shes not alone.
Tea tree oil is an Australian favorite that has migrated into bathroom and medicine cabinets across America for its application on minor cuts and burns, abrasions, bites and stings.
Markle revealed in an interview with Allure Magazine that Tea Tree Oil is her secret skincare weapon, saying, The one thing that I cannot live without when Im traveling is a small container of tea tree oil no matter what it is, its my little cure-all. Its inexpensive, its small enough to carry on, and I bring it with me all the time. The use of Tea Tree Oil first began in Australia, where the native aborigines harvested the oil for use in treating cuts, burns and other skin issues and now we give you 12 of the up to date Tea Tree oil benefits and ways you can use Tea Tree oil as a part of your health and beauty regime:
Here are some benefits of usingthis miracle-oil
1. Tea tree oil for acne
Tea tree oil is one of the best home remedies for acne. Tea Tree oil has powerful antibacterial properties and therefore, it makes a neat natural alternative to benzoyl peroxide, the chemical used in other types of acne treatments and, unlike its manufactured counterparts, Tea Tree oil doesnt leave your skin red and peeling. Just apply a drop of this wonderful oil straight on your pimple using a Q-tip before going to bed (do it for couple of nights) and see your acne healing. (Dont apply Tea Tree oil all over your skin, target only your acne breakouts.) You can also add about 10 drops of the antibacterial Tea Tree oil to your regular face wash.
2. Promotes healthyhair growth
A few drops of tea oil, mixed with a carrier oil (olive oil, coconut oil or sweet almond oil) massaged into your scalp will unclog the hair follicles, nourish the roots and help to induce hair growth. Always remember to mix with a carrier oil first as, on its own, Tea Tree oil is too strong for direct application to your skin.
3. Razor burn relief
For painful and uncomfortable razor burns, mix a couple of drops of Tea Tree essential oil with one spoon of Coconut oil and apply to the affected areas for a soothing and healing balm.
4. Dandruff cure
Tea Tree oil benefits include dandruff cure. Tea Tree oil has been used as an effective treatment for dandruff for many years. Just add a few drops of Tea Oil mixed in with your usual shampoo; wash and rinse out as usual.
5. Treatment for dry scalp
Mix some Tea Tree oil with a carrier oil, such as jojoba oil, olive oil, coconut oil or sweet almond oil and massage gently into the hair and scalp; leave for about half an hour before washing out. Oils will moisturise and nourish your scalp and clear any blockages in the pores.
6. Moisturiser for dry skin(mixed with carrier oil)
Tea Tree oil, mixed with a carrier oil, is great for moisturising dry and cracked skin. Mix 1-2 drops of Tea Tree oil with 1 tablespoon of sweet almond oil; massage gently into the affected areas, especially on your knees, elbows and heels for lasting relief from dry skin.
7. Hair fall remedy
An effective hair fall remedy that will help nourish and moisturize the hair: mix a couple of drops of Tea Tree oil with a couple of tablespoons of Castor oil or Argan oil, massage your scalp with it for couple of minutes, leave the treatment on your hair for about 1 hour, then wash off; it can slow the thinning of hair, re-vitalise and thicken hair at the same time.
8. Treatment for cornsand warts
Apply undiluted Tea Tree oil onto warts and corns twice daily for an effective, natural way of removing them. Be careful though not to let undiluted Tea Tree oil spill onto sensitive areas of skin, as it is extremely strong.

But reviving the wilted fortunes of his family's political dynasty ahead of a general election due next year will be a tough ask for the Oxford-educated scion, who at 29 years old has never held political office.
His family once dominated Pakistani politics.
Grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto founded the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and ascended to the highest civil office in the land, followed by Benazir, who became Prime Minister twice and was running a third time when she was killed in a gun and bomb attack on December 27, 2007.
Since her death the PPP has seen its fortunes plunge, and few are willing to bet on Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, now the party's chairman, shepherding it back to glory.
But there are flickers of life.
When Bilawal took the stage at the PPP's golden jubilee celebrations in Islamabad last week, surprised observers put the crowd at around 25,000, higher than recent rival gatherings.
Much like his charismatic mother, Bilawal was forthright at the lectern, confronting militants infesting Pakistan and the powerful military alike.
We have to continue our progressive struggle and defeat the conspiracies of dictatorship, he thundered as the crowd roared.
But away from the podium he cuts a shyer persona.
My mother often said that she didn't choose this life, it chose her, he tells AFP at his family home in Karachi. The same applies to me. - Great expectations Bilawal's grandfather Zulfikar forged the PPP in southern Sindh province 50 years ago, his slogan of roti, kapra, makkan (bread, clothing, shelter) turning the party founded by a feudal landlord into Pakistan's first populist force.
He gave every Pakistani a sense of pride, beams Bilawal.
But Zulfikar was deposed by General Zia-al-Haq in a coup and hanged in 1979 despite an international outcry. Benazir, as her son would be decades later, was thrust into the spotlight. Following Zia's death in 1988, she was elected prime minister at the age of 35.
Her government was undercut by military interference and allegations of corruption, however, and despite becoming prime minister twice she never completed a term.
Ousted in 1996, she spent most of the military dictatorship years of Pervez Musharraf in self-exile, returning in 2007 to contest another election.
But hopes sparked by her return were shattered by her assassination weeks later. Her murder was pinned on jihadists, with a UN investigation accusing Musharraf of failing to provide sufficient security.
It was a bitter blow for those who had hoped for a different Pakistan, says Ayesha Jalal, of the centre for South Asian studies at Tufts University.
That includes the Bhuttos. If they stopped assassinating us then my mother would be in the foreign office and I would still be a student, says Bilawal.
Bilawal was named PPP chairman after his mother's death but, still just a student, he returned to Oxford.
His father Asif Ali Zardari -- nicknamed Mr 10 Percent over the many graft claims against him -- took control as the party swept the 2008 elections, presiding over its years of decay, fuelled by allegations of corruption and incompetence. Questions linger over Bilawal's ability to lead the PPP if power still ultimately rests with Zardari.

British board to review Fury licence
London: Tyson Fury could have his boxing licence reinstated when the British Boxing Board Of Control (BBBOC) meets next month, a move that would allow the controversial British fighter to make a dramatic return to the ring.
UK Anti-Doping has cleared the 29-year-old former world heavyweight champion to return, after an absence of over two years, following his acceptance of a backdated two-year ban over a positive test for a banned steroid.
Fury, who has denied any wrongdoing, has spoken of his desire to reclaim the world titles which are rightfully mine but can only box again with the permission of the BBBofC.
Tyson Furys boxing licence suspension will be considered by the stewards of the board in January, the board said on Wednesday.
Fury, who has not fought since his shock win against Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015 to become the undisputed heavyweight world champion, said he was looking forward to getting back into the ring.
Im a fighting man through and through and Ive never backed down from anyone in my life and I was certainly not going to back down from fighting this dispute, he said.

CA extends interim order staying proceedings into almanac case till Feb. 2
The Court of Appeal yesterday extended its Interim Order staying any further proceeding into the controversial almanac case before High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, until February 2.
Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya made this order consequent to a Transfer Application filed by former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa seeking an order staying any further proceedings into the almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
Rajapaksa has sought an order transferring the case from the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to any other court of the High Court of Colombo.
Judge Kulatunga also delivered the judgement regarding the controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against him.
He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal complaining that he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
On November 15, the High Court case against two accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 29.4 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department was fixed for trial to be heard on a day-to-day basis beginning from November 24 by Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Minister and former Director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing five million almanacs with the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs. 29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material during January 2015 Presidential Election.

Cancer unit for Ambalantota hospital
A special cancer treatment unit will be opened at the Ambalantota hospital today to provide indoor treatment to cancer patients, Director of the Hambantota General Hospital Dr. Danushka Perera said.
The new unit at the Ambalantota hospital would fill the void created by the absence of indoor cancer wards at the Hambantota hospital, he said.
All these years, cancer patients in the Hambantota region had travel a long distance to Galle to obtain treatment from the Karapitiya hospital while patients in the Uva Province had to proceed to the Badulla General Hospital for treatment.
Although cancer clinics had been conducted at the Hambantota hospital since 2014, those needing indoor treatment had to be sent to Karapitiya or Badulla Hospitals for necessary expert attention.
The new indoor unit at the Ambalantota hospital has a bed capacity to facilitate 20 patients at a time, said oncologist Dr. Mahilal Wijekoon.
He said a pharmacy for cancer patients would be opened at the unit within a month.

Plague unthinkable
I am not averse to words that twist the tongue. One cannot spend time explaining. One must have technical terms. Still, there is a damnable plague of what plain people call long words.
The patient was diagnosed suffering from Dyskinesia, meaning the involuntary movement of the fingers in the left hand, otherwise known as Parkinson's disease, named after the British surgeon James Parkinson. The local specialist had prescribed 10 mg tablets of Domperidone be taken three times a day. The patient is from the school of hard knocks where he learnt to trust but verify. What he found was startling. Now he is on the horns of a dilemma. Listen to his guardian angel and does not take the drug or take the drug and sine que sera, sera -whatever will be, will be, the future is not for us to see. What he discovered was Domperidone is banned in most countries in the West due to its monstrous side effects and strictly banned in America by the FDA because Domperidone is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.
How a drug that is banned in advanced countries is freely prescribed in a poor, third world country is a mystery that can be solved only by Dr Watson, the associate of the famed detective Sherlock Holmes. Whether other banned drugs are also prescribed in this country at the prodding of the giant pharmaceutical industries, with bags of carrots, torments the mind.
I often saw him from my high perch in the senior dormitory, walking solo in his brown tussore shorts, matching silk shirt, polished shoes and socks across the quadrangle towards the junior dormitory and wondered who this brat was. Later I came to know he was a brilliant student winning double promotions and then coming first in the new class. There was a rare exception. He failed a compulsory question in a prize giving test to name the author of Survivals and New Arrivals, the answer, Hilaire Belloc.
To see so many years later he would be hit by such an unkind disease, more dreadful than what the Old Testament prophet Job suffered, demonstrates the uncertainty of life. He is but one of the last links I have with my old school St Joseph's College. As the song soberly proclaims, as time goes on, we miss friends, longtime friends.

Colonial architecture, heritage must be preserved: PM
Sri Lankas colonial and Kandyan architecture needs to be protected and restored, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Wednesday.
He was speaking at the Living Heritage conference at the Grand Oriental Hotel in Colombo.
Everywhere you go you will find buildings of the European heritage in this country, he said, citing the Dutch Hospital and Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, as well as the Galle Dutch fort.
But we also have other buildings from the same period, the Kandyan period, which are maintained. There are other, older buildings to renovate, going back about two centuries, he said. This is the living heritage of Sri Lanka, and this living heritage is what we want to make sure is preserved and also utilised as a part of our tourist industry.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that the government has asked the Tourist Development Authority to identify buildings for preservation. He also promised funding to Moratuwa University students who were conducting architectural heritage projects.
We need a plan, he said, because Colombo has some unique architecture, Colombo together with Calcutta is where the modern commercial example was introduced to Asia.
Preserving those physical buildings is valuable for history, he said.Colombo has a rich and diverse urban environment, EUs Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Tung-Lai Margue said.
But without the yin of policy change, and the yang of demand for that change from civil society, the city of memories, the city of peoples youth, will be lost, he said.
The architectural conference was sponsored by the EU, the Netherlands and German embassies and the British Council.

From crisis to resilience  Part 7
Think back to a meeting when you had a handful of people gathered around a whiteboard and one person is drawing and talking, explaining what she means. In mid-flight, a colleague grabs another pen and adds to the drawing, suggesting another perspective. A new train of thought emerges. Everyone pitches in and the conversation is electric with ideas, and with each word progress is made toward their common objective. This is a typical example of collaboration at work.
You might be one of those executives who might intercept and say, Excuse me, I never heard this term used in our company. We have coordination and cooperation extensively used and practised. Is there anything more in collaboration
Yes, there are differences.In cooperative endeavours the focus is primarily on sharing information and expertise. In this type of relationship participants are loosely connected so their contribution to the relationship is low. Each participant remains completely independent from the others. There are only minor changes in how each participant does business, but they have the advantage of learning from others and being able to modify the way they work.
In coordinated approaches, the parties realise the need to work together to meet a set goal. This process requires participants to tightly align resources and effort. Although involved in set joint policies and programs, organisations retain control over their own operations.
Coordination requires a higher level of contribution and commitment as well as stronger relationships between participants.
Collaboration is characterised by strong and highly interdependent relationships. Participants realise that to achieve outcomes they have to agree to radically alter the way that they think, behave and operate. Collaboration is not about making adjustments at the periphery; it is about systems change and as such participants are involved in a high-risk, high-stakes and volatile environment that can produce results significantly different from those originally intended.
In Business world, today we face an entirely new environment for innovation and getting things done. The days of the lone genius quietly toiling away in pursuit of that spectacular success in his organisation are all but over. We are now in the days of asking and listening to our customers and working with them in our innovation cycles.
And, innovation demands collaboration. So does sales, production, finance and administration. In the past we could focus on a single task in an assembly-line fashion, handing our completed activity to the next person who would in turn do the same, until the job was finished. Now the jobs change fast, requiring learning new skills rather than merely repeating the old. We have to seek out people who have other pieces of the puzzle and work with them to tackle increasingly complex issues at a much faster pace. Today we all need to be collaboration superstars. The trouble is, collaboration is a skill and set of practices we are rarely taught. Its something we learn on the job in a hit-or-missfashion. Some people are naturals at it, but most of us are clueless. Our challenge doesnt stop there.
An organisations ability to support collaboration is highly dependent on its own organisational culture. Some cultures foster collaboration while others stop it dead in its tracks.
Conditions
How do we get more collaboration in the workplace To do so, we need to understand the necessary conditions that will result in collaboration occurring. There are two conditions that are necessary for collaboration.
* First, collaboration can only be expected when efforts are focused on clear, high- stakes issues. We cannot expect people to collaborate on trivial matters. If ream members are told to collaborate on simple issues, they will quickly become frustrated. This often happens when a task force or committee is organized to address a simple matter.
* The second condition is the existence of good interpersonal relations between the people collaborating. For collaboration to occur, team must feel comfortable with each other. They must be able to work closely together and trust each other. This level of trust only comes with good interpersonal relations among the parties.
Trust must be established first, then collaboration is possible. If there is a poor relationship and no trust, people will quickly revert to a competitive, self- serving approach to any problem.
Tips
Its tough to keep everyone motivated and collaborating on your team every hour of every day. Here are 7 essential rules to help you along the way.
Communicate effectively
If youre not communicating with your team, then youre not collaborating.
Open and continuous discussion between team members can open the door to new ideas and concepts that would otherwise be left unturned. Communication is not limited to long emails or meetings instant messaging and group messaging services are a great way to keep communication constant and passive.
Encourage ideas
Are your team members or clients encouraged to share their ideas Sometimes your team or customers are not sure if their ideas will be deemed productive  let anyone working with you know their ideas are always welcome and collaboration is one of your principles in your company. A good exercise is to encourage ideas at different stages in a project, to make sure its ways headed in the right direction.
Value opinions
If you have opened up the door to ideas from your team, clients, or customers, be sure to value that opinion. Not all ideas are going to be gems, but by showing that you value other peoples opinions, youre allowing a constant stream of collaboration within your organization that will be worth it in the end. A simple thank you for your ideas is sufficient and allows flexibility when it comes down to making an important decision.
Group decisions
Its hard making a big decision on your own. Its normal to rely on someone else to help you make a decision, but it is even easier to make those decisions in a group. Even though its not possible to make every decision in your company as a group, by allowing some minor decisions or details to be made as a group, youre showing your team members that you value their opinion and you may increase collaboration as a result.
Magic number
The magic number has enough people to develop great ideas, but not so many that its hard to keep up with all those ideas. If you find the magic number, youll introduce a whole new level of collaboration within your team.
Young and experienced
Try and open up collaboration to as many different age groups as you can. Your team members in their 20s arent smarter than your team members in their 30s, and vice versa. Every age group has a different level of knowledge and experience, so dont pick one group over the other when communicating or collaborating.
The bossfactors
If youre a senior manager or the boss you may consider sitting out a few conversations and watch from the sidelines. By keeping your voice out of the start of a conversation, your team members may feel free to continue exploring their ideas without feeling the wrath of your power. If you get involved in the conversation too early, you may stump the growth of great ideas; by letting the seeds grow on their own, youre able to jump in at harvest time and reap the rewards (or destroy the crop if need be).
Digital trajectory
Companies are at different points on the digital trajectory; some are beginning their journey, some are implementing changes in a phased manner, while a few early adopters are already seeing quantifiable benefits. But one things for sure: digitalization is dramatically altering the way businesses are transacted globally. Consider the example that really grabbed my attention recently: erstwhile competitors are now collaborating for industrial growth  and this is certainly a game changer.
Previously, one used to hear about suppliers and end users collaborating to disseminate information and understand new technologies. Supply chain linkages were also linear; but this does not work in todays complex and integrated supply chains. In the digital world, where there are different levels of connectivity, suppliers are forging bonds with each other to simultaneously expand their combined global footprint and help the customer grow.
New workplace
We are witnessing the end of the dominance of the PC and a shift to a post PC world. The workplace has assumed an astoundingly mobile nature - one that has given employees the flexibility of working from home or any remote location.
This next generation workspace empowers employees across the world to collaborate, communicate and create. Sitting at the heart of this new workspace are four critical elements- mobile, social, visual and virtual. These four together marks a sea change in the way in which businesses operate. Mobile: As communication becomes more people centric, the explosion of mobile devices has made it possible to communicate from any device irrespective of technology or operating system.
Social: Recent times have witnessed a proliferation of social media applications in organizations of every size, across every part of the world.
Visual: Video is becoming pervasive and is no longer just used in conferencing and training, but in areas such as remote healthcare and banking, live problem resolution in manufacturing, global interviewing in HR and many others. Virtual:Organizations are taking applications to the cloud and making it available to users wherever they are. Virtualization is expected to become the top networking investment over the next five years as organizations continue to focus on reducing IT costs.

East Jerusalem should be declared Palestinian state's capital, say Muslim world leaders

East Jerusalem must be recognised by the world as the capital of an independent Palestinian state, more than 50 Muslim nations have said, in a move designed to counter Donald Trump's decision to recognise the contested city as Israeli.
A draft declaration from an extraordinary Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) meeting was distributed to reporters on Wednesday.
The Trump administration's move is "null and void" and means that the US can no longer act as an "unbiased" sponsor in Middle East peace talks, it read.
The 57-member strong body is meeting in Istanbul to hammer out a unified response from the Muslim world to last week's unprecedented move from the US.
The US president shocked even some of his county's closest allies on 6 December by following though with a campaign trail promise to formally recognise the holy city as Israels undivided capital.
Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 in a move that has never been recognised internationally.
Both sides claim it as their capital and the city's status remains a major stumbling block in peace talks.
While welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, many other world leaders - including the US Middle Eastern allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia - have expressed concern that the controversial move could spark renewed violence in the region and wider Muslim world.
Four Palestinians have died in clashes in Gaza and the West Bank and protests have smouldered across the globe for six consecutive days.
Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas told the OIC conference that Mr Trump's announcement was a "crime" that threatens world peace, calling on the UN to lead negotiations in the intractable conflict.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan added that the US' role is now "over" in brokering peace in the region.

EU, Japan in world's biggest free trade deal
The European Union and Japan have agreed terms for a free trade deal set to create the world's biggest open economic area.
The deal - the largest struck by the EU - is expected to liberalise almost all trade between the bloc and the world's third-largest economy.
It is being seen as a challenge to the protectionism championed by US President Donald Trump.
It must now be ratified by EU members and the European Parliament.
A joint statement by European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the deal had "strategic importance" beyond its economic value.
"It sends a clear signal to the world that the EU and Japan are committed to keeping the world economy working on the basis of free, open and fair markets with clear and transparent rules fully respecting and enhancing our values, fighting the temptation of protectionism," they said.
For the EU the agreement is overshadowed by another set of trade negotiations that seem to be about to start - with the departing UK - but it remains an important moment.
Japan represents the biggest economy with which the EU has signed on the dotted line. For sure there are important neighbours and significant players more distant from Europe, such as South Korea and Chile, but Japan is on another scale. And there could be more next week involving Mexico and a group of countries in South America. However, there is no current prospect of a trade deal with the world's two largest economies. Negotiations with the United States, known as the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), are stalled. The EU is negotiating with China on investment - not for a general free trade deal. For now, much of the EU's negotiating capacity will be tied up dealing with the UK.
Japan has a population of about 127 million people and is Europe's seventh-biggest export market.
One of the biggest EU exports to Japan is dairy goods, as the Asian nation's appetite for milk and milk-based products continues to rise.
Meanwhile, cars are one of Japan's biggest exports to the 27-nation bloc.
Japan is also hoping to capitalise on the failure of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was scuppered by Trump in January.
Last year, the EU and Canada struck a major trade deal as EU-US trade talks faltered.

Exclusive Lines introduces  app with NFC tap system
Exclusive Lines, the luxury retailer has introduced a new app that offers customers the convenience of scoring and tracking loyalty points with an NFC (Near Field Communication) tap system for the first time in Sri Lanka. In addition, customers can make their purchases via the app and have their goods delivered right to their doorstep.
Exclusive Lines is ahead of the digital consumerism curve with this new app, which will replace its loyalty card system in stores. Before this development, the company was the first and only retailer to use smart card technology in loyalty cards. Now it is the first company to use the NFC tap system in Sri Lanka-ahead even of financial institutions.
Customers can shop and redeem points anywhere, anytime. They can also keep abreast of special mobile promotions and benefits, receive news on upcoming online and offline promotions and get in touch directly with Exclusive Lines for queries and news.
The app is available on Google Play and Windows and will be available on iOS by mid-December. Anyone can register as a member on the Exclusive Lines mobile app with no charge or purchase required. From this point, a generous loyalty reward scheme falls into place. Registering as a member entitles the customer to a 5% reward on purchases of any amount from mobile and via any Exclusive Lines outlet. In addition, they can avail themselves of a 50% bonus on their sixth purchase, and a special 50% bonus on a birthday or anniversary. The app also provides an unrestricted upgrade to a next tier (VIP and VVIP) at any given time.
Exclusive Lines has led the charge for premium quality branded products in Sri Lanka for over 20 years, and represents several international luxury brands.
This total shopping solution for Exclusive Lines customers comes at a time when the Sri Lankan consumer is beginning to embrace digital solutions in retail. Exclusive Lines VIP and VVIP customers already had access to an innovative card system that used smart technology and NFC technology was the next logical step, says HiruSurtani, Director of the company.
The app also brings the rare element of transparency to the table; users can access information on their purchases and loyalty points at any time. This app has been designed for our customers to experience the same service they would experience at an Exclusive Lines store via their mobile. Its convenient, lightning fast and very interactive, added Surtani.
Customers can indulge in this experience at all Exclusive Lines stores islandwide.

FR petition seeking Interim Order fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights petition which sought an Interim Order restraining the Elections Commission from taking steps to hold elections for the election of members to three Pradeshiya Sabhas, including the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, was yesterday fixed for support by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Courts two-Judge-bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare and Justice Vijith Malalgoda, fixed the petition for support on December 15, since the Attorney General sought further time to get instructions from the respondent parties.
The petitioner, H.D.D. Nandaraja, a former member of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, also seeking an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette Notification issued by the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Governments, dated 2.11.2017 in respect of these Pradeshiya Sabhas until the final determination of this application.
The Petitioner stated that the Local Government Minister in declaring the dissolution of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba and constituting the aforesaid three Pradeshiya Sabhas has inter alia:
(1) Effected the sub-division of Local Government areas of the former Ambagaumwa Pradeshiya Sabha solely on an ethnic basis;
(2) Failed to consider the historical importance, significance and sacred value of the Sri Pada for the Buddhists, which was located within the local limits of the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha;
(3) Failed to consider the identity and the rights of the historical inhabitants residing within the local limits of the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha;
(4) Failed to assure due protection and fostering of Buddha Sasana (guaranteed by Article 9 of the Constitution), by placing Sri Pada, the most Sacred Place of worship of Buddhists and the sanctuary forming part and parcel thereof in immense danger of mismanagement and ill-treatment by non-Buddhists;
(5) Failed to consider the historical and social reasons and requirements for the demarcation of the existing boundaries of the Ambagauwa Pradeshiya Saba and the need to correspond to the limits of the Assistant Government Agents Division (Divisional Secretary);
(6) Failed to consider the equal rights for effective participation of the people in local government and development of the people living in the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba limits and the right for equal distribution of the revenue, wealth and natural resources therein;
(7) Acted ultra-vires, arbitrary, capricious and violate the principle of Natural Justice and Rule of Law.
The petitioner said though there had been no date fixed by the Election Commission to call for nominations with regard to the elections of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, he had made public announcements that such nominations would be called for Local Government bodies of the entire country together.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana with Counsel H.M. Thilakaratne, under the instructions of Nuwan Bellanthudawa, appeared for the petitioner.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

Galuku Hydrophonic wins Wayamba Vijayabhimani Excellence Award
Galuku Group of Companies was awarded as the most excellent businessman in the category of innovative value-addition products at Wayamba Vijayabhimani Entrepreneur Excellence Awards.
This award was secured by Galuku Hydroponic , a sister company of Galuku Group of Companies. The President, Maithripala Sirisena witnessed this award ceremony organized by north western provincial industrial services bureau at the provincial council auditorium in Kurunegala.
The ambition that induced the inception of Galuku Hydroponic (Pvt) Ltd in 2004 was the need to attire economic value on the leftovers of coconuts. They started their business on coir substrates and their subsequent experiments led to the manufacture of a more developed, quality-driven products range for the market.
Their first series of value-added products comprised of coir substrates-based agricultural outputs. The persistent popularity these coir substrates-related products could gain in nursery growths was remarkable. As they introduced most ideal coir substrate products that were sensitive to the water consumption, they could invade a massive market territory.Galuku Hydrponic has also invented products required for pets.
They already carry a glorious demand in the market. Galuku Hydroponic (Pvt) Ltd won the Wayamba Vijayabhimani award for the innovative products they manufacture for the pets, oil-related industries and innovations for domestic tasks. Their other products contain highly pure oil-related foods and skin-care products among them.

Getting ready for the ballot box
If Sri Lankans watched the drama that preceded the local government elections with much amusement with major political parties jousting with each other to gain political advantage for the poll, they will be in for more of the same as the nation prepares for its first countrywide test of public opinion since this government came in to office almost three years ago.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is still coming to terms with its internal divisions, the United National Party (UNP) is saddled with the burdens of incumbency and mistakes for which it has only itself to blame and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is keen to create a significant impact on its first appearance as a major political force.
There was light relief for die-hard supporters of the SLFP when President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa appeared together in public for the first time more than in two years. The occasion was the wedding of Pasanda Yapa Abeywardena, the son of State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
The two political rivals were not only the two attesting witnesses at the nuptials, they were seated at the same table making polite and convivial conversation, with Sports Minister Dayasiri Jaysasekara also in attendance. With photographers snapping away at this rare opportunity, Rajapaksa was to remark that there would now be stories of the SLPP and the SLFP uniting. However, any exchange the President and his predecessor had was limited to pleasantries and nothing political was discussed.
Local government elections
Politics was discussed however when President Sirisena telephoned another Rajapaksa sibling, SLPP stalwart and former Minister of Economic Affairs Basil Rajapaksa, following mediation from the Buddhist monk, Venerable Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera. When news of this appeared in the media, Rajapaksa himself offered an elaboration.
Rajapaksa was to say that this was his first contact with the President in several years but re-iterated that there should be an opposition to the government, hinting that any discussion he had about the two factions of the SLFP coming together would not bear fruit, at least in time for the local government elections. However, with the process of handing over nominations still underway, some SLFP old timers are hopeful that the two groups could still come to some understanding.
If there was any such agreement, none of that was evident on the ground with both the SLFP and the SLPP making hurried preparations for the poll, interviewing candidates. A further indication of this came when Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a loyalist of President Sirisena, announced that the SLFP would be presenting candidates under not only its traditional hand symbol but also the betel leaf symbol. The hand symbol has not been on the ballot paper since 1991, Amaraweera said.
The betel leaf is the symbol of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) of which Amaraweera is now the General Secretary. It will be recalled that the SLFP contested under the banner of the UPFA at the August 2015 general elections. That the mainstream SLFP is fielding candidates under the UPFA symbol in some areas is yet another indication that it intends to hold its own against any attempts by the SLPP to usurp the UPFA symbol.
A blow to JO faction
A further blow to the Joint Opposition (JO) faction came in the form of defections from the ranks of the JO to the SLFP. The first to break ranks was Digamadulla district parliamentarian Sriyani Wijewickrema. Ms Wijewickrema, who is from the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), met President Sirisena and pledged her support to the government, hours after voting against it in Parliament.
Following suit was Weerakumara Dissanayake. Dissanayakes defection is politically more significant in many ways. An Anuradhapura district parliamentarian, Dissanayake has been in Parliament since 2004 and was from the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP), the faction led by Wimal Weerawansa that broke away from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
Dissanayake joined the government along with Piyasiri Wijenayake, the National Organiser of the JNP, with whom Weerawansa has been having differences of opinion, even publicly, for some time. The defections of both Dissanayake and Wijenayake to the SLFP is a bonus for President Sirisena and lays Weerawansa open to the criticism that his JNP is now reduced to a one man show.
Stalwarts from the JO have criticised these recent crossovers stating that Wijewickrema and Dissanayake crossed over to obtain deputy ministerial positions in the government. That may or may not eventuate but if anything, the defections highlight that it would not be plain sailing for the JO and that it does not enjoy a stranglehold on its parliamentarians. With several weeks more to go for the polls, more drama is likely.
While the SLFP and the SLPP are fighting it out to gain an advantage over each other, the UNP is also not without its share of difficulties. Having supported President Maithripala Sirisena in his presidential election campaign against Mahinda Rajapaksa and having become the party with the largest number of seats at the general election that followed, the UNP now has to fight problems of its own making.
At the top of that list is the beating its public image has taken following revelations made at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank bonds. Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has already become a casualty but now the UNP is finding that whenever it levels allegations of corruption against the Rajapaksa regime, its stalwarts are responding with counter allegations related to Central Bank bonds. Needless to say, the partys reputation and integrity is not what it should be, just before an election.
This week, John Amaratunga, a senior UNPer and holding the portfolios of Tourism Development, Christian Religious Affairs and Land, generated more controversy by his remarks at a public meeting in Ja-Ela. The government and the Police are ours this time. No one should be afraid. We will deal with anyone. What we want is your vote only, Amaratunga told a UNP rally.
Rajapaksa regime
The opposition claims that the implied sentiment of these remarks is that the UNP will use the state resources and power to its advantage at the election- which is the kind of practice it accused the Rajapaksa regime of, when it was suffering for many years in the opposition and also the type of behaviour it pledged to stamp out when it came into office.
Already, the JO has complained about Amaratungas remarks and said that the Elections Commission should inquire into it. Amaratunga, now 77, completes forty years in Parliament next year and his remarks are unbecoming of a veteran politician and are unlikely to be helpful to the UNP.
Also, if the UNP believes that it can become victorious at the upcoming elections simply because the SLFP is divided into two camps, it needs to re-think its campaign strategy. The country has not seen a three cornered tussle between major parties since the 1993 provincial polls when the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) emerged as a breakaway faction of the UNP.
There might be a lull in campaigning during the Christmas and New Year season but tensions between the political parties and their leading personalities are likely to increase in the weeks to come. That is because the outcome will most certainly define the political direction of the nation for the next few years.

HARRY POTTER
Harry Potter fans have a new reason to be excited: a script about the wizarding worlds creator is gaining steam in Hollywood.
Written by Anna Klassen, an up-and-coming scribe who formerly covered entertainment news at Bustle, When Lightning Strikes is the astutely titled script telling the story of J.K. Rowling and its being placed on some powerful lists in filmmaking. When Lightning Strikes has landed itself coveted rankings on the 2017 Black List and 2017 Hit List.
This script is a story of one woman overcoming unthinkable odds - poverty, domestic abuse, depression - to create something born, miraculously, out of love, Klassen told ComicBook.com. Its a story of redemption and inspiration. Its a story we desperately need in 2017. Of course, Klassen is not wrong, either, as waves of news involving women overcoming obstacles have dominated headlines left an right, all year.
Its also good reason for Harry Potter fans to rejoice, of course, as the prospect of learning more about the woman who gifted them the iconic set of books which would spawn epic blockbusters, theme parks attractions, and more.
The script earned 20 votes on the Black List, earning a sixth place finish, and ranked 17th on the Hit List - in a tie with Pete Barrys Marian.
The synopsis listed for the film reads, The true story of 25-year-old Joanne Rowling as she weathers first loves, unexpected pregnancies, lost jobs, and depression on her journey to create Harry Potter.
Klassen, a graduate from the University of Oregon, took to Twitter to celebrate the placement on the well-respected lists.
I cant stop screaming, she wrote. Im on the 2017 Black List!
Ironically enough, Klassens header photo remains as a screen grab of her own words being used to promote the 2017s beloved Blade Runner 2049 film. While When Lightning Strikes is the first script of Klassens to gain such significant steam, the University of Oregon grad has a handful of scripts under her belt and recently won a ScreenCraft contest for another script titled 14 Words.
The person I must thank most of all, of course, is J.K. Rowling, Klassen writes on Twitter.
The subject of my Black List script and a woman I admire beyond words. Her story is her own - and I have tried to tell it with love, care, and respect.
When Lightning Strikes is still in the earliest stages of getting into any sort of production but with impressive spots on the Black List, Hit List, and nods from the Tracking Board, it appears to be a matter of time until Klassen tells the amazing story of Joanne Rowling.

have strong roots,  always be  yourself
Christina Peiris single-handedly gave Sri Lanka a reason to cheer when she was placed among the top 16 contestants in the semi-finals at the Miss Universe 2017 pageant held in Las Vegas, Nevada. The last time a Sri Lankan beauty queen made a significant impact in a beauty pageant of such caliber was Maureen Neliya Hingert when she became the runner up at Miss Universe 1955. A model and fashion designer Christina is the owner of X.TINA, a humanitarian clothing brand which she has established to donate a part of the earning to cancer patients.
I had faith in myself that I had done the best I can when I was standing on that stage with thousands cheering all around me. I did not expect to hear Sri Lanka being called second. I was over the moon that I did not get to the top 16 through a wild card. The judges had actually chosen me. At that moment I felt that I had done the best for my country and I was very happy to bring Sri Lanka forward among 92 other countries. It amazed me that so many Sri Lankans voted because I only missed getting into the top 10 by 50 votes. It is a shame that if our whole country voted, we would have had the chance to be in the top 10 but looking at it from a positive perspective I am happy that for the first time since 1955 we only needed 50 votes to reach top 10! Christina enthused.
She notes that one of the first things she noticed about being at the pageant was that almost every single girl who walked in was beautiful, possessed perfect hair, skin, toned bodies etc. This made her realize that she had to take a different route to catch the judges eyes.
I think my best feature was that I allowed my personality to shine through. Throughout the whole pageant I made sure to be myself. I wanted everyone to get to know me the way my friends and family know me. Even in the interview I did not rehearse my answers. So during the interview with the judges we all had a couple of laughs and I felt that the judges got to know who Christina really is, she explained.
Taking part in the pageant has also been a learning experience for the 23 year old beauty. Contestants from 92 countries had competed at the pageant and Christina had tried to learn something new about every single country during her stay.
I think the best way to learn about the world is when you meet someone from another country. There are so many fun facts to share and learn from one another, she said.
For Christina the real challenge linked with the event had been getting everything ready for the pageant while she was in Sri Lanka. She explains that she had to communicate with 15 people a day with every one changing plans the last minute and canceling meetings.
It was alot to take on with just three weeks after my crowning. In Vegas they really spoilt the girls with everything from clothing, to electronics, goodies, food, VIP transportation etc. So after going from all the preparation I did in Sri Lanka, Vegas was like a piece of cake. However if I really had to pick one challenging moment I would have to say walking in six inch heels on a slippery stage for the first time, she added with a laugh.
She notes that strangely she had enjoyed her whole experience at the pageant rather than be pressurized by it. She has made time to get to know each and every contestant.
I made multiple friendships that I know would last a very long time. Miss New Zealand and I still speak to each other almost every day and the only reason I cried after the pageant was because we had to say bye to each other. We hope to meet each other soon in New Zealand or Sri Lanka, Christina said.
Miss Universe Thailand Maria Lynn Ehren has been Christinas personal favourite for the Miss Universe 2017 title even before they had met. Once they met up, they had bonded instantly.
She was very friendly towards the other contestants and apart from being naturally beautiful, she had a personality which seemed like the perfect fit for the next Miss Universe, Christina said.
Queried about her view towards the cluster of beauty pageants which seem to be mushrooming around the world Christina said she can barely keep count of them.
I was privileged to be nominated for the most prestigious pageant in the world and to be a direct nominee. I dont think I would have taken part in a local pageant hence why I felt like it was the right time and opportunity when I was being nominated. I was recommended by Linda Speldawin to Essential Entertainment and a few weeks later, I received the call to be interviewed among other contestants.
I think Miss Universe and Miss World create a great platform for girls to speak about what they are truly passionate about and to be heard. This is what I truly admire about these pageants, she expressed.
Voicing her opinion about transgender people or those who have undergone cosmetic surgery taking part in beauty pageants Christina says,  I am a believer that we live in a free world and everyone should be free to do whatever it is that they wish to. A pageant like Miss Universe does not have any transgender contestants. However I was able to witness and hear stories about contestants using hair extensions, contact lenses, lip surgeries and other minor changes during the pageant period. The Miss Universe motto is to be confidently beautiful and I think being your 100 percent natural self is important, she opined.
Before she left for Vegas some people have advised Christina to get eyelash extensions done.
I listened to their advice and got my eyelashes done  an action which I immediately regretted. I returned the next day to get them removed but the lady said that it was too fresh to remove. So I had it reduced instead. Every single day leading up to the pageant I steamed, oiled and damped my eyes with warm water to remove them as I felt I did not look like myself or that the slight enhancement felt like I was cheating in the pageant by lying about the way I looked. I was finally able to remove every single one of them before the pageant because I think it is truly important to be YOU, she said.
A past pupil of Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya, Christina had later moved to Abu Dhabi where she finished her high school education at the Cambridge High School. After her IGCSE I she immediately started her degree at the age of 17 and four years later she graduated. At 23 she has come a long way from running her own travel blog and clothing brand to being a brand ambassador for the fashion market. Becoming a brand ambassador for Sri Lanka had been the icing on the cake.
Christina says that her family has been her biggest strength throughout her success. Her father had supported her a lot financially from getting fabrics for her gowns to providing her plane tickets.
My father is someone who only wants to see my sister and I strive for the best in life. He would only do nothing but the best for the both of us. My sister came with me from one place to another after she finished work to make sure I get everything done on time. I couldnt imagine doing all of this alone and taking on so much stress before heading for the pageant. They are my biggest pillars of strength and most of this wouldnt have been possible after my crowning as Miss Universe Sri Lanka if I did not have their unconditional support, she mused adding that her mother has and always will be her biggest inspiration.
I grew up watching her be a strong, independent, confident, kind and loving person. She use to uplift everyone around her and focused on making others smile throughout her day. With a full time job she was able to raise me and my sister and I think she did a pretty great job at raising us. She has shown me all the attributes of being the perfect woman, Christina said.
I have worked hard to make sure I accomplished all my dreams and after Miss Universe I only wish to work a lot harder on them. I consider myself a hard working person because at the end of the day I work hard to achieve what I am truly passionate about. I look forward to continue to inspire the youth as I did through my blog and after being crowned Miss Universe Sri Lanka I am able to reach a bigger platform, she said.
Her advice for girls who are aspiring to take part in beauty pageants is to finish their education first.
This is the only time you have to nourish yourself and to let yourself grow as an individual through a good education. Whether you want to be a model or beauty queen you should have strong roots and always be yourself. It is easy to get influenced in such industries but as long as you stay grounded, everything will fall in place. It is also important to go for the best and to pick what you want to do with care. Prior to this many approached me to join multiple pageants and modeling deals but nothing felt right. I am happy I had patience because this taught me that good things do take time, she said.
Dont be afraid. It is very easy to doubt yourself and to always worry about what others may think of you. Only you know your own potential and what you are capable of. If I had listened to everyone else around me I would have never had my clothing brand X.TINA or my travel blog loveplate.blog or been in the top16 at Miss Universe 2017! Find your space, knock on doors and dont be afraid to be proud about who you are and what you have to offer, she concluded with a smile.

## Title: Henna hints
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Henna hints
Henna is a hair colouring dimension which dates back to hundreds of years. Lately it has become a symbol of modern fashion to many women and men. Henna isn't just for covering grey hair. It makes your hair strong, voluminous and shiny. It is considered as a home remedy for various hair problems. Regular use of Henna on hair will help your hair regain the lost lustre and result in healthy hair.
Henna for all hair types
Natural Henna can be used on virgin hair that has not been chemically straightened, curled or coloured. It is not advisable to use Henna if you want to continue with the above mentioned chemical treatments as it will act as a barrier sometimes.
Natural Henna is actually one of the most versatile hair care treatments. Unlike a lot of commercial products which say they are only good for certain hair types, you can use Henna no matter what the texture your hair is.
Henna for chemically coloured hair
Pure Henna (Lawsonia inermis) does not react badly with previously chemically-treated hair. The problem only arises if the brand you buy has additives, synthetic dyes or metallic salts. Read the ingredients or use body art quality Henna. As long as you use pure, body art quality Henna, you can Henna over chemically dyed hair.
However Henna is permanent and can't be removed or stripped out easily when used over a period of time. Those who foresee lots of chemical processing in their near future might want to hold off on Henna as going back to chemical colouring and other chemical treatments might be difficult.
Lasting period
Henna stays rich and vibrant for four to six weeks. You can layer the colour as much as you want. The colour will build after every application, making for dense, multi-dimensional colour.
Things that should be done before applying Henna
A skin sensitivity test should be carried out 48 hours prior to henna application.
Applying Henna
Shampoo and then dry your hair. Before applying Henna, you will want to start with clean hair. Wash your hair with your regular shampoo to remove dirt, oil, and styling products inn the shower or bath.
Protect your hairline. If you have long hair, gather it up and tie it back so it is out of your face and off your shoulders and neck. Apply a barrier cream around your hair line. Comb and part your hair. Let your hair down and comb it with a wide-toothed comb. This will remove tangles and knots without making your hair frizzy. Part your hair in the center, and let your hair fall evenly to either side of your head.
Protect your skin. Henna tends to get everywhere, so its a good idea to wear old clothes and to protect yourself with a rag or old towel. Drape the towel over your shoulders. Arrange the towel to cover your neck and shoulders, and use a pin or hair clip to keep it together. Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves to protect your hands and nails because Henna can stain the skin.
common Henna faux pas
The most common mistake that people make when applying Henna has to do with root coverage. Be sure to get down to the roots of your hair as you colour (this is common for all hair colouring practices).
Henna has a thicker consistency than chemical dyes, less runny, and may require a little more attention to ensure that its touching and colouring all hair on the scalp. You want it there too - Henna conditions the scalp while it colors. It detoxes the follicle-root junction and nourishes the scalp so massage it deep to the scalp. Go heavy. I is worth it all around for colour, richness and treatment benefits. A hair colouring brush will definitely assist with roots, but is not paramount for quality Henna hair application.
Avoiding stains below the hairline, ears and neck
Smooth a protective balm/cream around the hairline and neck to ensure your skin is not accidentally tinted. Use protective ear guards to protect the ears.
Getting Henna stains off your fingers and skin
The easiest way is just to let it take some time. Most light stains will fade by morning, but if you have a deep, dark stain (you left skin fully exposed and immersed in Henna) well, you can only really speed up the fade time by applying natural oils (coconut, olive). They may help fade the stain faster and along with some direct exposure to UV (sun) light. Best advice: wash up very well after finishing hair application. If it stays on the skin for too long, its simply going to stain (for a few days in worst case if it is full exposure and left on skin for 2 hours). Pure Henna will stain longer (up to two weeks). Just wash up well to avoid such blunders.
Neutral Henna
Neutral Henna is actually Cassia Obovata. Potent botanical remedies are harvested from the leaves, pods, and seeds of this flowering Senna legume tree. Cassia conditions the hair, and shares in some of the hair treatment qualities of Henna, but it does not dye the hair like Henna.
It can boost blonde colours and undertones, or stain gray hair slightly blonde. Bunettes and redheads wont notice a colour change.
Consider it a conditioning Henna clear coat for the hair. Mix and apply to hair just like Henna and Henna-herbals. Its excellent for a conditioning and shine boost
Storing leftover Henna powder
The best way to store any remaining powder is to place it all in an airtight zip lock bag/container. Remove any remaining air and then keep from light. Store in a cool dry place. Dont store in the bathroom as it may get too humid and warm.
Identifying a quality Henna product
High quality Henna can be recognised by the intensity of the dye.
Another hint is where and how the Henna was stored.
You can also identify it according to the intensity of the colour of the powder (it is similar to barley and spirulina)
It is a quality product if your scalp doesnt itch when you use it.
If your hair is not dry, then your product is of good quality.
The colour reacts within one hour in a good quality product.
High quality Henna does not wash out fast.It only contains additives like amla, shikakai, reetha, brahma, indigo and other Ayurvedic herbs.
High-quality Henna does not contain any PPD, chemical dyes, peroxide or ammonia.Your hair should be stronger and with no dandruff if you use high quality Henna.

Horn retains WBO welterweight title with TKO win over Corcoran
Brisbane: Australian Jeff Horn retained his World Boxing Organisation welterweight title with an 11th round technical knockout win over English challenger Gary Corcoran in Brisbane on Wednesday.
Horn, in his first title defence since he upset Philippine boxing hero Manny Pacquiao in Brisbane in July this year, finished strongly to batter Corcoran and force the decision. Horn is now in line to face the undefeated American Terence Crawford (32 wins in 32 fights) in Las Vegas in April.
Asked about Crawford, Horn said: Its a big possibility. If that is what everyone wants to see, I guess that is what is going to happen. The win took Horns career record to 18 wins, 12 by KO, with one draw.
I felt my timing was a bit off but I got him in the end. He definitely pushed me in there, Horn said.
We both had cuts over our eyes and I was just trying to wear him down.
Corcorans corner threw in the towel in the 11th round after the Englishman had endured a savage beating from Horn, leaving his face a bloodied mess.
British boxer Amir Khan is another who has designs on Horns world title belt and was ringside on Wednesday with a potential fight between the two next year.
Horn, who reached the quarter-finals of the light-welterweight division at the 2012 Olympic Games, has never lost a professional bout.
Corcoran slugged it out with Horn up until the middle stages of the scheduled 12 rounds, but the Australians superior stamina and punching power won him the closing rounds leading to the fights stoppage.

Junior rugby  way forward for  Asian domination
Its the season for giving and sharing in more ways than one ..And if anything, the time we are easily able to separate boys from men ...as we found out with weeks island rugby calendar. Colombo and Kandy buzzing and plenty for our much hallowed social media experts to ponder with delight.
Kandy at home in the Nittawela cauldron are the epitome of intimidation and fanatical home town support ..much to the dismay of visiting teams, especially their coaching staff.
The gremlin is the mental advantage that Kandy get from their raucous fans of all shapes and sizes.
Eventually it affects the opposing team, huddled in their changing room...and takes a good 15minutes for them to settle down after kick off...
Plenty of time for the home team to run in a good platform of 3 or 4 tries to thunderous applause that is deafening to say the least.
Coaches know that this is tough to counter ...and even the most seasoned players struggle to find their rhythm straight away. Ipso facto the invisible Nittawela force field, that is impossible to plan for.
Kandy at home are daunting ..and currently led by Gayan Weeraratne, with a sharp sense of efficiency and finish. I am hoping to see a fully fit  Weerey by the final round just after Christmas D. He certainly steps up as the original warrior, with dozens of tours and plenty of bruises to show for it. I am looking forward to a fully fit Gayan and some clinical finishes to defend their Dialog league title in 2018 as well.
Beating Navy was a significant step and more bonus to clock up 35points as table leaders ..and very much the team to beat ..yet again!
Havelocks with 25 in second and Navy with 21 are the likely contenders.
Kandy vs Havelocks might just set the city on fire and become the most unforgiving and anticipated rugby match this season
If by a decent quirk of nature and some old fashioned Martis wizardry...Havies manufacture a clever win...the drama that unfolds will be a joy to behold.
Can the Havelocks boiler house 8 hold their own against the likes of Udangamuwa, Dimitri and Soyuru Anthony ...line-outs might afford the Colombo boys some grace ...and my thinking is that the Lions will out muscle Havelocks in the loose.
On the other hand ...will a 6.30pm start under lights be that edge for the park team Your guess is definitely as good as mine and if a Havies loyalist ..history might be in your half and a possible upset, quite delicious to savour.
I suggest a good early arrival at the stadium and time to settle for the big clash.
Sheer delight for us rugby hearts ..the match ups of opposite numbers...Dulaj v Marija, Sandun Herath v. Wiliwera, Gayan v Hirantha, Rahul de Silva v Roshan Weeraratne, Muthu v Udangamuwa and Sooriyabandara v Dabare or Nishon.
Dixon still recovering from a jaw injury will be hugely missed at the park and our best wishes from all his fans for a fully healed Kutty ..back in the middle.
The much hyped junior Asian international fixture for Sri Lanka, turned out to be pretty one sided and much on the unions platter of real concern.
We were accosted by the initial potential the Tuskers packed as a unit ..but Hong Kong were clinical, well drilled and able to outwit and outplay Sri Lanka in all departments.
The tries were well executed with clean running lines that shredded our mild defence ...hopefully a factor that will be sorted in Hong Kong for the return leg.
I am a firm believer in the old..well not that old, principle of a fit unit, both forwards and backs packing 85mins petrol to outrun the opposition for the duration....thats our skills and strength upfront, powerful enough to wear the former British colony ...down, and push them back.
Lets wish our lads a bigger fight back and some inspired defence across the big pond in Kowloon island...as they line up for the final leg.
Its a biggish task to expect more than a competitive finish, to meet HK head on ...and push them for the 80mins. A win would be fabulous ...but happy to settle for a draw ...in whatever form that takes.
Junior rugby in our warm tropical enclave ...is definitely the way forward and our most capable path to Asian domination.
If there is any hesitation at entertaining such thoughts ..ask yourself and the powers that govern ...what we lack on the big stage
Only last year we were Asian 7s champions at U18 and U20 ..sadly not to be reproduced in 2017...but a realistic dream to invest big and effective planning at home and plenty of consistent tours to intravenous enough experience as required.
The future is bright...but we need to make it brighter and bigger, better and faster for the boys graduating the school format ..
Its our last round locally before Christmas and a well earned break for our local gladiators to recharge and recover muscle power after a bruising first round.
Perfect for injury management and a big hand to all physios, massage specialists, and all therapists, who help maintain player wellness all season long.
Teams should invest in mentors and psychological support to help guide players ...very much the way forward in better performance and bigger fans etc .. Perfect way to grow the game, enhance skills and quality much needed and player wellness as our no. 1 priority.
Let me wish the players and inspiring game weekend, with plenty of attacking rugby to enthrall us ...and tackles that have its own thumping audio..
Blessings island rugby hearts..
More is more for the 80mins in the middle.
Cheers to fans from 1 to 93...it certainly is the season for giving.

## Title: A Memory
## Supertitle: The Best Gift of All:

The Best Gift of All:
A Memory
Think for a second about your grandparents home when you were growing up. If it was anything like my grandmother's, it was probably a small house with even smaller cupboards. And the cupboards were not that full. And she raised six children in that house! Fast forward to the present. We possess so many things even the spaces under our beds are crammed with stuff we thought we could not live without, at one time or the other in our lives.
Experts say, we have and consume twice as many material goods than we collectively did 50 years ago, but statistically we are much less happy.
54% of us report being overwhelmed with clutter and 78% of us have no idea how to overcome it!
Need I say it, this leads to additional stress: Especially when reports reveal over the course of our lifetime, we will spend a total of 3,680 hours or 153 days searching for misplaced items and that we lose up to nine items every dayor 198,743 in a lifetime. Phones, keys, sunglasses, and paperwork top the list. Of course, there is much more to why we are less happy than our grandparents and parents were, than just the excess clutter, but statistically, it is a contributor, and an easy one to address.
Especially now that the season of giving is upon us and we are all struggling with finding the perfect material gift for everyone in our lives. There are those who already have everything, those who want everything and those who want nothing at all. How are we, as gift-givers, supposed to maneuver our way through the holiday madness without going mad ourselves
The answer: Give the gift of experience. Go beyond the ordinary, past the latest and greatest new product and give someone the gift of a memory, a gift that truly lasts (and won't take up closet space).
Trust me, if you especially want to make someone happy this festive season, you are doing the right thing in investing in gifting experiences. Many studies have shown that material possessions do not equal happiness and that experiences are much more intrinsically fulfilling than things.
A researcher named Thomas Gilovich at Cornell University has spent more than a decade trying to understand why experiences have the ability to contribute to happiness so much more than material purchases. Along with another researcher, Matthew Killingsworth, he recently published his research in the Journal of Psychological Science showing that experiences provide more lasting happiness than material possessions.
The basic conclusion was that people tend to get less happy with material purchases over time, and more happy with experiences. They speculate that this is because we adapt to physical things, so even the nicest car or newest phone becomes commonplace after a certain period, while memories tend to get fonder as the years go by.
Our experiences are a bigger part of ourselves than our material goods, says Gilovich. You can really like your material stuff. You can even think that part of your identity is connected to those things, but nonetheless they remain separate from you. In contrast, your experiences really are part of you. We are the sum total of our experiences.
According to Cindy Chan, an assistant professor in University of Texas experiential gifts are more effective than material gifts at improving relationships too, from the recipient's perspective. "The reason experiential gifts are more socially connecting is that they tend to be more emotionally evocative," says Chan, an expert on consumer relationships. "An experiential gift elicits a strong emotional response when a recipient consumes it - like the fear and awe of a safari adventure, the excitement of a rock concert or the calmness of a spa - and is more intensely emotional than a material possession."
When you think about it you realize even the anticipation leading up to a trip, event, or experience has the potential to provide happiness itself, making it the gift that truly keeps on giving. Happiness in the anticipation, happiness during the experience and happiness in the memories.
So, this holiday season we could perhaps stop giving material gifts to each other and instead pool our money to give gifts to the children in an orphanage or the aged in an Elders Home. Instead of spending 10 minutes rapidly tearing through wrapping paper, we could experience the joys of bringing a smile onto the lips of the lonely and the needy by spending a full day with them.
Do keep in mind that as important as shared experiences are for adults, they are even more important for children and for healthy psychological development. In fact, shared family time (even in simple things like family dinner together) during these holidays is drastically important for a childs well being (much more than an expensive toy, chocolates or cakes). Shared family time and experiences have been linked to: Bonding within the family, fewer behavioral problems in children, a stronger sense of identity, a sense of security, and even higher rates of academic success. Of course, these shared experiences can be as simple as time spent together while preparing meals, or reading stories before bed, but prioritizing experiences as gifts (a library membership, a visit to the National Museum) helps reduce unwanted material items and fosters family bonding.
So, whoever you are shopping for this holiday season, there are a plethora of great experiences waiting to be gifted. Give the gift of memories to be made.
Isn't it amazing, Aristotle had it right all those years ago: men fancy that external goods are the cause of happiness (but) leisure of itself gives pleasure and happiness and enjoyment in life.

MEP denounces Wijewickremas action to leave JO
The Central Committee of the MEP has unanimously decided to denounce the action taken by Digamadulla District Parliamentarian Sriyani Wijewickrama to join the government, MEP Vice President Somaweera Chandrasiri said.
The Central Committee also decided that since Wijewickrama had joined partner sections of the UNP government and as such her action could never be endorsed.
Chandrasiri in a press release said the MEP Central Committee also observed that Wijewickrama was forced to arrive at her decision due to the arbitrary action and self-centred attitude taken by Digamadulla District Parliamentarian Wimalaweera Dissanayake in the preparation of the District Local Council Election nomination lists.
Dissanayakes failure to attend meetings of the party leaders held for the compilation of nomination lists caused inconvenience not only to Wijewickrama but all other party leaders as well.
The release said the MEP Central Committee also emphasises that people in the Ampara district were aware of the active part played by the party membership in political, trade union and other activities in the district from the inception of the Gal Oya Development work in1957.

Microsoft, Intel, Adidas among recipients  of International Innovation Awards in China
Thirty-one products, services and organizations received the InnoCube as recipients of the International Innovation Awards 2017.
Leading the pack was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) who won an award for the Microsoft HoloLens and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for its Ideas2Reality, an innovation program in its unit in China.
Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) won the award for its Ultraboost Uncaged Parley.
Other recipients range from a dietary supplement from sesame and a digital premium savings certificate to an anti-bacterial textile and an integrated mechanical parking system.
The awards were organized by Enterprise Asia. Submissions were judged on creativity and ideation, as well as execution and impact. William Ng, president of Enterprise Asia said, Innovation requires some degree of creativity, but innovation is not creativity. More than anything else, innovation is about execution.
No idea can work in a silo, as such, in determining the recipients of the International Innovation Awards, the judges took into consideration such criteria as innovation distinction, practicality and performance, commercial viability, replicability and measurability, and institutional support. The goal is to put substance ahead of form; execution ahead of ideation.
Great companies are also great at execution. But generally, they are great at executing their core businesses. The capabilities and capacity to execute these core businesses, and that singular focus to execute well, are often anathema to innovation.
Therefore, these companies that have won the International Innovation Awards are a step ahead of their competitors, Ng added. The recipients of the International Innovation Awards this year also receive the InnoMark, the global certification for innovation.
Enterprise Asia strive to create an Asia that is rich in entrepreneurship as an engine towards sustainable and progressive economic and social development reinforced by its strong pillars of: Democratizing Entrepreneurship, Institutionalizing Sustainability and Empowering Innovation. The International Innovation Awards 2017 recognizes outstanding innovations and in the process, provide the encouragement for organizations to continue investing in innovation.
The Awards provide a platform for companies and innovators to recognise innovation excellence, hence stimulating greater innovations to spur and for growth in economy

Novel solution to food waste disposal from  Eco Waste Disposers
Eco Waste Disposers recently introduced a product which offers a unique solution to Sri Lankas garbage problem. This garbage disposer unit eases the hassle of collecting and disposing food waste in residential and commercial establishments.
This unit grinds nearly all types of food waste including chicken bones, egg shells and fruit and vegetable peel. The ground waste passes through the existing pipe systems and its septic tank safe. The units can be used in any type of kitchen and they can be easily fit underneath existing kitchen sinks.
Waste management and collection has been a major concern for many years and this year has seen tragic outcomes arising from this issue. It is said that Colombo accounts for 1,500 MT per day of garbage and Gampaha 600 MT per day, Kaluthara 300 MT per day and Kandy 209 MT per day. It was said that over 61.8% of waste is organic waste (Open Journal of Civil Engineering, Vol.05 No. 01 - 2015). Of this, 40% is given to the local government services to collect and dispose.
We are happy to introduce waste disposers to Sri Lanka as it will no doubt ease the garbage problem we are facing today. We think its a timely solution for residential customers and commercial customers alike. We have been fortunate to partner with the worlds number 1 brand Waste King, a company who have been pioneers in this industry for over 70 years in the USA, said Kishani Kaluarachchi, Managing Director, Eco Waste Disposers.
Waste King disposers have a number of key benefits which includes motors which have 50% more RPMs (speed) and 30% more torque (grinding power) compared to other brands, hence taking less time to grind. The units are energy efficient, use less electricity and water, make less noise in operation, are environmentally safe and are septic tank friendly. Its EZ-mount systems makes installation fast and easy, while the stainless steel grinding component makes it corrosion free and durable.
With Waste King Garbage Disposers you can eliminate the need for collection of your food waste and avoid the odours this waste creates in your home, especially if youre living in an apartment complex.
It will also help you to reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to better environment management, Kaluarchchi added.
Waste King Commercial units can be used across a wide range of outlets including hotels, restaurants, pastry shops, hospitals, cafeterias, schools, snack bars, juice bars and other types of kitchens. The product range varies from 1HP-5HP models which can process waste of 50 upto 5,000 meals per hour. Consumers could request a demonstration at Eco Waste Disposers office at Thimbirigasyaya Road, Colombo 5.

Teachers and students said that the new syllabus consists of many problematic and impractical trends. Hettiarachci said that a new syllabus would be prepared next year after getting views of all concerned parties of the field. The NIE had requested the Education Ministry to take steps to discontinue the use of the new syllabus of this subject, taking in the views of concerned parties and accordingly, the ministry has decided to issue the circular to school heads to re-use the old syllabus until a new syllabus is introduced next year, said Kurunegala District Senior Education Director W.

Truecaller, the worlds most used Caller ID & Spam Detection app, has helped its users in Sri Lanka identify over 8.5 million spam calls, just this year alone.
One major problem around spam calls in Sri Lanka are calls from telco operators, which amount to the majority (72%) of the total for reported spam calls. Operator spam calls involve telecom companies cold calling people.
During these type of calls, call centre agents attempt to upsell data plans or push promotional offers to the public at large. Another major spam call problem that Sri Lankans have to deal with is scam calls, these accounted for 22% of all spam calls.
Scam calls are basically attempts to defraud you via your telephone, with scammers using a phony scheme to swindle money from unsuspecting members of the public.
Where, recently the one ring scam also popularly called the Wangiri phone scam affected many Sri Lankans.
Rounding off the spam call list in Sri Lanka are nuisance calls at 3%, these kinds of spam calls in general are unwanted and unsolicited calls that are a disturbance for users, or at the very least amount to prank calls and at worst, harassment.
The rest of the listed spam calls were constituted by financial services (3%) such as banking product offers, unsolicited credit union calls or credit card companies cold dialing people.
In Sri Lanka most operators offer the service of blocking calls via SMS or USSD code. However, this comes with a price and also requires effort in order to remember the SMS number or USSD codes for activation of the service.

Prudent decision of Ministers on liberalization hailed by industry
Speaking at the 2018 Budget debate in Parliament last Saturday, where the Budget was passed with a two-thirds majority, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera states his intention to have an open dialogue with the Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe before implementing any reforms related to ports and shipping.
In his speech he states, We need to encourage an environment of healthy competition that will drive innovation, service excellence and growth. We will ensure that such competition will be fair and balanced, eliminating unfair trade practices by enabling prudent regulation.
This is why the proposal on shipping liberalization is coupled with the proposal to implement an independent regulator for the industry. In fact, as I mentioned to my colleague this morning, we will discuss the modalities of implementation of these proposals with the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, at the earliest, while taking note of all his concerns.
Responding to the Finance Minister, Minister Samarasinghe expressed his gratitude for respecting the views of the industry and keeping the budget proposal open for discussion.
May I just thank the Hon. Minister for considering to discuss further the position that I put forward as the line Minister and I want to thank him for offering to discuss this further. Of course, I want to reiterate that my proposal was on behalf of not only the line Ministry but also the entire SLFP where we sat down, discussed this, and took a decision. But I thank the Minister for keeping it open.
It was made clear that the two ministries would work together to ensure that all stakeholders views are taken into consideration before implementing any changes and that the national interest will be upheld.
The industry would have to play an active role in helping the government to achieve its vision of becoming a maritime hub which will not only benefit the industry but also the whole country.
During the recent past many agency businesses have worked together with government authorities such as Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Merchant Shipping Secretariat and Sri Lanka Customs in implementing changes to the current procedure and improve ease of doing business. The industry has volunteered to engage in pilot projects and act as change agents to ensure that procedures related to shipping are better than any other regional port.
The Minister of Ports and Shipping and the Chairman of SLPA, after assuming office, have initiated the long overdue national maritime policy which will have the full support of the industry.
Therefore the industry will closely liaise with the Ministry of Ports and Shipping to make these discussions fruitful and also to promote fair competition benefiting all stakeholders.

## Title: PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, December 14, 2017 - 01:00
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY
The strength of the judiciary lies in the command that it has over the hearts and minds of men. In the view of Justice Kenny, part of the Courts authority rests upon public confidence in the judiciary. In a democracy, the enforcement of judicial decrees and orders ultimately depends upon public co-operation (Judicial Ethics 1985). The public confidence in the judiciary highly depends upon the independence of it associated with judicial ethics.
For instance, four thousand years ago, the Code of Hammurabi provided that a judge who altered a written judgment should pay twelve-fold the penalty ordered in the judgment and should be publicly expelled from the bench. The principle of the independence of the judiciary requires the judiciary to ensure that judicial proceedings are conducted fairly and that the rights of the parties are respected (Principle No. 6, UN Basic Principles 1985).
Does Judiciary come under constant public scrutiny
Justice must not merely be done but it must also be seen to be done. A judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety (Canon 1, Code of Judicial Conduct, American Bar Association 1990). For instance, in the matter of John Chiovero 1990, it was held that, when a jurist is offered a gift by a litigant, he must be aware of the possible appearance of an impropriety. Judges should regulate their conduct both in and out of Court as to further increase the public confidence in them.
Every Judge must at all times be conscious that he is under the public gaze and there should be no act or omission by him which is unbecoming of the high office he occupies and the public esteem in which that office is held (Canon 16, Restatement of Values of Judicial Life 1997). There would be a destruction of the public confidence if the public is aware of any corruption or some other serious wrongdoing of the existing judges (Gibbs 1987). According to Sydney Smith, Nations fall where judges are unjust.
Justice is not a cloistered virtue
As held in Ambard Vs. Governor for Trinidad and Tobago 1936, Justice is not a cloistered virtue; she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and respectful, though outspoken, comments of ordinary men; no wrong is committed by any member of the public who exercises the ordinary right of criticising, in good faith, in private or in public, the public act done in the seat of justice. In a democratic society, a certain level of criticism of the judiciary is inevitable and is also desirable. No judge is above the law he is sworn to administer (In re Esworthy, N.Y. Commission 1990).
Proceedings of every Court are fully exposed to public and professional scrutiny and criticism (Russell Vs. Russell 1976). There is no disagreement that public criticism of judges and their work is not permissible, but it is also desirable and necessary to ensure that judges would continue to retain public confidence in the judiciary by performing their functions in accordance with their constitutional duties and professional responsibilities.
The Article 19 of the UDHR 1948 says that Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. The Article 14 (1) (a) of the Sri Lankan Constitution says, every citizen is entitled to the freedom of speech and expression including publication.
However, exercise and operation of this right are subject to restrictions as may be prescribed by law in relation to contempt of Court and defamation (Article 15 (2)). Therefore, the criticisms against the judiciary should be fair; otherwise, it could amount to the offence of contempt of Court. For instance, if words of a politician obstruct or interfere with the course of justice or the due administration of justice by the Court that would constitute a contempt of Court.
Fair criticism in respect of Judiciary
Proceedings for contempt of Court must not be in a diminution of free speech. There would be no contempt if the questioned statement could not be said to be of a character calculated to interfere with the administration of justice or to undermine the public confidence (Mills Vs. Townsville City Council 2003). For instance, even Presidents like Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson have rebuked judges of their day (American Bar Association report on the independence of judiciary 1997).
In Attorney-General Vs. Butler 1953, it was held that Courts of Justice should be subject to the freedom of criticism which is a necessary accompaniment of the freedom of speech which is the right of all free men. In Nationwide News Pty Ltd Vs. Wills 1992, it was held that the judiciary should be open to criticism; if the defendant exercised his ordinary right to criticise judiciary in good faith, then there was no contempt.
Scandalising the Court by unfair criticism
The contempt of Court sometimes worded as scandalising the Court. Contempt could be committed by publishing material scandalising the Courts or judges by abusing them in scurrilous terms, alleging they are corrupt or lack integrity, or that they have bowed to outside influences in reaching their decisions. Unfair criticism of Court decisions could break down the respect for the judiciary, in the minds of people.
In Contempt of Court, there must be involved some act done, or writing published calculated to bring a Court or a judge of the Court into contempt or to lower his authority or something calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or the lawful process of the Courts. For instance, in Re S.A. Wickremasinghe 1954, at a public meeting, the respondent criticised Judges in the Courts in the city of Galle. Court held that it is no less an offence of contempt of Court to scandalise the judiciary generally than to scandalise the Judge or Judges of a particular Court.
A well-regulated law of a civilised community cannot be sustained without sanctions being imposed for contempt of Court. It is important to maintain the respect and dignity of the Court and its officers because without such respect, public faith in the administration of justice would be undermined and the law itself would fall into disrepute. The court in AG Vs. Times Newspapers Ltd 1973, held that the contempt of Court consists of conduct calculated to prejudice the requirements of the due administration of justice or to undermine the public confidence in it.
Punishing for contempt of facie curiae or ex facie curiae
Both contempt in the presence and absence of the Court are considered offences. According to Article 105 (3) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal could punish for contempt of itself, whether committed in the Court itself or elsewhere, with imprisonment or fine or both as the Court may deem fit. The power of the Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of any other Court, Tribunal or Institution, whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere.
Every High Court, District Court and Magistrates Court shall have jurisdiction to punish the offence of contempt of Court committed in the presence of the Court itself and all offences which are committed in the course of any act or proceeding in the said Courts respectively, and which are declared by any law for the time being in force to be punishable as contempt of court (SS.18 & 55 (1) of Judicature Act No.02 of 1978).
In Fernando Vs. AG 2003, it was held that where a person is guilty of gross misbehaviour in Court and disturbs the proceedings it constitutes ex facie curiae (contempt in the face of Court) for which he is liable to be summarily judged and punished, without a formal charge. In the matter of John Ferguson 1874, Court held that the Supreme Court of Ceylon has all the powers for punishing for contempt, wherever committed in this Island. The Court in Regent International Hotels Vs. Cyril Gardiner 1980, held that the Court of Appeal has all the powers under Article 105(3) of the Constitution of punishing for contempt whether committed in facie curiae or ex facie curiae.
Taking to task of the judiciary by political and media elements
In certain situations, politicians and media are playing a role in irresponsibly fabricating stories to show that public confidence in the judiciary has eroded by highlighting certain lapses of the judiciary out of proportion to their importance. For instance, websites operating from abroad might fabricate and publish false criticisms about our judiciary in order to achieve their personal agendas. If a publication by a politician or media has been made recklessly it would create a bad impression of the judiciary in the minds of the ordinary person.
Justice Michael Kirby has mentioned that many attacks on judges are now made by politicians who see mileage in that course. The current level of political and personal attacks on the judiciary is unacceptable. It has gone too farthe judicial institution will be damaged and judicial integrity undermined.
In the view of Justice Dr A R B Amarasinghe, media has time to time reported allegations of misconducts like rape, immortality, fraud, corruption on the part of individual judges and criticisms like delay in justice, inefficiencies and injustices (Judicial Conduct Ethics & Responsibilities 2014). Mass media report the bare facts of what Courts do, and what others say about judges without analysing and explicating their role properly (Miller 1970).
In DPP Vs. Francis 2006, a broadcaster who made a statement oh, smash the judges face, was convicted for contempt of Court. In the matter of Armand De Souza 1914, the defendant wrote in the newspaper that the Police Magistrate of Nuwara Eliya having been himself at one stage in his career in the Ceylon Police- Force, is partial to the police view;who is there to say what happens in his chambers. Court held that the defendants language, as interpreted in the innuendoes, amounted to contempt of Court.
In the matter of D M S B Dissanayake 2004, respondent was convicted for contempt of court punishable under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution and was sentenced to a term of two years rigorous imprisonment for making statements which were interpreted as an attempt to undermine the public confidence in the judiciary and to adversely impact upon the due administration of justice.
In AG Vs. Vaikunthavsasan 1951, the respondent published an article containing matter which was calculated at prejudicing the fair trial of a case that was then pending before a Magistrates Court. Court held that an offender guilty of contempt of Court should not be permitted to go unpunished merely because he acknowledges his offence and expresses regret.
In the matter of Hulugalle 1936, the respondent was charged with contempt of Court in respect of certain passages appearing in a leading article, published in the newspaper. The article entitled Justice on holiday. Court held that the article imputed a serious breach of duty to the Judges of the Supreme Court and further held that the article was calculated by bringing the Supreme Court into contempt and to lower its authority.
According to the principles of rule of law, no one could be lawfully restrained or punished except for a violation of the law and everyone is governed equally by the law. The mere criticism of judiciary could make people disbelieve the said principles of rule of law.
In State Vs. Ram Chander Sharma 1958, it was held that the maintenance of the dignity of the Courts is one of the cardinal principles of the rule of law in a free democratic country and when the criticism which may otherwise be couched in language that appears to be mere criticism results in undermining the dignity of Courts and the course of justice in the land, it must be held repugnant and punished.
The Court in Arundhati Roy 2002, held that Rule of Law is the basic rule of governance of any civilised democratic policy;...it is only through the Courts that the rule of law unfolds its contents and establishes its concept;for the judiciary to perform its duties and functions effectively and true to the spirit with which it is sacredly entrusted, the dignity and authority of the Courts have to be respected and protected at all costs;the confidence in the Courts of justice, which the people possess, cannot, in any way, be allowed to be tarnished, diminished or wiped out by the contumacious behaviour of any person.
The Sovereignty of Sri Lanka is vested in the people (Art.3 of the Constitution). It is a combination of legislative, executive, judicial bodies, fundamental rights and franchise. The judicial power of the people shall be exercised by Parliament through Courts, Tribunals and Institutions (Art.4 (c)). Hence, an unfair criticism of judiciary is a criticism of judicial power of people which is a part of the sovereignty of Sri Lanka.
In Hewamanne Vs. De Silva 1983, it was held that the power vested in the Judges to safeguard the welfare and the security of the people is a delegated part of the sovereignty of the people. Contempt against the judges is, therefore, an insult offered to the authority of the People and their Constitution.
Sometimes people merely criticize judiciary due to delay in justice without properly analysing whether there were factors beyond the control of the judge. According to Miller, delay in justice is not necessarily attributable to judges alone; there are instances where judges may be unable to reach prompt decisions after the trial, possibly because the issues and evidence are so complex.
The remedy to avoid delay in justice is to expedite the process. (Public confidence in the Judiciary 1970) For instance, in order to avoid delay in criminal justice, judges were informed to ensure that indictments are served as early as possible after they are received (Circular No.272, Judicial Service Commission (JSC) (2002).
In Attorney-General Vs. Butler 1953, Court held that any publications which are calculated, or have a tendency, to impair confidence in the rule of law,constitute contempt of Court unless they are madewith a proper respect for Courts as institutions established to administer the law in the interests of order, and the good government of the country. The court in Gallagher Vs. Durack 1983, held that the authority of the law rests on public confidence, and it is important to the stability of society that the confidence of the public should not be shaken by baseless attacks on the integrity or impartiality of Courts or judges.
Judges sometimes exhibit vanity, irascibility, narrowness, arrogance and other weaknesses to which the human flesh is the heir. They would make mistakes; they are human beings and not robots woven from steel mesh (In re Johnson 1978). Even if the judge knows the parties in person that would not harm the justice as long as he performs his duty honestly. The mere fact that a party or a material witness being known to the judge is not a reason for the presiding judge to disqualify himself from hearing the case (Circular No.287, JSC 2004).
In Chandradasa Nanayakkara Vs. Liyanage Cyril 1984, accused had addressed the Magistrate in rude language, abused and threatened him. It was held by the Court that the outrageous nature of the acts committed by the respondent constitutes not only an affront to the dignity and authority of the Court but also a direct challenge to the fundamental supremacy of the law itself. Court held that it amounted to contempt of court.
According to Justice Michael Kirby, attacking judges by inaccurate generalisations panders to public prejudice. It reinforces stereotypes about the judiciary. Such conduct is unworthy of countries that claim to uphold fundamental rights and the rule of law. (A Universal Phenomenon 1998). For instance, if the web mafia continue to attack upon the judiciary, the people would lose the trust they have in the judiciary and take up arms to settle their scores; they would no longer go to Court (Warnakulasuriya PC 2016)
Dealing with unfair criticism
If proper responses have not been taken against mere scandalising the Court, it would definitely affect the law and order. In the view of Justice Kirby, it seems now to be an accepted obligation of Chief Justices and other senior judges to respond, on behalf of their Courts, to attack the Courts, their judgments, their personnel or the administration of justice itself. It is also a responsibility of the Bar to defend the judiciary, to correct blatant misinformation and to remind politicians, the media and others of the precious heritage of judicial neutrality and independence.
He has further held, Leaders of the legal profession, whatever their own general political persuasion, should speak up where judges are unfairly criticised by politicians and others for doing their independent duty. The Attorney-General, as the traditional leader of the legal profession, should do so in appropriate cases (A Universal Phenomenon 1998). In the view of Justice Dr A R B Amarasinghe, the bold spirits on the bench should be mindful of their duty to safeguard public confidence in the judiciary (Judicial Conduct Ethics & Responsibilities 2014).
It is the duty of each generation of judges to ensure that public confidence in the judiciary is maintained (Commentary to Canon I, ABA Model Code 1990). Further, the political leaders should defend the judicial institution and individual judges when they come under improper personal and political criticism for doing their duty. No political interference from any quarter should be tolerated by the judiciary. The judiciary shall decide matters before them impartiallywithout any restrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason (Principle No.2, UN Principles on the Judiciary 1985).
Stabilising and reinforcing public confidence in the judiciary
Despite every ignoble criticism, judges should mete out justice come hell or high-water. In the view of Lord Francis Bacon, the place of justice is a hallowed place. Members of the judiciary are supposed to perform a function that is truly divine. If the independence of the judiciary comes under suspicion, it directly impacts upon the public confidence in it.
People should not make sweeping statements based on prejudices against such a holy institution like the judiciary. If the public confidence in the judiciary is eroded, law and order which is sacrosanct could collapse unleashing a chain of distressing events. Therefore, all those who have the welfare and the interest of this country should be sensitive to this issue and contribute to strengthen and uphold the public confidence in the judiciary in every possible avenue.

Seine net fishermen allowed to use winch machines
The Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development has granted permission to use winch machines to pull out seine nets under several terms and conditions, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He made this observation at the 40th anniversary celebrations of seine net fishermen, held recently in Udappuwa Beach, Chilaw.
According to the Minister, the decision was taken following requests made by seine net fishermen during discussions held at the ministry in the past few months.
Minister Amaraweera said fishermen who engage in seine net fishing used winch machines earlier to pull seine nets due to the labour shortage. However, a ban on the usage of winch machines to pull out seine nets was imposed recently considering the environmental damage caused.
Following a research conducted by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) which revealed that the beach and seabed were badly affected due to illegal seine net fishing practices, such as the use of four-wheel tractors equipped with a winch to pull out seine nets, relevant authorities proposed to ban seine net fishing in Sri Lanka. Around 18,000 fishermen currently engage in seine net fishing in Sri Lanka under 400 seine net owners. Livelihoods of the families would be badly affected due to the ban imposed on winch machines. Considering this situation, the Minister instructed relevant authorities to lift the ban and grant permission to use winch machines without damaging the coastal environment.
The Minister further instructed authorities to take strict legal action against fishermen who damage the marine environment by using these machines.

Sharmas 3rd double ton leads India to series-levelling win
Mohali: Skipper Rohit Sharma on Wednesday became the first batsman to hit three double centuries in one-day internationals as he powered India to a 141-run win over Sri Lanka in the second match on Wednesday.
Sharmas unbeaten 208 steered the hosts to an imposing 392-4 and then restricted Sri Lanka to 251-8 to level the three-match series at 1-1 in Mohali.
His epic knock, laced with 12 sixes and 13 fours in 153-ball stay, led the Indian charge after they were invited to bat first in overcast conditions.
Sharma reached 200 in the 50th over, bowled by opposition skipper Thisara Perera. His first hundred came off 115 balls, and his second off just 38 balls.
It was a great day. Winning the game was important for me and the team after that loss in Dharamsala, Sharma said after his first win as Indian captain.
In the first two 200s as well I got the century in the 38th over and I kept telling myself to hold my shape and hit through the line.
I did pretty similar things in the earlier ones too - getting 50 off 70 balls. This wicket was superb to start off, the longer I stayed the easier it became to bat on, said Sharma. The right-hander scored 209 against Australia in Bangalore in 2013, and followed that double-hundred with his highest score of 264 against Sri Lanka a year later in Kolkata.
Martin Guptill (New Zealand), Virender Sehwag (India), Chris Gayle (West Indies) and Sachin Tendulkar (India) have recorded a double century each in ODI cricket.
Sharma made a bright start with his opening partner Shikhar Dhawan (68) after the Indian batsmens horror showing in the opening ODI, when they were skittled out for just 112.
All three came at crucial times. 264 is obviously very close to me. Ive said it many times, but I honestly cannot pick one, Sharma said of his three double tons.
The Australia one was a decider, the Sri Lanka 264 -- I came back after a three-month layoff after a big injury, and this one also -- after a humiliating loss, we wanted to come back as a team, as a batting unit especially.
Sharmas 213-run stand for the second wicket with Shreyas Iyer, who scored 88, also stood out on a hazy day in Mohali.
Dhawan, who hit nine boundaries during his 67-ball knock, was caught at mid-wicket off Sachith Pathirana.
The wicket though proved to be a minor blemish on Indias innings as Sharma dominated the bowlers with the attack-minded Iyer for company.
Iyer also changed gears after completing his maiden fifty in just his second ODI, smashing the Sri Lankan bowlers around the park.
Perera got three wickets with his medium-pace bowling but was still hit around the park by Sharma.
Sri Lanka were never in the chase after losing their openers for just 30 runs as Angelo Mathews top-scored with an unbeaten 111. Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal claimed three wickets.
We had a plan A, B and C but none of that clicked for us which was the most important thing, said Perera.
If you want to chase a score as big as this, you need starts and scores in the middle order as well. But none of it clicked for us.
Angelo did really well for us, but it wasnt enough. Well come back hard in the decider, he said.
The third and deciding match will be played in Visakhapatnam on Sunday.

Siddhalepa marks 40 years of service to Sri Pada pilgrims
With the commencement of the Sri Pada season this Unduwap Poya on December 3, Siddhalepa ( Hettigoda Group) marks the 40th year of service to devotees who visit the sacred mountain of Sri Pada, to pay homage to the sacred foot imprint of the Lord Buddha, which enshrines the peak.
A Siddhalepa team is on duty night and day, throughout the season which ends with Vesak Poya playing a healing role to approximately 15 lakhs of pilgrims facilitating a peaceful and comfortable journey for them on their most sacred pilgrimage to the mountain peak.
One of the countrys leading Ayurveda Group, Siddhalepas service of extending their medical assistance to Sri Pada pilgrims was originated by the founder and Chairman of Siddhalepa (Hettigoda Group) Dr. Victor Hettigoda and over the years has grown into a large scale operation.
A large hall at Gangulathenna which accommodates over 200 pilgrims at a time is a peaceful heaven for weary pilgrims to revive themselves with a warm cup of LakPeyawa from Siddhalepa and some soothing Siddhalepa balm before they embark on the arduous ascent to the peak.
Over the decades the Group has contributed towards protecting the environment on the scared mountain in addition to their medical assistance to pilgrims. Three separate kinds of waste bins are provided for bio degradable waste, polythene and glass with Siddhalepa branding and a message on protecting the environment on every bin.
This year the company ensured that all polythene wrapping on their products is substituted with degradable polythene. To create further awareness and participation in environment protection among pilgrims at the site, the company has introduced some innovative practices to dispose of waste. For example devotees can collect fifty cents per empty bottle for any Siddhalepa products purchased on site, thus encouraging them not to throw away plastic waste on the holy site.
Devotees are also offered a free Siddhalepa toffee for every four toffee covers they produce at the Siddhalepa products stall at Gangulathenna.
Taking their environment protection on site a step further this season, special workers have been assigned to clear litter from Siddhalepa empty bottles, wrappers etc along the path from Nallathanniya to the holy peak.
This year the Group/company has fulfilled another need on the holy site by building changing rooms for women devotees in the three places on the way to the top where Siddhalepa has built water spouts for devotees to have a bath and cleanse themselves before they reach the holy peak.
The full range of Siddhalepa pharmaceuticals and oral and health care products are available for sale at the Gangulathenna hall. Siddhalepa is an ISO certified company with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 22000, HACCP, GMP SLS certifications for food hygiene and cosmetics and OHSAS 18001.
Preserving the traditions of an ancient medical practice and the reverence of a Buddhist culture, Siddhalepa (Hettigoda Group) has spread their message of healing through traditional medicine to a country of devotees who set out to pay homage to the sacred footprint of the Lord Buddha as an annual pilgrimage.

SL tea auctions  in China
The cabinet has granted permission to hold Sri Lanka tea auctions in China. This is subsequent to a proposal made by Minister of Plantations Industries Navin Dissanayake.
Sri Lanka will now look at entering into new agreements with China to hold tea auctions and also to hold more promotions in China to push its black tea sales.
According to Sri Lanka Tea Board, there is a steady demand for Sri Lanka back tea in China. Sri Lanka exported one million kilos of tea to China in 2010 and this increased to 8 million kilos in 2016. Sri Lankas share of Chinas tea imports had grown to 38% by end of 2016, up from 26% in 2015.
Currently Sri Lanka is a top exporter of black tea while both Vietnam and India are behind Sri Lanka.

## Title: A sound decision
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

A sound decision
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, it is reported, has banned political activity, at temples, and, other religious centres, during the duration of the LG election campaign. Accordingly no meeting, or, any activity of a political nature would be permitted, at religious centres, from the day of the commencement of nominations, that got underway on Tuesday, until the conclusion of the poll, our weekend publication, the Sunday Observer reported. A media campaign was also to be carried out to inform all political parties and Independent groups, in this connection, the chairman was quoted as saying.
It is part and parcel of the election law that no political party derives an undue advantage over others, at election time. This may come in the form of material benefits, cash handouts, and, other incentives that may oblige the voters to vote for a political party, dispensing such largess. In short, there should never be an advantage, or, ascendancy, gained by one political party over another, if the spirit of the election laws is to be followed to the letter. There is no knowing to what degree and extent Mahinda Rajapaksa derived an advantage through the distribution of sil redi among the Buddhist population countrywide during the Presidential election. But, there is no doubt, the gift, as it were, would have gone onto sway a mammoth chunk of the vote in his favour on January 8 , particularly the simple village folk, which comprise nearly 80 percent of the country's voting population.
Similarly, election activity or discussions held at a Buddhist centre, (no Christian religious centre, or, mosque, so far, have accommodate political parties within their sanctums) are bound to lend a distinct advantage to the political party, so engaged, due to the patronage extended by the chief custodians of these temples or, abodes, to the political party concerned, particularly if such prelates are popular with the masses.
It is this factor, which, no doubt, was exploited by Mahinda Rajapaksa, when he did the temple rounds, in the immediate aftermath of his defeat, bearing mal wattiyas, in order to cash in on the hold the temple has on the masses. But he took things further by using the Abhayaramaya as a veritable Head Quarters for his Mahinda samaga negitimu renaissance, turning that sanctified abode into a political market place.
Hence, the decision by the Elections Commission to ban places of religious worship, read temples, for political work, during elections, is to be commended. In fact this should have come from the Mahanayakes, given the desecration done to these abodes, with the help of political monks, who were, and, still are, in the payroll of the Rajapaksas.
Not just political activity, statements of a political nature, issued by monks, from their temple abodes, too, should be banned, by the chairman. This is taking into consideration the harm that is caused to the sanctity of such places, on the one hand, and, the influence this can have on the voter, on the other. There is also the case, where, politicians, under attack from political monks, usually are reluctant to counter such accusations out of regard for the saffron robe, which otherwise will be met head on ,in the case of a rival politician. Today, almost all these attacks from the monks are directed at government politicians, who may stand to lose public sympathy, if they challenge these monks, due to the respect for the cheewaraya. Hence, it will be one way traffic, to the advantage of the Joint Opposition.
Although the Commission cannot impose restrictions on monks expressing their view, politically, or, otherwise, openly, it behoves on the members of the Sangha to apply a degree of restraint, at least during the time of the current election campaign. Or, is it too much to expect, at a time when even the chief prelates, apparently, are divided on political lines
John misunderstood
Much is being made of a speech made by Minister John Amaratunga, at a UNP rally in Ja-ela the other day, by private TV channels backing the Rajapaksas. The minister said UNP supporters need not fear anyone and that they were today in a position to stand up to any challenge, since the police and the government were in their hands ape athey. The media went to town, giving a spin to this remark to suggest that the minister has threatened Opposition supporters, with one Joint Opposition stalwart even calling on the Election Commission to probe the minister's conduct.
In the melee, the context in which the minister made this statement was ignored. It is public knowledge that UNP supporters in Ja-ela, and, Wattala and, also, elsewhere, were at the receiving end of politically sponsored goon attacks, in the not too distant past, and, their political meetings broken up. What minister Amaratunga sought was to merely allay the fears of his supporters that times had changed and they were now free to carry out their political work in a climate free from fear, as a means of encouragement.

Strike ends, trains on track
Railway trade unions ended their strike yesterday.
This is following discussions held with the four member Cabinet Sub Committee headed by Special Assignment Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama appointed to look into their demands.
The Cabinet Sub committee unanimously decided that the Railway, Health and Education Services should be reorganized as closed services.
They have agreed to submit these recommendations at the next Cabinet meeting.
Thousands of railway commuters including schoolchildren sitting for the GCE Ordinary Level examination were inconvenienced due to the strike action of 12 Trade Unions for six days. The government had to declare the railways as an essential service from December 8.
The Cabinet sub committee yesterday morning held a lengthy discussion with the Trade Union representatives and agreed that decisions regarding new recruitment and examinations to these services should be withheld until solutions were found to existing problems after discussions with the trade unions next week.
The Committee also agreed to resolve administrative and salary issues in the Sri Lanka Railway Department after calling all officials for a discussion with Trade Union representatives.
It was also decided that no disciplinary action will be taken against any officer who participated in the trade union action and future work should continue as before.
Speaking at the weekly Cabinet briefing at Government Information Department yesterday Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said the government has proposed to declare the Railways, Education sector and Health sector as closed services to resolve the issue of salary anomalies in the pay grades across these sectors.
The Ministerial sub-committee having discussed the above proposal with the union have agreed that this is the best possible solution to the problem, Minister Senaratne said.
The Sub Committee comprisedSpecial Assignments Minister, Dr Sarath Amunugama (Chair), Education Minister, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam,Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne.
This was a technical problem, rather than a problem with salaries, Minister Dr Senaratne said.
He explained that under a closed service, a salary increment or change in one sector will not affect another. At present the Judicial Service is the only closed government service.
The problem started when the previous government decided to decrease the number of pay grades from 132 to 34. It was a good move, but it also brought up many issues. It is very difficult to bring a government service with 1.5 million workers down to 34 grades, Dr Senaratne said.
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara added that mistakes in a 2006 public administration circular triggered the crisis causing major salary anomalies across the public sector.
When you resolve issues of the Railways, Health threatens to strike and vice versa, he added.
Minister Dr Senaratne however believed that the closed service proposal would resolve 75 percent of the issues brought forward by the Railway unions. The Cabinet paper on the subject is expected to be presented to cabinet next Tuesday.
Thereafter we will hold further discussions with the unions and study their salary grievances within the closed service framework. The unions also had certain legal issues which we will resolve in consultation the Attorney General, Senaratne said.
He assured that no legal or disciplinary action will be taken against Railway employees who refused to report to work even after the President declared it an essential service,
We have come to a settlement now, Dr Senaratne said. Meanwhile twelve railway trade unions suspended their strike action yesterday citing a productive meeting with members of the four member Cabinet committee.
The committee has agreed to resolve some of the issues through a Cabinet Paper next week.
The four member ministerial sub-committee has agreed to look into our grievances and bring about an agreeable solution. The first step would be to put forward a cabinet paper next week directing that the Railway be declared a closed service, Sri Lanka Station Masters Union General Secretary Indika Pathiranage said.
They have also promised to resolve other matters within the next two months, he said.
Pathiranage added that they would suspend the strike temporarily until a permanent solution is given to them within these two months. It must be mentioned that until this morning, no one offered to come for discussions with us (unions). Had they offered to do so, this matter could have been resolved long ago.
Another union representative from the Railway Locomotive Engine Drivers Union told the Daily News that the meeting with the ministerial sub-committee has been productive and satisfactory citing that the unions had received the response they had been agitating for.
We did not ask for our demands to be met overnight, we were willing to engage in discussions from the start.
He said the Union had intended to continue the strike for the entire week adding that numerous rounds of talks between trade union representatives and officials failed since they were not willing to make amends.
President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the four-member committee to look into the grievances of the protesting railway employees, who have been striking for nearly a week.The members of the committee are Ministers Dr Sarath Amunugama, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Ranjith Madduma Bandara.

Oscar-nominated filmmaker Karen Shakhnazarov says he has tried to retain the context of Leo Tolstoys 19th century novel Anna Karenina in the film adaptation while adding something special.
Produced and directed by Shakhnazarov, the Russian film is a tragic story of Countess Anna Karenina, a married noblewoman and socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky.
The whole world knows the Russian literature, thanks to Anna Karenina. There were a lot of adaptations, but no example for me in this. I made the version, carefully preserving the language of Tolstoy, but bringing to the film something special, Shakhnazarov told IANS.
I made films of different genres, but never so closely approached the topic of relationship between a man and a woman. Nothing better has ever been written, or will ever be written, about relationships between men and women. The relationship between a man and a woman lies at the heart of our lives; everything else - politics, art - is secondary, he added. IANS

Visa launches suite of sensory branding
Visa yesterday announced a suite of sensory branding that will support the Visa brand in an expanded universe of connected, payment-enabled devices.These new sound, animation and haptic (vibration) cues will help signify completed transactions in digital and physical retail environments when a customer pays with Visa. The sound of Visa will debut in Visas global advertising campaign ahead of the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018.
For 60 years, the Visa brand has been a global symbol of innovation, speed, trust and security, said Lynne Biggar, chief marketing and communications officer, Visa. As payments become increasingly embedded in commerce, the notion of Everywhere You Want To Be takes on even greater meaning for our brand. As new payment experiences continue to take shape in the world, this suite of sensory branding elements will give consumers the assurances we know they want every time they use Visa.
Research shows that the Visa brand universally signifies trust, security and an understanding of available payment options. In a recent consumer study commissioned by Visa, up to 71 percent of respondents surveyed thought a website was secure when the Visa logo was visible, yielding a higher likelihood to complete a transaction.
In a digital world filled with connected wearable devices, Visas sensory branding elements are designed to evoke those same emotions, even in environments where the traditional Visa logo is not visible.
Extensive consumer research was conducted in eight countries to identify the impact of sensory branding on perceptions of both Visa and its ecosystem of partners, finding that: 83 percent said the sound or animation cues positively impacted their perception of the Visa brand; 81 percent said they would have a more positive perception of merchants who used either the sound or animation cues; less than a second in length, the sound of Visa was found to signal speed and convenience; the effectiveness of haptic technology in advertising has been shown to incite feelings of 'happiness' and 'excitement' during exposure among consumers.
Visas sensory branding will be available as a software development kit (SDK) on the Visa Developer Platform and through the Visa Ready program for deeper integration requirements, in 2018. Visa is also developing pilot programs with a national merchant and point-of-sale (POS) hardware vendors for 2018.

Keyt evolved a distinct personal style of painting, these murals using Hindu and Buddhist art forms. He incorporated costumes and jewellery of the period of the Sakkyas which shocked the devotees who saw them for the first time, with his unorthodox way of depicting the Buddha Charithaya.
He was the first Sri Lankan painter to break with the past with his reliance on the fresco idea and lines of calligraphic drawing can be seen. in the murals. The life of the Buddha was drawn with figures on a heroic scale and this was a complete departure from the traditional form of Sittara paintings of the Kandyan period.
ln the figures, Keyt gave poignancy to each incident relevant to his theme, capturing the mood with lines and colours. The paintings are not merely representational but symbolic of characters and conduct. The figures are round and robust. the male figures being energetic and virile and the female ones voluptuous. However, the Buddha has been depicted throughout as the great compassionate one and he dominated the murals.
ln painting his murals, Keyt did not make any preliminary studies as such before working on the walls and he created imagery straight away on the walls and when he started to paint the style evolved quite naturally And it was a spontaneous creativity to get the maximum effect with his brush and Paint.
It is interesting to study the murals at Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara with those of Gotami Vihara. at Kelaniya, Solias Mendis adapted the modes of the popular Shanti Niketan School of painting particularly that of Nandalal Bose. with an element of romanticism in the treatment of the subject at the hands of Solias Mendis.
Keyts approach is quite different. In depicting Mahamaya Devis dream sequence he used symbols such as white elephant and lotus flower to depict the conception as described in our classical Sinhala text Pujavaliya.
In the scene of the Renunciation, Keyt shows Prince Siddharthas contempt tor luxury and worldly pleasures and went in search of the truth. He has successfully conveyed the feelings of the Prince and creating the same sentiments in the minds of the viewers.
The most striking episode is Mara Yuddaya (Conquest of Mara) before reaching The Enlightenment. In order to heighten the effect, Keyt fused the traditional art with Picassos cubism to create the weird scene. Showing all the evil forces risen together to disturb the mental state of the Buddha.
Hitherto Sittara painters narrated incidents in detail in a pictorial manner using a limited range of colours. Their style remained essentially folk in outlook.
The border designs of Manjusri added a new dimension to the murals by using the floral designs of the tapestry and symbols such as the lotus and liyavela seen in the paintings of Tibet. The colours he used do not disturb in the eye yet they appeal to the beholder.
Keyt had a perfect understanding of art and sculpture of the past and he assimilated the influences which he depicted in the murals. This was an integrated idiom to convey a religious thought in an impressive way. Martin Russell in his monograph (1950) commenting on the Gothami Vihara murals said, Their popularity has grown steadily for they convey the full flavours of the Buddhas life with unexampled directness and conjure up a world of vigorous and beautiful civilization.

Wanna experience Picket Republic
If you step into the Lionel Wendt on the evenings of December 16 and 17, youll be walking into a tumultuous outburst of youthful energy, and a theatrical experience like no other. Picket Republic is a satirical theatrical representation of everyday life on the Pearl, brought to you by an enthusiastic cast of nearly forty thespians.
The play is a collection of scenes typifying our island mentality, that uses a story similar to the Wizard of Oz to get its point across. The play is bilingual, including scenes both in Sinhala and English, and a good dose of Singlish added in for good measure. The audience will no doubt be captivated by the accurate depictions and satirical takes that they will see on stage.
The theme of Picket Republic is of course evident in the title itself. The picketing culture now prevalent in Sri Lanka is one that none of us can escape, and indeed, it seems to have become the go to vehicle for any form of social unrest. Strikes and rallies are a dime a dozen, and seem to spring up at the drop of a hat. The psychosis leading to this phenomenon is the main topic explored in the play.
Its a heady mix of neocolonialism and nationalism, the tug of war between a nations search to establish its identity, which is plated up in a palatable, comedic form for your viewing pleasure. Negativity and fear of the other may be the manifestations of these processes, and there is indeed no better time than the present to investigate the ebbing and flowing of these forces within this tiny nation.
At a time when a new brand of thinking is necessary, it is heartening that a youth group such as the one behind Picket Republic have made it their mission to look beyond racial dynamics and nationalist motives, to the underlying humanity of all the citizens in this country. They will entertain you, and they will also challenge your perceptions at the same time.
If you are a fan of stage theatre, and want to see a laugh-out-loud, homegrown political satire based on these uncertain times, then you only have two days in which to get your fill of the last theatrical production to go on the boards of the Lionel Wendt for 2017. Be there on 16 and 17, from 7.30 pm onwards, or at the matinee show on December 17 at 3.30pm.

Wolbachia bacteria to control dengue
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is to submit a Cabinet paper to use the Wolbachia bacteria to control dengue, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the Australian Government will provide AUS $ one million for the pilot project to be implemented with the approval of the National Committee of Experts for Biodiversity, attached to the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry.
The Monash University of Australia will provide technical assistance to carry out a field study in selected areas in Sri Lanka.
Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil and Colombia successfully use Wolbachia-infected Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes to control dengue. The Wolbachia bacteria naturally live in bodies of over 60 insects including mosquitoes, he said.
When dengue mosquitoes are infected with the Wolbachia bacteria, the dengue virus does not develop inside their bodies up to the level of spreading it, he added. A total of 177,000 dengue patients and around 400 dengue deaths were reported during this year which is the highest recorded.
Minister Senaratne has instructed to implement a mosquito control programme before commencing the new school term on January 2, he added.

World changed for English cricket after Stokes incident - Cook
Perth: Senior batsman Alastair Cook says the world has changed for English cricket in the wake of the damaging Ben Stokes affair, and warned the team cannot afford any more mistakes.
The star all-rounder is currently banned from the international game while authorities probe his alleged involvement in a late-night fight outside a nightclub.
Cook, a former captain who will become the first Englishman to play 150 Tests when he appears against Australia in Thursdays crucial third Ashes clash in Perth, admits his side has been slow to learn from the fall-out.
Dubbed a behavioural cleanskin, Cook senses England should have learnt their lesson months ago that standards would be intensely scrutinised in the wake of the Stokes scandal.
It has been a very strange thing, he told reporters in Perth late Tuesday.
The world has obviously changed for the English cricket team from September. We have taken a couple of months to really realise that.
These last two incidents have proved that. Ive seen words written down, trivial misdemeanour at best, but since the Stokes incident times have changed for the English cricket team.
Cook was referring to further off-field alcohol-related scandals involving Jonny Bairstow and Ben Duckett on the tour of Australia.
Its sad in some ways because we have always been a bit different to football and been able to go under the radar a bit and enjoy playing cricket for England and enjoy seeing the country outside that, Cook said.
But the spotlight was now firmly on England and its off-field antics and its now down to us to adjust to it quickly and we cant afford any more mistakes.
- Taking the mickey -
Experienced fast bowler James Anderson said while the Duckett incident was not malicious and a bit of a non event, the tourists had to understand the current situation and act smarter.
Duckett was fined and will play no further part in the remaining matches for the England Lions in Australia after he poured a beer over Anderson in a Perth bar. The frustrating thing is that what was a pretty silly incident would have gone unnoticed before but now puts an unfair question mark over our (teams) culture, Anderson wrote in a column for Britains Telegraph newspaper.
We are all aware that from now on even a minor incident will be seized upon.
I know Australia will use the Duckett incident as a way of goading us, or taking the mickey. Fine. The players have moved on already. Our main focus is getting back in the series. That is all everyone is talking about.
With batsman Steve Smith shaping up as Australias danger man in Perth, Anderson said he would again try to get inside his bubble, suggesting the Australia skipper can expect some serious sledging.
In the first innings (in Adelaide) I sensed he was more bothered about what Stuart (Broad) and I were saying to him, which was not very interesting, Anderson said of Smith.
As a bowler, once you get him out a couple of times you realise he is not superhuman, he added. You realise I can bowl to this guy and that makes a big difference.

Forthcoming election to ensure development
The forthcoming local council election is aimed to ensure grassroot-level development such as building village roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, to facilitate village development rather than to change governments, said Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne.
As such, people should elect an efficient individual from the area who can ensure a good job for their benefit, rather than trying to follow the general election wave as during the time of a general election, he said.
Addressing a meeting held at Minipe recently, Deputy Minister Jayaratne said they spent the last two years studying the needs and requirements of people in the Uda Dumbara electorate. They found that about 20,000 people belonging to nearly 4,500 families lived in a wildlife zone extending from the Minipe anicut upto Randenigala.
After obtaining Cabinet approval to release the area from the wildlife zone, President Maithripala Sirisena had declared the entire Minipe DS division with 44 hamlets as the Mahaweli E Zone and allocated Rs 400 million to distribute the land among the inhabitants through title deeds, he said. Central Provincial Council Member Nissanka Herath, Victoria Zone Resident Project Manager Udaya Kumara, and other officials were present on the occasion.

Peopling for innovation launched by the Kelaniya University
The National Summit of Peoples Management by the University of Kelaniya was launched at the Kingsbury Hotel<U+200B> on Tuesday.
The summit with a vision of Peopling for innovation consisted of three separate sessions, The Academic Convention, The Postgraduate Caucus and The Undergraduate Confab. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs Dr. Sarath Amunugama graced the occasion as the Chief Guest while the Chairman of Hela Clothing, Dian Gomes also graced the occassion.
The minister addressing the gathering said, I take this as an opportunity to invite the foreign students who are present here today to make the most of this occasion. The subject you have selected is of great importance to this country and management is the key to development.
I must tell you that the Port City which is under construction is of 680 hectares with 80 hectares consisting of greenery. The Sri Lankan government has collaborated with a Chinese Company in building this great architecture within two years. Now this is a brilliant example of good management, he noted.
The biggest problem affecting the growth of Sri Lanka is the public sector and it is mandatory that we face this blunt truth. Poor management is the promary reason behind this. After independence, many governments have been making state ventures by bringing in their relatives and political supporters into power and this has caused many losses in the majority of government institutions.
