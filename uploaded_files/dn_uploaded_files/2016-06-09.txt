Chairmen and members of commissions:CC to propose payment of  emoluments and allowances

The Constitutional Council(CC), has taken measures to propose to the Cabinet for the payment of emoluments and allowances to the Chairmen and members of the Commissions set up under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, according to a statement issued by the Constitutional Council yesterday.
The statement said that the second report of the Constitutional Council (CC) for the period December 2015 to February 2016, had been submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena. The CC kept the President informed of the work it had undertaken during the aforesaid period.
It was also the view of the members of the Council that the general public should from time to time, be kept informed of the decisions of the Council and also apprised of the manner the decisions of the Council are taken. Whilst an element of confidentiality has to be maintained in respect of its deliberations to ensure a free and full discussion of the merits and demerits of persons and/or of their capacity to hold positions, none the less it was felt that the public is entitled to know its workings to ensure that reasonable measures are taken by the Council to select appropriate persons to critical posts which have to be filled on the recommendations of the Council.
The current council which was functioning since September 2015 had among its first important tasks was the appointment of members to several critical commissions which were set out in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. The Council decided to follow the procedure which had been adopted by the previous CC which functioned prior to the repeal of the 17th Amendment called for nominations from organisations, institutions and individuals which were then scrutinized by members representing the civil society and recommendations were made after the entire Council approved them. The basic criteria which was adopted were integrity, independence and non-partisanship of applicants to which was added the professional experience necessary concerning the work of the particular commission. Outstanding leadership qualities, maturity and diversity were among the other important criteria. Largely, the criteria followed were those adopted by the previous council, except the system of allocating specific marks which was considered as placing unrealistic means for the selection of such persons for the objective which was sought to be achieved.
Though the Council due to the urgency of its role adopted the guidelines set out above, which in its view was quite adequate and fair, the Council has also discussed the need to fine tune the criteria in the background of the experience it now has and make further suggestions and issuance of fresh rules. The Council felt that the views of party leaders should be obtained in formulating them. Accordingly, copies of the criteria adopted by the CC established under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, were sent to members of the Parliamentary Business Committee for their views.
Whenever a request was made to the CC by Commissions to meet with the Council to discuss issues relating to their smooth functioning, the CC readily provided the said Commissions with necessary opportunities to do so. In the past, as many Commissions, particularly those which were created by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, did not have the necessary office space, financial provisions and staff requirements the Council discussed these matters with the Treasury and other government authorities to urgently fulfill them.
The Council has had extensive discussions with the Chairmen of the Delimitation Commission, National Procurement Commission, Audit Service commission and the Elections Commission, relating to such issues.
During the past two months, the Council had met to grant approval for recommendations of the President under Article 41C(1) of the Constitution. These were in respect of appointments of a Judge of the Court of Appeal, approving the acting appointment of the Attorney General, appointment of the Attorney General and the appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court.
The Council has sent a proposal for the establishing of an Advisory Committee (in line with current trends), composed of Judges, Attorney General and members of the Official and Unofficial Bar which could be consulted by the President in nominating suitable persons to be appointed as the Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court, the President and Judges of the Court of Appeal and the Attorney General. The council has suggested that persons from the existing Judicial hierarchy, the official Bar and the unofficial Bar should be considered for such appointments after considering their seniority, suitability to hold such posts and who are held in respect by their peers.
