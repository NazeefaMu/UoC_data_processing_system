Report card with a steady progress
Two years ago, on January 8, 2015, the incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who thought he would be in power for another term, was thrown out of office at the Presidential election. Some called it a political coup, if ever there was one.
His contender, Maithripala Sirisena, was elected President. He has now had two years in office and it is possible to see what changes he has done and will do in the future.
A few days after Maithripala Sirisena assumed the Presidency, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the Parliament. He said, "The state of public finances exposes the shady operations of the previous government. The faade of duplicity must be removed and the actual position made known. The previous government gave Rs 524 billion as Treasury Guarantees to commercial banks to implement infrastructure projects by state-owned enterprises (SOE). The outstanding debt of SOEs to the local banking system is Rs 593 billion. Foreign borrowings of SOEs at end-2014 was US $ 2.36 billion or Rs 308 billion. The outstanding government debt at end-2014 including these three items is Rs 8.8 trillion". [Rs 8.8 trillion is 78 % of our GDP]
In August, same year, the UNP led United National Front won the parliamentary elections and for the first time in Sri Lanka's political history, two major political parties joined hands to form a Government. They called it a unity Government.
Progress
Even with an ailing health report, the unity Government emerged with a renewed emphasis on economic reforms and fiscal consolidation. Industry stakeholders began to emphasize the importance of diversifying and adding value to Sri Lanka's export basket and trade relationships, repeating the country's earlier success in the garment market. A variety of sectors, including branded tea, rubber products, gems, IT and business process outsourcing, were all seen as potential avenues for expansion.
Tourism posted record growth in the last two years with tourist arrivals of 1.8m and 2.0m respectively. Along with inward remittances, it represented an important component of Sri Lanka's foreign exchange earnings, though both were vulnerable to volatility in international economic conditions. In addition to these economic sectors, overseas employment contributed highly in foreign exchange, 90% of which coming from the Middle East.
With major international hotels, including luxury players Shangri-La and Grand Hyatt, continue to emerge in Sri Lanka, the country will be looking to reinforce its tourism profile overseas in 2017 and beyond.
Sri Lanka also has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving extreme poverty and is on track to meet most of the other MDGs, outperforming other South Asian countries.
What Next
President Sirisena has often emphasized that his Government plans to create a knowledge based social market economy and an export-oriented economy and a Megapolis in the western province to promote economic growth. Creation of several business and technology development areas specialized in various sectors island wide as well as tourism zones is also being planned.
Business Analysts suggest that a medium term (3-5 year) program is the call of the day. Two pathways are suggested: One is that it must be an all export oriented effort and the other recommends that it must all be left to the private sector. Both suggestions, in moderation, have a point but it is a balanced approach that is more to the point.
Economic growth
As President Maithipala Sirisena moves into his third year, the future of Sri Lanka's economic health will largely depend on the country's political stability, public service efficiency, return to genuine peace, good governance and continued policy reforms-particularly in fiscal discipline and public service management.
He can be happy that a significant progress has been made during his two years' tenure. His Government has reversed the previous Government's slide into authoritarianism and family rule. Space for dissent and activism has reopened in civil society. There have also been appreciable gains in rule-of-law and liberal-democratic governance, with the police and judiciary functioning more independently and reduced powers for the executive president.
The Government has set a more conciliatory tone on ethnic issues. Symbolic gestures like singing of the national anthem in Tamil on Independence Day accompanied initial progress in releasing military-occupied land in the Tamil-majority north and east and a slight pullback of the military's role there.
The Government's broader agenda is extremely ambitious, including a new constitution, to be drafted and approved by the mid-2017, further governance and rule-of-law reforms, addressing the legacy of the war and major changes in economic policy. Each track has powerful political opponents; all need to move at their own speed and are hard to synchronize against a backdrop of a deteriorating economy.
We have yet to see how willing and able the government is to move on deeper reforms, such as justice for wartime abuses and a political solution to the ethnic conflict based on greater devolution of power.
On January 4 the government launched the economic development plan, themed under creating a powerful Sri Lanka and economy which uplifts all. The plan is in keeping with the President's 'Sustainable Era' initiative.
Diagnosis
This writer believes that we have misdiagnosed the slowdown of the economic progress. It is not a problem of a 'weak top.' to be solved by a 'strong leadership.' No, it is not! Sri Lanka is faced with a systemic problem, born of the wrong or insufficient laws and deficient regulatory capacity.
But systemic problems take much longer than two years to fix. When you examine the reasons why doing business in Sri Lanka is so difficult: tax uncertainty, dozens of permits to start a business, daily corruption, broken infrastructure, shortage of trained talent, none are easy-fix ones.
There are larger problems in Sri Lanka that will take some time to tackle: education, health care, pensions, pollution. It is heartening to see that some long-term plans are afoot to solve some of these issues.
One of the platforms President Maithripala Sirisena ran on was to rid the country of corruption and rope in the people who got involved in corrupt deals. On that front, at least, one can say the Government has unearthed many mega-scams done during the previous Government. But people were complaining about the slow progress of the investigations.
To expedite the process, the Cabinet recently approved to set up a tribunal on the lines of Criminal Justice Commission to enquire into the cases of fraud and corruption.
Foreign policy
Only a few expected President Maithripala Sirisena to be a strong foreign policy leader; after all, he was a newcomer to international politics. Yet he has been a revelation on the world stage, a complete natural.
President Sirisena's invitation as a guest of the G-7 nations - the most powerful and influential group of nations - is unprecedented, not only for a Sri Lankan head of state but for a Third World leader.
Most of the trips he made during the last two years had been state visits to Asian countries invited by the leaders of those countries.
President Sirisena has undoubtedly opened doors to Sri Lanka. He has made friends among many leaders and won over the increasingly significant diaspora. This will have economic and social benefits down the road.
Under President Sirisena, Sri Lanka remains relatively nonaligned. But more importantly, Sri Lanka seems to have moved beyond: it has more of a global feel to it, projecting ambition.
Judgment
In the end, President Sirisena will be judged by Sri Lankan people on whether they feel their lives are improving, and here the President has some breathing space. Sri Lanka is going to keep growing for many years, in part because it is starting from short, medium and long-term plans and is blessed with hundreds of thousands of young people hungry for jobs and opportunities. The reality is that delivery takes time, especially in Sri Lanka. There is much to do. For President Sirisena, it means, less PR and more action, especially at home. He still has the tools and the confidence of the people to be Sri Lanka's most transformative leader in the post-independence history.

Rooney record in United rout, Leicester win at Everton
LONDON, Saturday: Wayne Rooney left his footprint on FA Cup third-round day with the first goal in holders Manchester United's 4-0 rout of Championship side Reading on Saturday to draw level with Bobby Charlton as the club's record scorer.
His seventh-minute effort took his United tally to 249 since joining the 12-times Cup winners in 2004, but Rooney failed to surpass Charlton's long-standing mark as Anthony Martial and two late goals from Marcus Rashford completed United's comfortable victory at Old Trafford.
I think it's just a question of time to score one more goal and become in the history of Manchester United. It's arriving; the big moment for him is arriving, manager Jose Mourinho said after his side's eighth straight win in all competitions.
Premier League champions Leicester City enjoyed some respite from a poor campaign as they claimed a first away victory in domestic competitions this season with summer signing Ahmed Musa scoring twice in a 2-1 victory at Everton.
There were a few surprises on one of the standout days in the English soccer calendar with three of the five top-flight sides to depart being beaten by lower league sides. Arsenal were in danger of becoming a sixth when they trailed 1-0 at second-tier Preston North End at halftime but Olivier Giroud's 89th minute winner sent them through 2-1.
Aaron Ramsey curler one minute after the break had cancelled out Callum Robinson's early opener.
The biggest surprise of the day came in south London where League One (third tier) Millwall humbled top-flight Bournemouth 3-0.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe made 11 changes to the side that drew 3-3 with Arsenal in midweek and it showed as Steve Morison, Shaun Cummings and Shane Ferguson struck for Millwall.
We are so stretched, the Premier League is such a demanding league, we feel we need our best players available for selection, Howe said in defence of his team selection.  Agencies

Setting up industries in Hambantota commendable: Chamal Rajapaksa

Setting up factories in Hambantota with foreign investment is commendable, former Speaker and Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Chamal Rajapaksa said in Parliament today.
MP Rakapaksa made this observation while joining in the debate that took place following a special statement made by Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena today.
Rajapaksa added that the harbour was constructed not to keep it without setting up of factories: "The factories should be set up in Hambantota and it is beneficial for the country, Chamal Rajapaksa said.
But they should be brought in a manner that would not be harmful to the country and it should be decided by way of discussions, he added.
He said further that lands have already been acquired for the industrial zones in Hambantota. He added that if more land is needed they should be acquired from suitable places. He added that there are lands in Monaragala, Matara and Ambilipitiya too.
However that there is an agreement entered into with the China Harbour Company in 2014 which has granted lands to them only for the operation," Chamal Rajapaksa said.
I can submit it to you for your information. He also said that the oppositions in a democratic country always stage some kind of protest against whatever move taken by a government whether constructive or not.
The people had a suspicion over the statement of taking over 15,000 acres for 99-years with the China Merchant Company, Rajapaksa said. "However, the Premier meeting with the Tissamahararama Nayaka Theras prevented a massive destruction.
It was great that he met the venerable Maha Sanga. But it had not cleared the peoples suspicion. So the people decided to stage a peaceful protest, he said.
He alleged that people were taken from Colombo to Hambantota to assault protestors. He said people from Colombo had been taken to a Hambantota conference hall and the following day they had assaulted the protestors under influence of liquor.
He added that he hoped the Prime Minister would look into this matter.

True freedom established in past two years: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said true freedom was established during the last two years by the government while carrying out true development.
The majority of people decided to vote in favour of forming a national unity government aiming to experience true freedom and true development on January 8, 2015, he said. The Prime Minister was addressing a ceremony to mark the commencement of the third year of President Maithripala Sirisena in office,at the BMICH yesterday.
The event was held under the theme The dawn of three years in the era of sustainability.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the government has established and ensured freedom for everyone including media freedom. As a result of that freedom, even the President and the Prime Minister are criticised. But, it is also significant that, no one is harassed or killed under this government.
Chief Minister of Andra Pradesh Nara Chandrababu Naidu attended the ceremony as a special invitee of the occasion.
The government has established freedom in order to for everyone to exprees themselves. As a democratic government, the government hears those voices and makes the necessary changes if needed, he said. The Prime Minister pointed out that there is a cordial rapport between Sri Lanka and the Andra Pradesh since the era of Anuradhapura.
Prime Minister Wickremasinghe said that South Asia is developing rapidly when compared with the other regions of the world. Therefore, the countries in this region have a better opportunity and potential to utilise the trend.
Speaking on the past two years of the government, the Prime Minister said that it is not an easy task to bring a country, which suffered tremendous destruction to normalcy.
The governments task to bring normalcy back to the country was no easy task.Establishing coexistence in a destroyed country is difficult but we achieved it. Now, we are working togehter like brothers,he said. The Prime Minister added that it is also difficult to link two rival political parties together. Forming this national unity government can also be considered as a significant achievement since during the last five decades, the main political parties were at two ends.
He added that the government has taken initiatives for the countrys economic prosperity. Under this not only Colombo but also many other districts including Trincomalee, Hambantota etc are being developed.
But, it is regrettable that certain people are trying to hamper and stifle the development drive. It is a great betrayal, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister further said that new laws should be implemented to take the country forward. It is nothing new to the world as many countries have implemented new laws from time to time reach our goals.

Two years down the road
Two years ago, on this day, the country was lashed with a political tsunami when the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena overcame severe odds to emerge victorious at the Presidential Election. The result no doubt would have overwhelmed this modest man from the out backs of Polonnaruwa, the son of a farmer, as much as it did the larger electorate. Sirisena when he left the SLFP as its General Secretary no less, and took the plunge to present himself as the candidate representing a rainbow coalition, of not only political parties, but also a wide spectrum of civil society organisations, artistes and social activists etc, he, no doubt, was treading on political quicksand.
On the one hand he had the challenging task of winning over the acceptance of the UNP, a large segment of whom would have not taken too kindly towards voting for a man of the enemy camp. On the other hand he had the might of the Rajapaksa ruling clan to contend with their control of state machinery, the unleashing of state terrorism and a highly obnoxious vilification campaign. That he braved the odds and emerged victorious is not only testament to the mans courage and resourcefulness, but also a reflection of the public hope for a better country, ruled, not with an iron fist, but respecting and honouring the peoples rights and their genuine aspirations.
True, most of the pledges made, yet remain to be fulfilled and reforms promised have been moving at a slow pace. Bringing to book those responsible for mega corruption which formed the main plank of the election platform has also been slow, creating frustration among many, chiefly the civil society organsations which put their shoulder into the campaign of the Common Candidate.
But, there have been visible changes during the last two years, chief of which is the absence of the climate of fear. Even his worse critic would concede that today there is an air of freedom, freedom to critcise the government, media freedom, freedom of the judiciary etc. Ethnic relations have never been so good as at present with the President working earnestly towards reconciliation. He has to a great extent removed the stigma attached to the SLFP as a racist party by emphasizing national unity.
Under President Sirisena, there is a Unity Government today which has placed a moratorium on contentious and rancorous politics which retarded development and progress in the past. One time arch foes are today sitting together to map out development plans and work together to take the country in one direction, under the Presidents stewardship.
The newly dawned year no doubt is going to witness many changes and radical shifts in many spheres. The President in his New Year message clearly indicated this. He placed accent on development and the employment generation. He said ones objective should be for those in power not to look at consolidating that power or those not in power to aspire for power, but to work together for the good of the country.
The President is aware that goodwill and popularity is a transient phenomenon and that people are bound to change or shift allegiance soon if they are not satisfied with their rulers. Hence, he, together with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, will be looking towards alleviating the hardship, a large segment of the populace is forced to undergo, due to the high living costs, in the new year. Already he has the rice crisis to contend with and is bound to be confronted with other problems which the Opposition will wish on him to topple him from his perch. For now though, President Sirisena is firmly in the saddle and still enjoys the goodwill of a sizable section of the public. His journey no doubt will be strewn with obstacles and pitfalls, but he is certain to demonstrate the strong resolve and resourcefulness he displayed in overcoming a formidable political foe two years ago to emerge triumphant in the face of these challenges.

Two years on
Two years is a short time to make a proper assessment of a new government's record in office. Usually, the first year is devoted to consolidating power while the second is the time when it gets down to business in earnest. It should also be borne in mind that although President Sirisena was voted into Office on January 8th the Unity Government was formed only in August following the general election. Hence the government's record should be assessed only from this point, some may argue. But, for all intents and purposes, the new government came into being with the election of President Sirisena two years ago at which time the change was ushered in and the government's overall performance should be gauged from this landmark happening.
Considering this, there is a lot to be happy with the turn of events and the changes wrought that has impacted positively on the citizenry. There can be no doubt that there is a discerning sense of freedom and an air of well being among the general public during the past two years. Many structures of the state that shackled the people have been dismantled and replaced by instruments that have enhanced and strengthened their rights. The oppressive powers of the President has been curtailed to a great extent through the introduction of the 19th Amendment and the long overdue Right to Information Act brought in to ensure probity and transparency in governance. Independent Commissions have been put in place to end arbitrary decision making and ensure fairness. The climate of fear that enveloped the nation is a thing of the past and freedom to criticise the government is only all too evident with several media institutions taking the government to task with gay abandon.
President Sirisena has also succeeded in winning over countries which were hostile towards Sri Lanka in the past and had the honour of a visit by a US Secretary of State to this country for the first time in several decades. He also had the privilege of being invited as a special guest to the G8 summit in Tokyo rubbing shoulders with world leaders including US President Barack Obama. All in all the country's standing internationally has risen appreciably under President Sirisena.
On the ethnic front, the past two years has seen communal harmony on an unprecedented scale with the President taking a personal initiative to make frequent visits to the North and interact with the Tamil community. He has also taken steps to reduce the military presence in the north and give back the lands, taken over by the army during the period of the war, to their original owners. Bold initiatives have been taken over the past two years to accelerate the reconciliation process and bring about a permanent solution to the national question, for which the President has won praise from many countries.
Some point out that the Yahapalanaya government under President Sirisena has not moved along in the expected pace on the development front and that corruption is raising its head again in government. Opponents have also taken the government to task for allegedly being lenient towards Tamil politicians who express pro-separatist sentiments and for taking the country on the path of division. Even those who voted for the President are largely disappointed by what they see as a lackadaisical approach of his government in making fundamental changes. For instance they find fault with the government for tardiness in bringing to book the corrupt of the former regime. There is also criticism over high taxes and the steep rise in the Cost of Living. The Opposition is quick to point out that development had stalled and that no new development projects have been started under the Yahapalanaya regime and indeed it was opening projects commenced by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
While there may be some justification to these claims the government cannot be expected to perform on all fronts at once in such a short time. It cannot plunge headlong into development projects without taking into consideration the cost benefit factor. The country has been landed in a massive debt burden thanks to injudicious moves by the former President to opt for mega schemes such as the Hambantota Port and Mattala airport without proper assessment of the economic returns that will accrue to the country.
For all that, the Yahapalanaya government under President Sirisena has displayed the will to succeed.While settling the mountainous debt, left behind by the Rajapaksa administration, it has taken determined strides to rebuild the economy and also usher in prudent development that would bring beneficial returns to the country.
President Sirisena has repeatedly asserted he would not allow a separation of the country and has put to rest fears entertained by the public over the new constitution, which the Joint Opposition is attempting to drum into their collective minds. As he has often said the constitution is still in the making and will be finalised only with the inputs of all stakeholders. The President has already declared that the 2017 will usher in a development revolution in the country and asserted that the Yahapalanaya government is unshakable and would run its full course.

US jobs growth slows to 156,000 during December
US businesses added 156,000 jobs in December in the last release of key economic data before Donald Trump is sworn in as US president. The number of jobs created fell from an upwardly revised 204,000 in November and came in below market expectations of 175,000 new roles.
The jobless rate edged up last month to 4.7% from 4.6%.
Trump, who takes office on 20 January, has pledged to create 25 million jobs over 10 years.
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the annual rate of wage growth accelerated in December to 2.7%. This compares with a 2.5% increase in annual average hourly earnings recorded in November and is the quickest pace of growth since June 2009. The bureau revised up the number of new jobs created in November from an initial count of 178,000 to 204,000.
Over the last year of Barack Obamas presidency, job growth reached 2.2 million, down from 2.7 million in 2015. Luke Bartholomew, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said, Job growth was decent and wage growth is picking up nicely. But the only real show in town is Donald Trumps inauguration.
The economy is doing well and doesnt obviously need the shot in the arm that Trump is planning on providing.
The interaction between the Fed and Trump, and the resulting policy mix, is likely to be the defining theme for investors this year.
Some of the figures for that eight-year period look pretty good. Eleven million more people with jobs, and the unemployment rate down from 7.8% to 4.7%. But then in some respects Obama did have quite a tailwind to help him.
First of all, he came to power as the great recession was really beginning to bite. He had the benefit of the subsequent cyclical recovery you would expect anyway. The working-age population has grown, which means increased numbers with jobs are to be expected. The percentage of people (aged 16 or over) with jobs has actually come down a little although that has a lot to do with an ageing population. And theres a case for saying that wider measures of labour market problems (people who want to work longer hours or have given up looking for work and are not counted as unemployed) are still somewhat on the high side.
The conclusion Plenty of scope for argument about President Obamas jobs legacy.
Trump has promised to cut tax both for individuals and for businesses, as well as invest in national infrastructure.
The US Federal Reserve indicated in the minutes from its last rate-setting meeting in December that it may have to raise interest rates at a quicker pace if Congress passes Trumps tax cuts. BBC News

AL results of 80 students withheld
The Advanced Level Examination results of 80 students have been temporarily withheld, Commissioner General of Examinations W.M.N.J. Pushpakumara said.
He said the results of students who sat for the exam fraudulently from districts other than their own have been withheld following preliminary investigations by the Education Ministry.
These students whose results have been withheld had sat for the Examination from the Central, North Western and North Central Provinces, Pushpakumara said.He told the Daily News that this was the first time results have been withheld for cheating by sitting for the exam from another district.
We will decide what final action is to be taken after a full inquiry. Till then their results have been withheld, he said.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam revealed in August that 216 students had fraudulently sat for the A-L exam last year from 11 schools in the Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura and Puttalam districts.
Out of them 145 students had sat the exam from six schools in Nuwara Eliya, 61 from three schools in Anuradhapura and 10 from two schools in Puttalam. The Commissioner General of Examinations however said the Education Ministry during the preliminary inquiries had decided to release the results of some of the students who provided valid reasons for the change in district.
The misuse of quota for the underprivileged districts, which came to light recently, had been an exam mal-practice that had been continuing for some years.

Already 50 Chinese financiers to invest in Sri Lanka-China Industrial Zone
Already 50 Chinese financiers have come forward to invest in the Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said.
He was speaking to the media at the Department of Government Information yesterday.
State Minister Senasinghe said that Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka,Yi Xianliang has confirmed that 50 investors have already given the green light to invest in the Mirijjawila, Hambantota Industrial Zone.
The confirmed investors are only from China. Fifty is a very small number of investors to China. Our target is to receive 2,000 foreign investments for this industrial zone Senasinghe said.
Pointing out the importance of the strategic location of Sri Lanka, He said that Chinese President Xi Jinping has shown a special interest in Sri Lanka as a capitol in the new Silk Road.
The government is expecting 5 billion USD basic foreign investments to the Hambantota Industrial Zone within the next 3-5 years, State Minister Senasinghe further said.
Minister Senasinghe also refuted the allegations that a million Chinese workers will be working in the Hambantota Industrial Zone.
It is a false allegation, State Minister Senasinghe said. All workers in the factories will be Sri Lankans,he confirmed.
Why should someone think that we would launch projects for the prosperity of the Chinese is beyond us,the State Minister said.
The monthly salary of an average Chinese worker is 800 dollars. In Sri Lanka, it is 200 dollars. Therefore,it is highly unlikely that Chinese employees would be interested in working here, he said.
There is a legal framework in the country, which does not allow any and every foreigner to come and work freely in this country.The Chamber of Commerce only gives a few liecenses for foreign employees, who are mainly experts on certain subjects, to come and work in Sri Lanka,Senasinghe pointed out.
He further pointed out that the basic salary for workers in the zone will be around Rs.40,000.
If the employees are skilled and properly trained, they may even get an income around Rs.80,000 to Rs.90,000. The government is focused on establishing training colleges and institutes to create a suitable workforce as the employers would demand, Senasinghe said.
The success of the Hambantota Industrial Zone will create not just one million jobs but more than five million, Senasinghe further said.
He pointed out that the Sri Lankan economy needs to focus on production and industries without solely focusing on services sector. Without developing and promoting industries, our economy will go nowhere other than to an economic crisis,he pointed out.
The free trade zones have created 1.3 million jobs in the country. How many said no to these free trade zones Senasinghe questioned.
If we are to successfully implement this project, we will be able to generate job opportunities about 35 times larger than the free trade zones did,Senasinghe further said.
Senasinghe further pointed out the government is currently paying a maintanace fee of Rs.1,000 million for the Hambantota Port.
The interest for the debts taken for the same is Rs.15 billion, he further said.
Neither Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe nor President Maithripala Sirisena are interested in the commissions they can get or deals they can enter into, when launching development projects like those in the Rajapaksa regime allegedly did with these projects,Senasinghe also pointed out.
Senasinghe also denied the allegation that the claiming of lands for the industrial zone would destroy temples or archeological sites.
Around 96% of the land that we are focused on, belongs to the government. Some, encouraged by the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, are forcefully using the government owned land for their personal use. If any of these lands are developed by these people, the government will compensate them for the development they have done. Senasinghe pointed out.

Anderson powers N.Zealand to T20 sweep
MOUNT MAUNGANUI: Corey Anderson bludgeoned 94 off just 41 balls as New Zealand beat Bangladesh by 27 runs in the third Twenty20 at Bay Oval on Sunday to sweep the series.
Anderson, who put on 124 runs for the fourth wicket with Kane Williamson (60), hit a New Zealand record 10 sixes in his batting blitz as New Zealand posted 194 for four.
Bangladesh in reply made 167 for six in their 20 overs.
Tamim Iqbal and Soumya Sarkar launched Bangladesh's reply by reaching 44 in the fifth over when Tamim was dismissed for 24. Bangladesh were 89 for two after 10 overs, but with Soumya having fallen for 42, they could not sustain the run rate.
The tourists still had an outside chance of reaching their target at 120 for three after 14 overs when spinner Ish Sodhi produced a crucially tight over in which he took one for three, blowing out the required run rate to an improbable 14.44 per over.
New Zealand captain Williamson said the blustery conditions meant the win was not as easy as it appeared on the scoreboard.
Power and Corey
Corey's knock was outstanding. It wasn't easy at times -- you had to adjust to the wind but I don't think the wind mattered to Corey, he said.
He hit it to parts and hit it a long way and it was a good knock that set us up for victory. New Zealand, sent into bat, were on the back foot early, slumping from 34 for nought to 41 for three in the space of 11 deliveries. That brought Anderson and Williamson together and after taking a few overs to settle in, with only 55 on the board at the halfway stage, they let fly in the second half of the innings which produced 139 runs.
They also set a New Zealand fourth-wicket partnership record of 124, one more than the previous mark set by Colin Munro and Tom Bruce in the second game two days ago.
The big-hitting Anderson only faced 41 deliveries for the highest knock of his career while Williamson faced 57 balls for his seventh Twenty20 half-century.
Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza, who had the misfortune to see Williamson dropped off his bowling on 53 and 58, was unable to complete his fourth over because of injury, compounding his team's problems.
Regular opener Imrul Kayes was also injured in the field. He dropped down the order during the Bangladesh innings and was not required to bat.
Rubel Hossain was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers with three for 31, including two wickets in one over when he removed Jimmy Neesham (15) and Munro, a century-maker two days ago, without scoring.
Sodhi took two for 22 and Trent Boult two for 48 for New Zealand.
The defeat left Bangladesh winless after three 50-over matches and three Twenty20s, with two Tests remaining on their tour. -AFP

Apple rewards developers as  App store sales soar
An insatiable desire by gamers to jump to the next level generated record revenues for App Store developers in 2016, according to Apple.
Developers who sell their apps through Apple earned a record $20bn in 2016, up 40% on the previous year.
Games dominated App Stores bestsellers, including Pokemon Go and Nintendos Super Mario Run.
Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw, said in-app purchases, such as paying to upgrade a character, drove the rise.
Since 2008, when the App Store first launched, developers have earned a total $60bn in revenue.
Last year alone accounted for $20bn, or a third of total sales.
Dawson attributed the acceleration to a relatively new business model where people download a game app for their iPhone or iPad for free, then pay to buy additional features such as opening secret levels or new powers.
In 2016, Apple also also changed its revenue sharing deal with developers of subscription apps such as Netflix or HBO Now.
In the first year of a customers subscription, the existing agreement remains in place which gives the developer 70% of revenue and Apple 30%.
Under the new terms, if the subscription continues for a second year Apple takes a smaller cut of 15% and the developer keeps the lions share, giving them a greater incentive to work to retain customers interest.
Apple also extended the scope of who can offer customers subscriptions to their product. Previously, only categories such as music services and magazines offered this service. In 2016 the option became available to all 25 categories on the App Store, including game makers.
Last year, revenue from subscriptions rose by 74% to $2.7bn. Also, the number of apps available through Apple grew by 20% to 2.2 million.
Dawson said subscriptions give Apple more predictable revenue streams as sales of iPhone, iPad and Macs slow.
App sales made a strong start to the year, with customers spending $240m on the App Store on New Years Day alone. BBC News

Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka
Simplicity and patience were his greatest treasures
Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka was a fearless man, who never feared anybody or anything, always stood by the correct thing and above all, had a manly heart. He was so courageous that he was ready to fight and to fight, even when hope was out of site.
As a politician, he never wanted to retire, he said, and wanted to live his life, forgetting his age and never to retire from living. Above all, he enjoyed living like a humble villager and enjoyed being himself. Simplicity and patience, was observed to a very great extent in his life. Those qualities were his greatest treasures.
His achievements were born of great sacrifice. He had good faith, and positive thinking, confidence in himself, and devotion to hard work. These excellent qualities, enabled him to do a remarkably great service to the nation and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as its General Secretary over the years, without caring for trouble making personalities.
One of his biggest contributions to the country was during the last few years of the separatist war  mainly from 2006 to 2009, when he was the Premier. He never knew about fear and he was so brave and fearless, while threatening Velupillai Prabhakaran with death and the LTTE terrorist leaders, again and again, saying that Prabhakarans days are numbered; in three months hence, Prabhakaran would be three metres under the earth and so on.
This type of brave speeches helped boost morale of our armed forces on one hand, and helped the campaign to attract urgently needed new recruits to our armed forces on the other. That way his contribution was immensely valuable for the country at that time.
He was never a racist. A Sinhala Buddhist at heart he always respected all religions and ethnic groups without any difference. We have never seen any occasion, where he has shown, any difference under whatever the circumstances, all were Sri Lankans to him. He was by all means, for a unitary Sri Lanka and valued always the sovereignty of our country. After passing out as a young lawyer, at the party reforms, I was selected as the SLFP organiser for Balapitiya in 1979. Since then, I became fairly close to this gentleman, who was the General Secretary of the party. We continued our friendship for the last nearly 40 years.
In the early 80's, may be at least once a week, we used to meet and discuss political matters at Rathna Deshapriya Senanayakes residence at Castle Street, Borella, with Dharmasiri Senanayake, Lakshman Jayakody, Senerath Somarathna, Harischandra Mendis, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Vijaya Kumarathunga etc.
All sorts of arguments regarding various subjects were discussed with their deep knowledge on men and matters, where we were lucky to enrich our political knowledge with Wickramanayakas great contributions especially to me as I was the youngest in that circle. Around 1995 when I was the District Judge of Hambantota, one morning he rang me, to say that he was coming there. He said he will not visit me and even for a cup of tea. To that extent, he was conscious and concerned about the members of the judiciary.
During the 2010 Presidential Election campaign, I accompanied him to many a meeting, in different parts of the country by helicopter. I traveled with him throughout Kalutara district, during the general election by car. Once, after a grand meeting to felicitate him, for completing 50 years in politics in 2010, in Horana, we were to go to a well-wisher's house for lunch. After the event, though we were seated together, he went to the car and left. I continued to be seated at the same place at the venue, though I knew, we were to go for lunch together with him.
A little later, he had remembered me and the car immediately returned. While proceeding, he inquired as to why I did not join him. I said: You didnt invite me. He apologised for the lapse on his part. He was such a humble and genuine gentleman with noble qualities.
He cared very little for money and during election times, he sold a few acres of his ancestral land for the campaign. He never uttered a word about his loss. He had boundless enthusiasm, and worked with resolution, to overcome even so called impossibilities. He had been a man, who had honour, and one would not lie. He believed in persistence and determination as the most important factors to make this place we live in a better one.
Although he appeared rough and ruthless, and a vociferous speaker inspiring the supporters, he was merciful, gentle, gracious, kind and humane, compassionate and tender hearted.
All his good qualities and trustworthiness, helped him to be the Prime Minister under former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and also equally, under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He was also the Senior Advisor to President Maithripala Sirisena.

Christopher Gregory Weeramantry
He made his name, and that of Sri Lanka echo worldwide
Each and every nation treasures a selected band of very special sons and daughters; the eminently gifted ones in any given domain of human endeavour. Christopher Gregory Weeramantry will go into history as such a son to Sri Lanka. He will also keep a special place in the hearts of many of his fellow-countrymen.
The surname Weeramantry is spoken of with respect throughout the country: Christophers father Gregory and his elder brother Lucian earned their spurs in national history. But Christopher was to reach well beyond the national compound. He made his name, nd that of his beloved Sri Lanka echo worldwide.
None perhaps of the eminent legal and social minds Sri Lanka gave birth to ever exerted such an impact on global thought as did The Judge, as he was lovingly called. For there was a personal element to it as well. By virtue of his gentle, mild personality, his irresistible charm - topped by that enchanting smile  Christopher Weeramantry, with enviable ease, laced together strings of friends and admirers worldwide.
Christopher Weeramantry was gifted with a rare legal and philosophical genius, a photographic memory, an astoundable energy and a formidable drive and will-power. For all of this, he will be remembered first and foremost for his courageous stand on principle when it counted most, when he was faced with one of the greatest challenges met in the history of the Bench which he served with such pride and honour: the International Court of Justice in The Hague (1991-2000). His valiant defence, in the trenches of the law, of the unconditional ban on Nuclear Weapons will be remembered as the zenith of his moral endeavours.
Some people manage to rise to the occasion: with Christopher Weeramantry one felt he was hand-picked and groomed all his life to serve the world. Rarely, even in the impressive, century-old records of the highest judicial authority the modern world boasts as the outcome of a chequered process and at the end of a long and winding road, will one find a Judge whose in-depth humanity, truly universal outlook and inter-cultural learning shone so eminently and persuasively.
His stand in The Hague did not come by incident, though. At various critical moments in his long career Weeramantry spoke up on principle on acute political and ethical issues, be this in an academic capacity or in his position as a Judge of the Supreme Court in Colombo.
His stand against Apartheid in the final stages of the regime exemplifies the numerous ethical issues of compelling urgency that found lucid, and fundamental, treatment in Weeramantrys publications.
We were honoured to edit a Congratulatory Volume to celebrate the 90th birthday of Judge Weeramantry, on November 17, 2016. The volume is titled One World, One Home, One Law For All, A Tribute to Christopher Gregory Weeramantry, and will appear shortly. In the publication some 60 colleagues, pupils and friends from a range of disciplines amply review the width and wealth of Weeramantrys multi-faceted career. They address his seminal tenets on such varying issues as Humanitarian Law; Sustainable Development and the Right of Future Generations; Trusteeship; Equality & Freedom; Science & Ethics; Xenotransplantation; Law & Equity; Judicial Integrity and Law & Religion.
The rich harvest of his numerous Opinions and publications marks Christopher Weeramantry as one of the most intriguing legal thinkers of the 20th Century. Paramount in this philosophy are his unfailing belief in the global perspective and in the fundamental equality of all human beings, next to his reliance on the capacity of Man to overcome the unsettling challenges the world faces today. And something else is noteworthy. In perceiving the role of the Law and the Judiciary Weeramantry insists on the quintessential unity of the Law; on the imperative of its interaction with Society; on normative moral values and such concepts as Justice and Equity; last, but not least, on the pertinence of the worlds rich cultural and religious traditions - the reflection of humanitys accumulated experience and wisdom - as sources of inspiration to draw up the Universal Law of the Future.
And this brings us back to Sri Lanka. No Judge in the history of the World Court was so adamant on revitalising the interaction of Law and Religion. It was a tantalising quest Judge Weeramantry embarked on, not just in view of the prevailing Western legal tradition of four centuries, but no less on account of current clashes and skirmishes.
Still, there is no coincidence here. Not just his Opinions in The Hague, but numerous books and publications, even his poetry, reveal Weeramantrys penetrating thought on the views conceived in Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam with respect to the Judiciary. To that extent he proudly presented himself as the product of that multi-cultural and pluriform religious tradition of his home country.
But it likewise revealed the heartache he felt witnessing the troubled times his country had been through. There is a wealth - not just of learning and knowledge but, what counts most in the final analysis, of Wisdom and Humanity in the tracts and treatises the Judge leaves his fellow-countrymen of all denominations. And this is the rich legacy he presents on a silver platter to his country in recognition of the debt he always felt he owed his Island of Serendipity.

Princie Perera
I will never forget her
Mihindukulasuriya Mary Annie Perera was born in Chilaw on January 25, 1921. She was well known as Princie. She was the only daughter of Peter Perera who was an Interpreter Mudliyar at the Chilaw Courts and Agnus Perera who was a housewife.
She had three elder brothers named Flemmin, Dudley and Lawrence. She lived at Princie Villa, No 53, Alluthwatte Road,Chilaw.
She had her school education at St Marys Convent, Chilaw and was a very smart and intelligent student. She was good in almost all the subjects and always wanted to become a nurse. Though she was very keen on higher education she had to stop her studies as her mother was sick. She married her life partner D.P. Perera (D P master) from Chilaw and had three children Dunston, Siyani (my mother) and Sharmaline.
I was very lucky as my childhood was strongly influenced by my grandmother. As my mother was reluctant to enter hospital for confinement when I was to be born, my grandmother had to arrange a room in her house with all facilities including a midwife and a doctor. I was born at Princie Villa on a sunny morning in March and the first to see me in this world was my grandmother.
As I was born as the first grandchild to the Perera family, she was very thrilled with my arrival. She once told me it was the happiest day in her life. She had performed the Sinhala tradition ritual Ran Kiri Kata Gema amidst all the relatives on my christening day.
She used her wedding ring with my mothers breast milk. My mother told me that my grandmother used to lullaby me singing Indrani Pereras Dilhani Duwani.
The second chapter began when my sister was born and my grandmother decided to look after me as my mother was struggling with two little children. I moved to Chilaw again as a two-year-old. She looked after me very well. We slept on the same bed and she always made sure that my nose touched her lower part of the neck. Once I asked her why she always wanted me to sleep in that posture (as I felt uncomfortable) and she said she needed to feel my breath and make sure that I was living. I was with my grandmother, grandfather and aunt for five years till I moved to Colombo to join my parents as I had to start schooling at Holy Family Convent, Bampalapitiya.
She was a very clever and famous in Chilaw. She used to help people whenever they needed. I can remember people borrowing her jewellery for functions and weddings. She was very good in cooking and sewing. She used to stitch all her grandchildrens clothes including uniforms, petticoats and undergarments.
For our birthdays, Christmas, functions and weddings she used to stitch clothes. I can remember for my concert at the nursery, she did all the outfits including the headdress to be worn as an animal. She made me a Teddy Bear out of old socks for the performance with a teddy bear.
All these were done with her inbuilt cleverness and artistic ideas. There was no access to internet to get ideas in the early 70s. No ready made costumes or outfits were available as now. She annually organised a pilgrimage to Madu church. She saved money from September to July every year and spent on the annual pilgrimage in August. She used to come from Chilaw to the Maradana railway station with my grandfather and domestic aid and our family joined them there.
We used to travel in the night mail train which started in the late evening from Maradana railway station. Dinner was roast beef, butter and bread every year. A cup of ginger tea was given after dinner. We slept till the train reached the Madu Road station. A hopper treat was given at the Madu Road station for breakfast by my grandmother. These hoppers were made by old women who ran small boutiques in cadjan huts near the station. We used to stay there for seven days and she was the one who organised menus for all the meals for all seven days. She used to arrange five dresses from five different coloured materials stitched by her for my sister and me to dress for evening novenas.
She always preferred to dress siblings in same manner which she had done for my mother and her sister when they were young,and for me and my sister when we were young. I have the same habit now when I choose frocks for my two daughters. I can remember how she dealt with the labourers to get the tent or the house in order. Till 1982 we enjoyed the annual pilgrimage to Madu church organised by her, which stopped due to the war. She was fluent in all three languages Sinhala, English and Tamil. She could deal with Indian labourers and vendors well, as she knew their language.
Her maternal great grandfather was an ayurvedic doctor and she inherited all his medical books. She used to prepare one of his medicines used for tetanus. I can remember people tapping at the gate calling Princie Nona. Those were her customers to buy Gammiris Kude Behetha (Pepper powder medicine). Fishermen especially took it as a first aid when they went out to the rough sea to have it as precautionary measure for them for tetanus caused by cuts and injuries from nails etc in the boats.
She was very good in treating the sick. I hardly remember going to the doctors during the five years I lived with her. She used to treat me with her own medicine and first aid.
She had a habit of taking me to the studio on my birthday to get a photograph with the birthday cake. One year she could not organise a cake and she took a cardboard box, glued an embroidery lace around it and made the cardboard box look like an icing cake. The black and white photograph looked perfect. Till I was 16 years, she forced me and dragged me to the studio for the so called Birthday photograph, but ended on my 16th birthday as the cameraman asked whether we came for the ID or Passport photo. On that day she felt after the 16th birthday, photographs were not necessary. I have all 16 birthday photographs with me.
She used to come with my mother to see me when I was at the University. I can remember how she used to joke with my batch mates, especially the boys. She was very proud of me as I was the first to enter university out of her children and grandchildren. The last chapter of her life was spent with my parents, her grandchildren and great grandchildren. She was sick at the age of 80 and passed away on March 12, 2001.Eternal rest to you Mamma.

Sirisena Koralearachchi
A father like no other
My father Sirisena Koralearachchi was a senior graduate teacher of Royal College, Colombo. He was born on January 21, 1942 in Yatigala, Veerakatiya Gamsaba, North of Giruwapaththuwa in the Hambantota district.
This village consisted of natural resources and wild-life. The surrounding forests, were nourished by inter-monsoonal rains. Most villagers led a simple and charming life, and my fathers father was a farmer.
In my fathers village there were no government or private schools, established at that time. My paternal grand-father, Wilbert Koralearachchi manged to build a primary school with support from the village temple head and several villagers. The name of the school was Tharaperiya Primary School, which still exists today. My father was incidentally the first student. My father, by his sheer dedication and commitment became the first proud graduate from the Beliatta electorate.
After graduating from Kelaniya Vidyalankara University, his first appointment was Sariputhra Maha Vidayalaya Matara in 1970.
He always loved to create and write Sinhala literature poems, and produce stage dramas. His talent was visible through the production of a spate of national stage dramas, which had the distinction of winning junior competition and senior competitions in 1973 and 1980.
During his tenure at Matara Denagam MahaVidyalaya, he produced and directed the stage drama Kalahoda Passen for the island-wide national competition, securing second place in 1973, in the junior category.
When teaching at Kelaniya Nagasena Vidyalaya, he produced and directed the stage drama Ran Polawata Ran Dahadiya, which competed nationally in the senior category. He won first place, bringing recognition to his school, which as a result gained recognition.
He took over the responsibilities to teach Sinhala and Social Studies to Ordinary Level students as a graduate teacher at Royal College in 1984, and went on to serve for two decades, until his retirement.
He was also instrumental in establishing a senior Sinhala Literature Club to initiate cultural activities to Royal College, and promote arts to a high level. Through his guidance for the first time in Royal College performed a Sinhala stage drama, titled, Nomal Puthutu Aluth Lowak. This drama was performed at the opening ceremony of Rajasisu Gama house scheme project at Ratnapura in 1986. This stage drama produced and directed by my father, was appreciated by the chief guest, then President Ranasinghe Premdasa.
I would like to give due respect to my father as the initiator who established the Art stream for Advanced Level students at Royal College. He did all these not for his own benefit but for the future of my alma mater, and the country.
He did not want titles or laurels. This was evident when he nominated two teachers from his own staff to hand over the responsibilities of the Sinhala Arts section. He however took pride in overlooking the programmes and made sure of its success. My father married Nanda Koralerarachchi in 1972. She was also a graduate teacher and shared a passion for teaching. My father met my mother when they were teaching at Denagama Maha Vidayalaya in Matara. During his retired life he did not waste time for unnecessarily. He used his time reading till midnight and wrote poems during the day. He also had a penchant for astrology and served more than a decade as an astrologer. He always lived true to his philosophy. He was always patient regarding any problem. I learnt a lot from his retired life, and how looked at problems in a very wise way. He was extremely patriotic and concerned about national problems. We discussed many times how we could make a positive contribution to solve these at a civic level.After fighting health issues he died on October 10, 2016. According to his last wish, his remains were gifted to the Colombo Medical Faculty on October 12, 2016.
May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana.

Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 1.21% W-o-W (or LKR 33.16Bn) to LKR 2,712.25Bn cf. LKR 2,745.41Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 71.40% (or LKR 1.91Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 97.61% of the sectors total turnover.
The Manufacturing Sector meanwhile accounted for 7.68% (or LKR 0.21Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily Chevron and Teejay Lanka which accounted for 57.90% sector turnover.

In terms of volume, Access Engineering & Singer Sri Lanka led foreign purchases while John Keells & Renuka Agri led foreign sales. In terms of value, Singer Sri Lanka & Hemas Holdings led foreign purchases while JKH & Chevron led foreign sales.
Point of view
Share markets fell ~75 points during the first week of 2017, as last months gloomy sentiment continued to predominate yet again this week.
The ~70 point drop on Monday and Tuesday dragged the ASPI down to a ~ 9 month low with foreign selling (particularly in Index-heavy-weight JKH) adding to the overall dull sentiment.
Turnover however, was supported by bargain-hunting on selected counters with active participation by HNIs and Institutional investors in key counters such as JKH (~87% of the total crossings), Chevron & Singer Sri Lanka helping account for ~52% of the total turnover.
Higher HNI and Institutional activity helped daily average turnover surpass LKR 0.50Bn (cf. 0.26Bn without crossings).
The daily average turnover level in the 1st week of trading in 2017 was consequently LKR 0.54Bn, although 26.54% lower than 2016s full year daily average of LKR 0.73Bn and ~49.41% lower than full year daily average of LKR1.06Bn in 2015.
Foreign flows into the Bourse meanwhile, turned negative for the first time after a month of consecutive of inflows, with foreign selling in Blue-chips resulting in a net outflow of foreign funds of ~ LKR 1.0Bn (cf. net inflows of LKR 11.98Mn last week and inflows of LKR 3.20Bn over December).
Muted activity is likely to persist in the holiday shortened week ahead as investors (particularly retailers) remain on the sidelines.
In its Road Map for 2017, the Central Bank (CB) highlighted that improving macro-fundamentals indicate that economic stability is broadly on track and reiterated its commitment to ensure stable economic conditions on a sustainable basis.
The Monetary Authority noted that although some of its policies may be perceived as painful in the short run, they are intended to strengthen the medium-term stability of the economy.
The CB added that while the GoSL is in the process of addressing deficiencies in budgetary operations via a new fiscal framework, the CB would complement these efforts through its transition towards a flexible inflation targeting framework and new framework for FX management to establish a market- based exchange rate system.
The CBSL also elaborated on some key changes to its monetary policy formulation process, including the reduction of Monetary Policy Committee meetings to 8 meetings per annum (cf. current 12) and the reintroduction of a Monetary Policy Consultative Committee comprising academics and professionals.
The CBSL also highlighted its intentions to streamline and strengthen its regulatory and supervisory framework via amendments to the Banking Act.
The Monetary Authority added meanwhile, that while inflation is expected to remain at mid-single digits (ie: 4-6%) over the medium-term, consistent with the inflation target bands stipulated under the EFF arrangement with the IMF, expected changes to tax structures along with weather-related supply shortages and possible global oil price shocks could cause temporary variations in price levels.

Audit Bill before House soon: Speaker
The Audit Bill will be presented to Parliament soon, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker said this legislation would help enhance Parliaments control over state finances, while creating the environment necessary for State Audit officials to work resolutely for the country.
He made these comments addressing the Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Audit Service Association at New Town Hall in Colombo.
The Speaker pointed out the improved space for the public to question the State finance management is a healthy sign of democracy.
He observed the service of Audit officials is a must to make the work of Committees on Public Enterprises and Public Accounts a success.
Sometime back, it was revealed through a movement called Clean Hand spearheaded by a team of senior state officials, that 40 percent of the public money is wasted or misused when utilised for public work. I believe we can arrest this unfortunate situation as the end result of successfully implementing the Audit Act, Right to Information Act and independent commissions, he said.
Addressing the event, COPA Chairman Lasantha Alagiyawanna said unlike before Parliament now takes Audit reports seriously and goes through every page with utmost attention. He reminded there was a time these reports were blatantly disregarded.
COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti stressed the Audit Bill should be passed through Parliament before the end of this year.
If not, what we were all doing today to arrest corruption and bribery will be in vain, he said.
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe also participated.

Best and most efficient will be selected this year: Mahinda Amaraweera
New Year 2017 will be special for the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry as it will hold a competition this year to select the best and most efficient officer. The winner may be an officer or an ordinary employee. He or she will be feted and rewarded, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a meeting at the Ministry on January 2 to commence work for the new year. The New Year programme began with every one taking the oath of dedication to their duties.
The ministry belongs to the fishery community rather than to ministry officials. The existence of the ministry depends on the fishery community who visit it seeking its services, the minister said.
The minister said he witnessed four categories of office workers. One group attend office early and left office late after performing extra duties. Another group come late and spend time criticising and obstructing others work. Another group arrived and left office in time rendering an honest work. A fourth group not only neglect their duties but also try to sabotage others' duties. It was therefore up to the ministry staff themselves to decide the category they are in. The minister said he knew certain staff members who sleep resting their heads on tables. Others waste time on Face Book page. Book reading could be permitted during spare time provided the books read were good. He said he made these comments not to run them down but to steer them on the right path.
The minister said public servants who abide by rules and regulations and render a proper service could work for the entire duration of their service period and retire happily. But the date the politicians should retire was decided by the people. Politicians had to retire on the day they were rejected by the people.

Bonds across borders
A policy of closer integration with the world
After the near isolationist policies on foreign relations followed by the previous government, Sri Lanka continues to make progress in Foreign Affairs with the strengthening of relations with the world, and international organizations that are most relevant to the development strategies of the Government.
The presence of President Maithripala Sirisena in several countries from East Asia to the West, and neighbouring India, too, showed the interest that Sri Lanka has in building new relations with the international community, as well as strengthen neighbourly relations, which would help the country in its path to progress in both economic and social development. President Sirisena visited Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Germany, and Austria in the efforts to build new friendly relations, had discussions with national leaders and did sign important agreements of understanding, as well as winning the interests of those countries on investing in Sri Lanka. The relations with India continued at good neighbourly levels, with Sri Lanka displaying a position of friendship and interest in closer cooperation between the two countries, while maintaining the country's good relations with China, too.
He also visited the United Nations for the General Assembly (UNGA) Sessions, in what the important 70th anniversary sessions of the UNGA, and renewed Sri Lanka's commitments to the United Nations on its resolutions on peace and understanding; especially in the context of Sri Lanka moving towards strengthening peace building and reconciliation among its own people.
Sri Lanka was among the countries that endorsed the Climate Change Agreement that was agreed in Paris, the previous year, and made clear the country's commitment on protection of the environment and the use of renewable energy, taking an important place in the South Asian moves to battle Climate Change.
PM's foreign tours
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too made visits to many countries, and had meetings with international organizations with an interest in promoting democracy and the Rule of Law, in keeping with the spirit of the Commonwealth on these issues, and Sri Lanka's own commitment to be a strong democracy in Asia. His visits took note of the necessity of making the best of Sri Lanka's strategic location in the Indian Ocean, and the possibilities this opened for a stronger economy and better understanding with the larger world community, with the importance of the Indian Ocean sea routes in the advance of international trade.
The new trends in international affairs that were emerging in the past year saw the Ministry of Foreign Affairs look at new directions in the country's foreign relations, which saw settling down of good relations with near decade of antagonism with the international community, the United Nations and many UN and other international organizations, under policies of the previous government.
Busy year
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera did have a very busy year with the necessity to renew good relations with the world and also give leadership to the implementing of policies that Sri Lanka had agreed to with UNHCR and other organizations, as the country moved to give meaning to the principle of better relations with the world.
An important aspect of this change of direction in Foreign Affairs was the participation of Minister Samaraweera in the "Our Ocean Conference 2016" held at the US State Department, at the invitation of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The Minister said that Environment was a matter of major importance for Sri Lanka, which would play its part in dealing with issues relating to Climate Change and the Environment in a responsible manner, both locally and in the global context.
2016 saw an unfortunate development in foreign relations in the South Asian region, with the failure to hold the scheduled Summit of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which was due to be held in Pakistan, due to rise in cross-border terror attacks on India, that India saw as having created an environment that is not conducive for the Summit. South Asia saw Pakistan being isolated over the issue, as Bhutan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and the Maldives, decided to keep out of the October 2016 Summit, which resulted in Sri Lanka not participating in what would have been a non-event in international relations.
NAM summit
Sri Lanka did participate in the 17th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) held in Venezuela, which reaffirmed NAM's determination to continue opposing any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity or territorial integrity of a State as well as their commitment for the respect of the sovereignty, the sovereign equality of States, the non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and the abstention from the threat or use of force, in accordance with UN Charter.
Another international event of significance for Sri Lanka in 2016 was the "G7 Outreach Summit", in Japan, where Sri Lanka was a special invitee that saw the participation of President Sirisena. In his address to the Summit the President said that with a revolutionary change of governance, his government has succeeded in creating the path for a viable development environment and for reconciliation in a multifaceted society.
Now, the people are free and human rights are respected. Sounding a most practical note he said that Sri Lanka lacked finances for extensive development efforts and therefore seeks developed nations and multilateral and bi-lateral investors to invest in Sri Lanka.
Thanking Japan for the invitation to Sri Lanka to attend this important Summit, President Sirisena said this invitation would yield real benefits beyond bounds, if serious attention is drawn to our problems Sri Lanka faced.
Sri Lanka moves to 2017 with much expectation of even better relations with the world as it seeks to fashion its foreign policy to the major changes that have taken places in the West, and the rise of new populist political trends in both the US and Europe, that are key international investors; and also looking at the relations with South and East strengthened, as the world possibly enters a new phase of closer trade and economic relations among countries, rather than wider international agreements.

CIM Sri Lanka hosts inaugural Principals Forum on The New Age Education
Understanding the pivotal role school Principals play as decision makers in schools, the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Sri Lanka recently hosted its inaugural Principals Forum under the theme The New Age Education in December at the Hilton Colombo Residences.
The forum provided a vibrant platform for Principals from leading National, International and Private Schools in Sri Lanka to congregate and share their experiences, ideas and gain positive insights on a wide range of topics related to school education.
The esteemed gathering was addressed by leading distinguished speakers associated with cutting-edge educational perspectives.
The speakers enlightened the participants on several timely topics with the importance of being responsive to the enormous challenges faced by schools due to an increasingly complex society and a rapidly changing technology-based education system.
The discussions also focused on child and adolescent development and how to support growth in various domains including the cognitive, social, physical, and emotional.
Dr. Udena Attygala, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, Galle responded to questions put forward by participating Principals on the topic of Emotional intelligence and the role it plays in the various stages of a childs development processes.
He said, There are various means of development - cognitive and physical development, and social development. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand emotions and regulate those emotions and express them in a productive way, to be able to handle emotions.
Children and sometimes even adults also struggle with emotions. In emotional intelligence there is a component of being able to adapt, use their emotions so they can create a positive outcome.
Elaborating from a corporate perspective, Damitha Dharmasena, Group Director HR, MAS Active noted the importance of preparing students for the future. He urged participants to inculcate a work ethos in students.
What students go through during their younger days has a lasting influence as they enter into adult life, in terms of how they think, behave and their emotions.
Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, Director and the Chairman of the Board of Management of the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka addressed the participants on the components of leadership.
He said, A Leader has to be a servant; leadership is an opportunity to serve. Leadership is nothing to do with going on others shoulders, it is to do with carrying others on your shoulders.
Elaborating on other significant traits of a leader he noted, You need to be a collective decision maker, participate with problem solving.
Its all about character and how you get connected to others through your emotional caring nature and about being logical and analytical, ability in being focused and taking action.
Commenting on the initiative, Onalie Dissanayake, Educational Services Manager, CIM Sri Lanka stated that,its an opportune moment to discusstopics of this nature as it could help the primary decision makers in schools to adapt to the trends in new age education. We hope to continue this initiative and constantly support schools in fulfilling the educational aspirations of the society.

It is disheartening to find that education in Sri Lanka has mostly turned out to be a private enterprise in spite of free education introduced by late C.W.W. Kannangra. Both the poor and rich people used to enjoy the free education in government schools for quite a long time. So, it was a blessing for Sri Lankan children in educational field. Since education was freely available to all from primary level to University level, there has been a tremendous development among the less privileged people of the country.
But, the new trend in privatisation of both academic and technological education has created a lot of problems among the poor section of the people. Because of fashion for foreign imported high rated courses, the affluent parents admit their children to international private schools are pursuing such attractive courses without basic education.
As a consequence the less income earners too try to admit their children to the money motive private educational enterprises by getting loans on payment of interest. What I would like to stress is that the Government should restore the period of Kannangaras free education system in the present Yahapalanaya introduced by President and the Prime Minister as soon as possible.
The educational planners should embark on implementation of a uniform system of education where every one must enjoy free education with free books and free uniforms. Then only the real objectives of education will be fulfilled in our democratic country. Education for all without discrimination must be available in our country.

One fifty stall owners at the Dambulla Economic Centre had been ordered to hand back their stalls within 24 hours by the Dambulla Divisional Secretary Lakshmi Hewapathirana since they had not paid due rent as per the lease agreement. The Economic Centre Manager said the stall owners owed the government nearly Rs. 30 million as rentals.
He said eviction notices have already been sent to the traders.
Some traders, however, said they did not receive the eviction orders.
Traders' Association President U.R. Daya Nandasiri said the management increased the rentals without prior notice and the traders had opposed the move in writing.
They withheld payments until they received a response to their petition from the management.
But the management had issued the order without responding to their appeal. Officers at the centre seemed to be defying even court orders, they said.
The Traders Union said this may be a conspiracy by the officials to inconvenience the government.

Dimitrov stuns Nishikori to win Brisbane final
Brisbane: Bulgarias Grigor Dimitrov won his first title in over two years when he upset world number five Kei Nishikori in three sets to win the Brisbane International on Sunday.
In an enthralling final between two evenly matched opponents, Dimitrov claimed the Roy Emerson Trophy 6-2, 2-6, 6-3, his fourth singles title on the ATP Tour.
Dimitrov was ranked as high as eighth in the world in 2014 and was nicknamed Baby Fed because of his similar playing style to Swiss great Roger Federer.
Injury problems and poor form saw him slump during 2015 and the first half of 2016, when he plummeted to 40th in the world. But he recovered towards the end of last year and entered the season-opening tournament ranked 17.
The Brisbane win will see him climb to 15 when the rankings are released Monday.
Dimitrov insisted he had not felt under pressure because of his rankings slide and said he knew he would eventually get the rewards for the hard work he was doing off court.
I think that was kind of an emotional win for me, but at the same time, it wasnt unexpected, he said.
I think I have put in the work. I think I have learnt a lot.
I have set myself quite high goals for the first six months, and one of them was actually to win a tournament, he added.
And it happened during the first week of the year.
The 25-year-old revealed later he had relaxed ahead of his matches with late-night visits to a Brisbane video game arcade.
Since I have been here, every night Ive been going to the arcades for an hour and a half, he laughed.
Its given me tremendous joy. You know, its something so childish (but) every time I was going to bed, I was, like, Wow, that feels so good. Its just something so small.
Despite Dimitrovs win over top seed Milos Raonic in the semi-finals, the 27-year-old Nishikori had not lost to the Bulgarian in three previous meetings and went into the final as firm favourite.
The Japanese star started well and had Dimitrov struggling to hold his opening service game. But from then on the Bulgarian dominated the first set, breaking Nishikori twice to take the opener in 36 minutes.
Dimitrov took that momentum into the second set and was comfortable on serve. But at 2-2 he faltered and was broken, with Nishikori seizing the initiative and winning four games in succession to level the match. AFP

Djokovic in epic win over Murray in Doha final
DOHA, Saturday: Novak Djokovic made an immense statement in his bid to rule men's tennis again when he defeated Andy Murray, the man who deposed him as world number one, 6-3 5-7 6-4 in an epic Qatar Open final in Doha on Saturday.
Looking back to near his peerless best at times in a game of searing quality, the Serbian missed out on three match points and had to repel a roaring Murray comeback before ending the Briton's 28-match, five-tournament winning streak.
In their first meeting since Murray won their season-ending climax at the ATP World Tour finals, the Briton ran into a rejuvenated Djokovic who, despite having problems with his racket hand and receiving two warnings for his behaviour, prevailed thrillingly in their 36th contest.
The world number two said it was the dream start to 2017 in his build-up to the defence of the Australian Open title later this month and defeat provided food for thought for Murray, who lost for the 25th time against his old rival. It was close, a very physical battle. All the way to the last shot, you never know with Andy. It's no strange occurrence for us to play three sets for three hours, Djokovic told Eurosport.
It means a lot. For the last three months of 2016, I haven't felt that confident on court and didn't play that consistent. But to start 2017 with a win over the world number one and my biggest rival was a dream start so I'm hoping I can get the best out of it.
Djokovic had looked out of sorts as he struggled to tame Spaniard Fernando Verdasco in Friday's semi-final and he started inconsistently again, also requiring treatment to a bleeding right thumb in the third game.
Yet Djokovic began playing with an authority that he had not displayed all week and was so frustrated after losing one 29-shot rally that he was warned for hitting the ball away petulantly towards his box.
Still, he pressurised Murray, making his breakthrough in the eighth game as the Scot surrendered the crucial break with a mis-hit forehand.

Don't fall to drug mafia net, Rajitha tells doctors
Doctors should not take money from the drug mafia which is not suitable for their professional ethics, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Dr. Senaratne said only one doctor attached to Maharagama Cancer Hospital is not using the cancer drug imported from Russia, while all other doctors use it without any problem.
"Doctors cannot reject drugs given to patients through free health service," he said at a ceremony at the Beruwala Divisional Secretariat recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the drugs used before introducing the Russian made drug, cost Rs. 280,000 and the drug imported from Russia cost only Rs. 130,000.
"The drug was imported after analyzing their quality by qualified pharmacologists. Two more cancer drugs are to be imported from India," he said.
Doctors cannot reject drugs imported by the government because they take money from the drug mafia. The CID is conducting an investigation in connection with 14 doctors from the Maharagama Cancer Hospital going to Denmark together using money obtained from a drug company, the minister said.

Extraordinarily committed
The International Society of Nephrology (ISN) lauded President Maithripala Sirisena for his firm commitment and devotion to ridding Sri Lanka of kidney disease by presenting him with an award at the Galle Face Hotel on December 19.
Professor Adeera Levin, President of the ISN, presented President Sirisena with the 2016 Extraordinary Contributions to Kidney Health award in acknowledgment of his work to prevent chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu).
"This is an amazing honor to present Your Excellency with. This is the first time the ISN has in fact given this award for extraordinary contributions to people living with kidney disease," said Levin.
The event also marked the inauguration of the International Society of Nephrology-Gardiner CKDu fund, named in honor of Sanjeev Gardiner, the Presidential Ambassador for the Prevention of Kidney Disease.
The President, for his part, communicated his gratitude to the ISN on behalf of the Sri Lankan public, saying that credit for the successes against kidney disease are due not only to him, but also myriad people and institutions that worked together.
"The positive outcomes we have so far achieved are not only from my work, but also the work of countless individuals and organizations. Together, we are working to make Sri Lanka free from chronic kidney disease," he said.
There is no doubt that the President's contributions to battling CKDu are laudable and wide-ranging, but Sri Lanka must jump many hurdles so that the disease affects the fewest citizens possible.
CKDu is a somewhat mysterious disease, as its causes remain undiscovered.
There is, however, a strong prevalence of CKDu in populations that perform farm work; 61% of those suffering from CKDu in Sri Lanka are agricultural laborers, the lion's share of whom are low-income and do not have consistent access to clean drinking water.
Furthermore, the disease is most widespread in Sri Lanka's dry zones. It has been identified in eleven districts, and is most concentrated in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts. Cases have been reported in about 60 divisional secretariats.
There are reportedly almost 21,000 patients currently suffering from CKDu in the most affected areas, according to the Ministry of Health. Patients generally suffer from nausea, anemia, and fatigue, and those who do not get treatment can experience kidney failure.
President Sirisena, well aware of the seriousness of the disease, formed the Presidential Task Force for Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention (PTF), that spreads information on how to prevent the disease and provides care for those afflicted with CKDu. Furthermore, the PTF works to coordinate information sharing between patients, doctors, and organizations that can lend help. The body is also responsible for compiling the National Policy and Plan (NPP) for the prevention of CKDu, a plan that the President hopes will prove exceptionally effective in combating the disease.
The NPP has already been enacted, and it helps to coordinate communication between the government and NGOs. Though it is called the National Policy and Plan, it will be enacted all the way from the national to the village level.
It was because of the inauguration of the NPP that the ISN decided to felicitate the President.
"The national-level program has been commenced and launched in a very short period of time, harnessing the energy and passion of not just doctors and nurses and researchers, but government officials as well as government ministries," Levin said.
"For this, we can all thank you tremendously. It's the only national policy or program, to my knowledge, that's ever been launched, and I think for that Sri Lanka needs to be commemorated and celebrated," she continued.
President Sirisena, despite receiving the prestigious award, vowed not to stop aiding the poor in their fight against CKDu.
"We, as a country, have to look into the lives of poor populations in our country. We have to look at their personal lives and help them. I am pleased to see the haves helping the have-nots in our country, but we must do more to guarantee the welfare of poor communities," he said.
"Only with more cooperation and by working together can we reduce this burden on our people and eradicate this disease. We can have a good day when 100% of CKDu patients are cured. We will face, meet, and then conquer this challenge," he added.

Florida shooting suspect faces possible death penalty
US: US authorities on Saturday charged the Iraq war veteran accused in a deadly shooting rampage at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport with offenses that could carry the death penalty, while continuing to probe whether terrorism was a potential motive.
Esteban Santiago, 26, was accused of killing five, wounding six and sending thousands scrambling for safety on Friday before authorities shut down the airport in Florida, a major gateway to the Caribbean and Latin America.
Federal prosecutors charged Santiago with firearms offenses and carrying out an act of violence at an airport, US Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said in a statement. If convicted, he could face the death penalty or life in prison.
The suspect was scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Monday.
Murder charges could be forthcoming from state prosecutors, but no decision has been made yet, a spokesman for Broward County State Attorney Mike Satz told the local Sun Sentinel newspaper.
Santiago had traveled from Alaska to Fort Lauderdale on Friday. After retrieving a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun and ammunition that he had declared and stowed inside his checked luggage, he allegedly loaded the weapon in a bathroom and opened fire in the crowded baggage claim area of Terminal 2.
Santiago started shooting, aiming at his victims heads until he was out of ammunition, Ferrer said.
FBI special agent George Piro said law enforcement was continuing to investigate motives for the attack, including continuing to look at the terrorism angle.
Piro said the suspect appeared to be acting alone and that every indication is that he did follow (Transportation Security Administration) procedures in flying with the weapon.
The gunman was detained without law enforcement having to fire any shots, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said.
A former member of the Puerto Rico and Alaska National Guard, Santiago served in Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011. He ended his service in August.
An aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, told the NorthJersey.com news site that Santiago became a father to a baby boy in September -- and that he was having mental problems. Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind, Ruiz said. He said he saw things.
On November 7, Santiago walked into the FBIs Anchorage office and complained that his mind was being controlled by national intelligence agencies, which were forcing him to watch Islamic State jihadist videos, authorities said.
The erratic behavior led agents to contact local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental health evaluation, Piro said. He was not placed on a no-fly list. Anchorage police chief Christopher Tolley said Santiago came to the FBI office with a loaded magazine, but left his gun and newborn child in his car.
Santiagos weapon was taken by police for safekeeping at the time, and he was able to reclaim it on December 8.
Tolley said it was not known whether it was the same gun used in the rampage in Fort Lauderdale.
Santiagos brother, Bryan, criticized the way authorities handled his case.
They had him hospitalized for four days and they let him go. How are you going to let someone leave a psychological center after four days when he said he hears voices that the CIA is telling him to join certain groups Bryan Santiago told CNN, in a Spanish-language interview the network translated into English. Not everyone has the same reaction when they return from war. Some are better, and some, not so much. Authorities have not identified any victims, but three named in media reports were all getting ready to set off on cruises. They included 84-year-old grandmother Olga Woltering of Marietta, Georgia, the Sun Sentinel reported.
The British native and her 90-year-old husband were going on a cruise with family to celebrate his birthday.
Olga was so charming, calling everybody Lovey or Love in her unmistakable British accent, the Catholic Church of the Transfiguration, where Woltering was an active member, said on its website. Terry Andres, 62, was going on vacation with his wife of nearly four decades, Ann, the Palm Beach Post reported.
He lived in Virginia Beach, Virginia and worked at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.

LONDON, Saturday - Olivier Giroud's scoring streak continued as he struck late to give Arsenal a 2-1 victory at Championship side Preston North End in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.
Giroud's deflected finish in the 89th minute was rough on Preston who had dominated the opening period after Callum Robinson had given them an early lead.
Arsenal were a different proposition after the break and equalised a minute after the restart when Ramsey fired home from the edge of the area after Alex Iwobi's lay-off.
The hosts looked capable of holding out for a replay but Giroud struck for the fourth match in a row when he capitalised on a clever back heel by Lucas Perez.
Preston were left to rue missed chances before the break, the best of which saw Jordan Hugill somehow fail to connect with a Robinson cross with the goal gaping.
Robinson also had a goal ruled out for an infringement.

Good Governance entrenched
As President Maithripala Sirisena steps into his third year in office, the country is poised to undertake a massive socio-economic development programme titled a three-year programme for sustainable development. The three-years obviously refers to the remainder of the Governments term, but the idea is that these development principles would essentially remain over the next decade at least regardless of political developments.
The complete scrapping of a previous Governments programmes has usually been the practice when a new Government is elected, but the Maithripala Sirisena administration departed from this norm. It did pause a few development programmes for a while to asses their viability and financial background, but by and large many development programmes of the previous administration has been carried over. Unfortunately, the Government was saddled with a few white elephant projects which are also being reinvigorated.
There were rumblings that the Government had stopped development programmes, but the Government wanted to draw up a more comprehensive plan for development during the last two years. In the meantime, preliminary work on programmes such as the Western Province Megapolis Project took off. This is a massive project the like of which has never before been undertaken in Sri Lanka.
Development projects
Almost at the start of the New Year, President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe together opened several development projects in various parts of the country and the Prime Minister later outlined the Governments economic vision for the next three years. This is a major challenge, given the economic downturn in most parts of the world, which does have an effect on Sri Lanka. But with the right mindset and hard work, Sri Lanka should be able to reach its goal of becoming a financial and economic hub that straddles regional powerhouses Dubai and Singapore, both of which are just four hours away from Sri Lanka by air.
This is the vision behind the two plans and documents unveiled last week - the three year sustainable development programme and Sri Lanka towards powerhouse status which outline the Governments vision for economic prosperity and South Asian hub status. From the Hambantota Port to the Colombo International Financial City (Port City), Sri Lanka will have the infrastructure facilities necessary to become a financial hub for the region.
Investors will get a better deal under such a set-up. There will be new infrastructure links such as a Light Rail Transit (LRT), Bus Rapid Transit, new flyovers and expressways, electric railways, railway line extensions and best of all, virtually a brand new airport by 2020. First impressions of visitors to Sri Lanka do count, and it is important to have a state-of-the-art airport.
Sole runway at BIA
The overlay of the sole runway at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) which began last week will be the start of a massive US$ 400 million expansion project at the BIA implemented in partnership with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). It will include a new international terminal capable of handling the double-deck Airbus A380 plus a new domestic terminal. It will be one of the most eco-friendly airports in the world when completed. Domestic airports islandwide will be upgraded in line with this development and there will be a bigger role for Mattala.
We cannot live in isolation in a globalised economy. Just as physical links to other countries via ports and airports are essential, diplomatic links are even more crucial. Ending Sri Lankas isolation in the international community was one the major victories of the Maithripala Sirisena administration. Most Western countries used to shun Sri Lanka, but now they have enhanced their relationship with Sri Lanka. International relations are vital for our trade and development prospects.
Sri Lanka will soon have a number of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with several countries including China. Trade links with India will be strengthened under the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement. As Sri Lanka has become a Middle Income country, OECD aid (in the form of outright grants) is generally on the decline. Thus trade has become a vital lifeline. The twin ports at Colombo and Hambantota will assume greater significance as Sri Lanka seeks to ramp up its exports over the next three years.
Enhanced relations with the EU
The restoration of fish exports to the EU and the imminent restoration of the GSP Plus facility of the EU will be an impetus to our exports. This was made possible by the Governments enhanced relations with the EU which soured over human rights concerns earlier. Human rights are now a universal concern. This is indeed the logic behind the UNs Universal Periodic Review (UPR) where other countries raise concerns over a given countrys HR record.
Sri Lanka experienced a hostile situation at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) during the previous regime over alleged human rights abuses and accountability issues following the end of the conflict.
It did appoint a Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) which submitted a string of recommendations to achieve reconciliation. It was left to this Government to actually implement most of these recommendations. Instead of being hostile towards foreign Governments and individual officials, the Government has opted for constructive engagement with the international community. It is working towards a domestic accountability mechanism that will address certain issues raised by the global community.
Priority to reconciliation
The Government has given the highest priority to reconciliation and the creation of a truly Sri Lankan identity. In addition to various exercises already underway - from small gestures such as singing the National Anthem in Tamil to bigger ones such as handing over lands to displaced persons, the Government has also made it a point to make reconciliation and national unity the pivot of the proposed new Constitution which is in the process of being formulated.
If, at least by 2020 we can all proudly call ourselves Sri Lankan instead of identifying ourselves by community (Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher) as we usually do, these efforts will not be in vain. People expected a change for the better when they voted on January 8, 2015 and this will by far be the biggest change in our contemporary history.

Govt to launch electricity demand-side management programmes to save around US $ 500 m
The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry is set to save revenue equal to construction cost of a 500 Megawatt power plant through an energy efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) programme, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said so after opening a new office for energy demand management in Colombo.
The office was opened with the Sri Lanka Sunithya Energy Authority.
Siyambalapitiya said the implementation of envisioned energy efficiency and DSM proponents are expected to cut down the mammoth expenditure going to fossil-fuel-powered electricity generation in the country.
The savings, the minister said, his ministry is going to make via DSM programmes is close to US $ 500 million when one considers the costs involved in setting up a 500 Megawatt coal based power plant, as pointed out by an official of the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said they are faced with a challenge to meet the increasing demand for electricity in 2017 because of adverse weather impacts hydroelectric reservoirs has had during last year.
He said three Cabinet papers are at the ready to be submitted to provide an uninterrupted electricity supply to the public.
In fact we have prepared ourselves over the last two years to address the electricity demand of 2017, which will involve establishment of a Presidential Task Force, he said. "We are going to divide our responsibilities. The Secretary to the President will supervise the energy management programme for successful implementation."

Greater challenges this year in power generation field:  Siyambalapitiya
We may have to face greater challenges in the power generation field this year due to the climatic conditions in the recent past. Therefore, three papers will be submitted to the Cabinet on measures to be taken to overcome those challenges, Power and Renevable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing a meeting after opening a new office for electricity demand management set up in league with the Sustainable Energy Authority at Albert Crescent, Colombo recently.
The minister said his ministry had prepared itself to face a future power crisis almost an year ago by setting a presidential task force headed by the secretary to the President.
Today the cheapest energy in the world was solar energy. We could easily move away from fossil fuel by changing over to power management and depending on solar energy.
He said life was full of challenges. Life would be dull without challenges. He was confident that his ministry could overcome the challenges through consensus, unity and discussion.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera, Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda and several officers participated.

Human Rights and Reconciliation: a reflection on 2016
A reflection on human rights emphasizes that people must be protected when facing sudden and profound reversals in economic and social life. The four basic standards drawn are: Respecting all human rights and fundamental freedom, Nurturing of unity in cultural, religious and ethnic diversity, Realizing social justice by enshrining the rights of vulnerable and marginalized groups and Ensuring democratic participation and the rule of law.
In early March, 2016 I alerted an advisor to the Prime Minister the need to revisit and draw up a new national Human Rights action Plan given the expiry of the existing plan. I was involved in parts in the drafting of the previous plan. The Foreign Ministry is anchoring the new plan.
A new position
The country has been on the dock before UN Human rights bodies for decades. With sharper exchanges and pronouncements since 2010. A new plan must reposition our framework to an era outside of war which protects all, delivers on Constitutional promises, prevents recurrence of past abuses, has specific references to constituencies such as senior citizens and is bold in adopting the best of practices of the best in the world. The Government's job is not to defend its human rights record but to defend human rights
Low hanging human rights fruits
The non-emotive essentials include de housing inmates in correctional facilities, ensuring children are not separated from families in homes unless critically important, hearing those tortured, compensating for their suffering, addressing their trauma, banishing the Vagrance Ordinance, protecting the homeless poor, implementing without delay the revised strengthened legislation to protect animals, creating a policy for persons with special needs where in 361 towns under six categories 2million live. The Samurdhi Bank has billions to take as loans. The poor need to be supported to access them and repay. 250,000 Housing loans at 7% with 20 year tenure for 1Mn loans with land free for low income groups cannot be any better. Our Official Languages Commission Act is 25 years old. A time to seal forever the issues by enacting the Language charter. I have studied every paragraph in the budget proposals of 2015 and 2016. They provide ample scope and opportunities for balanced inclusive development. What's unknown is the extent of use of funds allocated to derive maximum benefits.
Reconciliation
Wars are crimes. No war is just if you have to kill, maim, displace and terrorize. Our history since 1971 has narratives of our failure to prevent dissent from becoming violent. We need to remind ourselves recorded narratives of several Presidential Commissions awaiting implementation of recommended steps including prosecution due to disappearances. Human rights cannot be selective in its memory.
Former Presidents,Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa and Minister Mangala Samaraweera have at different times championed human rights and reconciliation. Our current four pillar approach provides ample coverage but suffers from insufficient messaging. In 1995, President Kumaratunga declared," effective constitutional framework for devolution of power to regions based on an internally consistent and coherent value system, just resolution of centre-region disputes; encourage regions and communities to become constructive partners of a stable and pluralistic democracy; ensure that all persons may fully and effectively exercise all their human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination before the law; accord equality of status to these languages, and to recognise English as a link language; protect the identity of distinct communities and create conditions for the promotion of that identity, and to transact business with the state in the national language of their choice.". Utterances which remain relevant to date. Tragically Prabakaran and the Government could not embrace these concepts and bring a halt to the war in 1995 with horrendous consequences later including for Prabkakaran and family.
Notwithstanding a history littered with outrageous excesses against rights of so many our political firmaments still struggles to give us a new deal. If with President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Leader of the Opposition Sambanthan, backed by smaller parties and efforts of former President Kumaratunga do not bring forth a Constitutional arrangement for the future when will we see another opportunity as we have now All these leaders have stayed consistent to-date in the crafting process the past year. We have to ensure that our diverse societies truly welcome and respect people of all faiths and backgrounds, and our leaders continue set the tone on this issue.
Reconciliation is not a matter confined to reports and depositions. It also means people grieving, expressing themselves in song and in verse. Understanding violent extremism requires delving deeper into causes if we are to prevent regress or recurrence.
When my boss was blown up I wondered about the compulsions of the assassin who died. President Obama said, "when people -- especially young people -- feel entirely trapped in impoverished communities, where there is no order and no path for advancement, where there are no educational opportunities, where there are no ways to support families, and no escape from injustice and the humiliations of corruption -- that feeds instability and disorder, and makes those communities ripe for extremist recruitment.
When people are oppressed, and human rights are denied -- particularly along sectarian lines or ethnic lines -- when dissent is silenced, it feeds violent extremism. When peaceful, democratic change is impossible, it feeds into the terrorist propaganda that violence is the only answer available."
As Desmond Tutu in The Book of Forgiving: The Fourfold Path for Healing Ourselves and Our World says, "The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen."
We sadly lost a giant in Professor Weeramantry who could have guided us. We need such people to lead us in all the elements constituting our domestic process of reconciliation.

## Title: Illegality, discrimination of LGBTIQ community
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Law & Order

Illegality, discrimination of LGBTIQ community
Citizens of Sri Lanka are currently facing systematic stigma and discrimination based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity (SOGI), where authorities often ignore or fuel such abuse of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transsexual, intersex and questioning (LGBTIQ) individuals.
Consenting adults could face imprisonment for sexual activity, individuals are not protected by law from domestic violence, workplace harassment and unfair job dismissal can go unpunished  the list goes on.
These are just a few of the plethora of problems the LGBTIQ community constantly encounter in Sri Lanka.
Multiple discrimination against LGBTIQ people are often rationalised through Sri Lankas Sections 365 and 365A of the Penal Code  ambiguous and archaic British Colonial laws, which are interpreted to criminalise the sexual activity of consensual same-sex adults.
Likewise, Section 399 of the Penal Code sees the ill-treatment transgender individuals are meted through cheating by impersonation.
Beyond this illegality lies a by-product; a lack of a Bill of Rights acknowledgement of anti-discrimination, and non-discrimination constitutional recognition for LGBTIQ persons. All of this despite our being signatory to multiple United Nations (UN) Conventions (ICCPR, ICESCR, CEDAW, CAT) aimed at protecting all citizens, regardless of their race, gender, gender identity or their sexual orientation, according to the Yogyakarta Principles globally acknowledged interpretations.
These UN conventions indicate that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights  which are inalienable and are the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. More specifically, the Yogyakarta Principles, which apply International Human Rights Law to the protection of LGBTIQ persons, indicate that the treatment of the LGBTIQ community in Sri Lanka is indeed in violation of the many UN Conventions and treaty bodies Sri Lanka is signatory to.
If you would like to know more about this, information about the Yogyakarta Principles and EQUAL GROUNDs publication Human, Right can be found at the bottom of this article.
In October 2014, during the IPPCR review of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan government claimed Article 12 of the Sri Lankan Constitution regarding non-discrimination includes the protection of LGBTIQ persons, however, there is no explicit mention of such group beyond the vague language of, any one of such grounds, within which the Sri Lankan State claim SOGI is covered.
This public recognition of Article 12, although a step in the right direction, does not realistically translate to the experiences encountered by the LGBTIQ community. Instead, many find themselves victims of widespread societal and institutionalised homophobia and transphobia reinforced by law enforcing officers and arms of the legal system.
For example, unfounded hearsay can be used for interrogation and to keep LGBTIQ persons in police custody, and in many cases, individuals have been forced to sign a statement admitting their guilt. There are reports of this statement being shown to family and used as a form of bribery or for coercion  adding stress not only to their familial relationships and reputation, but leads for some to lose their jobs or be forced to leave educational institutions.
Many governments around the world now have legislations and constitutions that guarantee the rights and non-discrimination based on SOGI, ensuring equality and respect of all their citizens. A shining example of outstanding protection of the LGBTIQ community comes from one of our fellow South Asian nations, Nepal.
After decriminalising homosexuality in 2007, Nepal last year joined only two other countries in enshrining full equal rights protections for LGBTIQ persons in their constitution. This extremely progressive move makes them a leader not only in South Asia, but the Asian continent.
This human rights issue intersects with matters of family and other socio-cultural persuasions, as well as the economic realm. As outlined in a 2015 Kaleidoscope report 2015, Speaking Out, LGBTIQ persons suffer extreme levels of violence  emotional, sexual and physical, both in public and at home, with no legal protections or worse; risk being charged for being homosexual or gender non-conforming.
To illustrate this, even though the introduction of the Domestic Violence Act No.34 of 2005 does not explicitly exclude protection for those in same-sex relationships experiencing domestic violence, there are potential consequences for individuals seeking redress due to the illegality of same-sex relations and fear of persecution.
Victim-survivors of same-sex domestic violence cannot rely on the police or courts for protection and must be extremely cautious in their interactions with the police or other law enforcement mechanisms. If you think you or someone you care about is a victim of domestic violence, EQUAL GROUNDs own publication Stepping Out of the Shadows  Same Sex Domestic Violence in Sri Lanka may be able to assist you in getting help.
Also, if you have experienced sexual or physical violence because of your SOGI, NexGen is an anonymous tool created by EQUAL GROUND to increase the reporting of incidents to the Sri Lankan government.
NexGen and is part of EGs strategy to advocate for protection of people with different SOGI, but please note, this is not an emergency service. Details of both of these services can be found at the bottom of the article.
More broadly, the concept of being LGBTIQ is often wrongly mistaken for an alternate lifestyle that is nothing more than a choice made by the individuals themselves. Having a LGBTIQ status immediately puts an individuals head on the chopping block, being publicly LGBTIQ could cost them dearly.
Homophobic and transphobic violence is ever present in Sri Lanka; it has caused a lot of suffering, driven many to the brink of suicide, and has even resulted in deaths. A Sri Lankan LGBTIQ persons internalised homophobia and transphobia alone is enough to make their lives unbearable.
Because of the very prominent discrimination endured by those who are not heterosexual, many lesbians and gays are forced to remain closeted by keeping their true identity hidden from public and private life.
The fear of being disowned by ones own family keeps many young adults from being open with them.
Due to the aforementioned internalised homophobia, combined with the general revulsion the South Asian society has towards homosexuals, many struggle to come to terms with their own sexual orientation. What follows this unreasonable discrimination is often brutality.
Homophobia, which loosely describes the hatred and aversion an individual has towards homosexuals, on many occasions escalates to violence. Prevalence of social norms and the power it has over the lives of Sri Lankans makes it the governing power to which all must abide by. These deep rooted teachings of what is considered right and wrong makes even the most carefully researched, globally certified and accepted studies that homosexuality is perfectly normal, irrelevant and bizarre.
Thus, Lesbians and gays often only have the choices of either being out and subsequently disowned by their families, be forced to marry against their will, risk being subjected to conversion therapy and/or conversion rape; or to suppress their blatant instincts, have a heteronormative marriage, and be unhappy for the rest of their lives. The psychological stress of suppressing ones sexual orientation can result in anxiety, self-harming, suicidal tendencies, and clinical depression.
Often, most homophobic parents with little understanding resort to conversion therapy. From practitioners of black magic, to psychologists who choose societal norms over good mental health practice, there is no shortage of con artists willing to push their homophobic agenda while swindling these desperate parents.
Conversion therapy is equal parts brutal as well as unsuccessful. Illicit name calling, beatings, torture, sexual assault and murders are some of the ways LGBTIQ persons are brutalised to no end. How can culture justify the endless torment and fear Sri Lankan LGBTIQ persons are forced to endure every waking moment of everyday.
Transgendered persons are on the receiving end of some of the most heinous anti-LGBTIQ violence in Sri Lanka. South Asia has very strict gender norms to which each sex is confined.
Straying from the imposed norms guarantees discrimination whatever the persons sexual orientation or gender identity may be.
Being uncomfortable with the sex to which they were born and identifying and desiring to be that of the opposite, is a concept so alien and frightening to many Sri Lankans that they seemingly resort to not only mistreating such individuals, but even assaulting them. The amount of reported cases of transphobic violence is heart breaking and frightening. From aggravated assaults to gang rape, the heinous crimes transgender persons face seem to be endless and inhumane.
Sensitising of the general Sri Lankan community about LGBTIQ issues and rights is lacking.
Parents, teachers, relatives, peers, as well as co-workers of a transgender are often confused, appalled, disgusted, and almost always ill equipped to properly handle an individual coming out to them as transgender.
To make matters worse, the representation of transgender persons in Sri Lankan tele-dramas are completely inappropriate and inaccurate  creating and sustaining an extremely cruel and offensive stereotype. Male to female transgender women having been very unfairly stereotyped as promiscuous are very often sexually assaulted because of their gender identity.
Many transgendered persons are groped in the crotch and/or bust area by strangers to find out whether or not they are a real man or a real woman. This revolting violation of their basic human rights is tragically a daily occurrence for some, and highlights the transphobia of many cis-gender people.
Many transgender individuals encounter the incorrect use of pronouns by family members and associates due to either a lack of understanding, or a lack of acknowledgement and acceptance of that individual as a transgender person. Some people intentionally use incorrect pronouns to ensure public humiliation.
The lack of gender neutral bathrooms is also a very big problem in Sri Lanka. It can be very dangerous for a female-to-male be identified as a transgender man in the mens bathroom and vice versa.
The violence faced by transgender individuals is not limited to strangers or their associates. Many are also severely persecuted by family members. A persons basic expression of individuality is deeply interconnected with their gender identity and sexual orientation, and much like suppressing your sexual orientation, the consequences of suppressing your gender identity are negative.
The gender norms that are forced upon us the minute the blue or pink blanket is wrapped around an infant extends to adulthood, where our clothes, our words and our behaviour must reflect the sex we were born. The negative consequences of gender fluidity are a result of the social constraints that the lack of LGBTIQ sensitisation programs exacerbates.
Furthermore, intersex people are often mistaken for being transgender because of their biological ambiguity at birth. Intersex people are born with both male and female sex organs, and often doctors will assign that individual a gender at birth  by chance this gender may be correct, but equally that individual may realise they have been assigned the wrong gender. This does not make them transgender but are mistakenly discriminated against for being so.
A lack of anti-discrimination laws also sees negative economic consequences. Just in the same way some employers discriminate against women, religious beliefs or different ethnicities in the workplace, LGBTIQ individuals also encounter multiple discrimination, but without the legislation or constitutional recognition to protect them.
Lack of protection in the workplace sees discrimination against LGBTIQ individuals not only by fellow staff members and employers, but also from their customers. Reports from LGBTIQ individuals of sexual, mental and/or physical harassment are abundant.
Simplified, this situation is two-fold. Firstly, not only are the mental and often physical injuries incurred by an individual an impingement on their freedoms and a serious human rights violation, it also becomes an unnecessary and expensive burden on already strained public health services, funded by tax payers. This is true not only for workplace discrimination, but discrimination of all forms, in all aspects of an individuals life.
Secondly, it results in scores of unemployed citizens solely on the basis of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity  costing the economy greatly. It is estimated that six to 10 percent of Sri Lankas population is LGBTIQ. When a society restricts the working capacity of six to 10 percent of their population, it missed out on a large portion of income generated by taxes paid by those people.
To put this into perspective, when comparing the figures of the cost of homophobia and transphobia in India to Sri Lanka, a potential loss of Rs. 124 million per annum of net productivity is identified  the equivalent of our aviation industry.
To further illustrate this, a study released by M.V Lee Badgett et al, The Relationship Between LGBT Inclusion and Economic Development: An Analysis of Emerging Economies, finds that when comparing developing countries, the better the legal and social LGBTIQ rights, the higher the Gross Domestic Product (GRP) per capita for that country (with all other factors taken into consideration).
Reasons for the economic exclusion of LGBTIQ persons is numerous. Findings in the same study by M.V Lee Badgett et al, can be almost identically paralleled to EQUAL GROUNDs experiences through their work with LGBTIQ people in Sri Lanka. The most evident reasons stem from cultural norms and a lack of protection, limiting their freedoms. These consist of police officers unjust treatment in the form of arbitrary arrests, violence and coercion  taking them away from work; higher rates of physical and psychological violence at home or in the community  restricting work through physical or psychological injury; discrimination in schools and universities by teachers and other students  restricting access to education and skills; and finally, most obviously  workplace discrimination.
Fortunately, despite the lack of legal anti-discrimination support from the government, the private sector is in the early stages of leading a progressive movement in the way of workplace discrimination. Sri Lankas largest conglomerate, John Keells Holdings, after beginning an 18 month LGBTIQ Equality in the Workplace training with EQUAL GROUND in November last year, are now making inclusive changes to their workplace policy to protect the rights of their LGBTIQ employees.
In a competitive market, it is only a matter of time before other companies will follow in the footsteps of this progressive employer to further tap into the under-valued resource that is LGBTIQ individuals.
However, it is not just the private sector that is hearing our voice. The conversation at government level in both our country and in our region is changing. In India, the abolition of Section 377 of their Penal Code (similar to our Sections 365 and 365A), which vaguely criminalises homosexuality, is currently being debated  opening up dialog for much needed reform.
Closer to home, our government is eagerly trying to re-sign the Generalised Scheme of Preference Plus (GSP+)  a European trade agreement for developing countries, which in 2010, Sri Lanka was eliminated from for not upholding the human rights of female garment workers. This time around, due to the criminalisation of and lack of anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTIQ people, they are once again facing barriers for eligibility  thus creating space for change.
During a time where the Sri Lankan State is drafting a new Constitution and Bill of Rights, it is now more than ever that reform to decriminalise and protect LGBTIQ persons from discrimination could be a reality. It is suggested that Sections 365/365A and 399 of the Penal Code are repealed or amended to no longer criminalise adult consensual same-sex activity, and adult gender expression or identity respectively.
Further, it is recommended to not only have the language in the Constitution changed to explicitly include non-discrimination based on SOGI, but also in the Bill of Rights; ensuring non-discrimination within the private sector also.
It is through these simple changes that we can finally be on the road to positive reform that is inclusive of all members of Sri Lankan society, regardless of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.

Jeep Club of Sri Lanka Annual Expedition 2016: Jeep conquers coast less travelled in Sri Lanka
Jeep Sri Lanka frequently organizes outdoor adventure activities for their loyal customers who loves to go anywhere, do anything. Adventure is a part of the DNA of every Jeep Brand vehicle ever built and as long as curiosity drives man to explore the edges of heaven and earth, the Jeep Brand will continue to inspire him to go beyond. Freedom, adventure and passion are some of the core values of Jeep.
Jeep Club of Sri Lankas Annual Expedition was themed the Coast Less Travelled for 2016 and covered some of the most gruelling,scenic and exciting terrains and tracks along the coastal belts of North Western, Northern and Eastern part of Sri Lanka. Seventeen members of the Jeep Club of Sri Lanka (JCSL) took part and DIMO came on board as the main sponsor as the only authorized distributor for Jeep in Sri Lanka.
JCSL together with DIMO organised the Coast Less Travelled from the 10th to the 13th of December 2016. The expedition commenced from DIMO 800 and went on to Jaffna during the first day.
The route took the drivers through the flora and fauna of the Wilpattu National Park whilst experiencing the scenic and breathtaking views of Kudrimalai Point where King Vijaya landed. Lunch for the members were served on the Talaimannar Pier organised by the Sri Lanka Army. The first day drive ended at Jaffna covering approx. 420 km and the drivers stayed the night at Jetwing Jaffna.
The second day consisted of a 180 km drive from Jaffna to Mullaitivu. The most interesting part of this route was the 35 km drive across the beach which was tremendously breathtaking and exciting. The beach drive was another opportunity for the drivers to learn and enjoy the techniques of sand driving, especially in a Jeep. All members enjoyed the capabilities of their Jeeps, which for some were a novel experience.
The experts in the JCSL were always at hand to teach the others on manoeuvring in sand and water and working with tides and tyre pressure. Lunch was served at Maradankeny beach and they were accommodated at bungalows for their second stay.
The third day saw the members drive from Mullaitivu to Trincomalee covering approx. 130km. This trail included a 25 km jungle run and which went through the devastation and damage caused by the war. After having lunch the memberswent on another 10 km beach drive which was equally scenic as the other. Overnight stay was at arranged at TrincoBlu by Cinnamon where everyone enjoyed the networking session where they could share their knowledge and stories.
The expedition turned out to be yet again a memorable experience for the Jeep Club members. The experienced and the drive also reassured the members that they have chosen the best off-road vehicle, which is truly a go anywhere do anything vehicle.
For 75 years, Jeep Brand vehicles have inspired man to dream and to dare. To go farther, live larger and explore every corner of this amazing world. The Coast Less Travelled was another Jeep event organized to challenge the off-road enthusiast.
Whilst DIMO was the main sponsor of the event, Michelin tires, BF Goodrich tyres, Kumho tires, WD-40, Bosch, Moose Clothing, Sign Tech and Meesha Photography came on board as co-sponsors.

Lankan vessel crashes into Indian trawler injuring fishermen
A mechanised boat fisherman sustained injuries after he fell into the sea after a Sri Lankan naval vessel crashed into the fishing trawler in a bid to arrest the fishermen onboard for poaching in Lankan waters on Saturday.
Didit Raj, 45, the fisherman from Thangachimadam was one of the six fishermen onboard the trawler (IND TN 09 MM 245) and fishing on the high seas off Katchatheevu when the Lankan Navy from Delft island, crashed into their vessel.
Raj fell into the sea and got hit by the trawler on his chest. After fellow fishermen helped him to board the boat, the Lankan navy detained them for poaching in Lankan waters.
As the Navy was taking the fishermen along with the trawler, Raj developed chest pain, warranting medical attention.
The Navy released the fishermen, after which they returned to the fishing jetty on Saturday evening.
After first aid at the Government hospital in Rameswaram, Raj was admitted to the government headquarters hospital.
The Lankan navy released us after I complained of severe chest pain, he said. Hospital sources, citing scan reports, said his condition was stable.
The trawler was damaged on being hit by the Lankan Navy vessel and there was a gaping hole in the middle portion of the boat.
The fishermen managed to sail to the shore with the help of other fishing vessels. Praveen, the boat owner, has lodged a complaint with the Fisheries Department.
The Department had issued fishing permits to 450 trawlers and more than 2,500 fishermen had set out for fishing from the Rameswaram fishing jetty on Saturday morning.
They were fishing on the high seas when a Lankan Navy from Delft island chased them away, the fishermen said. - The Hindu

LAUGFS Maritime first to register  ship at Hambantota Port
LAUGFS is set to mark another monumental milestone by being the first to register a vessel at the Hambantota Port.
The announcement was made together with the purchase of another LPG vessel under LAUGFS Maritime, in its plans to rapidly expand its vessel fleet. This latest LPG carrier was acquired for an investment of over USD 2.8 million and is registered under the Sri Lankan flag as Gas Courage.
Being a conglomerate that takes pride in our Sri Lankan roots, we are extremely pleased to be able to register the first ship at the Hambantota Port, said LAUGFS Holdings Chairman W.K.H.Wegapitiya.
We have been aggressively expanding our interests in the Power and Energy sector as part of our global expansion strategy.
Our plans are to strengthen our vessel fleet to 20 carriers soon, to cater to the growing logistics demand within the region as well as by our own LPG operations in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Gas Courage will expand logistic capabilities of LAUGFS Maritime with another 3,000 M/Tons of LPG capacity.
As global energy demand continues to rise, we are quickly gearing up to support these future requirements and to capture emerging opportunities, with strong investments especially focusing on energy infrastructure, he continued.
LAUGFS is currently setting up one of the largest LPG Import & Export Terminals in South Asia at Hambantota.
The terminal, which is expected to be commissioned in 2018, is expected to support the growing LPG demand serving as a central storage hub for the region. Further, the energy trading arm of LAUGFS, SLOGAL Energy DMCC, was set up last year with headquarters in Dubai.
As a home-grown conglomerate, we take great pride in being able to register another vessel under our Sri Lankan flag, said LAUGFS Holdings Group Managing Director, Thilak De Silva.

Macys shares fall 13%  on job cuts plan
US department store chain Macys has seen its share price fall 13% as it cut profit forecasts and announced plans to shed 10,100 jobs to save $550m (447m).
It said 3,900 jobs would go in 2017 as a result of 68 store closures, out of a planned 100 announced last year.
Meanwhile, other changes and reductions in middle management roles are expected to eliminate another 6,200 jobs.
Department stores in the US have been struggling with tough competition from online retailers and discount stores.
Macys - which owns department store Bloomingdales - also said its profits for the year to 30 January would be lower than previously forecast.
It had expected profits to be between $3.15 and $3.40 a share, but has now cut this to $2.95-$3.10.
Other US department stores also saw significant share price movements on Thursday.
Shares in Kohls dived 19% as it too cut its profit forecast, while Sears saw its shares rise nearly 6% in early trading after it said it would sell its Craftsman tools business to Stanley Black & Decker for $900m.
However, Sears also reported weak holiday trading, with same-store sales in November and December down by 12-13%, and announced plans to close 150 stores. And its shares closed barely changed.
Macys revised profit forecast came after the chains like-for-like sales in November and December saw a fall of 2.1%.
While our sales trend is consistent with the lower end of our guidance, we had anticipated sales would be stronger, said Macys chief executive, Terry Lundgren.
Neil Saunders, from research group Conlumino, said the latest move was a necessary evil in order to get the company back on track.
The blunt truth is that many of these locations are simply not going to deliver solid returns, so there is little point trying to revitalise and invest in them.
Revitalising the business will not be easy. Shopping trends are firmly against Macys, and its brand, while not completely diminished, is most certainly tarnished.
In our view, it needs to completely overhaul the experience to make stores easier to shop, more interesting to browse, and more relevant to todays shopper.

## Title: Making development more sustainable

Making development more sustainable
President Maithripala Sirisen last week unveiled the Sustainable Era Initiative which would set the countrys development path. Prof Mohan Munasinghe, founding chairman of the Munasinghe Institute for Development and honorary senior advisor to the government was asked by the President to help set up an expert Commission which would draw up the Strategic Framework of this initiative. In an interview with the Daily News, Prof. Munasinghe highlighted that while inputs from the people would be sought when drawing up the framework, it will also help the government make its development programs more consistent and integrated.
Excerpts:
Q. Could you explain briefly what the sustainability era initiative is and how will it impact the people
A. There will be a special expert commission appointed by the President and I am helping to set it up. We are in the process of identifying members, who will be experts in specific areas of sustainable development. The document is a strategic document which will flesh out the vision of the sustainable era which the President outlined on January 2. It will hopefully show the national sustainable path to be followed by not only the government but also civil society and the business community. The report will be written in simple and clear language and it will follow a very inclusive process. We will get our experts to cast their nets widely as they produce the early drafts. Well before the final report, there will be extensive consultations not just with other experts but also the public.
The report thus will be owned by the people. We hope it will guide the President, and also empower the people. For example, If the report identifies broad policy options to alleviate poverty or save energy, it should also highlight where people can contribute at a personal level At a community level, and so forth.
Q. When you go to the people, how will you get this information you need Does everyone understand the meaning of sustainability
A. Yes, but we wont necessarily go to them at the launch stage. In the initial stages we have to digest a lot of existing information generated by the government, businesses and civil society, and the experts know where to get them. We can also solicit suggestions. This will be put together in a preliminary first draft. And that will be taken to the people. For example, you cannot simply go and ask the person on the street what they think of the sustainable development goals (SDG). But on the other hand, if we have a first draft which says we want to make sure that all the have access to water and that it may take the next five years to achieve, you can go and ask the dry zone farmer for his views. He might say, we cant wait five years, why cant you give it to me in two So we put out something which is relevant to them- with a certain target, time frame and how to achieve it. Then we can get a more meaningful response.
Q. This would then be the first time in the country that someone is asking the people their views on environment/climate change and how to cope
A. Yes. In the sense that the consultative process we hope to follow will be quite broad and inclusive. This document is not a plan in the sense that we already have a planning apparatus, like the Prime Ministers Ministry of National Policies and Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank and other major line ministries. They are all doing their thing. So we dont want to get into that level of micromanagement. But we do want to go beyond a superficial election manifesto. This document will be in between. That kind of report has not been produced before and at that strategic level, we have not posed the question to the people. But the people cannot respond to all of them. For example, suppose there is a certain target to achieve 10 percent solar-renewable energy in the total energy mix within a certain time frame. An ordinary person may not know if that is desirable, but he/she can indicate if they feel that more solar is better.
Q. Having shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, you advocated for people to do small things which will lead to a big difference rather than waiting for governments to make the big decisions. Hence this initiative seems to be trying to live up to that principle
A. Yes, exactly. This is the framework called Sustainomics which I presented at the Rio Earth Summit (1992). This is the first principle, how do we make development more sustainable It is like a mountain peak, which is covered in mist. When you ask people what is sustainable development, they have no idea. We dont know where the peak is but we can still keep climbing uphill and feel empowered to do something. For example, at the personal level, if you switch off the light when you leave the room, turn off a tap or plant a tree - you are moving towards sustainable development. This first step is embedded in the process for preparing this document.
Q. How will you adapt the SDGs into the Sri Lankan context
A. The President has said clearly that we will prioritise, so we will not blindly follow all 17 UN SDG. The structure and composition of the expert commission will reflect the priorities the President sets out (poverty, education, health, agriculture, etc). Those will be the highest priorities but we will seek to include other areas as well. But finally, it will certainly be Sri Lankas agenda that will be followed within an integrative framework, since each SDG is still isolated.
They have said that the SDGs should be clustered but when you take for example the SDG on poverty; you have water, energy, food, health, jobs. Urbanisation, etc. that are all linked to it. In the end it is some official in a ministry who has to set the target. Basically what we are saying is that to set the SDG target, you have to have these integrated within a national plan before. My take on the SDGs is that first we have to harmonise what is going on within the government and then integrate the SDG into that framework.
The expert commission will be assigned to the most important national goals (will not necessarily strictly follow the SDG themes -- some will coincide and some will not). For example we have a governance theme which will comprise of reconciliation, peace, etc., but it does not exactly correspond with any of the SDGs. We will have experts who will look at what is going on with government, and then they will ask business and civil society for their views, and harmonise everything. Since it is a strategic document, we can have integrate plans and policies at a more generalised level without going into detailed modelling.
Q. So you are following the second principle of Sustainomics -- looking to integrate the three key elements of environment, society and economics into this framework
A. For example, we may have a clusters to harmonise the economic aspects  getting key inputs from policy and planning people, Finance Ministry, Central Bank, industry, urbanisation, etc. Under the social cluster we could have poverty, inequality, reconciliation, human rights, basic needs, etc. Environment might include land use, forests, water, pollution, marine environment, etc... Within each cluster, sub-themes will be pursued by experts who will network with specific ministries and specific business community leaders and academia. We will thus respect the second principle of Sustainomics- balance and integration. Hopefully, better harmonisation will be achieved here, something that is a bit weak right now. This is the Presidents concern, and hopefully this document will help him in that task.
Q. Integration and working across fields is not we have achieved so far. This will be quite a challenge
A. people tend to forget that ultimately what we are protecting is the democratic space in which we live. The moment one aspect becomes too powerful, it affects everything else. For example, in previous years the government pursued huge unproductive mega projects to build economic capital, but this destroyed the social capital and the environmental capital and crushed the democratic space, which must be protected. This is very much in Presidents mind. When he talks about reconciliation it is more than the different communities talking to each other, it is about protecting the democratic space where all can talk freely and resolve issues in a civilised way.
The third core principle of Sustainomics is about innovation and fresh ideas. We are doing a lot in government but some of it is still business as usual. There is a whole generation of younger people using new tools, including ICT, mobile technology, social media, etc. The number one thing we need to do is to change the present unsustainable value system, built on greed, selfishness, violence, etc. Under the section on governance and education, we hope to touch on these issues.
Q. Some years ago, you launched the novel concept of Millennium Consumption goals at the UN, and one outcome was the inclusion of this concept in SDG 12 on Responsible consumption. The Prime Minister recently released the Economic Development Plan which speaks of accelerated growth. Arent these two principles contradictory
A. The present government's development programme has some inconsistencies, but there are good reasons for it. When the government took office, there was an economic crisis - primarily the debt issue. Because of that, the first priority was to pick up the economy. The government is still busy remedying the unproductive mega projects. We cannot abandon them so the government is trying to recover the losses. There are some inconsistencies because we were so far off the sustainability path that we cant jump back on to it immediately. And this report will help us get back on track.
This report will cover 10-15 years, but we only have six months to produce it!
We will first step forward to 2020, where we have reasonable confidence, then to 2025, and if we have the data and time, we will step forward to 2030 - although that may be more vision than reality.
This is a one off report, so we will do this and the commission will be dissolved.
Q. Who will be responsible for implementation
A. That is a different matter. The President has a whole cabinet of people to do that. For example, he can say, This is the framework I like until 2020. It is a strategic framework so he can go to a specific line ministry and check if their detailed plans fall within the overall framework, and he can thereby hold them accountable.
Q. Given our history, what is the guarantee that the framework will be followed
A. That is up to the President. We will go step by step, when climbing the mountain. At present the President does not have an adequate framework to make decisions. This is called the consistency framework. For example, the Energy Ministry could say, we want to supply 20 percent of solar in the energy mix within the next five years. But but the Finance Ministry has to decide whether there is enough money to do that kind of thing. So the consistency framework could help the President and public see how these things fitting together. And the President can ask the ministries whether they have talked to each and seen what is possible.
Q. Many say that countries like ours cannot afford SDGs, so who will fund all of this
A. There is an important aspect of perception here. Development must be there to achieve sustainability. In development, the economy is the main driver. You cannot have sustainability if you beggar the economy. Economic sustainability requires that the monetary and financial aspects are respected. Then environmental sustainability says that you protect the environment to the extent that you can afford but at the same time you tell the economic policymakers that the growth pattern should not unduly damage the environment either. These alternative growth paths, are called Inclusive Green Growth (IGG) paths.
We should not slavishly follow the same unsustainable path to development as the rich countries. Instead, Sri Lanka must find its own path to prosperity, but in a way that does not harm our environment and makes growth inclusive for all.
Q. Ten years ago you had said that all countries need their own sustainable development agenda and the main obstacle was lack of political will and that bureaucrats were lazy to try out new things. So now that you have been asked to help in developing a framework for Sri Lanka, do you believe change can happen
A. Yes. I am hopeful in the following sense. We will produce a report which is user friendly and people understand what is intended. And it will also be operationally useful to the President as he decides to harmonise and put some order into the development path. The Prime Minister also endorses this approach, so we have a consensus at the highest level.
I am satisfied that the President was very sincere when he asked us to make this report and that it will not simply sit on some shelf. The report is not a detailed plan that will propose specific projects, but it will check the consistency and harmony of what is going on. That is the difference.
Secondly it is about carrying the people with you. As the President starts to implement policy within an integrated framework, hopefully he will be able to say to the people, this is what I plan to do and you were consulted on this. The people will be empowered. They also can put new questions back to the government.
Q. We have had goals like the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) but in the end we have not been able to fully realise them. What do you think is our obstacle
A. First, is it a question of time Yes. Secondly, to what extent was the goal too ambitious given that time frame Both are linked. There was a question of child nutrition which came up with the MDGs, I think given another few years, we could have closed the gap, but not completely. Because if you talk about poverty alleviation, that can be done, but 100% poverty eradication is not achievable even in rich countries.
We have to see the goals within the time frame. That is also the problem with the SDGs. We are talking about 2030, which is a very uncertain future. How do you set a goal That is precisely why our document will be the first step. Some of the goals may be meet, and some not. We do our best. The guiding principle is leave no one behind. At times, you may achieve 95 percent on one goal, and only 25 percent on another. Rather than trying to go from 95 to 100 on the first, it may be better to use that effort to go from 25 to 30 on the second.
We are not saying we are achieving sustainable development; that is impossible, it is a moving target. We are making development more sustainable.
Q. The government has called to increase the pace of development with a massive drive towards urbanization. In such a scenario how do you press for sustainable development More importantly there's an argument that sustainable development can only be achieved once poverty alleviation and urbanization have been achieved. What do you think
A. You have to distinguish between trends and a responsible life style. Trends sometimes are irreversible. We might say that all these urban centres are unsustainable but you cant swim against the global current of urbanisation. So what we can do it is manage it. If the Megapolis is going to happen and is part of government policy, we can do is make it more sustainable by learning from other green and sustainable cities, worldwide.
The IGG path not only assures prosperity, environmental protection and inclusivity. It also alleviates poverty, by it raising the poor out of poverty along a sustainable path, and persuading the rich to pursue more sustainable and less wasteful lifestyles.

Meticulous raid on iguana theft
Around midnight on January 6 when all shops in Dickwella town had closed, Dickwella police rushed to a stationery and cigarettes shop in the town and surrounded it following a tip off that thieves had entered it.
The shop owner awakened by police was also at hand to assist in the raid and witness the thieves being caught red handed by the police.
A large crowd assembled at the spot heard goods rattling inside the shop and thought the thieves were collecting everything possible to make a quick getaway.
Police on full alert ordered the shop owner to unlock the door waiting to pounce on the men inside and catch them with the loot.
But when the door was opened, they were all astonished to see two iguanas that had been locked inside.
They were making the loud noises slithering away from the shop toppling goods on their way unconcerned about the commotion.
In the end, the police officers, shop owner and crowd had a hearty laugh and left the spot to recover their lost sleep.
However, the shop owner and the crowd were thankful for the police officers for showing quick response to the public alert despite the inconvenience caused.

Mixed views on Good Governance : 2017, the year of Judgement!
It has been two years since Sri Lanka came under the 'A Compassionate Maithri Governance - A Stable Country.' Here some well-known personalities who have been a part of the driving force behind the change share their views about the present government with the Daily News.
Somaratne Dissanayake
People elect a new leadership and government expecting a change. The past two years have seen some positive changes taking place in the country. The issue of bribery and corruption is almost under control. They are investigating cases which have been done and have been ignored in the past.
The country's economy is in a positive state. Some of the general problems of the people too have been solved. Their day to day living conditions have improved.
We have to appreciate these changes. However there have been no changes in the arts field yet. The situation is the same or even worse. Since the authorities have turned a blind eye on the problems in the arts sector, issues have doubled. We expected more but got nothing in return so far.
They have not met our expectations yet. We need remedies for these issues which hinder our work. In my point of view the year 2017 is the 'Year of Judgment'. Two years is more than enough for a new government to settle in and recognize the problems in each sector. They cannot give excuses after this term. They need to start working instead of talking now.
Dilhani Asokamala
We worked towards establishing this government expecting some change. I am on alert, just waiting to see what is happening.
Dharmasiri Bandaranayake
The main reason why the public wanted a change is because they wanted to live a life free of fear and suspicions. The country was under the rulership of a dictator then. People did not have the freedom to express their opinions.
They were not in a state to seek the law to solve their problems. It was like we were all controlled by a certain force.
The present government too seems to be forgetting that it is the people who put them in power. It can be seen by their haughty behaviour. They do not have any knowledge about the results of the wrong decisions that they take.
The law gone astray, a society living in fear, corruption and nepotism... You can forget such incidents if they happened many years back but can you ignore them if they happened in recent times A parent can't even admit their child into a school of their preference in peace because certain personalities work against it by establishing societies under various names. This is the pathetic but true state of affairs.
Nadeeka Guruge
I sense that we are in better hands if you compare the present government with the previous one. They have taken the needs of the citizens to heart. The law and order of the country has been reformed.
There are no partialities like before. However there is much more to be done. We need to move towards a better direction.
Though I am happy about these changes what concerns me now is that most of the decision makers in the government were the same ones who held top positions in the previous government as well. This is not what we expected from them. I am waiting to see what would happen next.
Suresh Maliyadde
We had great hopes that something would happen after the elections are over. Now two years after obtaining power the government still hasn't made the changes we expected from them. Now bitter experiences have made me come to the conclusion that no matter who would come to power, they will not build up- this country.
Navaratne Gamage
Peace among ethnic groups and the citizens of the country is the most important factor at the moment. It is the government's duty towards the people to take up this matter seriously. We got details about many murders due to the greed for power in the past. Even the poor people in the country need to transform their life in a certain manner.
I was in Cambodia recently. I witnessed that the situation in that country is similar to that which our country had in the 1970s. Though we have gathered many material goods today but our human qualities have deteriorated. The barbaric nature of the society has increased today.
We need to guide the new generation towards the correct path. They are keen to pursue knowledge but cannot do so because of the division of power. There are too many philosophers today. The whole country is in an uproar. We need to look at matters with a critical eye.
We have lost many opportunities to make quality productions. An artiste is dedicated to his or her work. Unlike other fields the arts helps to reform the lifestyle of the people.
Samanalee Fonseka
We were disappointed with certain things done by the previous government. The turning point came with the Aluthgama anti-Muslim riots. We feared that another Black July was about to dawn. So we decided to act and support the opposition.
That was not the best decision to take but it was an option. We can see a slight improvement in the relationships between ethnic groups today which has broken away from former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's nationalistic vision. We need to change the mindset of the people in the south so that they will not fear or hate the Tamil people anymore. This is a very important initiative but the government has brushed it aside. As members of the Aluth Parapura Kalakaruwo society, we are doing what we can but the Government needs to play a bigger role in this matter.
Parakrama Niriella
The government has taken up matters like peace and law seriously but they have not done anything on behalf of the arts. We decided to support them after getting a signed document from President Maithripala Sirisena before the 2015 presidential elections stating that he would make certain changes in the field once he comes into power but today both the President and the Prime Minister are too busy to give even a date and time for discussions. They are too concerned about their own businesses to look into the issues in the arts field.

The IGP who is at the beck and call of all higher ups addressing them as sir is insulting the police service by trying to exert undue pressure on the media, Kurunegala district parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was speaking to the media after paying homage to the Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates at their temples and received their blessings.Rajapaksa said people should rise up against oppression and policemen in his security detail who took the side of the people had been transferred. The former President said he had not received any invitation so far to attend President Sirisenas second anniversary celebrations. He said not even an iota of democracy, rule of law or good governance could be observed in the country today.
The fall of the government is imminent any moment according to the present indications, he said. He said there was information that three teams from Colombo had been sent to Hambantota by the government to attack and expel the people led by the Maha Sangha who demonstrated against the moves to deprive their ownership rights to their lands.

Naidu encouraged by Lankas progress
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu said yesterday at a meeting with the Sri Lankan media at the Taj Samudra Hotel that he is encouraged by the progress Sri Lanka is making and that he hopes to continue working with the government to promote development and alleviate poverty.
There is a big future for this country, and I strongly believe that. Even now Sri Lanka is doing well, and there are a lot of opportunities for this country, he said. The Chief Minister was invited by President Maithripala Sirisena in order to discuss various poverty relief efforts and technological projects between Andhra Pradesh and Sri Lanka. Naidu shared his vision that spreading technology can drastically improve the lives of the poor.
All over the world, poverty is the biggest problem that we have to eradicate. Innovation, technology, and the internet of things are a deadly combination today that can be used to help people lead better lives, he said.
Naidu mentioned that the Sri Lankan government had requested his state governments expertise in replacing traditional light bulbs with LED bulbs, a move that he said could save 40% of the energy used to power the street light system. He also mentioned plans to share groundwater-monitoring technology with Sri Lanka so that the government could determine groundwater levels and quality. Chief Minister Naidu also mentioned that Brandix has plans to invest around $1 billion in Andhra Pradesh, while his government will work with that of Sri Lanka to improve infrastructure both in Andhra Pradesh and Sri Lanka.
Naidu was extremely enthusiastic about Sri Lankas recent progress, noting that he was impressed by President Sirisenas efforts to strengthen parliament and the rule of law while also working to create a national identity that transcends race, ethnicity, and religion.
Im totally convinced Sri Lanka is a wonderful place that is moving in the right direction. In the future, we would like to work with the Sri Lankan government on various issues. We are all neighbors. In the future we can make better connectivity, he said. It is increased cooperation that, in his view would help to eradicate poverty, provide a basic minimum wage, improvetechnology skills, and allow each and every citizen to be happy and prosperous.

New era under the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration
When Sri Lanka ended its civil war in 2009, we had been fighting our internal conflict for close upon half our post-independence period of sixty-one years. That our most significant political engagements were not through dialogue and discourse but through armed conflict speaks volumes about the political weaknesses and fragility of South Asias oldest democracy.
We ended our civil war as a deeply divided nation. Polarised on ethnoreligious grounds, with badly wounded democratic and governance institutions and a sub-optimised economy which has made going abroad, for employment or migration Sri Lankas most popular occupational ambition, for both women and young people.
Sri Lanka has had in the past three decades, three conflicts, the military conflict between the State Security forces and the LTTE, the political power contest between the UNP and the SLFP and the ethnic problem between the Southern Sinhala polity and the Northern and Eastern based Tamil polity. These three conflicts were interlocking and influencing each other, addressing one conflict meant dealing with the other two power struggles as well.
Re-election of Mahinda Rajapaksa
The end of the war in 2009, not only ended the armed conflict between the State and the LTTE. The attendant change in the Tamil polity was that the leadership of the Tamil community changed from the armed and violent LTTE led by Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman to the democratic and relatively moderate TNA led by the R Sampanthan and M A Sumanthiran.
It is in this context that Sri Lanka headed into the 2010 presidential election, witnessing the re-election of Mahinda Rajapaksa. The most charitable understatement which can be said about the Rajapaksas second term, is that it was a wasted opportunity, which took Sri Lanka rapidly down the wrong path and mercifully for reasons as yet undisclosed, four years into a six-year term, Mahinda Rajapaksa called an election, which ended his rule and attendant dynastic ambitions.
Maithripala Sirisena and his allies within the rainbow coalition styled the Democratic National Front, a special purpose political vehicle acquired for the presidential election, campaigned on a platform of the three pillars of good governance, sustainable economic development and national reconciliation. To achieve this, they promised a national government and an entirely new political approach and policy framework. Contrary to joint opposition claims, the national government does have a popular mandate, not once but twice.
As we commemorate the second anniversary of the election of President Maithripala Sirisena, it is worth contemplating the political miracle which was wrought two years ago. In 2014, Mahinda Rajapaksa seemed unassailable, funding massive projects with rather expensive Chinese loans, booking no dissent by jailing his presidential election opponent, sacking Sri Lankas first female Chief Justice, governing inefficiently and corruptly while openly promoting his family and relatives in government positions.
The Rajapaksa political project was deeply entrenched in power and seemed good for decades more to come. The snap presidential election called for January 2015 was planned to be a Rajapaksa Vs the West campaign, painting Rajapaksa opponents as Western world lackeys, foreign funded NGOs, Tamil Diaspora, Muslim extremists and non-patriotic traitors.
Political skill and sagacity
It is a tribute to the political skill and sagacity of the matriarch of the founding family of the SLFP, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, that the most remarkable political coalition of all times, comprising remarkably Sinhala nationalists and Tamil nationalists, Marxists and neo-Liberals, all parts of the feuding Muslim polity, the then General Fonseka, civil society and professional groups all came together around a single common presidential candidate in Maithripala Sirisena, the genial, affable and soft-spoken General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
The election campaign of January 2015, transformed itself to a Rajapaksa and his minuscule allies of the UPFA Vs the rest, a political dynamic which still holds true and the result, was the election of Maithripala Sirisena as the sixth executive president of Sri Lanka.
With the formation of the National Government comprising both the UNP and the SLFP in 2015, the second conflict in Sri Lanka, or the political contest between the UNP and the SLFP has been halted for a term, to bring about through consensus and a unity government, the urgent state reforms, both political and economic, which Sri Lanka needs. The consequence of the 2015 elections is that Sri Lankas moderate political centre, in both the North and the South, expanded and is in power, unlike at any time in the past three decades. Creating a real opportunity for genuine change, which albeit does come slowly.
The year 2017, will be the critical year for the Sirisena - Wickremesinghe administration. The foundation for a new Sri Lanka is the work of the Constitutional Assembly, established to design a new constitution for Sri Lanka. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Sirisena presidency, the Parliament as the constitutional assembly would be debating and deciding how to proceed with the steering committee report on the proposed new constitution. There is a consensus emerging through the constitutional assembly process.
Local Government election
There is political drama, on the sidelines. Defeated president Mahinda Rajapaksa recently told the respected Indian journal The Hindu that he would topple the government in 2017. There has been some controversy amidst joint opposition hopes on a nation-wide Local Government election. But the real game changer, the substantive and sustainable basis for a new Sri Lanka is state reform, through constitutional reform.
Sri Lanka needs a new constitution, which will strengthen democracy and through devolution of power, ensure that the Sri Lankan state, reflects and accommodates the full diversity of her society. It was LTTE suicide bombing victim, late Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam who described this need best, as rectifying the anomaly of imposing a mono-ethnic state on a multi-ethnic polity.
Sri Lanka has experienced through both the 1972 and the 1978 constitutions a democratic deficit, caused by weak institutional checks and balances which significantly limited individual and human rights, resulting in internal rebellion and organised political violence. We need to rectify that situation. Beyond any other gains of the Sirisena -Wickremesinghe administration, this foundational reform, a new compact between the government and the governed, may be its most lasting legacy to Sri Lanka and her peoples.

No doubting Thomas as American leads Matsuyama by two shots
MAUI, Saturday: Justin Thomas, hunting his third PGA Tour victory, seized a two-shot lead after the third round of the SBS Tournament of Champions in Hawaii on Saturday but has the games hottest player, Japans Hideki Matsuyama, in close pursuit.
Co-leader overnight with fellow American Ryan Moore, the long-hitting Thomas eagled the par-four 14th and finished in style with a birdie at the last, where he two-putted from just short of the green, for a six-under 67 and an 18-under total of 201.
Thomas is seeking his first PGA Tour title on U.S. soil after claiming his first two wins at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia but will have to contend with Matsuyama in Sundays final round at the Kapalua Resort on the island of Maui.
Matsuyama, who has four victories in his last five starts worldwide, was alone in second place in the elite 32-man, winners-only field after firing a superb 66 that included five birdies in the last nine holes.
One factor in Thomas favour is that he is the only player to have beaten Matsuyama during his sizzling run of form, having triumphed by three strokes over the world number six at the CIMB Classic in October, but the young American is taking nothing for granted.
It's nice to be able to give yourself an opportunity in the first event of the New Year but there's 18 holes left and Hideki's the hottest golfer in the world right now, Thomas, 23, told Golf Channel.
I'm glad he had a little time off or else I wouldn't have liked my chances going into tomorrow, he said with a laugh.
Matsuyama is competing this week for the first time since he won the Tiger Woods-hosted Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas a month ago.
But he's still obviously playing great so it's going to be a great test ... I just need to go out there and do my job, Thomas said. Thomas broke clear of a congested leaderboard with a birdie at the par-four 12th, where he hit his second shot from 100 yards to within two feet of the flag. He then moved two strokes in front with his eagle at the 14th, reaching the green off the tee and rolling in a curling 22-footer.  Agencies

NO ONE CAN TOPPLE Government
The utterances that the good governance government will be toppled are only dreams and no one can topple this government, President Maithripala Sirisena emphasized while speaking at the main event to celebrate his completion of two years in office, at the BMICH yesterday.
I dare say that this strong government cannot be toppled and no one will be allowed to topple this national unity government which was formed amidst challenges and obstacles, the President said.
Certain politicians, who no longer have the peoples support, are boasting that the government will be toppled. But,I must say that this is only a pipe dream he added.
He also identified the abolition of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution which gave extraordinary powers to the President as a bigger victory than the passing of the 19th amendment which pruned the powers of the Executive President.
The event at the BMICH yesterday was held under the theme The dawn of three years in the era of sustainability.
The President went on to say It was vital to nullify the 18th Amendment than passing the 19th amendment to the Constitution as it is of paramount importantance to safeguard democracy, he said.
The President while speaking on the action plan of the country especially in the economic development sector, said the country will be subjected to a radical changes in several key fields. Accordingly, the President said that economic development drive is being carried out under the supervision of the Prime Minister.
Speaking on the moves to agriculture sector development, President Sirisena said that it has been planned to renovate all small tanks including channel system.
The President pointed out that the election manifesto,which forwarded at the Presidential election,clearly mentioned that a unity government would be formed even though certain bankrupt political forces are levelling allegations on this national unity government. He pointed out that the concept of a national unity government is not familiar with the political culture of the country.
However, the present unity government is being praised by many world leaders at various occasions. As a result of the democratic and people-friendly good-governance existing in the country, many challenges could be overcome and moreover the country is being widely accepted in the international arena especially at international forums. The country has achieved a significant progress in the spheres of protecting and safeguarding human rights, strengthening democracy, media freedom, freeing the judiciary system from the clutches of politics and many more positive achievements in various sectors as described in the election manifesto, the President said.
As a consequence of the failure to protect human rights, inability to face the economic crisis and failure to build up ethnic harmony was the very reason for the former government to dissolve it two years before the due period, President Sirisena said.
The bad economic management of the then government, there is a liability of Rs 9,000,000 million to be settled by this government, the President said.
Certain people tend to ask what this government has done during the last two years. I must say that this government has laid the foundation for democracy, freedom, ethnic harmony, achieving economic freedom and many more positive moves. Unlike the previous regime, no journalist was killed on the road or no one left the country for death fear to save the life. This is how everyone is experiencing media freedom, established by this government during the last two year period. Despite the fact that a mountain of loan amounting Rs. 9,000,000 million to be settled, several key development projects are being carried out. Even though, illuminated development projects are not carried out by this government, the economy of the country is gradually strengthening, the President said.
President Sirisena speaking on the political situation of the country said that certain people are boasting about toppling the government. Anyone can day dream but it is fruitless to talk about an election which will be held after four years, he said.
The President urged everyone to hand in hand to bring the country forward without marginalised in narrow minded political views.
No need to talk about toppling the government. Your duty is to take the country forward with this politically elected government the President said.
During his speech the President thanked 6.3 million people who voted for him at the Presidential election to form this unity government.

Over 100,000 jobs, US$ 5 bn investment  with Special Economic Zone: Yi Xianliang
Over 100,000 employment opportunities would be created while over US dollars 5 billion would be invested with the creation of the Special Economic Zone in Hambantota Chinas Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang said. This would be in three years.
I believe this zone will be the most important economic activity for this government and particular for Hambantota people, Xianliang said.
The ambassador said over 50 Chinese business people who contributed to Sri Lanka during the past would also be potential investors for this Sri Lanka-China industrial zone.
Chinese Ambassador pledged that Sri Lankas law and environmental standards will be complied with thorough out the whole process.
This is not only my promise but also all the Chinese business people. We will respect the decision taken by Sri Lankan government and its people.
In the past 50 or 60 years China affords nearly 20 billion US dollars financial assistance including loans, donations to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is the number two to get the most support from China in the world, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said creating the special area for Chinese investors was aimed to making the debt-burdened Hambantota port viable.
The Hambantota port was going to sink us (Sri Lanka), but we are now trying to leverage it to create new economic activity and boost growth, Wickremesinghe said. (SS)

An overview of economic performance : Solid foundation laid, but more needs to be done
Sri Lanka's coalition Government has now been in office for two years; the new president was elected two years ago and the new coalition in Parliament was formed some eight months later. How has it fared, particularly in the sphere of economics
To put things in proper perspective we must appreciate the unique political moment in which the new administration operates. The change of regime was a shock and expectations soared; perhaps to levels that were unrealistic. The disappointment has now set in as the coalition Government, made up of disparate parties with different agendas unexpectedly propelled to power has grappled with a Gordian knot of issues.
Economic liberalism, good governance, ethnic reconciliation and a sensible foreign policy were expected to materialise overnight. While significant strides have been made they have fallen short of public expectations.
Careful handling
On the economic front in particular expectations have proved to be far too high. The Government has treaded very cautiously, shying away from tackling unpopular reforms and unravelling the web of protectionist regulation that grew up around many sectors of the economy under the 'import substitution' label.
Part of the problem has been in the communication, the public were not aware of the precarious state of the finances that the new Government inherited.
The IMF, in its review in September 2014, noted that "public debt and debt service remain high by international comparison, reserves are limited, tax revenues are low, and medium-term sustainability depends heavily on continued growth and a positive external environment." In 2014 the debt/GDP ratio stood at 75% and debt service costs accounted for 90% of Government revenue. Interest cost alone amounted to 37% of Government revenue.
Despite the bleak economic situation, prompted by forthcoming parliamentary elections in August 2015, the new Government announced a wave of populist measures -increases in salaries, subsidies and reduced fuel costs, amongst others.
These were probably necessary to win the election. Flush from electoral victory the new regime may not even have realised the full depth of the problem they were dealing with: there were periodic news reports announcing various apparently unrecorded liabilities being unearthed during their first few months in office. Unfortunately having won the election, the Government was unable to roll back any of the giveaways or make any headway in reducing the size of the state. Politically expedient but economically unsustainable the resulting fiscal, balance of payments crisis and IMF bailout were inevitable.
Tough measures followed in the budget of November 2016. Personal and corporate income taxes were increased along with VAT and taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Though unpopular these should provide the macro-economic stability within which the Government can embark on a serious programme of reforms. The time for proper reform is now upon us. Eminent economist, Professor Razeen Sally warned that Sri Lanka is in a period of dangerous policy drift and that the window of opportunity for economic was narrowing and that Sri Lanka should not 'miss the bus'.
What needs to be done
Now that the tax rates have been raised to a level where the fiscal deficit is under control for the moment, it must be secured for the medium term. This means that the State must keep its expenditure under control; no more populist unfunded giveaways, a freeze on recruitment and a general economy drive eschewing extravagance, the elimination corruption and waste through increased transparency and open processes.
This must be followed by measures to start trimming the state. There is some public support for privatisation in a few sectors at least. The government should push ahead with these and list the entities on the stock exchange. The formula used in privatisation during the1980's: sale of a majority stake, a public listing for 20% of the shares with 10% of the equity given free to employees proved to be both popular and successful. It will also give a boost to the flagging stock market and send an important signal to investors that Sri Lanka is ready for business.
Improving the business climate
Some measures have already been announced, which is welcome, but more needs to be done. There is still a need to cut red tape: business regulations must be simplified, the number of approvals for investment minimised and these should be processed by a genuine one-stop-shop rather than a multitude of ministries, and despatched in a matter of days and weeks rather than months. Digitisation and reducing bureaucratic discretion are the way to go.
This in turn will lay the foundation for the big reform which is to reorient policy towards FDI and exports. The trade and FDI regime needs to be liberalised: import tariffs minimised, customs procedures simplified, non- tariff barriers to imports such as quotas/licensing arrangements should be abolished as far as practicable.
If implemented properly, the reforms should take Sri Lanka back on a path of sustainable growth resulting in improved livelihoods for its citizens.
The overall conclusion on the economy over the past two years is similar to contemplating a glass; half full or half empty, depending on perspective. The government has the opportunity to change this perspective to one of near full, provided the moment is seized and a reform programme moves ahead without delay.

Pelwatte Dairy on quest to making Sri Lanka self-sufficient in milk
Pelwatte Dairy Industries Ltd, a leading manufacturer of locally produced dairy products has since its inception supported the local dairy industry and is on a quest to making Sri Lanka self-sufficient in milk.
According to local statistics Sri Lanka spends 400 million dollars annually to import more than 80,000 tonnes of milk powder and milk based products.
It is indeed a sad state of affairs that such a large sum of money is drained out of the country every year, especially when Sri Lanka is in possession of all resources necessary to be self-sufficient in milk.
All facilities, highest grade cattle, ample grazing grounds, and highly skilled traditional dairy farmers are all at our disposal.
Yet, we rely on unhealthy, chemically enhanced milk foods that are imported in to the country, said Chairman, Ariyaseela Wickramanayake.
Taking on this mission of uplifting the dairy industry in Sri Lanka, Pelwatte Dairy at present directly employs 350 people while 25,000 farmers and their families are benefitted indirectly by the companys efforts.
Almost 150,000 -200,000 liters of milk is collected per day at collections points situated in close proximity to dairy farming communities, before being transported to the Pelwatte Dairy factory in Buttala.
Many of Pelwatte Dairys direct employees have been with the company right from the start supporting the managements noble vision. Another factor that has ensured the companys high retention rate is that each employee is considered a vital part of the network and is treated with the utmost respect.
All employees and their families are covered with health insurance, while all products are made available to employees are concessionary rates. An employee welfare association also ensures that the wants and needs of each employee are looked in to constantly.
Pelwatte Dairy has become such a part and parcel of peoples lives that 72-year old M. G. Chandrasena who is the current Executive Director has been involved with the company from the very beginning.
He started off as the General Manager when the company commenced operations in 2008 by taking over a land in the Moneragala District which was an area reserved as a junk yard. After laying the foundation he was involved in all the tasks of importing machinery, installation, starting the farm, training the youth for the dairy industry and much more to get the constructions of Plant 1 done and initiate productions.
In an area where employment was so difficult for the youth he was involved in recruiting and training from the casual worker to the graduates from that area.
Pelwatte Dairy created many job opportunities in that area and has gone on to produce world class dairy products in Moneragala with the involvement of the locals.
Chandrasena is today the most senior dairy farm manager in the country. Although he has completed 70 years and wanted to resign in April this year, the management decided to keep him longer due to his valuable input to the dairy industry.
Aiming to create a positive attitude towards locally produced dairy products, healthy and safe Pelwatte Dairy milk powder, butter, yoghurt, ice cream, pasteurized milk, and vanilla or chocolate flavoured milk is made using milk freshly collected and used within 24 hours.

The peoples victory of January 2015 : Reflections on the state of the nation
Maithripala Sirisena, elected the 6th executive President of Sri Lanka on January 8, 2015, was the victor over a highly popular and seemingly invincible opponent. Nevertheless, it was a victory of the people of Sri Lanka, as President Sirisena himself has often said. It became a peoples victory because the battle was between a political ideal and a personality.
Ranil Wickremesinghe, for example, had to sacrifice what in retrospect seems to have been a good chance to be the President. He made way for a man who had a decidedly better chance of defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa, a strongman president with a cult following.
Maithripala Sirisena had to take an enormous risk in coming forward. He, perhaps more than anyone else, knew the consequences of a possible defeat having seen the trials and tribulations that Sarath Fonseka had to suffer in 2010 after failing to dislodge incumbent Rajapaksa at the January 2010 presidential race.
Dissident Sirisena took a risk that few in this world would have taken and deserves all the accolades that followed his victory.
Nevertheless, it was not his victory alone. Every single individual who openly supported the Sirisena candidacy was taking an enormous risk. The vindictiveness of the previous regime, after all, was not a secret. Prominent representatives of civil society, led of course by the late Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, leaders of political parties and other political organisations including trade unions, professional, academics and media personalities rose to the occasion.
Most importantly, the crucial votes came from people who decided that ending decades-long terrorism did not give the incumbent a license for perpetual and corrupt rule. The anti-Rajapaksa bloc vote was also necessary to deliver the January 2015 outcome.
I remember that day very well. On election day, as I left home, my wife asked me the question that probably troubled many who voted for Maithripala Sirisena: What if Mahinda Rajapaksa wins
I told her that he would be defeated but that he might not leave office in a hurry. It was a concern that was shared by many. It was a justified fear of people in our families due to what we had to suffer during the previous regime. There were many who were forced to leave the country.
Even some Sri Lankan expatriates were scared to be seen in the company of political refugees from home fearing a backlash from the Rajapaksa regime. The general attitude could be summed up this way: if Mahinda doesnt like you, please understand, we cannot be associated with you in any way. It was not only high profile individuals like Sarath Fonseka and former Chief Justice, Shirani Bandaranayake, who invited the wrath of the Rajapaksas.
There were many ways in which critics of the regime could be made to pay and indeed most of them were made to pay dearly for the choices they made.
First and foremost, then, the January 8 result made my wifes question irrelevant. Importantly and happily President Maithripala Sirisena did not engage in the kind of witch-hunt that his opponent in all likelihood would have carried out had the outcome been different. It was clear from the outset that rule of law had another chance in this country.
It is now two years since that historic peoples victory. Anniversaries of significant political moments naturally call for retrospect. The time that has passed is often described in terms of progress made. The delivery of promises made or otherwise is assessed. Errors are enumerated. Recommendations for rectification are proposed along with blue-prints for the way forward.
What was Sri Lanka immediately before January 8, 2015 I believe it was a sick patient. I believe it was a patient plagued by multiple and near-fatal ailments. It was a patient battered, bruised and bleeding from multiple and life-threatening injuries.
It was, however, a patient that was well dressed to hide the wounds and one that had a face so heavily and even artistically made up. The first impression was of a person in the pink of health. Pretence can hold up only for so long. The decaying body gives out foul odours. They break through all cosmetics. The truth was ready to emerge and emerge it did in the form of a telling electoral defeat for the Rajapaksa regime.
This is what the new government inherited. It was tasked to treat and revive a dying patient. Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe were charged with bringing back to health a patient who had been poisoned and thereafter treated by quack doctors who dealt with symptoms and not the disease, who used bandages to cover up wounds without treating them. Truth be told, even the physicians thus tasked learned of the true nature of the ailments only much later. Perhaps this is why, two years later, Maithripala Sirisenas manifesto and the timeframe that the new dispensation set out for itself appears to have been over-ambitious.
-Sri Lankas prognosis-
It is in this context that one must assess performance. The problem of inaccurate assessment of a patients condition is that it leads to expectations that are unrealistic. For example, you cannot expect a fast bowler who has had knee-surgery to perform at full pace immediately after leaving hospital. Indeed he would need several weeks or months of therapy to get back to full fitness.
Sri Lankas case is far worse. As mentioned, the patient had multiple ailments, some of which were evident in part by symptoms and some which were hidden or at least not easily identified. It is as though the patient had high cholesterol, was a chronic diabetic, had several malignancies and had been kicked in his kidneys, had a couple of ribs broken and also been shot in the leg.
Expecting the patient to walk out of hospital after a couple of pain-killers would be a tall order indeed. Expecting the patient to run a marathon is absolutely out of the question.
However, it has to be remembered that the conditions are not untreatable. Proper medication, proper therapy and proper care can do the job, In this, the government can count some successes but also has to acknowledge failures. Some drugs dont work on some patients and wrong prescription are not unheard of in the medical profession. However, we are not talking about the right leg being amputated when it is the left leg that needed to be removed. The mistakes that have been made are not irreversible.
It is no easy task to revive a collapsed economy, restore a failing democracy and bring about reconciliation and national unity. Each of these, even if they had to be dealt with separately, would have been tough. This government has had to attend to all these simultaneously. Naturally there has been more progress in certain areas while successes on other fronts have been modest.
The best performance has been in the sphere of democratisation. The 19th Amendment, which curtailed the powers of the president, strikingly with the full support of the very man who enjoyed the near dictatorial powers, was a significant achievement. It also included the setting up of independent commissions on multiple subjects. The Right to Information Act, likewise, was a significant achievement. The true benefits of these measures will no doubt take some time to be fully appreciated.
They seek to change the anti-democratic culture that has plagued this country, a condition which was ironically constitutionally enshrined. Politicians as well as the general citizenry are yet to fully understand the potential of these changes. No doubt, in time, their reference and subsequent application and the inherent empowerment will be realised. Already weve seen how the space for criticism has expanded. Those taken to task by the media and by other sections of the polity are engaged with and not abducted. Due process in all matters is slowly but surely becoming a reality. If electoral reforms are instituted as per the promised 20th Amendment, democracy will well and truly be on the path to full recovery.
The economy is decidedly a more delicate matter. It has been unfortunately marked by indiscipline. Almost everything has been framed by the self-serving needs of those in high places of power. The politicisation of anything and everything didnt make the country investor-friendly. Foreign relations being at an all-time low didnt help either. To put it in a nutshell, the economy was on its last legs. In contrast to democratising reform, an economy cannot be turned around by edict. There are things that can be controlled and things that are out of the hands of the men and women in charge, in this case global factors. The medicine can be bitter and the surgery painful. There are no magic injections that will set things right overnight. Gains on one front often coincide with losses on another. It is inevitably a slow and painful process. Establishing fiscal discipline can cause a lot of discomfort.
Rooting out corruption and cronyism is not an easy task either. Gains have been made but the destination is still quite a distance away.
The same can be said of the reconciliation process. The most important difference has been in the area of trust. A space for dialogue has been created and with democratic reforms this can only grow. It has been established now that there are no winners in a conflict and that reconciliation is about building trust and building on trust to build partnerships. Unity never comes cheap. It is never a quick fix. It takes time to forge. The forging instruments are now in the hands of the people.
Yes, the people. They made this change possible. If the government is considered to be a team of physicians, then all the institutions and all the people including members of the government in their personal capacities must be considered the patient that we referred to above. The body must also fight and be a partner in the process of healing. A patient that is in the dark about the ailments is not an ally but in fact can rebel against the process of recovery and even be an enemy to himself or herself.
Communication challenge
This, I believe, is the biggest failure of the government. The true nature of the tasks at hand have not been communicated to the people. The people still expect quick fixes to the plethora of ailments. They want to be up and running, not realising that the track is not yet ready and the preparation is still in its initial stage which, as always, is slow and involves a lot of hard work, patience and understanding.
Of course it is easier to market cosmetics as opposed to ill-health. Bad news does not make anyone happy. However, the truth has to be communicated and communicated effectively. This is something this government has failed to do. Ironically, it is almost as if the government is scared to tell the truth to the very people that brought it to power.
This country will not be ready for economic take-off over the next few days. People will not be waking up tomorrow to find peace and prosperity at their doorsteps. The government has to revisit the period preceding January 2015 and remember that the electoral victory was possible because the people believed there could be change. That belief was reconfirmed in August 2015. Mahinda Rajapaksas sway over the media did not stop the people from thinking independently, being critical and acting out on their perceptions.
Even as the government moves on democratisation, economic rebuilding and reconciliation, it has to work as hard on communicating the hard truths relevant to all these processes. The government has to believe that the people can still believe in the government.
The marathon can be run, this is certain. After two years, only light jogging is possible. Given all the obstacles that this government inherited and given the incompetency it is saddled in part due to a long standing human resource crisis in the country we will not see things in full stride in the short term. It is reasonable to predict that things will be clearer and better by the year 2020, but for this to happen, important steps have to be taken right now, that is in the year 2017, to correct the correctible errors, get things back on track and above all to be brutally honest about everything to the people. This is because it was a peoples victory that we saw in January 2015. The people deserve to know the truth and in fact progress is clearly possible only if the people know the truth and decide to support progressive efforts simply because they feel empowered by the fact that they have been taken into confidence.
January 2015 was a peoples victory. Sustaining the gains clearly depend on whether or not the people remain with the government. They will be if they believe they are still partners of the forces that they brought to power. Making them continue to believe is the challenge. It is a challenge that has two distinct components: getting the job done and keeping the people informed of all aspects of the process at all times.

Over 26,000 employment opportunities would be available to the youth of the country in the foreseeable future, revealed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the opening ceremony of the US$ 50 million ATG Hand Care(Pvt) Ltd facility in Koggala on Friday.
The premier said he had participated along with the President in several ceremonies this week like the MAS Fabric Park in Pannala, the Western Automobile Assembly Factory in Kuliyapitiya, Rigit Tyre Factory Horana and the ATG Hand Care facility in Koggala which will open 16,000 job opportunities to the youth.
He said the first phase of ATG Hand Care when completed will offer 4,000 jobs and during the second phase another 4,000 will be provided employment. The first phrase in Hambantota itself will provide another 10,000 jobs which will total to 26,000, the premier said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe having a discussion with Fazal Abdeen, Joint Managing Director, ATG Group at the opening on Friday. 
Wickremesinghe said the Koggala FTZ has been in existence for 23 years and today provides employment to 22,000. However with the projects that his national government has initiated within one week, much more than that figure will receive employment in the future.
The Prime Minister said that it was still not sufficient and more job opportunities and income avenues must be generated for the people of the country.
Now investors are coming to Sri Lanka. We have to create an environment that secures the investments of whoever comes in. Lanka needs to have the political stability that exists in Europe and India in order to accomplish that task and for the first time we will create that stability, Wickremesinghe insisted.
President J R Jayewardene initiated massive development projects. But with the advent of war these developments came to a halt. Even after the war ended the development did not start.
That is why they decided to carry out a much more vigorous development drive, Wickremesinghe said. In 1977 Sri Lanka had to compete with countries like Singapore and Malaysia. Today Sri Lanka has to compete with India, China Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Pakistan in Asia itself, he said.
That was why after establishing a stable government it is required to penetrate foreign markets. This is why the need arose to go for free trade agreements (FTAs) with India and China to enter those markets he said. He said the GST+ concession will also be obtained for this purpose. Wickremasing said negotiations were also on to sign a FTA with Japan.
The only country left was America. As Americas policy was yet not clear, once it gets clear focus can also be placed in America, as Sri Lanka has created a huge market there.
Two new industrial zones will be setup in Elementwatta and Kaburupitiya. A high end tourism zone from Bentara to Galle will also be set up for tourists who could spend over US$ 1,000 per night.
The Prime Minister said there were mounting plans for Galle. The city will be expanded and made an IT and computer industry hub. Also measures will be taken to boost the Cinnamon industry in a big way.
Apart from Hambantota we will start development drive in Trincomalee. India, Japan and Singapore will assist us in this endeavour, he said.
PM questioned as why one should not redress the burning monitory issues with the assistance of foreign countries. We have no money.
We are bankrupt. What is wrong if we take money from China, India, Japan or America and solve our issues he questioned.
All these measures will be taken to provide employment to youth in the country and uplift the living standards of the people, he said.

President intensifies battle against CKDu
President Maithripala Sirisena is to meet all ambassadors to Sri Lanka to seek international facilitation for the battle against Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain Etilogy (CKDu), currently progressing full force ahead, the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease said.
A special hospital for CKD, funded by the Chinese government is to be established in Polonnaruwa, Presidential Task Force on Prevention of CKDu project director Asela Iddawela also said.
Iddawela further said they are focused on coordinating researchers on the chronic kidney disease, early detection of patients and supplying clean drinking water.
We have set stage a consortium for national and international teams researching on CKDu in Sri Lanka. Such coordination was nonexistent before. The researches have not yet identified what causes this chronic kidney disease, Iddawela said.
The Presidential Task Force on Prevention of CKDu together with the Health Ministry and the Social Welfare Ministry hase supplied clean drinking water for 58,000 families in affected areas, distributing 11 water filters worth Rs. 208 million, Iddawela pointed out.
New Irrigation projects in Medirigiriya, Galgamuwa, Matale and some other areas, will produce clean drinking water for more than 100,000 families who are in affected areas, Iddawela further said.
Asked on the agro-chemical pesticides still circulating in the market suspected to be a cause for CKDu, Iddawela said President Sirisena has ordered the Agriculture Department to take strict legal action against selling such harmful pesticides.
Director-General of Public Health ( DDGPH) Dr Sarath Amunugama said kidney donation is to be promoted since kidney transplant is the best treatment for the CKDu patients.
A card has been issued for the interested kidney donators to give permission for them to donate their kidneys if they are to have a sudden death, Dr. Amunugama said.
He further said that the cases identified as CKDu, have slightly risen in 2016.
This rise may have been due to the method we followed to identify patients. We do not wait until the patients come to us. We reach the villages where CKDu has been reported and do regular check-ups. We have reached more than 300,000 villages to check on the spread of the disease. Dr. Amunugama said.
Around 21,000 patients are identified to be suffering from CKDu. Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts record the highest number of CKDu patients, followed by Kurunegala, Vavunia and Matale.

Custody of a child
Question
My wife has filed a maintenance case, claiming maintenance for her and our daughter. We have been living separately for three years. My daughter is now 10 years. She is living with my wife. I pay Rs. 15,000 per month to my daughter. Can I ask my daughters custody in my maintenance case My wife is not allowing me to meet the child. I tried to meet her at school, but was not allowed. Please advise me, what are the legal remedies available
Karunarathne, Katana
Answer
You cant claim custody in the maintenance case. But you can request the court to give access to your child as you are paying maintenance to your child. If you need the custody of your child you have to file a custody case in the District Court. However as the upper guardian, the Court will consider the best interest of your daughter and give custody to a suitable parent.
Second copy of a Deed
Question
I bought a land five years ago. I am trying to sell the land to another person. I applied for a second copy of the deed of transfer and the Land Registry informed me that the notary who executed the deed has not handed over the second copy with stamp duty. But I paid the notary the total cost including the stamp duty on the date of execution. Will this situation affect my ownership rights
Pujitha, Matara
Answer
It is the duty of the Notary to submit duplicates of the deeds he executed to the Land Registry where he practices before the 15th of every month. If the notary has given you the registered original deed it will not affect your rights. However, as you have paid the stamp duty and the notary hasnt taken steps to register the second copy, it will be a ground to take disciplinary action against the Notary.

The Mediation Boards Commission (the Commission) consists of five members appointed by the President for a period of three years. Three of the members are required to be from among persons who have held judicial office in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal (the highest courts in the land), one of whom is appointed as Chairman of the Commission.
The Commission is vested with the power of appointing mediators. It is also vested with powers of dismissal and disciplinary control of mediators and of supervising and controlling the performance and discharge of the functions and duties of mediators.
The Commission functions as an independent body and the mandatory inclusion therein of persons of the calibre of retired Judges of the Appellate Courts is an attempt to ensure its independence and inspire confidence in its impartiality.

Rajapaksa family behind tense situation in Hambantota: Sujeewa Senasinghe
The tense situation at created at Hambantota Port was the doings of rabble-rouses who are politically bankrupt, State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said at a media briefing held yesterday.
If the call records of the Rajapaksas were checked, one could easily understand who were behind these violent protests, Senasinghe said.
The Rajapaksa family, other than former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa and members of the Joint opposition are behind these protests. There was a Court order against certain individuals who organized the protest. They were misleading innocent people for their own political gains, Senasinghe said.
We are not sure whether the bhikkhus who pelted stones at the police are really monks who were dressed as monks. These people are utterly misled by false allegations made by MR followers, he said.
Minister Senasinghe further said the police should have been strict on the violent protesters.
These protesters forcefully entered the premises where the ceremony for laying the foundation stone for the Hambantota Industrial Zone was taking place, Senasinghe said.
Minister of Irrigation and Water Management Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa pointed out that the protesters forcefully entered a location where the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister were present.
What else can the police do other than using minimum force against these violent protesters What if they attacked the Prime Minister and the Chinese Ambassador Minister Vijayamuni Soysa, questioned.
It is unworthy of the JO to carry out such disgraceful antics and mislead the public and the Maha Sangha, Minister Vijayamuni Soysa, further said.
Soysa further said that the governments Yahapalana approach should not be misread as not being persistent. More than 20 people including security personnel were injured, 52 arrested and about 20 remanded due to the protest against the Sri Lanka - China Logistics and Industrial Zone.The briefing was held at the Department of Government Information.
