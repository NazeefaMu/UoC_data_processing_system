Terrorists would not come under Reparations Acts purview
The Reparations Act has been brought to pay compensation in respect of truly disappeared persons and those who suffered damage on account of war and other turmoil, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
"This is different to the way Rajapaksa paid salaries and compensation to terrorist leaders such as KP, Ram and Nagulan, who massacred innocent civilians in their hundreds," he said.
Minister Ranawaka was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for the proposed new trade complex building at Kolonnawa, recently.
The minister said an office for paying reparations has been established to which the President would appoint officials to pay reparations to people who have undergone suffering on account of the war and gone missing.
"The Office for Missing Persons would nominate people who had truly gone missing. Thereafter, it would investigate the accuracy of the claimant and see whether he or she had truly disappeared or is living abroad before paying compensation," the minister said.
"Earlier, compensation was granted according to an archaic law enacted in 1987 and the payment was carried out by Divisional Secretaries. It was to streamline this process and offer proper guidelines, that the Reparations Act was enacted," he added.
Minister Ranawaka said nearly 12,600 LTTE terrorists surrendered to the Security Forces during the last stages of the war.
"Of them, LTTE leaders such as KP, Ram and Nagulan were even paid salaries by Rajapaksa. They were people responsible for the massacre of hundreds of innocent civilians in Moneragala, Kataragama and elsewhere. Another group of nearly 1,000 terrorists were deployed for Army intelligence services and paid monthly salaries by Rajapaksa. When they questioned about these payments, the answer given was that they would ensure a vote bank for the Rajapaksa regime from the Vanni and the Eastern Province at the next election," Minister Ranwaka alleged.
Minister Ranawaka said he would challenge Rajapaksa to come forward and deny that they paid salaries and compensation to surrendered LTTE terrorist cadres through Army intelligence services.
Minister Ranawaka said the government would bring in a new Counter Terrorism Act to replace the PTA. Once the Supreme Court opinion was received for it by the Speaker, it would be brought before Parliament. It was the people who were not even seen during the final do-or-die battle against terrorists who now try to pose as national heroes on Facebook.
"Terrorism would come under the old PTA. Terrorists would not come under the purview of the Reparations Act. A lot of false rumours were being spread in the country. The government displayed a weakness by not countering them. People in the North and South should resolve to join hands and march forward without getting misled by false rumours spread by those forces with vested interests and ulterior motives," the minister said.

Prevention of elephant-train collisions:
Committee Report presented to minister
The Committee Report proposing recommendations on preventing elephanttrain collisions on railway tracks was handed over to Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva by the Committee members on Thursday.
The Committee has recommended the introduction of a telephone alert system to warn train drivers about the presence of elephants on railway tracks, clearing of shrubs in an area up to 30 metres on either side of the railway tracks, enforcing train speed limits, building paths (overpasses and underpasses) for elephant crossings at multiple locations, removal of obstructions in elephant crossings at locations with bridges and erecting electric and bio fences at places where elephants enter.
The report has proposed a system whereby the installation of sensors in low-lying areas (cuttings) on railway tracks would trigger an alarm if breached by elephants transmitting an automatic signal to the engine driver to stop the train.
The report also suggests the installation of an automatic device to scare away elephants walking on tracks when a train is approaching and issuing warnings to engine drivers to alert them that an elephant is on the track. Fitting a horn to issue a warning to approaching engine drivers to reduce the speed of the train when an elephant is on the track and the installation of thermal Vision-Digital Active PTZ camera to identify live objects on the track, are among the other proposals.
A month has been granted for public consultations and submissions for this report. Once the public consultations are over, a draft proposal will be made to estimate the expenses involved and to seek Cabinet approval for the project.
Thirty places where underpasses can be built and 22 places where overpasses can be built on the railway track beyond Mahawa for the smooth passage of elephants have been identified.
A team of 14 officials of the Railways and Wildlife Department appointed on the instruction of Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, have observed the elephant transit points along the Northern and Eastern railway lines to make recommendations for preventing elephanttrain collisions.
The team was engaged in the observation of elephant transit points along the Northern and Eastern railway lines starting from Mahawa Railway Station, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Anuradhapura, Thalaimannar and Kankesanthurai from October 11 to 14.
Department of Railways, Project Director of Elephant Collisions Irosh Perera said elephants freely move from wildlife protected areas to forest reserves and vice versa, which also include their home ranges.
"The obstruction and blockage of elephant corridors due to human activities has ultimately led to elephants having to cross railway lines, thus invading villages. In a conflict situation, both humans and elephants have impacts from the other," Perera said.
"It is necessary to build a safe environment for elephants and special attention should be paid to the elephant corridor. We should focus on scientific methods to prevent this crisis," he said.
"We have identified 142 kilometres of track where elephants are vulnerable to collide with trains. The other identified zones are 188 km-long mid-level danger area, 38 km-long low-danger area and 294 km-long zone where elephants do not roam. Accordingly, an area of 368 km has been identified as a zone where elephants roam freely," Perera said.
"We have found many reasons for elephant-train collisions. Among them are non-visibility of elephants at bends, non-visibility of elephants due to shrub jungles on both sides of the track and poor lighting on the headlights of trains, he added.

CP farmers asked to use fertilisers low in phosphorous
The Agriculture Ministry has recommended that farmers in the Central Province use fertiliser with reduced levels of phosphorous for vegetables and other crops.
The ministry in a press release yesterday noted that at a meeting held on Thursday evening under the patronage of Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, experts in the field of fertiliser highlighted the issue of high phosphorous fertiliser.
They said the soil phosphorous content in the Central Province was high and thus, applying chemical fertiliser high in phosphorous caused damage to the soil fertility conditions and eventually made the soil unsuitable for cultivation.
The minister thus directed the Agriculture Department to prepare a long-term plan for the country on the use of fertiliser that is suited to the soil condition in the area.

A CREEPING CALAMITY
The traditions of all the dead generations weighs like an incubus upon the brain of the living - Karl Marx
No other country I knew had so many layers of wretchedness, and few countries were as populous. I felt I was in a continent where, separate from the rest of the world, a mysterious calamity had occurred. Yet what was overwhelming to me, so much in the foreground, was not to be found in modern day writing I knew, Indian or English. In one Kipling story an Indian famine was a background to an English romance. The extraordinary distress of India, when acknowledged, was something given, eternal, something to be read only as background.
It took time to break through the bias and fantasies of Indian political ideas about the Indian past. The independence struggle, the movement against the British, had obscured the calamities of India before the British. Evidence of those calamities lay on every side. But the independence movement was like a religion; it didnt see what it didnt want to see.
For more than six hundred years after 1000 A.D. the Muslim invaders had ravaged the subcontinent at will. They had established kingdoms and empires and fought with one another. They had obliterated temples and local religions.
For twentieth-century Indian nationalism those centuries of defeat were awkward. So history was re-jigged; ruler and the ruled before the British, conqueror and the subject, believer and infidel became one. In the face of the great British power, it made a kind of sense, to promote the idea of the wholeness of India, before the British.
The fourteenth-century Moroccan Muslim theologian and world traveller Ibn Battuta didnt fit in so easily with this idea of Indian wholeness. Ibn Battuta wished to travel to all the countries of the Muslim world. Everywhere he went he lived on the bounty of Muslim rulers. He came to India as a conquered Muslim land. He was granted the revenues (or crops) of five villages, then-in spite of a famine two more. In Ibn Battutas narrative the local people were only obliquely seen. They were serfs in the village (property of the ruler, that could be offered the traveler) or simple slaves (Ibn Battuta liked to travel with slave girls).
The Muslim ruler in Delhi, Ibn Battutas ultimate patron, liked blood, daily executions and torture on the threshold of his hall of audience, with bodies left lying for days. Even Ibn Battuta, though used to the ways of Muslim despots the world over, began to take fright. When four guards were set to watch him, he thought his time had come... - Reading and Writing - VS Naipaul
Legal deadlocks and muddles
Despite the shared heritage, we have been mercifully spared the extremes of the Subcontinent. Our poverty is not desperate; our crowds, not the teeming millions of India, less overwhelming. The island is not subject to the extreme moods of nature as much, a climate relatively mild, possessing a generous soil. It appears this moderation of climate is complemented by the make- up of the islands inhabitants, the noticeable absences of large personalities; leaders, writers, artists, industrialists, only of middling order, in aspect as well as aptitude; of no lasting stature, leave alone any relevance outside of our shores.
It is difficult to imagine a ruling class which mocks the concept as much as what we have brought forth, managing only pseudo nationalists in the native garb or fraudulent mimics in western attire. There is neither inspiration nor moral leadership to be found. Anything our leaders put their hands to, will atrophy, eventually becoming another burden the nation must carry.
Inept attempts at constitution/law making has led only to legal deadlocks and muddles. In our so called development efforts since independence, it is the under-performance that strikes the eye; the corruption, the mediocre growth (rate) and the smallness of the nations achievements. For long we have been planting basics like rice, tea and rubber. Yet, our harvests from these crops slag behind India, per acre wise, itself a low yield producer. Even at sports, at the recently held Asian Games the country failed to win a single medal, placed behind much smaller nations; small people, big talk, small doings.
I quoted at length from Naipaul, because one cannot lay bare the Subcontinents agonies and the confusions more perceptively than the Nobel Prize winning writer. On a much smaller stage, with local deviations, our history too follows similar patterns. We also are quick to lay the blame for our ills on the foreign powers which dominated the island for nearly five hundred years. When the European seafarers moored their ships in our bays, our political unity was already fractured and whatever power we could claim was infinitely inferior to what the strangers could command. History teaches us that new and better ideas will overcome the old and ineffective, the progressive will eventually oust the regressive.
Past glories
When it comes to claiming past glories, we are second to none; not only a ready granary for the neighbouring countries encountering food shortages. (The rice variety we grow today has no market outside of the country) but also a technological marvel capable of even making flying machines. Little merit is given to the impact of later advances in transport, banking, and communication which revolutionized trade between nations, from the primitive and sporadic bartering that prevailed until then. If the lost manuscripts that recorded the specifications of the ancient flying-machine are unearthed now, we surely could transform our present low-tech economy.
Having played no role in the dazzling advances in science and technology of the last few centuries, we downgrade the know-how required to take flight as well as navigate heavy machines in the air. Confronting a distressing reality, there is comfort in fantasy and mythology.
The evening of our civilization had begun long before the European adventurers sighted our shores. History does not stand still, but the kings did. In nearly everything; new ideas, technology, methods and capabilities the visitors from the far-away lands were resurgent, while we were on the wane. Societies that do not evolve and move forward will recede, and be beaten.
A mysterious calamity had befallen India thought Naipaul, a calamity that happened gradually, imperceptibly, leaving the Subcontinent completely sapped; absurdly poor and weak. The colonial rule united the vast land, gave it cohesion, bestowing new ideas and institutions of governance .In recent times, the economic model of India has begun to change. Not only that the vast Indian diaspora is investing in the country, but are also bringing new ideas to their old land. Perhaps there is a glimmer of hope for the millions calling India home now; a quality of life which could be seen and experienced, categorized, counted and given value, not just fantasy and legend.
A calamity has hit Sri Lanka too; an early agrarian society has ended up a struggling nation in a perpetual state of crisis. Hugely in debt, we are even proud to be considered credit worthy by an international lending organisation, in the manner of a village boutique keeper bragging about a small facility extended by a rural bank to steady his unstable enterprise.
A major source of foreign exchange for the country, as well as a mode of upliftment for many families, is foreign employment. These are mainly in blue collar and domestic capacities, a good number filled by females. Our so called public service; politicized, inefficient and corrupt; is viewed only as a safe and secure way of earning a livelihood with no occupational demands or responsibilities. Other countries loathe to encourage Sri Lankans to visit them, entry Visas are granted most grudgingly, after a demeaning process of verifying the integrity of the applicant. No one wants our currency either, the value of the Rupee sliding nearly on a daily basis.
These are not considered in tolerable humiliations or even extraordinary misfortunes, but only as a given, unchanging background. There is poverty, corruption, degradation, they have always been there, nothing can be done about them! For those who may, like Ibn Battuta, the idea of fleeing the gory scene, or in terms of modern choices, the attraction of a dual citizenship, beckons irresistibly.
In these bleak times we need men with vision, courage, resolution; strong men, with open minds and moral strength. But a calamity has happened. We dont have such men; we have no leaders.

Cricket undid cricket: Why Test Cricket is losing its essence
The late Robin Williams once said that Cricket is baseball on valium. The man had said that after having lost what is required to enjoy the game, in his usual witty style. Well, it seems like not only a man from country alienated from cricket but for those people whose veins have blood running with cricket cells in them it's becoming the same. Did the recently ended Test series between India and England suffer from that vague notion
Well as it happened ..
The much talked about Test series between India and England ended recently with England winning it 4-1. Although the series cannot be taken into granted considering the scoreline as pronounced by the Indian skipper Kohli nothing can be taken away from the winning side, as they outperformed India in every aspect of the game when it was needed the most.
Even though both teams looked equally equipped to gun down each other the scoreline tells a different story isn't it So what led to such a disappointing scoreline of 4-1 Whether the quality of cricket from India wasn't good enough or were England too good for the subcontinental giants
Before we delve into the matter and jump to a conclusion let me start by analyzing India's preparation for this huge 5-match Test series.
India's tour of Europe began with two T20s in Ireland, a formality for a big cricket controlling board, the BCCI. After getting to settle down and enjoy the pretty Irish offerings both on and off the field, the Indian team landed in England for the actual contest. The Indian team were to play 3 T20s first-up. The Indian team had their gun with full of IPL bullets in it. The series began well for India with one of their expected Test openers scoring a ton and helping India win the first one.
The second went England's way and Indians pulled it back in the third one with some special performances from Rohit Sharma and some thought out bowling from Kuldeep Yadav who completely bamboozled England's batters at times throughout the series.
The ODI's too began with a smile on Kohli's face, ear to ear, with some great performances from Rohit Sharma and Kuldeep Yadav. But a team like England wasn't gonna go down without fighting and with their main guns firing in the need hour, they just did that and totally took the game away from India in the second and third ODI, also with some helping hand from the weak parts of Indian players.
So after two weeks of cricket and with two weeks of break between the big Test series, the Indian team frittered away most of their time in enjoying the royal breeze and with wags by their side the team seriously took to the road. While some individuals were seen drifting from town to town in their lavish attire, but they all enjoyed a good week or so in "re-energizing" themselves for the big test!
With 6 days remaining for the commencement of big Test series, the Indian team arrived at Chelmsford to play a rain-affected 4-day turned 3-day practice match against not so good Essex County team. Facing the new red Dukes ball in English conditions is considered as the most challenging thing, but still, the Indian coach Ravi Shastri and skipper Virat Kohli were hoping for some good performance all-round going into the actual contest.
But Indian batsmen did not share a big part of the load and with Indian bowlers doing an okay job and just like that the Indian practice ended. That's it! The practice for this huge series ended in 3 days!
With that kind of practice can any subcontinental team perform well in England or on any foreign soil for that matter. Well, the answer would be a big NO! But did the Indian team do well Well, according to me this has been the best performance since last decade. But the big question is, then why does the series end show 4-1 To address that we have to discuss the way cricket was being played.
Any Test series that has given result every single match shows the fearless cricket being played from both the sides. Being fearless is a great quality of a test team. It allows the players to play in a free frame of mind. Throughout history, the most fearless teams have been able to successfully dominate the opposition, but being fearless doesn't mean you shouldn't have patience.
The most basic requirements for a Test team is patience and perseverance. Let us go back four years and try to think of the Adelaide Test match between India and Australia where Aussies edge past India in the last session with Indian skipper being dismissed by Lyon after playing what he rates as his greatest knock until now. However, when we look at it from Kohli's point of view we can sense he saw victory and he went ahead to chase down 350+ target on the last day itself.
But had he told his boys to just play the day would it have ended in a draw Who knows with Vijay showcasing his skills and skipper playing like wanting to make Adelaide ground named after himself I think India would have managed to save that test. But why didn't they What was the hurry Was the victory necessary When we try to ask us such kind of questions we could only end up with assuming things and imagining the outcomes in every which way possible.
It is apparent that people have a hard time having any control over their emotions. And with one not being able to control psychological side of theirs then it is like orchestrating chaos. Its so important that players are left alone because its a lonely game even though its played between 11 players from either side. The loneliness helps for preparation, but with so many support staff around each player, its difficult to find some game privacy for the players.
If the same thing is applied to cricket, then we know why we are losing the ability to play and at the same time watch Test cricket. We have become so intolerant to being patient that we have developed this affinity towards swift results and in turn losing all the joys that game provides us with. Cricket was meant to be played more mentally than physically and some ways it justifies being called a gentlemen's game.
The T20 invasion of cricket has led to many things that many people might have never imagined to happen to cricket. For instance, the IPL has not only become a multi-billion dollar spectacle, and it won't be a surprise for you to hear a youngster saying their main goal is to wear Indian blue and not the whites. I have got nothing against T20 or IPL. In fact, they have brought some new crowds to other forms according to the stats and has also made players fitness freaks which is great for the game, but what use is of that fitness if they don't want to play the longest format of the game.
Players like Lasith Malinga retired from Tests just to continue to play shorter formats which is was heartbreaking considering the unique nature of play he had bought to tests. There are many such examples when we look at WI, the unique combined island force which once ruled the longer formats for almost 2 decades. My suggestion would be to stop T20 series between tours. If they want to have a world cup once in every 2 years then they may have it just to keep fans engaged between big test series and CWC but we don't need it between the tours.
When one goes back and look at India vs England series to find out the reason behind India's devastating loss one may find the lack of being patient and persistent in their approach when it was needed the most. We can go on discussing such instances from the series whether being too happy with just winning sessions and letting tail enders take charge, being over-dependent on one man and not to forget how they surrendered to the swinging conditions at Lord's, not to forget getting carried away with the emotions and letting themselves cooked at oval. They surely paid the price but one may argue that end result was bit harsh, but cricket is fair all the time.
We can say that here, undoubtedly it was Cricket that undid Cricket. Indians went to win a Test series by preparing for different ball game and cricket is a game which awards you with what you have prepared for. There is one befitting quote that sums up Indias reason for failure.
For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.  Aristotle
Will India learn anything from this series and come back better in 2022 I hope so, with no Anderson and broad it might be comparatively easier for them. But with the same approach, like the last 3 series, I dont think they will win it, may go down fighting, as it's in vogue and will be.  sportsk

Estate workers demand Rs.1,000 wage increase
Protests erupted around the hill country yesterday as estate workers continued to demand that their basic wage be increased to Rs.1000 per day.
A large number of estate workers from a number of estates in the Patana Police area walked in procession towards the Patana junction yesterday morning holding slogans demanding that their basic wage be increased to Rs.1000 from the current Rs 500.
They statged a picketing campaign at Patana junction on the Hatton-Nuwara Eliya road from 10 am till 1.00 pm.
Three wheeler operators parked their vehicles along the road and shops in the Patana and Bogahawatte bazaars were closed in solidarity with the protesters.
The protesters were from the Kelliewatte, Bogahawatte, Dimbula, Mt.Vernon, Craigielea, Faithilea and Forest Creek estates. The Dimbula-Patana Police headed by Inspector Dissanayake provided security.
Estate workers from the Wewessa Tea Estate also staged a protest at around 12.45 p.m, opposite the Uva Provincial Council, as the Wewessa Tea Estate authorities have refused to comply with their demands.
Teachers of the Hatton-Kotagala school, where most children come from the estates, also engaged in a protest yesterday between 7.30-8.30am asking that the workers basic wage be increased.
The protest was held at the Hatton-Nuwara Eliya main road entrance to the school.
They pointed out that it was the estate workers who earned one of the lowest wages in the country. They asked that the government intervene in increasing the wage.
In Hatton, Estate workers have organised a protest march into Hatton town on October 28. The protest march has been planned to start at the Hatton-Malliappuwa junction and arrive in Hatton town. Former Hatton-Dickoya Municipal Council Chairman and incumbent councillor Alagamuttu Nandakumara has requested that all shops in Hatton close for the day in support of the march.
These protests interestingly have not been led by any political party or union and it was the result of a huge demonstration held on Wednesday (24) at Galle Face Green by estate workers and their children who work in Colombo.
The protests were organised through social media and has led to the push for the Collective Agreement between the companies and the workers to be renegotiated.
At present, workers earn a basic wage of Rs.500 and the companies have promised to increase the basic to Rs.600 with Rs.340 being added as an incentive per day.
Workers however point out that incentives depend on reporting to work 25 days a week and plucking at least 18-20kg of tea per day- and if these conditions are not met due to both natural as well as human reasons, their wage would remain at Rs.600 per day.
This time around, the workers are not prepared to settle for anything less, an Estate Workers Union member said, as companies once again try to negotiate a hard deal for the workers.

GMOA to voice concerns to President
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will inform President Maithripala Sirisena about the current dire situation of the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital allegedly caused by the political appointment made by the Health Minister, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday.
Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA will submit their complaints to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and all other relevant institutions on the unethical practices of Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital Director appointed by the Health Minister.
According to Dr. Aluthge, this political appointee has launched a cunning and well-planned strategy against all consultants who oppose his unethical and illegal practices. Slinging mud against them using social media, cutting down additional allowances paid to them etc. are among the tactics employed. Now the strategy has improved up to the level of physically harassing consultants and threatening them.
"According to the Court judgement given, fresh applications should be called from qualified individuals and a new Director should be appointed to the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital. But the current director who is a political appointee without the required qualifications remains in the position with the blessings of the Health Minister, Dr. Aluthge alleged.

Saltwater mixing into freshwater sources in Kalutara:
Government to provide solutions before 2020
The City Planning and Water Supply Ministry has initiated a project to provide a solution to the mixing of salt water into freshwater sources in the Kalutara district.
The project is expected to be completed by 2020.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said so at a public gathering, following the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Aluthgama-Matugama-Agalawatta integrated water project.
We expect to implement this project before the expiration of our governments term in 2020. In addition, we will take steps to inaugurate a number of community water projects as a solution to rural villages in this district, he said.
The Water Supply Board has not received government funds. However, we launched projects with local and international donor assistance. We have to be mindful of repaying this money, he added.
At present, the government only provides portable drinking water to half the population.
We should especially be grateful to India for providing us with financial assistance to the tune of US $ 500 million. During his Sri Lankas, visit Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to provide us this loan at a low-interest rate. At present, a number of Indian companies work in this sector as contractors, the minister said.
The project is funded by the EXIM Bank India and Bank of Ceylon. They will provide Rs. 24,285 million and Rs. 4,286 million respectively while the governments contribution is Rs. 3,707 million. The total cost of the project is Rs. 32,278 million.
The main contractor for this project - Iron Exchange India Private Limited - is sponsored by the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry and is launched by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.
Through this project, it is expected to meet the water needs of 300,000 people by providing 32,000 new water connections by 2020 and to 573,000 people by 2030.
One of the main objectives of this project is to take steps to resolve the issue of salt water mixing with drinking water by constructing a new plant in Nahalla Kole Modara to provide 78,705 cubic metres daily and adding a new water transmission plant up to the Kethhena water purification station.
The project will be completed within three years covering 269 Grama Niladhari Divisions in Matugama, Dodamgods, Kalutara, Beruwala, Agalawatta and Madurawala Divisional Secretariats.

## Title: The highest individual score by their wicket-keepers in Tests

12 Test-playing nations:
The highest individual score by their wicket-keepers in Tests
In the sport of cricket, the wicket-keeper is the one who dons the keeping gloves and stands behind the stumps to stop the ball missed by the batsman. Besides the aforementioned job, the wicket-keeper plays a vital role in various kinds of dismissals such as caught behind, stumpings and run outs. Earlier, the teams used to focus only on the wicket-keeping skills of a player to allow him a place in the team. But the game has evolved with time and the wicket-keepers role has been transformed into the wicket-keeper batsman role. Many teams prefer a batsman who can keep rather than having a keeper who can bat.
The wicket-keeper batsmen have always played a vital role in the success of a team. Their role is sometimes only limited to keeping in T20s but in the longest format of the game, they need to perform with the bat too. Heres a look at the best batting performances by a wicket-keeper of each Test playing nation.
(Note- This list considers Test matches after 2010)
1. ENGLAND - JONNY BAIRSTOW - 167* (251) vs Sri Lanka, Lords
Jonny Bairstow, the English wicket-keeper was in the form of his life in the season 2016-17 where he was one of the top run-getters for his side in Test matches. In the 3rd Test against Sri Lanka at Lords, English captain Alaistair Cook elected to bat first after the coin tossed in his favour. Cook (85) kept on scoring from one end but got no support from his partners.
Jonny Bairstow came in to bat after the fall of the 4th wicket and stabilised the innings along with his skipper. When Cook departed, Jonny Bairstow joined hands with Moeen Ali (25) and Chris Woakes (66) to take the teams total past 350. Woakes lost his wicket when England had put 371 on the board and Bairstow added 45 more to that while batting with the tail.
The wicket-keeper ran out of partners as he remained not out on 167. He was adjudged the Man of the Match in the drawn Test for his unbeaten knock.
2. SRI LANKA - DINESH CHANDIMAL - 162* (247) vs India, Galle
After conceding a humongous 192 run lead in the first innings against Virat Kohlis team India, very few expected Sri Lanka to even escape an innings defeat. However, the team showed character despite the collapse at the top of the order, as wicket-keeper batsman Dinesh Chandimal led the Lankan Lions to a famous victory. The home team lost their 3 wickets with just 5 runs on the board but Kumar Sangakkara (40) and Angelo Mathews (39) stitched an 87-run partnership to kick off Sri Lankas fightback. After the formers departure, Dinesh Chandimal walked in to play the best innings of his cricket career.
The right-handed batsmans gritty 162* left the Indian bowling attack clueless as he added 48 runs to the team total batting with the last 2 batsmen. Sri Lanka set an achievable target of 176 for India however, Rangana Heraths 7 wicket-haul dismantled the Indian batting as Angelo Mathews men won the match by 63 runs.
3. BANGLADESH - MUSHFIQUR RAhim - 200 vs Sri Lanka, Galle
Mushfiqur Rahim has been the cornerstone of the Bangladeshi cricket team for a long time and he proved why he is considered the best wicket-keeper batsman to have played for his country in the Test match against Sri Lanka. In the 1st Test of the series played at Galle, Sri Lanka declared their innings after scoring a monumental 570 at the loss of just 4 wickets.
Avoiding an innings defeat seemed improbable for the Bangladeshi Tigers. But the visitors put on an epic fight as Mohammad Ashrafuls 190 and Nasser Hossains 100 pushed them towards the total. Mushfiqur Rahim provided huge support to both the batsmen as he kept on piling runs from the other end. He became the first Bangladeshi wicket-keeper to score a double century on foreign soil by scoring 200 off 321 balls before Nuwan Kulasekara dismissed him. Bangladesh ended their innings with a first innings lead of 68 runs.
4. NEW ZEALAND - BRENDON MCCULLUM -185 (272) vs Bangladesh, Hamilton
In 2010, Bangladesh toured New Zealand and took part in a one-off Test. Shakib Al Hasan won the toss and invited the home side to bat first and they had a shaky start, losing their first 5 wickets with just 158 on the board. Martin Guptill (189) and Brendon McCullum then destroyed the Bangladeshi bowling attack as the duo added 339 for the sixth wicket before Rubel Hossain uprooted the stumps of Brendon McCullum.
The Kiwi wicket-keeper had made sure that he did his job before departing, as his knock of 185 comprised 17 fours and 3 sixes. New Zealand declared the first innings at 553-7 with major contributions from the two centurions. The visitors could not match the level of the higher-ranked New Zealand team as they lost the match by 121 runs.
5. SOUTH AFRICA - AB DE VILLIERS 169 (184) vs Australia, Perth
South Africa batted first in their 3rd Test match against the home side Australia in 2012. Faf du Plessis 78* helped the Proteas reach 225 before losing their 10 wickets. A spirited performance by their bowlers handed them a first innings lead of 62 runs after Australia could manage only 163 in their innings. The Test match turned dramatically in the 3rd innings of the match as Hashim Amlas 196 and AB de Villiers quick-fire 169 off just 184 balls led the visitors to a huge 569 in their second innings. De Villiers stuck 21 fours and 3 sixes in his onslaught over the Australian bowlers.
Chasing 632, Australia lost the match by a big margin of 309 runs despite valiant efforts from Ed Cowan (53) and Mitchell Starc (64).
6. AUSTRALIA - BRAD HADDIN 136 (287) vs England, Brisbane
In the 1st Ashes Test of 2010-11, England elected to bat first after winning the toss and put 260 on the board. The Australian side began the innings on a positive note with a half century from Simon Katich (50) laying the perfect platform for the middle order batsmen to take the home side past their nemesis total. Michael Hussey (195) and Brad Haddin not only took Australia ahead of the English sides total but also gave Australia a gigantic first innings lead of 221 runs.
However, England scripted a fightback of their own as they scored 517-1 and declared their second innings, setting Australia a target of 297 runs. The Test ended in a draw as Australia could score only 107/1 in the remaining time.
7. AFGHANISTAN - AFZAR ZAZAI 6 (18) vs India, Bengaluru
ICC allotted Afghanistan Test status in 2017-18 and the BCCI announced that India would be the first opponents of the minnows. In a two-day Test match at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, the Afghan bowlers were shattered by the Indian batsmen as Murali Vijay (105), Shikhar Dhawan (107), Hardik Pandya (71) and KL Rahul (54) led the Indian team to a huge 474 on a green wicket.
When Afghanistan walked in to bat in the first innings, their wicket-keeper Afsar Zazai could score only 6 runs off the 21 balls he faced before Ishant Sharma cleaned him up with a beautiful in-swinger. He came out to bat at no.7 in the second innings but that did no good to him as Ravindra Jadeja uprooted his stumps when the inexperienced Afghan had scored 1 run facing 9 balls.
8. IRELAND - NIALL O BRIEN 18 (45) vs Pakistan, Dublin
Niall O Brien, the Irish veteran who recently announced his retirement from cricket had a horrendous outing when Ireland played their first ever Test match against Pakistan. After Pakistan declared their first innings at 310/9, Ireland lost all its 10 wickets for 130 runs which led the visitors to enforce a follow-on. O Brien was dismissed for a duck in his debut innings. However, he had a chance to improve his performance in the second innings.
The Irish player failed to make the most out of that opportunity as he could manage only 18 runs after playing 45 balls. Nialls brother Kevin O Brien registered a memorable hundred in the second innings which forced the visitors to bat again. However, the target was too small for the Asian giants as Ireland lost their first ever Test match.
9. ZIMBABWE - REGIS CHAKABVA 101 (226) vs Bangaldesh, 2014
The Zimbabwean batsman Regis Chakabva was the last wicket-keeper to score a century for his country when he scored 101 against Bangladesh in 2014. After Bangladesh put 433 on the board in the first innings, Zimbabwe started their innings quite slowly as they lost both the openers at 84. However, Hamilton Masakadzas 158 powered them back into the match. Their wicket-keeper Regis Chakabva also stepped up and delivered a century to decrease Bangladeshs lead. The duos centuries helped the visitors reach 368 in the first innings.
Bangladesh expanded their 65 run lead by adding 248 in the second innings. Set a target of 313 in the 4th innings, the Zimbabwean batting order suffered a collapse as they slumped to a huge 162-run defeat at the hands of the Bangla Tigers.
10. WEST INDIES - SHANE DOWRICH - 125* (325) vs Sri Lanka, Port Of Spain
Sri Lanka toured the Windies in June 2018 to play a Test series and in the 1st match of the series, the home side elected to bat first after Jason Holder won the toss. Small contributions from Kieran Powell (38), Shai Hope (44) and Roston Chase (38) kept the Windies scoreboard ticking. But it was the wicket-keeper batsman Shane Dowrichs century which helped them reach 414-8 before Holder declared the innings. Dowrichs patient knock comprised 12 fours as the middle order batsman kept on adding runs with the tail-enders.
The home team took a big lead in the first innings which helped them set up a 226-run victory over the depleted Lankan side. Shane Dowrich was also a part of the Windies Test squad that India whitewashed last week.
11. PAKISTAN - SARFRAZ AHMED - 112 (215) vs New Zealand, Dubai
When New Zealand and Pakistan played a Test series in 2014, Sarfraz Ahmed was an emerging wicket-keeper who used to bat at number 7 or number 8. In this Test match too he came out to bat at number 7 after Ish Sodhi bowled Azhar Ali and Pakistan were trailing by 183 runs. Sarfraz showed character and played excellent strokes against the New Zealand bowling attack. The wicket-keeper batsman added 81 for the last wicket with Rahat Ali before becoming the final Pakistani batsman to be dismissed in the 1st innings.
His 125 run innings helped Pakistan reduce New Zealands lead to a mere 10 runs. Chasing 261 in the second innings, Sarfraz remained not out on 24 as the match ended in a draw.
12. INDIA- MS DHONI - 224 (365) vs Australia, Chennai
The Aussies powered by Michael Clarkes 130 and Moises Henriques 68 scored 380 in the first innings when they toured India for a 4-match Test series. Sachin Tendulkars 81 and Virat Kohlis century helped India reach closer to Australias total, but it was the Ranchi boy who played a memorable knock in front the Chennai crowd. This was MS Dhonis first and only double century in his Test career as his 224 off 365 blew away the Australian bowling attack. Australia could only give a target of 50 runs in the 4th innings to the home side as India took a 1-0 lead in the series by winning the match by 8 wickets.  sportsk

## Title: The importance of LRT
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Saturday, October 27, 2018 - 01:00
The importance of LRT
Sri Lanka is a net importer of fuel, to the tune of US$ 6 billion (approx) every year. We must thus explore all avenues that can save fuel. If a passenger car can haul five people, a bus can transport at least 40 and a train can take around 1,000. One can see the impact of public transport from this example alone.
If Sri Lanka had a world-class, reliable, comfortable and punctual integrated public transport system, many people would opt to keep their cars at home. Indeed, not having a world-class public transport system has cost us dearly. This will be even more crucial in the future - by 2035, there would be 30,000 passengers per hour per direction in some transport corridors in the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR). Planners have forecast that by 2035 the number of passengers in the main CMR transport corridors would rise from 1.9 million to 4.5 million.
The first thing that comes to mind when the term public transport is mentioned is a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system, which mostly runs underground. However, some cities may not need such a complicated system, which is a huge investment. A Light Rail Transit (LRT) system does the same thing, at a lesser cost. Many LRT systems are operational around the world.
There is little or no tunneling involved (the most expensive part of the construction) since a LRT system often runs on elevated pillars. It is also electrified, emitting no noise or noxious gases. After careful consideration of the costs and other factors, authorities have settled for LRT systems for major urban centres in Sri Lanka, starting from Colombo.
The good news is that construction work on the proposed LRT would begin at the end of next year, according to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry. Seven tracks had been identified under the proposal. The first line (21 Km) is likely to be constructed from SLIIT Malabe to Colombo (World Trade Centre with a possible extension to Port City). Another line with a total distance of 33 Km would be constructed from Ragama to Kirulapone via Kadawatha, Fort and Bambalapitiya. Another 28 Km long line would be constructed from Kelaniya to Moratuwa via Dematagoda, Borella, Narahenpita and Nugegoda and a 22 Km long line would be constructed from Hunupitiya Junction to Kottawa via Koswatta. There will be several interchanges where commuters will be able to hop on connecting lines to their final destinations.
LRT cars are generally much smaller than a MRT train, but a single LRT train (generally two-three compartments) will be able to take around 300 passengers. With trains coming every four minutes at each station along the proposed LRT routes, thousands of commuters will be able to travel to Colombo and suburbs in under 40 minutes. The convenience, comfort, punctuality and speed of the LRT will no doubt convince many motorists to keep their cars at home for the work run and use them only on weekends and holidays. If at least 2,000 cars stay off the road during the morning and evening rush hours, the fuel savings will be very significant.
There are growing calls by transport experts to pay more attention developing the entire railway sector, which has been seemingly put on the backburner as roads get all the fanfare. After all, rail development is much cheaper than road construction. Railways already have additional lands that can be used for adding tracks without the need for land acquisition. Electrification, which is a must for the local railway sector, will be costly initially but will pay for itself in the long run. Moves are now being made to electrify segments of the main lines and to increase speeds. Rail travel will get a further boost when the line from Matara to Beliatta opens next year with an eventual 90 Km extension planned to Hambantota and Kataragama.
With no traffic congestion to take care of, railways are also inherently faster than any form of road transport. Rail travel from Colombo is even now faster (150 mins approx) than travelling by the A1 road to Kandy (5 hours approx). Upgrading the tracks to boost speeds up to 125 Km/h and increasing the frequency of trains will nudge more people to travel by rail between Colombo and other main cities. However, we do need more modern and comfortable compartments for all suburban and long distance trains.
As experts have rightly pointed out, restrictions on the type of vehicles allowed on expressways mean that 70 percent of travellers like those using normal buses, three-wheeled auto-rickshaw taxis and motorcycles would not be able to use them although all tax payers bear the massive cost of the projects. On the other hand, anyone can travel by train. The train services can be complemented by ultra-luxury articulated buses, which are like mini-trains. We need a balanced mixture of road and rail transport as we head into the future. A seamlessly integrated comprehensive public transport system will help take thousands of cars off the road at busy times and cut down on fuel wastage as well.

Speaking exclusively to the Daily News, former St. Sylvesters Cricketer, national boxer as well as national rugby player, Senior DIG Nimal Lewke Said My memories take me back to the 60s. There again if I am not mistaken, it was Donald Ganesh Kumar from Jaffna Central who got selected to the national schools cricket team as an excellent all-rounder and as a Junior i still remember he scored a brilliant 175 against St. Sylvesters at Police Ground Asgiriya in the mid 1960s when St. Sylvesters had bowlers of the calibre of S K Basnayake, Nihal Samarasekera, Lionel Perera etc. Ganesh Kumar later joined the Police as a Sub Inspector with some of the outstanding sportsmen like Jayakumar Thangavelu - Boxer, Ranjith Dharmaratne, Daya Jayasundara etc.
But, due to illness he died very young. When I saw this news item my memories took me back to the era where Jaffna schools produced some of the best cricketers like the days Donald Ganesh Kumar played for the Police team and the Police Inter Division.
Hope these youngsters and many more youngsters from the North of the calibre of Ganesh Kumar, Surendran, Devendran, Suriyakumar, Nadarajasingham, Muthu Thambi, Sothilingam, Anton Benedict, Pathkumaraja, Sathyadeva, Vipulanandan, Sothilingam, will be unearthed concluded Lewke.

Kandy badly in need of grounds
Kandy schools are finding it difficult to play their cricket matches, due to the bad weather and lack of venues. What Kandy needs today are playgrounds. Pallekelle ground was made for cricket but today only international games are played. At one time there was a Sylvestrian serving in the grounds committee and his school managed to get the grounds for matches. Today only Trinity, St. Anthonys, Sri Rahula and Dharmaraja have their own grounds. Kingwood grounds is still not suitable for senior matches.
In the good old days it was the Police grounds and Campus grounds which helped these schools. Today the Police grounds still remain a matting wicket, and campus grounds have various problems. Today some schools go out of Kandy to play cricket. It is high time the politicians who talk big before the elections help schools to get grounds. A school has to spend a lot on ground fees for every sport. All cricket lovers in Kandy hope that their immediate needs be met by the present President and Prime Minister which will help the young sportsmen in a big way for their future.
Bogambara needs a face lift
Historic Bogambara playing field needs a face lift. Today the ground is so hard that most of the participants get injured. It is a ground with a long history. It was in 1897 the ground was converted from a lake to a playing field. A number of sporting clubs including Kandy Sports Club, Young Stars SC, Young Wanders SC, Green Field SC and schools including St. Anthonys, Trinity College, Sri Rahula College, St. Pauls (now known as Sri Sumangala College), Dharmaraja College and Kingswood College used the venue to conduct cricket, football, rugby, hockey and athletics. Bogambara was renovated into a stadium in 1972, thanks to the Kandy Municipal Council Special Commissioner of that time M. B. Samarakoon, who initiated the renovation work with support from local politicians such as E. L. Senanayake, Noel Wimalasena, Shelton Ranaraja, and E. W. Balasuriya, a local sports promoter and philanthropist, who assisted in raising donations. In 1997 Amnurudha Ratwatte upgraded the grounds with government funds at a cost of Rs. 89 million. It was re-developed under the patronage of the municipal council and after the redevelopment the Sports Ministry took over the premises, from that day the ground is in a mess The ground fees are on the high side and the less affluent football and hockey clubs are finding it difficult to make use of it.

One-off T20I v England today :
Lanka could throw ambidextrous Kamindu Mendis as surprise package
Twenty-year-old ambidextrous cricketer Kamindu Mendis could be the surprise package that Sri Lanka might throw at England in the one-off Twenty20 international at the R Premadasa Stadium today.
Sri Lanka T20 skipper Thisara Perera although not committing himself fully gave enough evidence that they were keen to hand Mendis his maiden international cap.
Kamindu played alongside with me for Colombo District. We know what he is capable of. A remarkable player he can bowl with both hands and when a right-hand/left-hand combination is out in the middle having him in the team is a big bonus for us, said Perera at the post-match press conference.
I represented Sri Lanka when I was 20. The important thing is to give a young player like him a break and give him some exposure. He is an impact player. He is more than an all-rounder I would say. He bowls with both hands. Excellent fielder and he is a handy bat too, very good talent and a very good find. He will be a great asset for the team moving forward.
England had a look at Mendis for the first time when he played for the Sri Lanka Board XI in their two-day warm-up match sending down his off-breaks against left-hander Eoin Morgan and then switching to orthodox left-arm against right-hander Joe Root, having earlier showcased his abilities during the 2016 under 19 World Cup.
Having won the fifth and final ODI against England rather comprehensively Perera said that Sri Lanka want to carry the momentum into todays game.
We had a good game in the last ODI and we want to continue that good performance in the T-20 International as well. We want to finish off the one-day series well, said Perera. I told the boys that we had some good momentum from the last ODI and we have to hand over to the Test guys with a good momentum by doing well in the T-20. That is our main focus.
Perera was of the view that the toss would not be a huge factor. As T-20s start at 7 pm the dew is present by the time the game starts. The team that does less mistakes wins. We have to keep our energy on the field. Half chances need to be converted and that is the key when it comes to T-20s. Things like toss and weather you cannot control. What you can control is the way you play.
With Kusal Perera still on the injury list it is most likely that Sri Lanka would persist with their ODI openers Niroshan Dickwella and Sadeera Samarawickrama who have so far paired off together successfully providing the team with starts which they can build match-winning totals.
We gave them the last couple of games hoping to get a good start. We have to give players opportunities often and I thought they grabbed it with both hands. We have just a few games before the World Cup and we hope to settle on a side rather than allowing new players to come in and find places, said Perera.
Kusal Perera was named in the T20 squad of 15 but has been replaced by Samarawickrama as his hamstring injury is taking time to heal.
Sri Lanka rested experienced fast bowler Lasith Malinga for the fifth ODI and being a T20 specialist is likely to return to the side for todays game.
What we wanted to do in the last ODI was to give a couple of young players a break. Lasith is one of our main match winners and he can turn up at anytime. We are yet to finalize the combination. Lasith is a huge asset for us when it comes to T20 and we look forward to him playing in tomorrow's game, said Perera.
Sri Lanka has lost three of their last four T20I matches played at this venue, including a penultimate ball defeat to Bangladesh in the Nidahas Trophy in March this year that led to a dressing room door being smashed.

Sri Lankas First Cardinal His Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray OMI - 30th death anniversary:
Life dedicated to spirituality
Born on December 29, 1901 in the little hamlet of Periyamulla in Negombo into a modest but devout Catholic family as the fifth child and its third son, Thomas Benjamin Cardinal Cooray OMI became the first ever native archbishop of the metropolitan See of Colombo on July 28, 1947 with the sudden demise of Archbishop Jean-Marie Masson OMI the last foreign prelate to hold that office. The Church authorities of Rome had decided wisely that it was the opportune time for the administration of the Catholic Church to pass on to native hands especially with the Independence era about to dawn on Ceylon the following year. His Eminence Cardinal Cooray passed away on October 28, 1988, having held the reins of office for 30 years. His mortal remains are interred in the crypt of the National Basilica of Our Lady of Lanka at Tewatte. His entire life had been marked by the pursuit of personal holiness, faithfully shepherding his flock, the archdiocese of Colombo and leading the Catholic Church into its post-Independence era. At the time of his demise, he had been a Religious for 63 years, a priest for 59 years, in episcopal rank for 42 years and a Cardinal for 23 years.
The Dawning of the Cooray-Era
At the time of his appointment, Fr. Thomas Benjamin Cooray OMI had earlier been a member of the staff of St. Josephs College, later holding responsibilities as the warden of the Catholic hostel for university students and finally, the office of the Director of the Oblate Major seminary in Borella. He became archbishop at the age of 46. With brilliant academic careers both here and in Rome where he was sent by his superiors for continued priestly and missionary training, coupled with many experiences in the spiritual formation of the young and in matters of ecclesiastical administration, Fr. Cooray was well equipped to become the first native archbishop of Colombo and spearhead the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka. He joined the minor seminary at the age of 12 finishing his education with a B.A. (Lond) and while in Rome, was ordained priest in June 1929. He returned to Ceylon in 1931 earning two doctorates with highest honours in Philosophy and Theology and got his first appointment to the staff of St. Josephs College, Colombo.
The Cooray-Era that began in 1947 lasted until 1976, when he retired at the canonical age stipulated by Church Law. His period of stewardship saw tremendous change that came over the Catholic Church which entered the post-independence era. To crown it all, Archbishop Cooray was created Sri Lankas first ever Cardinal in 1965 by St. Pope Paul VI, thus becoming the 5th Asian to be bestowed with this highest honor and the third in the history of the OMI congregation. As archbishop he had the privilege of having as co-workers Fr. Peter A. Pillai OMI, an intellectual colossus of his time, Fr. D.J. Nicholas Perera OMI who was in the team of delegates that approached the Colonial Secretary in Britain demanding Independence for Ceylon as far back as 1920, appointed as liaison between Church and State and the stalwart Frenchman Fr. Gerard Fortin OMI who was known as a working dynamo. Thus in his choice of collaborators he succeeded in engaging well, the local priests and foreign missionaries to launch a new era in Sri Lankas modern Church history. As a leader he believed in harnessing the talents of others.
Some Vicissitudes of his Involvements
More than his administrative talents and ability to maintain good relations with all, he was known even during his life time as priest, archbishop and cardinal for sanctity and holiness of life. He was lauded as a man of principles, undaunted defender of justice, ever-strong in his convictions and always sensitive towards others in empathy and understanding. Even today those who knew him have great reminiscences of his spirit of kindness and compassion to all. He desired goodwill and spirit of solidarity to animate the life in the various ranks in the church such as the priests, the religious men and women and the lay faithful towards all of whom he exercised a strikingly paternal care. He was more than convinced of his spiritual obligations towards all of them.
Even in times of difficulties, crisis and problems, His Eminence Cardinal Cooray held himself in calm disposition of mind and took decisions that were inspired by a sense of humanity and love for people.
His concern for victims of natural disasters such as the floods of the mid-fifties in Chilaw and that of the mid-sixteees in the north and east had been admirable, visiting these victims personally and organising relief-services. Even today people talk about his involvements with the conditions of living and work of the farmers in the North Central Province and the fisher-folk along the coastal belt of the western province. Some of the best Catholic initiatives for elevating the standard of living, employment and integral formation of these ranks of workers and those of young Christian workers were launched by Archbishop Cooray.
He had a special place in his heart for the poor youth of the rural areas and those who could not continue schooling due to financial constraints and also juvenile delinquents who needed rehabilitation. His Eminence Cardinal Cooray was very much distressed at the spate of violence that overtook the youth in 1970s erupting in the youth insurrection of April 1971. He assisted the government in rehabilitation programmes and appealed to the errant youth to adopt non-violent means to address injustices and to claim their rights of to education and employment through patient dialogue and discussion with the government. From his earliest days as Archbishop he had serious concerns about the impact of Marxism and leftist tendencies intruding into the mainstream of national politics and universities, which made him warn about impending disasters that would follow in the blind pursuit of radical socialism. There was no possibility of reconciling such materialistic and purely economic ideologies with the great and noble values proclaimed by the great religions practiced in the country for centuries.
Cardinal Cooray and the Nation
Archbishop and Cardinal Cooray maintained excellent relationships with the governing authorities from whichever party-hue they came whilst expecting from these seats of power justice and fair-play for all: majority community as well as minorities. He wished to see Ceylon becoming more and more indigenous, learning how to tap the natural and cultural resources it enjoyed while being open to modern technology, including mass media and to carefully avoid pitfalls of western cultural value systems. He was a great lover of nature and the plant world as we can see from the oasis of the mighty trees that offer shade around the national basilica of Our Lady of Lanka in the hamlet of Tewatte (Ragama): clusters of trees that he himself had planned and planted. His sensitivity to the needs of the poor is seen in his proposal made already in 1946 for the erection of an overhead-bridge at the Ragama Railway intersection to ease the congestion of traffic and thus enabling easy mobility to pilgrims flocking the shrine of Tewatte and poor patients coming to the Ragama hospital. His Eminence Cardinal Cooray welcomed with patriotic joy, the new constitution of 1972 which declared colonial Ceylon to be a new independent Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, though he was swift to advice the government not to hurry through a new constitution without sufficient consultation.
He shared the sorrow with his co-patriots at the sudden death of the father of the nation, D.S. Senanayake and kept longing for stable governments to continue ensuring his policies for national development, working towards an agro-economy and national unity.
He fought heard for the rights of the Catholic Church and the Christian minority of the country when land bills and education policies enacted at times, affected them adversely.
His concept of education was that it be integral, thus forming a growing child holistically and inclusive of a sound religious formation. Archbishop Cooray is well-known for his bitter opposition to the Schools Takes-Over of 1960 in which the Church lost nearly 600 schools that were under its administration. He firmly believed of the crucial need of a Catholic atmosphere for the education of Catholic children and the parents right to choose a Catholic institution for the education of their children.
Towards an Indigenized Church
The Cooray Era brought in an in-culturated Church with its buildings and worship taking on a local cultural touch. One saw also with the departure of the foreign Catholic missionaries as a result of certain government restrictions on visas, the emergence of a local Clergy that could replace them and take on reins of responsibility in running the Churchs affairs. All in all, Catholicism and Christianity in general had entered a new phase within independent Sri Lanka and were gradually becoming part of the countrys identity. His dream was to see a Sri Lankan Church with its adherents also living and contributing their best to the common good of the nation. Hence we see that Cardinal Cooray has made a great and significant contribution to the country and can easily be seen as a true patriot, a great religious leader, an illustrious prelate and a pioneer.
Path to Sainthood
Within the Catholic community, he has always been regarded as a person of sanctity who pursued and gave primacy to spirituality in all his undertakings. This striking witness of his life bolstered also by facts and documents pertaining to his work and activities, made it possible for the cause of his canonization as a saint to be introduced by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith in October 2010, It was completed in 2017. All documentation pertaining to this process now rest with the relevant departments in the Vatican City for review and final approval. With an eventual miracle of a cure or healing through his intercession, that will attest to the sanctity of His Eminence Cardinal Cooray and declared to be so by medical experts, the path to sainthood will be assured. If declared a saint, His Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray OMI will become the first ever Sri Lankan saint, one from our own soil, who will be a source of jubilation and pride not only to the Catholics here and the universal Church, but also to entire Sri Lanka, the pearl of the Indies.
May one of the great dreams of His Eminence Cardinal Cooray who loved his motherland in true patriotic grace, soon come to pass with the dawn of a truly united and prosperous nation which provides safe sanctuary to its ancient religious teachings and noble cultural traditions.

Malaysian company files arbitration against government
Malaysian renewable energy producer KLS Energy Lanka Sdn. Bhd. has initiated International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) arbitration under the Sri Lanka-Malaysia Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), reportedly due to the cancellation of a USD 150 million wind/solar hybrid power plant project by the Sri Lankan government. The request was registered on October 24, 2018. According to news reports, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) approved the investors project for building the hybrid power plant in Jaffna in 2008, and also concluded a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement with KLS.
The same source reports that the Sri Lankan government then cancelled the project in 2016, alleging that KLS had not continued its investment in the project. Meanwhile, the investor reportedly claimed that it had already invested USD 22 million and that the government was responsible for any undue delays.
The ICSID filing comes after threats by the claimant in 2016 to invoke the Sri Lanka-Malaysia BIT if negotiations with the Ceylon Electricity Board were unsuccessful, according to reports. Neither party has yet retained outside counsel in the case.
Sri Lanka currently faces one other claim at ICSID over a hotel development project. The tribunal in that case held jurisdictional hearings last week.

The Speaker further said that a Compact Disk (CD) which contains both the translations had been placed on the desks of all the MPs.
The Speaker Jayasuriya made these remarks exactly after day, in which Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A Sumanthiran, United People Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Dr. Bandula Gunawardena and United National Party (UNP) MP Ravi Karunanayake pointed out that parliament had not received the said translations even after the lapse of eight months.
Most awaited parliamentary debate on the PRECIFAC and Bond Commission reports had to be postponed indefinitely on 20 February due to the unavailability of Tamil and English translation of PRECIFAC report.
However, the House did not discussed about resuming the debate after receiving the needed translations yesterday.
Govt. presently occupied in defusing fiscal time bomb:Finance Minister
The present government is now in the process of defusing the fiscal time bomb it inherited from the Rajapaksa regime in 2015, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said. He also said that of the debt payments due from 2019 - 2025, more than 70% of it are debts taken by the ex-regime.
For example, 77% of the share of our foreign debt service in 2019 and 2020 would be on pre-January, 2015 borrowings. We would have to service a debt of US BN$ 2,845 this year of which, 63% is debts taken by the Rajapaksa regime. In 2019, we have to service 4,285 USD BN of which 77% were taken by Rajapaksa regime. In 2020, there are 3,768 US$ BN debts to be serviced and 77% of it is Rajapaksa-time debts. In 2021, we again had to service 3,441 US$ BN of which 83% was Rajapaksa-time debts. Then in 2022, we had to pay 3,840 US$ BN of which, 71% is Mahinda Rajapaksas debts. In 2023, we had to pay 2250 US$ BN and 71% of it is Rajapaksa-time debts. In 2024, we have to service 2218 US$ BN of which 69% is Rajapaksas debts. In 2025, we have to service 4275 US$ BN, of which 33% would be Rajapaksa time debts. Finance Minister Samaraweera pointed out.
Minister Samaraweera made these observations while tabling the resolution to raise Rs. 310 BN by way of loans in or outside Sri Lanka for active liability management.
Assuring that the government had a clear strategy to address the issues of local and foreign debts, Minister Samaraweera said that the present government had to find answers for a debt crisis in the country.  Of course, the debt issue in hand is a legacy of pre 2015 mismanagement and therefore let me begin by underlining the colossal burden that was left on our shoulders. This government took over a very fragile and structurally imbalanced economy. The economy was in shambles when our government took over in 2015. Economic growth in the post war years was dominated by a foreign debt funded construction boom. The then government went on to spending on infrastructure, investments, many of which yielded little or no return. The government at that time expanded its unproductive expenditure in an irresponsible manner, without proper attention to developing revenue sources to meet such expenditure.
As a result, they developed a fiscal time bomb which the government is now in the process of defusing. We inherited a fiscal time bomb and for the last three years, we have been in the process of defusing the bomb successfully, Minister Samaraweera said.
Speaking further, Minister Samaraweera said, the Sovereign bonds issued during 2010 - 2014 amounts to US$ 4.5 BN which would be maturing in 2019/2020. In dollars terms, our annual interest payments on the sovereign bonds would exceed 300 MN US$.
Much of the increase in borrowings by the previous government from expensive external foreign debts, requires investment in production through assets. Unfortunately, no productive investments were mechanized instead of draining our resources to utter wastage.
Fortunately for this country, in 2015, the direction of that disastrous path took a different turn and now for the first time in history, we have a clear approach to manage our debts.
Therefore, we are fully cognizant of our outstanding debts liabilities, denominated in local and foreign currencies, in view of the necessity for institutionalizing a legal framework for managing the countrys public debt profile in a prudent manner that brings debt sustainability and macro-economic stability.

President condemns killing of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khasshoggi
President Maithripala Sirisena on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, condemned the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, while addressing the awards ceremony for Investigative Journalism funded by the State Department of the United States of America and conducted by the Institute of War & Peace Reporting (IWPR), which was held at the BMICH last evening.
The President also said that such incidents should not take place anywhere in the world again.
President Sirisena said that after he was elected to office that inasmuch as the peoples freedom, democratic rights, human rights and fundamental rights have been ensured and the government has also done much to ensure media freedom. In the past three or four decades, journalists have been harassed, murdered or forced in to exile. From the day I assumed office up to date, no journalist had been killed or harassed, the President said.
The President also said that he had appointed a committee to look into the grievances of our journalists, but it was questionable as to why the recommendations made had not been implemented. He also ensured the journalists that he would take it upon himself to seek solutions to all issues put forward to him by them. President Sirisena handed over awards to the ten journalists who had published the best Investigative Reports under the programme.
Karunarathna Gamage, President of the Federation of Media Employees Trade Unions (FMETU), and its Secretary Dharmasiri Lankapeli and Allan Davis IWPRs Director for Asia and Eurasia, addressed the gathering.

Reparations are for all affected in armed conflicts - MP
UNP MP Mujibur Rahman said the Office for Reparations Bill was presented seeking compensation for all survivors and victims of the kin in several armed uprisings in the country and not for the ex-LTTE combatants or any other particular political group.
Addressing a media briefing held at the UNP headquarters Sirikotha yesterday, Rahman said the Office for Reparations can provide a strong message of care to conflict affected populations living in all parts of the country due to the several conflicts that have taken place during the countrys post-independent history.These include the recent anti-Muslim riots and the two JVP insurrections that took place in 1971 and again in 1988-89 in which much violence was perpetrated on innocent people.
"We have had a long history of conflict not only in the north, but also in the south. People had disappeared during the conflict and it is also necessary to find out what happened to them and give reparations to the affected people, he said.
He said the law is clear and reparations are not given on the basis of the victims ethnic or religious background, or belonging to any particular political group. Several persons including those of the joint opposition are attempting to create a public opinion that the government is all out to appease the LTTE. It is not true.We have to focus on the human perspective and not so much on the political viewpoint. All Sri Lankans are equal under the law and this Act clearly stipulates that reparations could be awarded to the aggrieved persons who are victims of during the 30 year long war and 1971,1988/89 periods as well.
The LLRC proposed that justice be meted out to those who were affected by the war during the former regime. But, it was not implemented. "The disappearances not only in the North but also in the South have been reported. Reparations have to be made, Steps should be taken to provide relief to the victimized parties,"he added.
The Bill provides for the provision of individual and collective reparations for aggrieved persons who have suffered violations of human rights or humanitarian law.
We have enough experience on how the Rajapaksa government made reparations to former LTTE leaders. One of the former LTTE leaders Karuna Amman who was master mind behind Sri Dalada Maligawa bomb blast and Aranthalawa Bhikku massacre appointed as a Cabinet Minister as well as Vice President of SLFP during the former rergime.
Our main aim is to establish four pillars of transitional justice including truth, reconciliation, and accountability for past abuses arising from the war and Office of missing persons has already been set up as part of this target, he added.
We never opposed when former President took measures to release over 12,000 ex-LTTE combatants for the rehabilitation.They must reintegrate into civil society to address the reconciliation. That is why former President J.R.Jayawardene released those who were in jail during the 1971 insurgency and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga released those detained during the1988/1989 insurgency.
DIGs conversation elicited information
UNP MP Mujibur Rahman said yesterday an investigation will reveal the real facts based on the conversation between TID DIG Nalaka Silva and informant Namal Kumara shortly.
DIG Nalaka Silva cannot speak like a DIG to obtain real facts from the informant.If he speaks with him as a DIG in his official capacity, he may not receive the information that he wants.
If someone wants information from an informer, he or she has to act according to needs of the informer.
However, real information will be reveled in the future through the investigations, he said.

SLASA Batticaloa branch urges legal action against Thera
The Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SLASA) Batticaloa branch held a demonstration on Thursday urging legal action against Ven. Ampitiye Sumanarathana Thera of the Mangalaramaya Temple in Batticaloa for allegedly trying to assault Eravurpattu Divisional Secretary N.Vilvaratnam.
SLASA Batticaloa branch officer Al Ameen speaking to the Daily News yesterday, said it also made a written request to the Eastern Province Senior DIG urging immediate action against the incident.
We strongly condemn the attempted assault by the monk on the Eravurpattu (Chenkalady) Divisional Secretary over an issue of cutting down several branches of a Bo-tree. This is not the first time that this Buddhist monk behaved violently. It was not long ago that a female Divisional Secretary was threatened by him in the same manner. We have been tolerating his aggressive behaviour for a long time in order to protect social harmony, he commented.
A video clip, which was doing the rounds on social media, showed how the monk allegedly behaving in an aggressive manner and trying to assault the DS while using abusive language. When contacted by the Daily News, Eravurpattu Divisional Secretary Vilvaratnam said he lodged a complaint with the Eravur Police that the monk tried to assault him. The incident took place around 2.30pm on Tuesday and it had also been reported to the Batticaloa District Secretary.
The Divisional Secretary explained that he gave approval to cut down several branches of the Bo-tree situated in a private land on the request of the residents in the area, adding that the approval was given after obtaining the Forest Conservation Departments recommendation.
The monk objected stating that the tree has a religious value and we are sad that this incident happened. This particular land had been used as an Army Camp previously and it was released back to the people recently. The people requested to cut down several branches as it blocked the electricity supply lines, he commented.
When contacted by the Daily News, Eravur Police OIC said the incident was being investigated but refused to give any details.
SLASA Batticaloa branch officer Al Ameen requested his superiors to take this matter up with the relevant authorities and ensure the public servants security to work according to the rule of law. We seek the Governments intervention to stop these unlawful influences, he said.

## Title: Test Cricket: timeless or pass
## Supertitle:

Test Cricket: timeless or pass
Test cricket is the ABC of cricket. Test cricket is the gold standard. It is where one's mettle is observed, analyzed & bisected. Test cricket is the pinnacle for judging a cricketer's skill, temperament, technique, class, adaptability, ability, character, attitude & spirit just to name a few qualities. Such a century old glorious game is slowly on the brink of declination Is it or is it not If so, is there something we should do about it
Every cricketing nation wants to hold that Test mace, for that they have to be on top of their game in every aspect and in every condition. The challenging thing is to perform overseas and in doing so rightly claim the no 1 spot, but over the last decade, we have seen a new trend. Every team have become king in their own backyard and minnows in foreign soil except few teams like WI who have just become a by-product of t20s.
Gone are those days when we used to hear about the devastating 80s WI team and the hostile nature of their play, I personally have heard it through people on television screen talking about it by the likes of great Ian Chappell, Tony Greig, Richie Benaud etc. And as decades passed by, we have a new set of people talking about the Australian team of the 90s & 2000s and how they had made a habit of travelling, winning & shaming the home team under any circumstances. But it has all become a part of history now.
WHO WOULD HAVE CONCENTRATION WHEN THEY BREATHE SHORTER FORMATS OF THE GAME
Any cricketer who plays all 3 formats is prone to injury, lack of patience and concentration. Its because they cant adjust to 3 forms in 3 different ways and so far, Test cricket is on the receiving end of it with both batsmen and bowlers failing to assess the conditions and due to lack of practice, evidently failing to read the match situation and thus end up losing on foreign soil.
Many Test matches now ending in 3-4 days shows the failure of borrowing of techniques of shorter formats into the longest format. Some say it makes Test cricket exciting even though it's only played 3-4 days but Test cricket was not meant to be played like that. It was meant to stand and battle it out and to hang in there, to survive and to save the team from defeat. But nowadays no one wants to go for a draw because they think its old fashioned and losing has become the new act of resilience.
In recent years, how often have we seen an innings like the one Cheteshwar Pujara played against the Australian team at Ranchi or the one that Faf du Plessis played against the same opposition at Adelaide Grinding! Isn't that what life is all about Battling it out against the most daunting of challenges. Have the players lost concentration Do they lack patience and perseverance One might be led to believe so.
With the amount of Cricket being played the majority of the Test players are facing heat from the hectic schedules. Boards need to rethink about the amount of Cricket that needs to be played, obviously keeping in mind of financial set-ups.
Are we the last generation of Test match lovers Well, I don't think Test cricket will not be played 10 years from now but will be able to call it 'Test' Will it be able to regain its glory days Certainly not. Given the amount of time we are giving it now I don't think we will be a free as a group or society for that matter to give any prominence to it 10 years from now.
TEST CRICKET IS JUST LIKE 'LIFE'
The next day of your best day in life may be the worst. Even when you consider any given day there is a certain period, a certain time or a certain hour that belongs to you and you feel like the day belongs to you and only you, even though you know nothing is permanent in life and certainly a tight slap from the adversary is waiting ahead.
Test cricket is similar too and true in all sense of the word 'life', for you may be having the best session of play of the entire Test match and enjoying being on top of the game but one momentarily lapse of concentration and you lose the entire thing.
But before we bury Test Cricket totally by becoming quiet as a mouse and throwing in the towel, I think the boards need to rethink about it and somehow manage to make it more accessible and as fans we need to show support to the greatest form of the greatest game in the world by turning up in pretty good numbers, but fans only turn up if there is good contest, so boards need to have some strict plans regarding foreign tours, they should direct players to go and play some county cricket instead of arranging a t20 series.
They should focus a lot on creating an atmosphere where true champions are made. Most importantly, players must respect the game because nothing can be bigger than the game itself. I believe Test cricket, at this very moment, is suffering from a lack of heroes. There is always room for improvement. Its high time we realize that.
Just a decade ago with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, the quality of battle between 2 champions was impeccable, it was gladiatorial cricket. Sometimes people would turn up just to watch those two not that others were not great, but every team had one champion player. But when we look at today we may not find a single champion team let alone battle between 2 champions.
As the saying goes Practice makes man perfect and longest format being is the one which is in need of it. Being outplayed in foreign soil regarding every team over last decade has a lot to do with adapting to the conditions.
Earlier, when legends like Rahul Dravid used to play county cricket not only before they were to play in England but also to enjoy the game more, to get to know the game in every dimension possible. They did that for their sheer love for the longest format. To still improve...
They still took time to play for a month or two in domestic cricket and county cricket considering their busy schedule. But with the invasion of T20s and franchise cricket, players tend to be attracted to millions of dollars. Like every other sport, cricketers too have a short career span and earning is important, so its the duty of ICC and respective cricket boards to keep an eye out for that.
In recent events, we have seen many players retiring from their International careers just to earn a good living, by signing with county cricket teams and T20 franchises. If there is an option to prefer the players who wish to play Tests for the International tours, it must be acted upon and the players must be paid accordingly.
Test cricket reminds me of Paulo Coelho's message in his great novel The Alchemist, where he says the journey of life is more joyous, curious & pleasurable than the goal of life itself. The joy of cricket cannot be found in flashy sixes or 360 of play or watching Kohli master the chase, surely there is some joy but it's all momentarily suited but real joy lies in Kohli taking on Mitchell Johnson along with 10 other Aussies on the field and yet being able to come out on top, the joy lies in enjoying the rhythm of a fast bowler from how he prepared for his run-ups to how he delivers it and one can get it if they watch Michael holding bowl!
Joy lies in the way batsman deals with the pressure when the entire crowd is against him with 11 people trying to strip him of his skills and send him back in desolation and yet the batsman preparing for that situation by thinking of every which way he can stop that from happening, in that very moment itself shows the improvisatory dimension of the game and I bet no other format can boast of having such quality or any sport in the world for that matter, to say that Test cricket is the most spontaneous form of cricket would be perfect.
It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary!
Cricket is the same too, when all the flashiness of the T20 and ODIs are removed then most people will realize that Test cricket is the most complex, is also the most simplistic form of cricket. We all watch sports, some for entertainment, some for getting thrilled, some for learning, some for money, some for analysis and some for the joy it gives to us by the manner in which it is played. I belong to that group of fans who find eternal joy in the Test Cricket and would like to witness the resurgence of the purest form of sport.

Thonda threatens to resign if wages not increased
Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Leader and Parliamentarian Arumugam Thondaman said that he will resign from Parliament next Tuesday (30) unless the basic wages of estate workers are not increased to Rs.1,000 each by estate companies.
I will resign from Parliament, if the estate companies are not ready to pay the Rs. 1,000 basic wage demanded by estate workers by Tuesday, Thondaman said.
He was addressing the media at the Primary Industries Ministry at Battaramulla yesterday.
Estate workers especially in the tea plantation sector have been resorting to trade union action demanding for an increase in their wage to Rs.1,000 per day.
Addressing the media, he further said that it is not difficult for estate companies to pay this wage hike when considering the service they obtain from estate workers.
Thondaman He pointed out that the managerial staff of estate companies draw huge monthly salaries while estate workers get a meagre income.
The death anniversary of late Minister Saummiyamurthi Thondaman falls next Tuesday,October 30 and therefore that day is significant for the CWC.
The CWC urges the estate companies to come to a conclusion to pay this salary hike at least by that day (October 30) or otherwise, I will resign from Parliament and launch a huge campaign from November 6 aiming to meet the estate workers demands, he said.
He added that if the estate companies do not agree to pay the salary hike by October 30, a series of protests will be carried out from Deepavali Day which falls on November 6.

Two Koreas to withdraw some border guard posts
SOUTH KOREA: The two Koreas on Friday agreed to remove 11 guard posts along the heavily-fortified border next month with a goal to possibly remove all of them in the future, senior military officials said.
The agreement made between generals from the two sides came as diplomatic thaw between the former wartime foes gathered pace.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the North's leader Kim Jong Un previously agreed on a broad plan to ease tensions along the border during their third summit in Pyongyang last month.
During Friday's talks aimed at fleshing out details, the two sides agreed to withdraw all troops and weaponry from the 11 guard posts along the border and destroy them by the end of November, according to a joint statement released by Seoul's military.
The two sides also agreed to hold working-level talks to remove all remaining GPs based on the progress of the test removal of 11 GPs, it said after the talks held at the border truce village of Panmunjom.
Panmunjom -- or the Joint Security Area (JSA) -- is the only spot along the tense, 250-kilometre (155-mile) frontier where soldiers from the two Koreas and the US-led UN Command stand face to face.
But as part of the latest reconciliatory gesture, the two Koreas on Thursday removed all firearms and guard posts from the area, leaving it manned by 35 unarmed personnel from each side.
The two nations technically remain at war after the 1950-53 Korean War that sealed the division of the peninsula ended with a ceasefire instead of a peace treaty.- AFP

Umpire Aleem Dars unique on-duty act impresses cricketing world
It was almost like a pilot leaving the board after all had evacuated. Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar recently set such a high standard while on duty that the entire cricketing world has lauded him for his sense of responsibility.
The 50-year-old umpire though had his share of controversies in the past but his latest act during an ODI game between Sri Lanka and England will certainly do his reputation as an umpire a world of good. It all happened during the fifth and final game of the recent series played in Sri Lanka. It was a dead rubber at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo as England had already won the series. Sri Lanka won the toss and put up 366 for 6 in 50 overs. England had a bad day at the office and were completely off target. They faced a batting debacle and were 132 for 8 after 26 overs, still having a mountain in front of them to climb. Off-spinner Akila Dhananjaya came out to bowl the 27th over and on the very first delivery, he found tail-ender Liam Plunkett plumb in front of the wicket after the latter failed to read the googly. After pitching outside the off stump, the ball hit him on the right thigh, betraying the batsmans hope that it would turn.
Dar was the umpire and he gave it out. Plunkett then referred for a third umpires decision but in between the technicalities, the skies opened up, as it in all the matches earlier. The decision was so correct that Plunkett had no option but to return but then something unique happened.
All the players had left the ground as the rain and thunders increased but Dar stood his ground, waiting for the verdict from upstairs. Finally, the fans saw in amazement that Dar left the field with his dreaded finger raised, confirming the decision he received from the reviewer. Plunkett was dismissed and England were 132 for 9 in 26.1 overs, losing the game by a whopping 219 runs as per the Duckworth-Lewis Stern method  their heaviest defeat in the 50-overs format. crictracker

Upholding democracy during tough times
The averred RAW exposure situation with regard to the alleged plot to assassinate the President has continued this week, bringing out a truly raw depiction of the divisions in the governing coalition.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to India last week, enabled further explanation of the situation that arose in that controversial Cabinet meeting, with a cordial meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The discussions between the two Prime Ministers certainly helped restore good understanding between the two countries, after President Sirisenas own telephone conversation with PM Modi relating to this matter.
However, the pressures of local politics, particularly the running and rising differences between the SLFP and UNP saw the RAW issue kept in the political terrain, to further drive the party differences, with little consideration to the larger issue of international and good neighbourly relations. The statement by UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera that the four Cabinet ministers who leaked the RAW story to the media would be exposed, followed by the earlier criticism of this leak by SLFP spokesman minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, clearly showed the SLFPs desire to keep this controversy alive, with hidden s fingers pointing at UNP ministers in the Cabinet. While the UNP ministers had to deny any such leak, we saw Namal Rajapaksa get more publicity by calling for exposure of the leakers'.
What was clear was the political aim from the SLFP to use the RAW allegation, which President Sirisena himself has denied to both the Indian Prime Minister and High Commissioner, as part of the political battle with the UNP in the current situation of confrontational politics; where the goal of a Caretaker Government is kept dangling in the political domain, even with such a caretaker being increasingly considered unrealistic.
There is a quixotic situation arising from these allegations of leaking to the media a situation that officially did not take place at the Cabinet meeting. The SLFP Ministers are no doubt aware of President Sirisenas own denial of any reference to the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of the Indian Intelligence Institution. If there was no such statement and reference, what was there to leak Did the reference to RAW involve what ministers said, other than what the president said Was it mere RAW banter, if the President was not suspicious of any RAW involvement in the alleged assassination probe The more this is dragged on, it will be an unhelpful situation relating to Sri Lanka-India relations, as well as an attempt to use even an imaginary situation to drive deeper the divisions between the SLFP and UNP.
Interestingly, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who now leads the SLPP, and one who has more seriously accused RAW of involvement in the election of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena as President by defeating him, has said it is hard to believe there are ministers with affiliations to RAW. While stating that such a situation would be treason, I dont believe there are ministers with RAW affiliations, he said at a meeting in Tangalle.
It will be helpful for the SLFP purveyors of this RAW narration, to know that issues facing the country and people are more diverse and much deeper in content, such as economics, cost of living, and corruption, and would draw little public attention in the current political content. Paying more attention to improved relations with India, would be far better in the wider political context, beyond the narrow interest of rival party politics.
Provincial politics
Termination of the first Northern Provincial Council this week, brings a new interest in the democratic process in the country. This is now the sixth provincial council to be dissolved, with no signs of elections to these councils, raising major issues about the advance or continuance of democracy in the country.
The Northern Province had its first PC election, five years after ending of the separatist war with the LTTE, in September 2013, following which C. V. Wigneswaran of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was elected Chief Minister. Since his taking up the office of Chief Minister there have been increasing disagreements with the TNA, leading to open divergence between him and the largest political party of the Tamil people. There was agreement between him and the TNA leadership when it supported the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena in the January 2015 Presidential election. In the General Election that followed the TNA had the largest members elected from the Opposition political parties, and its leader M. Sampanthan was chosen Lender of the Opposition in Parliament.
The disagreements between Wigneswaran and the TNA leadership was initially due to the delay in the constitutional reforms promised in the campaign for the Common Candidate, which were key aspects of the policies proposed by the Movement for Social Justice led by the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, and the political alliance that supported the Common Candidate.
With the delay in constitutional reform, and the government moving away from the promises of wider devolution, beyond the limits of the 13th Amendment, which introduced devolution and the Provincial Councils, there was increased dissatisfaction among sections of the Tamil political leadership, moving away from the TNAs hopeful alignment with the Government.
Chief Minister Wigneswaran soon became a voice for Tamil political opinion that is critical of governments policies, and moved closer to the more extremist and racist thinking of Tamil political opinion, with increasing dissatisfaction with the governments slow and uncertain policies of reconciliation, understanding and peace building. Although the government has done much on reconciliation, the influence of Tamil Diaspora voices functioning abroad, and the rise of majoritarian thinking and policies with the government and the Joint Opposition, combined the buildup of the more radical Tamil political thinking in the North.
This has now resulted in the Wigneswaran being a founder of the new Tamil Peoples Council (TMC) or Thamil Makkal Kootani, a political party that will throw a challenge to the TNA, and its leadership given to the Tamil, people, for more than three decades. This includes the period of the LTTE war of separation in the much curtailed parliamentary context, when many leading members of the TNA and its associate parties were assassinated by the LTTE.
Apart from the challenge the TNA will have to its position of leadership among the Tamil community, especially in the North and East, the forming of a new political party by Wigneswaran and his political allies also raises a major problem for the government, over the continuing delay in the holding of Provincial Council elections. The Sabaragamuwa, North Central, Eastern, North Western and Central Provincial Councils have ceased to function for some time, with the first three over one year. The sixth such PC  Northern Province, raises a major issue on the devolution of power to the Tamil people. The Northern and Eastern PCs are no not functional, and their administrations are handled by the Governors. This certainly raises questions about the democratic process in the country, and the absence of a clear statement by the Government about the holding of elections to the now dissolved PCs.
This certainly gives much cause for the political opposition led by the SLPP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to intensify its campaign for speedy PC elections, which will now have a bigger push from Wigneswarans TMC. This will bring an ethnic aspect to the demand for provincial democracy, and will certainly extend to the wider call for better and a functional democracy in the country.
The call for polls from the North, combined with the East, will bring added pressure on the Elections Commission too. There will be increased questions raised as to how and why the Elections Commission continues to be seen as in accord with what are the governments legislative delays in holding the PC elections in time. It is also possible that this matter may move towards a Supreme Court determination, which will be in keeping with an earlier decision of the Supreme Court on the former Elections Commissioner having to act in keeping with the legislation on elections, and not the governments political and administrative delays on the matter.
The new politics of the Northern Province will see a whole new trend in political developments, which will bring the aspects of constitutional change to the front, which the government is not ready or able to present in the context of the divisions between the SLFP and UNP; as well as the general move away from the promises of the Common Candidacy in January 2015, and the General Election later that year.
Political amnesia
Political memories could be a serious issue among those who have been in politics for many decades. The recent recognition of the role of the Senanayakes in national politics has certainly led to forgetfulness of key aspects of UNP politics, especially in the context of the UNP and SLFP alignment, which is moving towards separation. Those who had joy in having an alignment with the once Senanayake led UNP, would do well to revive memories of the major changes that JR Jayewardene brought to the UNP and the country, the most important of which is the Executive Presidency, which did not have any Senanayake contribution. Such political amnesia could contribute to divisive politics where reality is replaced by opportunist thinking.

Ministry refutes baseless allegations:
US$ 2.5 bn FDI target for 2018, US$ 1.4 bn realised in first half

The Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry refuted unsubstantiated media reports citing that the Board of Investment had failed to attract or facilitate foreign direct investments to the country.
A communique said these allegations are baseless and inaccurate.
While Foreign Direct Investment into Sri Lanka had been performing poorly, efforts taken by the BOI has helped turn this around.There has been consistent growth on the cumulative value of investments attracted, both in terms of new projects approved and on-going projects implemented, the Ministry said in a release.
It is to be noted that such growth was seen when the government took a deliberate decision to suspend the SDP Act as well as the granting of fiscal incentives by the BOI, until the enactment of the new Inland Revenue Act.
The realised FDI figure of US$ 1.9 bn for 2017, as stated in the Annual Report of the Central Bank, was the highest FDI received thus far, and this value includes only US$ 292 mn. for the restructuring of Hambantota Port. The targeted FDI value for 2018 is US$ 2.5 bn and at the end of the first half of the year, US$ 1.4 bn was realised.
Commenting on the Export Processing Zones, the Ministry noted that while there are no new export zones, all 16 zones operated by the BOI are in operation, except for the Meerigama EPZ and the Mirijjawila Export Processing Zone that is now being integrated and developed as the Hambantota Industrial Zone.
The Ministry cited that since a substantial number of industrial zones were located outside the BOI Zones since the facilities within the zones were lacking in waste-water treatment plants, solid waste treatment and infrastructure. In view of above, it was decided to develop three new zones, in Hambantota, Millaniya and Bingiriya and these are being meticulously pursued, albeit delays in land allocation and development of requisite infrastructure by relevant state agencies; i.e. RDA, CEB and the NWS&DB.
A significant volume of investments are due for 2018, amounting to US$ 32 bn, most of which are in export oriented manufacturing. Implementing most of these projects are delayed due to issues pertaining to land allocation and various delays in respective line ministries, which are beyond the direct control of the BOI. These projects are diligently pursued by Ministry officials in conjunction with BOI officials and respective line ministries and state agencies.
The BOI has also identified targeted sectors for attracting FDI and enhance export revenue through an in-depth research study in collaboration with Harvard CID and the World Bank group. In identifying the target sectors, special focus has been placed on export oriented mechanise goods as well as services with a view to enhance foreign exchange earnings and also to diversify Sri Lankas export basket.
Investment promotion programmes are being implemented to attract FDI in the export manufacturing sectors of electric and electronic products, food and beverage, ship and boat building, IT and BPO, pharmaceuticals, automobile parts and services.

Yalegama Third Cross St in disrepair
The residents of the Third Cross Street of the Yalegama Mawatha, Redbanagama in Ukuwela said they undergo severe hardships since their street is a puddle in rainy days.
They said the road was bulldozed by the Ukuwela Pradeshiya Sabah to concrete it but later they rehabilitated another cross street with a few houses using the funds allocated for their street since a Pradeshiya Sabah member lives there. The residents said 24 families reside on the Third Cross Street. Now the road is a puddle and schoolchildren undergo severe hardships to and from their schools.
Ukuwela Pradeshiya Sabah Chairman Chethiyaratne said that if the residents made a written request, the Pradeshiya Sabah would take necessary steps to repair it in a week.
