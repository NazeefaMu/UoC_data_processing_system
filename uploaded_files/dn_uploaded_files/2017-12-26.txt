Programme launched to improve southern rural schools
The Southern Province Education Ministry has launched a programme to improve rural students knowledge, SPC Education Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said.
He was addressing a seminar in Matara recently.
A recent survey showed the Southern region has 300 state schools and each school has fever than 100 students.
The Galle district has 111 schools and the Matara district 95 schools. Hambantota boasts 85 schools and southern region has 17,025 students. Many of them are from low income families and they cannot afford their school text books, bags, shoes and other essential items, the survey said.
SPC Minister Rasaputhra has allocated Rs. 90 million for 2018 to facilitate children from low income families. He has taken steps to assure that remote schools receive adequate aids to keep them open.
The Minister said he would initiate programmes to develop remote schools to match with the urban schools.

Russia lifts tea ban
Russia has decided to lift the temporary import restrictions placed on Sri Lankan Tea with effect from December 30, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake told the Daily News yesterday.
Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance had taken the decision to impose temporary restrictions from December 18 after it found an insect, in the packaging of one consignment of tea from Sri Lanka. Minister Dissanayake said that Russian authorities had decided to lift the ban following discussions with a Sri Lankan delegation in Moscow yesterday.
Following the restrictions on tea imports by Russia, President Maithripala Sirisena speaking at a public event said, he would make an official request from Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw the temporary restrictions.
The President on that occasion went on to say that already an investigation has been initiated against the company which had exported the consignment of tea from Sri Lanka in which the insect had been detected and added that its export license will be revoked if found guilty.
Following the ban the Sri Lanka Tea Board in a statement said it believed the present case was an isolated incident that is, in any case, not a reflection on the quality of Ceylon Tea.
The Tea Board went on to say that the beetle is a pest of grain crops such as rice, and has never been associated with tea.
The Daily News learns that Sri Lankas Ambassador to Moscow Dr. Saman Weerasinghe and officials from the Ministry of Plantation Industries and the Sri Lanka Tea Board were involved in talks with Russian authorities constantly.
The Minister said the Russian authorities had set several conditions to be met by the Sri Lankan tea exporters, including maintaining the cleanliness of the containers used for tea exports. Dissanayake said these criteria were not difficult ones and the Sri Lankan delegation had agreed to meet them.

Special religious ceremony to commemorate tsunami anniversary
A special religious ceremony will be held at the tsunami memorial at Pereliya, Galle today to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the devastating tsunami on the boxing day of 2004 which killed over 35,000 people.
Two minutes silence will be observed from 9.25 a.m. to 9.27 a.m. today to commemorate the tsunami victims.
The 2004 tsunami-rail disaster in Peraliya is the largest single rail disaster in world history where over 1,500 people travelling in the Matara bound train from Colombo died.
Similar commemoration services are organised by the Disaster Management Division district branches island-wide.
Sri Lanka was hit by the tsunami triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra on December 26, 2004. The tsunami tragedy was one of the worst disasters ever recorded in Sri Lankan history. It left thousands dead, many more homeless and misery around the country.

Unadkat helps India sweep T20 series against Sri Lanka
MUMBAI, Sunday  Paceman Jaydev Unadkat led a disciplined attack to set up Indias five-wicket win in the third Twenty20 international against Sri Lanka as the hosts completed a 3-0 whitewash on Sunday.
Unadkat returned impressive figures of 2-15 to help restrict the visitors to 135-7. India then achieved their target with four balls to spare in a tense chase at the Wankhede Stadium.
Manish Pandey top-scored with 32 but it was Dinesh Karthik (18) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (16) who put on an unbeaten 31-run stand to take the team home.
The win ensured that India end the year on a high after outplaying the islanders in the Test (1-0), one-day (2-1) and T20 series.
Sri Lanka however put the hosts under pressure with regular strikes as paceman Dushmantha Chameera and medium-pace bowler Dasun Shanaka claimed two wickets each.
Shanaka got skipper Rohit Sharma for 27, early in the chase. The in-form Sharma hit 4 fours and a six during his 20-ball stay but his wicket silenced the crowd.
Shreyas Iyer, who scored 30 before being run out while backing up at the non-strikers end, and Pandey then put on a gritty 42-run stand for the third wicket but their departure spelt trouble.
But veterans Karthik and Dhoni stayed calm in the final few overs when India needed 20 off 18 balls.
Earlier Asela Gunaratne, who top-scored 36, and Shanaka, who hit an unbeaten 29 off 24 balls, gave some respectability to the total after the visitors lost their top three batsmen for 18 runs.
Unadkat, who removed the openers early, was ably supported by fellow fast bowler Hardik Pandya as they claimed two wickets each.
Apart from the paceman, debutant off-spinner Washington Sundar, who opened the attack for India, dismissed Kusal Perera for four and ended with figures of 1-22.
After a dominant home season across all three formats, India now head for their high-profile tour of South Africa starting January 5 with the first Test in Cape Town. AFP

How much will the Earth get warmer next year
World raps U.S. knuckles over Jerusalem
In the United Nations last week the world community dealt a recalcitrant and boastful American President a sharp rap on the knuckles for his move on Jerusalem. But as 2017 draws to a close, humanity must look back, first and foremost, at the pace of global warming and climate change. How much closer are we to losing our living environment on Earth How much have the oceans risen in 2017 and how much more will sea waters encroach on land in the new year
Even though the President of the United States of America refuses to believe in global warming, the worlds premier space agency, namely, Americas own National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) has tons of information on the phenomenon of climate change and its growing impact on human civilisation. NASAs climate change monitoring website  full of easily understood graphics  reveals that due to global warming and the resulting melting of ice across the planet, the worlds oceans are now steadily rising.
In the last century, according to NASA, sea levels have arisen 8 inches. Following the recent faster rise in global temperatures, ocean water will encroach on land by at least 3 feet more during the rest of this century. This may not seem much living on a big island like Sri Lanka, but think of what is happening to The Maldive Islands.
Very little of The Maldives 1,200-plus chain of tiny islands is three feet above sea level. Thus, with Indian Ocean water levels rising, The Maldives literally faces extinction over the next century. Will Sri Lanka have to accommodate the 200,000-plus Maldivian population once it is displaced by rising ocean levels Questions such as these truly drive home the seriousness of the issue of global climate change.
Oceanic encroachment
Numerous small islands and archipelagos, such as the tiny Pacific islands of Nauru and Micronesia, are already experiencing this ocean encroachment and face displacement in the next few decades.
Our low-lying coastal areas too will experience this oceanic encroachment on our living space. Tens of millions of people in the large low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh and other parts of South Asia face displacement due to the gradual encroachment of ocean waters. Bangladesh is already very crowded. When sea water encroaches, where will the displaced population find living space in the even smaller and yet reducing land area Across the world, hundreds of millions of people face displacement and loss of livelihood as ocean waters encroach on land over the next several decades.
The passing of years is becoming a kind of countdown to humanitys displacement from the Earths land surface. And global warming is accompanied by other, already catastrophic, symptoms of climate change: massive swings in weather patterns disrupting agriculture, desertification and, freak storms becoming the norm and not the exception.
Meanwhile, climate crisis notwithstanding, US President Donald Trump continues to indulge in all kinds of political histrionics both domestic and international. While some of his histrionics are mere individual foibles  enacted in damaging real politik  other actions are done in coordination with his governing Republican Party.
Donald Trump may, on his own, indulge in gimmicks like some controversial public statements  often shockingly racist or sexist Tweets. These are often for the purpose of diverting attention from the on-going criminal investigations into Russian cyber subversion and Trumps own possible complicity with some of that subversion, specifically, possible clandestine collaboration with the Russians to tilt last years presidential election in his favour. Another motive for such pseudo-drama is to keep entertained Trumps immediate political constituency, mainly White American, lowbrow, working class segments especially in the poorer mid-western and eastern states.
At the same time, possible collusion with Americas old enemy and continuing rival power Russia, notwithstanding, the ruling Republican Party collaborates with their President in attempting to achieve their own political agenda.
Right now, mid-term elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate that are to be held next November are high on the Republican agenda. Hence, when President Trump opted to announce the US recognition of Jerusalem as the official capital of Israel, the Republican Party went along with their President even though the veteran party leaders knew, from governing experience itself, that this diplomatic recognition was not only a violation of international law and current United Nations resolutions, but also an undermining of the US long-held role as peace-maker in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
The sole reason why all those seasoned politicians of the Republican Party have gone along with Donald Trumps Jerusalem gimmick is domestic vote bank politics. The Republicans know that the Jerusalem move appeals to the Right-wing, Christian conservative voters most of whom are with the Republican Party.
With little legislative achievement to show in the first year of the Trump presidency other than the recently passed sweeping tax reforms, the Republicans need to have such populist actions like the Jerusalem recognition to retain their conservative Christian vote banks.
Many intellectuals in American across the political spectrum are amazed as to the lengths the current Republican Party leadership seems prepared to go in risking the undermining of Americas standing in the world as well as further de-stabilising the precarious West Asian situation - just for the purpose of short term electoral gains.
The Jerusalem announcement has estranged America from much of the world community, including its closest allies.
UN Security Councils emergency session
First, the UN Security Council convened in emergency session and the US suffered a condemnatory resolution which was only avoided by the US Ambassador casting a veto.
If the Security Council vote exposed the isolation of America, the subsequent UN General Assembly sitting, also convened urgently, showed the degree of hostility that the Jerusalem move has brought to the country once upheld as a beacon of civilised democracy and human decency.
In the General Assembly session, a similar condemnatory resolution was passed with 128 countries  including Sri Lanka - in favour, just 9 against (including the US and Israel) and 35 abstentions. A few country delegations stayed away from the UNGA session, probably too scared of the US to vote in favour of the resolution and yet unwilling to embarrass their Arab friends by attending and supporting America.
Many of the worlds poorer nations, including Sri Lanka, who are dependent on American aid and investment to some degree, supported the resolution, braving threats made by Donald Trump himself to cut off aid to those countries that went against the US. US Ambassador Nikki Haley, sounding like a schoolmarm, went around threatening to take names of those countries supporting the condemnatory resolution.
She would have had to take the names of the UK, Germany, France and almost all of Americas closest allies who all supported the UNGA resolution which condemned the American action on Jerusalem and declared it null and void.
Americas has gone further down the path to isolationism. The new year will show how much further such trajectory will hold before more thinking people in Washington get their act together to return the worlds most powerful nation on to a more rational path.
What Washingtons current performance clearly shows is that the current anomalies in policy are not simply due to the actions of an incompetent, bigoted individual in the White House. Rather, we are seeing probably the most right-wing, ethnocentric and isolationist Republican leadership tagging along behind that incompetent individual in the White House for the purpose of achieving their ideological goals while they can.

1964 when Bens beat Thomians by four wickets
Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties. It was amply proved in an inter school cricket match in 1964 where St. Benedicts College, Kotahena took on S. Thomas' College Mount Lavinia at Kotahena in the 1963/64 cricket season. Thomians were captained by Premalal Gunasekera while the Bens were led by Sunil Fernando. The Thomian camp was strengthened with the presence of Anura Tennekoon, Sriyantha Rajapaske, the gloveman of the side Kumar Boralessa, Sarath Seneviratne, Ranjan Samarasinghe, Meven Peiris and Barney Red while Bens team had in their ranks Ranjith Fernando, Mervyn Fernando, Felix Dias, Harold Sirisena, Maxwell Anandappa and Anuruddha Vithanachchi .
Premalal won the toss and elected to bat first and declared at 261 for 7 with skipper Gunasekera scoring a breezy knock of 53 runs ably supported by Tennekoon (35) Lasantha (44 and valuable contributions came off the bats of Sriyantha (28 and Senevriatne 20) Vithanachchi, J.A.J. Perera and Selva Perumal claimed two wickets each. In reply homesters were all out for 182 runs with Felix Dias making the top score of 52 runs while Maxwell Anandappa (34) Sunil Fernando (33), M. Perera (20) and Harold Sirisena was unbeaten on 20. Barney Reid had a fine spell of 6 for 32 while S.L. Perera claimed 3 for 71. In their second essay Thomian skipper Gunasekera declared the innings at 75 for 3 with L.S. Perera scoring 30 runs and gave Bens the task of scoring 155 runs in 90 minutes. At 5.30 p.m Bens were 42 runs behind with 4 wickets intact but Anandappa and S. M. Perera brought the score near to the target and it was Reid's turn and he got ready to bowl the final over of the day with eight runs needed.
The Bens pair took four singles in the first four balls and they were unable to get a run in the fifth delivery and three runs were needed for a tie and four runs for a victory and S.M. Perera had to face the last ball of the day. Reid bowled the last ball and S.M. Perera went for a big hit and missed it but the wicket keeper could not collect it and at a fair speed the ball passed the fence for four byes and Maxwell Anandappa was unbeaten on 47 runs and Sunil Fernando made 36 runs. Barney Reid had a match bag of 10 for 80. The jubilant spectators stormed the ground to celebrate the last ball victory with four wickets in hand. In the following week end Bens crushed Royalists before tea on the second day and then went on to beat Joes after a lapse of 47 yeas in the next week end and they went from strength to strength and finally they became the best team of the island and carried away the prestigious Lifebuoy Trophy.

American youngsters make their mark ahead of Ryder Cup
PARIS: The rising generation of Americans dominated the 2017 season after Spaniard Sergio Garcias memorable Masters triumph, laying down a marker ahead of next years Ryder Cup in Paris.
Brooks Koepka, 27, claimed the US Open title, before Jordan Spieths third major crown at the British Open and his fellow 24-year-old Justin Thomas breakthrough victory at the USPGA Championship.
Add in world number one Dustin Johnson, and United States Ryder Cup captain Jim Furyk has a formidable team more than capable of repeating Octobers Presidents Cup thrashing of the Internationals.
The US are the favourites to retain the trophy come next September at Golf National, but they havent won on European soil since 1993 at The Belfry.
We have 25 years of scars to overcome, Furyk said in Paris in October. I dont want (them) going in there being overconfident that they are the greatest team.
I want them going in with a chip on their shoulder that they have something to prove. Europes stars had a mixed season, although 37-year-old Garcia produced the years stand-out moment by finally ending his wait for a major title by edging out Justin Rose in a thrilling Masters play-off back in April.
Garcias compatriot Jon Rahm stole a few headlines by rising to world number four in his first full season as a professional, but four-time major winner Rory McIlroy was plagued by injuries and loss of form as he failed to win an event for the first year since 2008.

Australia coach Lehmann to step down in 2019
MELBOURNE, Monday : Australia cricket coach Darren Lehmann will not seek to renew his contract when his current deal expires at the end of 2019, he said in an interview aired Monday.
Lehmann outlined his plans to Fox Sports, declaring the English summer season in 18 months will be his last hurrah.
Australia will seek to defend their World Cup title in the first half of the 2019 English season before playing an Ashes Test series.
That will be it, Lehmann said when asked whether he will seek a new contract beyond 2019.
It will be a case of too much time, too much travel.
Lehmann has been at the helm since the 2013 Ashes when he replaced sacked coach Mickey Arthur following a disastrous tour of India.
In Lehmanns time as coach, Australia have won two Ashes series at home and lost two in England, while also winning the 2015 World Cup.
For me, Ive really enjoyed the role and loving it, he said.
Well just get to that point and work out what we do from there.
Former Test opener Justin Langer, who has an outstanding record at Western Australia and the Perth Scorchers, will be among the favourites to succeed Lehmann as national coach.  AFP

Australia plot another Boxing Day blow against England
MELBOURNE, Monday: Australia will look to extend their Christmas cheer into the dead rubber Boxing Day test by subjecting a demoralised England to a fourth consecutive loss in the Ashes at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Anchored by the brilliant batting of captain Steve Smith, the hosts have barely put a foot wrong in the five-match series and will head to the MCG confident of pushing England towards a second successive whitewash on home soil.
However, they will have to do it without their pace spearhead Mitchell Starc, who is nursing a heel injury and has been replaced by Jackson Bird.
While Starcs absence is a big relief for the tourists, Tasmania paceman Bird has been in impressive form in the domestic Sheffield Shield.
Right-armer Bird also has ample MCG experience, having made his test debut against Sri Lanka at the Melbourne colosseum and also bowled in last years Boxing Day test against Pakistan.
More of a line and length bowler, Birds inclusion robs Australia of the express pace, swing and left-arm variation of Starc, however.
Theyve had three bowlers who can all bowl 90 miles an hour (144 kph), England paceman James Anderson told the BBC of Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.
But you look beyond that, theyve got problems.
England have a few of their own issues to deal with, not least the worrying form of their senior players.
With opening batsman Alastair Cook and paceman Stuart Broad both enduring a poor series, pundits have called on selectors to be ruthless and start the regeneration of Joe Roots team now rather than later.
The calls are almost certain to be ignored given the players long service and lofty standing, but the pair will hope to prove they still belong at the highest level in the final tests in Melbourne and Sydney.
Englands pace stocks have been gutted by injuries and they are another man down with Craig Overton ruled out of the Melbourne match with a broken rib.
The tourists lack of pace has been exposed on Australias flat wickets, so selectors might opt to recall Durham fast man Mark Wood rather than pick the slower Jake Ball.
Queries over Moeen Ali also linger, the all-rounder struggling with the bat and his off-spin doing little to support Englands fast bowlers.
Uncapped Mason Crane, a legspinner with an average of 43.98, is in reserve in the squad but battling Australias pressure-free batsmen in front of a huge Boxing Day crowd could prove a harrowing debut for the 20-year-old.
Englands last trip to Melbourne was a miserable one, as Michael Clarkes Australia thrashed Cooks tourists by eight wickets to take a 4-0 lead in the series.
Dead rubber aside, the Boxing Day test is one of the great carnivals of Australian sport but a heavy security blanket at the MCG will add a sombre tone.

Bethlehem: House of Bread
But as for you Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His going forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity Micah 5:1.
Even the name of the too little town that our Abba Father chose for Christ to be born for us is part of the prophecy of the Messiah. The word Bethlehem means house of bread. Our Messiah God was born in Bethlehem, the house of bread. He Who would later declare I am the living bread that came down out of heaven (John 6:51) was born in Bethlehem, the house of bread. Our loving Father God wanted everyone to know that not only was the Messiah coming but also why the Messiah was coming. Jesus Christ, Emmanuel (God with us) was born in Bethlehem, that He might be recognised and received as the bread of life for all people. There is more than enough bread in Gods house of bread to feed and fulfill everybody in Jesus Christ, if one will but come to Jesus, the living bread that came down out of heaven.
Our Lord went on to say, If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I give for the life of the world is my flesh (John 6:51). It is wonderful to see that the very nature of Jesus birth, life, death, and resurrection are all foretold in the word Bethlehem. Let us go to Christ in Bethlehem today, Gods house of bread within us and let us gratefully pray, Give us this day our daily bread (Matthew 6:11). Amen, let us partake of Gods live forever bread, the bread of Christ Jesus Our Lord, Who has promised I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger (John 6:35).
The birthplace of Jesus Christ, Bethlehem, is one of the most famous Biblical places in Bible History.
So famous in fact that it has eclipsed another town that existed in Israel by the same name. The Bethlehem where the Messiah was born is in the south, near Jerusalem, in the territory of Judah. The other Bethlehem is in the north, near Nazareth, in the territory of Zebulun (see Tribal Lands).
Bethlehem in Judah
The most famous Bethlehem is located in the hill country (approximately 2,500 feet above sea level) of Judah. Situated on the main highway to Egypt (which came in very useful just after the birth of Jesus Christ), it was known variously as Ephratha (Genesis 35:16), Bethlehem Ephrathah (Micah 5:1), Bethlehem-Judah (1 Samuel 17:12), and the city of David (Luke 2:4).
Bethlehem is first mentioned in the Bible as the place near where Rachel died: So Rachel died and she was buried on the way to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem, and Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; it is the pillar of Rachels tomb, which is there to this day. (Genesis 35:19-20 RSV).
Bethlehem was the scene of the story of Ruth and hence the place where in later years David was born. It was at Bethlehem where David was anointed king by Samuel (1 Samuel 16:4-13).
Newborn Christ
It was because of Jesus ancestry to King David that Joseph and Mary were in Bethlehem when He was born, at the time of the census (enrollment): In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. This was the first enrollment, when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn (Luke 2:1-7 RSV).
In an attempt to kill the newborn Christ, Bethlehem was the scene of the slaughter of the innocents by Herod: Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in that entire region who were two-years-old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah: A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they were no more (Matthew 2:16-18 RSV).
In conclusion I would like to meditate with you on the words of Bishop Fulton Sheen taken from his book the Life of Christ pages 23, 27 In the filthiest place in the world a stable purity was born. He who was later to be slaughtered by men acting as beasts was born among beasts.
He would call himself the living Bread descended from Heaven, was laid in a manger literally a place to eat. Bethlehem became a link between heaven and earth. God and man met here and looked each other in the face. In taking of human flesh, the Father prepared it, the Spirit formed it and the Son assumed it.... He who had His birth in Bethlehem came to be born in the hearts of men, for what would it profit if He was born a thousand times in Bethlehem, unless He was born again in man
The manger and the Cross thus stand at the two extremities of the Saviours life! He accepted the manger because there was no room in the inn; He accepted the Cross because men said, We will not have this man for our king. Disowned upon entering, rejected upon leaving, He was laid in a strangers stable at the beginning, and a strangers grave at the end.
An ox and an ass surrounded His crib at Bethlehem; two thieves were to flank His Cross on Calvary. He was wrapped in swaddling bands in His birthplace; He was again laid in swaddling clothes in His tomb  clothes symbolic of the limitations imposed on His Divinity when He took a human form.
I encourage you to develop a hunger for God that can only be satisfied by God Himself. In this way you will ensure that you are making your way to Bethlehem in the Eucharist, continuously, to partake of your daily bread, this live forever bread, with your Gracious Lord Jesus, your One and only true and faithful Bread of Life. He satisfies our hunger always. Hallelujah!

Plight of travelling on route 155
If ever there is a cussed route operated by the private bus operators, the above will easily secure first place for the following.
No tickets are issued. Overcrowding is where animals are transported to have more free space. No bells so that infirm and elderly passengers are over carried. Seats removed to accommodate more standing passengers. Time tables are non-existent resulting in stops at the Town Hall for as long as the bus crew determine, so that they could make or receive telephone calls and read the papers. On the return trip the same is true opposite the Bambalapitiya flats. You dare not question why they remain halted for so long even though over packed in the stifling heat with widows that cannot be opened. The intimidating answers if you dare to question will be met with Get down and take a trishaw if you are in a hurry. No name boards in the rear and not lit up at night.
Which authority is responsible for all this The Ministry of Transport The Department of Motor Vehicle Registration The Transport Commission The answer lies with the CTB. Why does the CTB not operate more buses on this route Room for obvious suspicion. Why isnt the controlling authority looking into this One does operate at about 7.15 p.m. which passes Dehiwala. For the rest of the day they are non est. They have left the field open for this state of affairs.
The dear President of the LPBOA will yelp for help and increase in fares even if the price of a screw goes up. Has he thought of the plight and obligations towards the passengers whose fares pay his salary No a brass farthing!
This is written on behalf of thousands of helpless passengers left at the mercy of a few scoundrels. Will this also like all other problems in the country require action by the President Responsible officials must retire if they cannot act.

Colombo Port handles six millionth TEU
The Port of Colombo handled its six millionth Twenty-Foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) container volume last Friday.
Speaking at a special function held at the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to celebrate the handling of the 6 million TEU mark, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said it was commendable to witness the Colombo port achieving the great feats through public-private collaboration.
Deviating from the traditional competition, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority controlled Jaya Container Terminal, privately owned SAGT and CICT together have proven of a success story that we can continue to make the port the hub in the region, the Minister said.
He thanked officials, staff and employees of the SLPA, SAGT, CICT, shipping agents, freight forwarding agencies and stakeholders who contributed in numerous ways to elevate the position of the port to higher standards amongst the container ports of the world.
SLPA Chairman Dr.Parakrama Dissanayake said it was a historic milestone to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority as it was the collective effort of the SLPA with the JCT, SAGT and the CICT handling 6 million containers for a year at the port.
We have to be mindful of the marketing challenges we are expected to face. The commencement of operations of the East Terminal of the Colombo South Harbour in near future will see further increased efficiency in the port to attract more ships at its deep draft berths, Dr. Dissanayake said.
The Colombo port marked the operation of its first TEU in 1973. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) controlled Jaya Container Terminals stage. It was completed in 1985. The completion of the stage II of the JCT in 1987, stages III and IV in 1995 and 1996 respectively marked the increase of operation volumes of the port.
South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) commenced its work in 1999. In 2002, assisted by Asian the Development Bank (ADB), the SLPA initiated to construct the Colombo Port Expansion Project (CPEP) which is known as the Colombo South Harbour today. The new harbour was constructed with plans to the ever increasing Ultra Large Container Vessels. Its first terminal known as the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) was completed with the investment of over US $ 500 million as a PPP loan and on BOT model. The CICT of Colombo South Harbour came into operations in 2013.
With the rapid development of port infrastructure including the construction of new terminals and the public private partnership in operations at the Port of Colombo, the handling capacity of the Port of Colombo dramatically increased.
The Port of Colombo achieved one million TEUs in the year 1995. Although it took almost nine years to reach the mark of two million TEUs collaboratively with the SAGT in 2004, the Port handled three million TEUs in 2006, four million TEUs in 2010 and five million TEUs collaboratively with the CICT in 2015.
Together with the latest developments in the Sri Lankan port sector, the six million TEUs mark this year is recorded through aggressive marketing strategies implemented in collaboration with the SAGT, CICT and the public sector controlled JCT to offer a world class service with the maximum customer satisfaction and the minimum vessel turnaround time, Minister Samarasinghe said.
The SLPA, being the landlord, regulator and port operator together with other terminals has been able to attract more Main Lines and Feeder Services to the port in 2017, he saod.
With the latest initiatives implemented, all sectors of port operation show a rapid growth compared to similar periods during the past. A number of processes are being implemented in all commercial ports around the country under the purview of the SLPA to realise the vision of the government to develop Sri Lanka as the premier maritime hub of the region, the Minister said.
SLPA Vice Chairman P.G. Dasanayake, Managing Director H.D.A.S.Premachandra, SAGT and CICT officials other stakeholders were present.

Decision on using elephants in peraheras after committee report
President Maithripala Sirisena will commence a special programme to supply elephants for Peraheras after studying the committee report on the issue, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering before commencing Mihindu Perahera, organized by the Ingiriya Imagira Shri Bodhiraja Viharaya recently, he said according to Albert Einstein, Buddhist philosophy is something scientific. It is Buddhist Bhikkus who protected Buddhism for 2,500 years.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that as Buddhist devotees, all of us should assist Buddhist Bhikkus to protect the Buddha Sasana. There is a huge demand in Europe for Theravada Buddhism. That is why British rulers sponsored the Sri Dalada Perahera during the colonial era. Perahera shows the world our rich cultural heritage, the minister said.
Obtaining elephants for peraheras is an issue. Environmentalists say elephants should be protected. We have to protect our cultural heritage. Therefore, a committee is appointed to look into the matter and to make recommendations. A proper system will be set up to achieve both objectives, he added.

## Title: The Divine Plan

## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, December 26, 2017 - 01:00
The Divine Plan
As we would learn from the Scriptures, the Blessed Trinity existed before the beginning of time and had done much in respect from the beginning of time. The early chapters of the Book of Genesis contain references to God, the Eternal Word and the Holy Spirit, as being divine entities in the composition of the Blessed Trinity with joint and several responsibilities (Gen. 1: 2; 1:26).
They created the world in a state of perfection and brought mankind into existence to dwell in it. God who had His own divine prerogative placed them in a salubrious garden in serene conditions, where they lived in blissful happiness. God communicated with them from time to time in the harmonious relationship that existed with them. The serpent did not wish that the abiding relationship they had with God should continue. He tempted and misled them to disobey God which depraved them with sin. This sin severed the sublime relationship they had with Him and also made an adverse impact on the world. God was perturbed that they had fallen victims to the serpents intrigue, but as He loved them, He did not abandon them. His justice and generosity towards them prevailed. He promised a Saviour to purify the generations of mankind to come (Gen. 3:15).
Gods focus was therefore on mankind. It was His intention to help them to live their lives even in the changed and difficult conditions of the world. He communicated with them through His Prophets to tell them what He intended to do for them. Centuries later, He conveyed a prophecy through Prophet Isaiah to a king named Ahaz. The content of the prophecy was The Virgin is with child and will bear a son and call his name Emmanuel (Is. 7:14). It was not well understood by the people when it was given, but in later times the people themselves knew that it referred to a Saviour promised by God for whom they were waiting with unceasing hopes. However, they were mistaken about what the Saviour would do for them. They expected the Saviour to be a person of gallantry who would help them in their secular and material lives. They did not know that God was concerned not about their lives in this world but their lives after death.
The crux of Gods plan however, was to save mankind from sin because He did not want them to live in the culpability of sin for all time. In doing so, He wanted them to attain spiritual excellence in this life which was possible only if they avoided sin and pleased Him. However, they had to be taught a new way of life to do this and that was to come. Besides this, mankind had to be redeemed of sin, not by mankind, but by someone who was different from them and above them in spiritual attribution. He chose His Son, the Eternal Word, to be the catalyst to bring salvation to mankind.
John says in chapter one of his Gospel: In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God and the Word was God: He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him and without him nothing came to be (Jn. 1:1-3). The Word had a distinct existence and was Himself uncreated and eternal.
As God wanted mankind to be a part of His plan to save them, He chose a virgin named Mary of Nazareth to accomplish His plan. She was the first human to know about the Word and that was at the annunciation of His birth. An angel of God said to her: Do not fear, Mary, for God has looked kindly on you. You shall conceive and bear a son and you shall call him Jesus. He will be great and shall rightly be called Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the Kingdom of David, his ancestor; he will rule over the people of Jacob forever and his reign shall have no end (Lk. 1: 30-33); The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the holy child to be born shall be called Son of God (Lk. 1:35).
This divine message explained everything that was to take place. She conceived the Holy Child by the power of the Holy Spirit as she agreed with Gods proposition. The conception confirmed the truth of Isaiahs prophecy (Is. 7:14).
And it so happened that while shepherds were camping in the country side, taking turns to watch over their flocks by night, an angel of God appeared to them with the glory of the Lord shining around them. As they were terrified, the angel said to them Dont be afraid; I am here to give you Good News of great joy for all the people. Today a Saviour has been born to you in Davids town; he is the Messiah and the Lord. Let this be a sign to you; you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger (Lk. 2:8-12). Suddenly many more angels joined him, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth for God is blessing humankind (Lk. 2:13-14).
The shepherds hastened to visit the location in Bethlehem in search of the Child and found Him with His parents in a cave. All those around were astonished when the shepherds told them what they had seen and heard.
This was how God fulfilled His promise to bring a Saviour to this world to save mankind from sin for all time.

Elephant survey on the cards next year
A survey on elephants in Sri Lanka is due in the year 2018, Wildlife and Conservation Department Director General G.C. Sooriyabandara yesterday said. Speaking to the Daily News, Sooriyabandara further said the survey will be conducted in the dry season which falls during the months of August-September as a water hole count.
The objective of the survey is to identify the elephant habitats and their numbers, Sooriyabandara also said. The survey will also be helpful to collect data that will be imperative when launching development projects in the country and in mitigating Human-elephant conflict as well, he pointed out.
DWC Deputy Director Ranjan Marasinghe told the Daily News that the need for a survey on elephants is high considering the recent interests expressed by the public and other groups on elephant conservation.
Marasinghe also said that the DWC will be inviting all scientists, activist groups and foreign resource persons to contribute to this survey as there was much debate over the Elephant Census conducted by the Wildlife Department in 2011.
There were and there are several conflicting ideas when it comes to a data base on elephants. Some groups say that such a data base is necessary and important, when some groups say that such data collection is unnecessary, pointing out that keeping such records on these animals will cause them less good and more harm.
With all these conflicting ideas, we want all their inputs to make this study a success. Marasinghe pointed out.
Marasinghe also said that there were several hindrances such as trade union actions and conflicting ideas on surveying, which delayed the elephant survey in 2017.
He also said the DWC plans to collect data on elephants at this survey by using several direct, indirect and scientific techniques rather than from just a single method. Marasinghe also said it is important to negate the political involvements and various agendas that have a harmful impact on the matters relating to elephant conservation.
Director of Wildlife Health at the Department of Wildlife Conservation Dr. Tharaka Prasad told the Daily News that the number of elephant deaths in year 2017 is approximately between 250-270.
He said the reasons for these deaths include both natural causes and other reasons such as the Human-Elephant conflict.

Federer, Nadal shine as rivals hobble into 2018
PARIS: Written off as dead men walking, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal defied time to sweep the Grand Slams in 2017 while the injury curse which dogged their rivals looks set to be the new year's early storyline.
Evergreen Federer, who will turn 37 in 2018, took his majors tally to 19 with a fifth Australian Open title, which was secured by a five-set triumph over Nadal, and a record eighth Wimbledon with a stroll past a tearful Marin Cilic.
Nadal, 32 in June next year, was not to be outdone, claiming a 10th French Open, a third US Open crown and the year-ending world number one spot.
Federer finished the year at number two in the world, having started at 16, and a season-leading seven titles -- including three Masters at Indian Wells, Miami and Shanghai -- despite having skipped the entire clay court season.
It's been an amazing year for me, said Federer who had missed the last six months of the 2016 season through injury.
Nadal added two Masters titles at Monte Carlo and Madrid to his triumphs at Roland Garros and Flushing Meadows, finishing the campaign with six trophies.
The 16-time Grand Sam champion also secured the year-ending top ranking for a fourth time.
I never would have imagined I would end up as number one at the end of the season again, said the Spaniard.
It wasn't one of my goals going into the season -- far from it. After returning from a difficult period in my career and battling through injuries, this wasn't on my mind. Nadal will go into the new season without his uncle Toni who has been his coach since childhood.
But one thing will be familiar -- his career-long battle with knee injuries.
He was forced to withdraw after just one round at the World Tour Finals and has already pulled out of an exhibition tournament in the United Arab Emirates from December 28-30.
Injury worries
Injury permitting, Nadal will now start 2018 as top seed in Brisbane from next weekend with the Australian Open due to get underway on January 15.
The Spaniard is not the only A-lister under an injury cloud.
Former world number one Andy Murray and fellow three-time major winner Stan Wawrinka have not played since Wimbledon -- Murray suffered a hip injury while Wawrinka required two knee operations.
Murray has delayed his departure to Australia while Swiss star Wawrinka joined Nadal in pulling out of the UAE event.
Novak Djokovic will play in Abu Dhabi as the former world number one and 12-time Grand Slam winner makes his return having last played at Wimbledon where he picked up a season-ending wrist injury.
Djokovic is now ranked 12 in the world, Murray is at 16 while Wawrinka starts 2018 at nine.
I wouldn't be surprised if 2018 worked out for them as well like it worked out for me and Rafa, predicted Federer.
The new year could also see the highly-regarded Alexander Zverev make a Slam breakthrough after a 2017 which saw him win five titles.
However, the beanpole German had a roller-coaster year at the Slams -- a last-16 spot at Wimbledon punctuated by a first-round loss in Australia, a second-round exit in New York and a third-round defeat to Nadal in Australia.
On the women's circuit, Serena Williams started the year with an Open-era record 23rd Slam triumph in Melbourne.
The achievement was made even more remarkable when the American star revealed she had won the title while pregnant.
Baby talk
Williams, who hasn't played since her Australian Open win, married boyfriend and Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian in November, two months after the couple celebrated the birth of their baby daughter in September.
In Williams's absence, a power vacuum in the women's game opened up as Jelena Ostapenko and Sloane Stephens became two of the most unlikeliest champions at the Slams.
Ostapenko, a 100-1 outsider, became Latvia's first ever Grand Slam champion at Roland Garros, claiming her first career title in the process.
At Flushing Meadows, Stephens won the US Open, just six weeks after seeing her world ranking slip to 957. In between, Garbine Muguruza won a second major at Wimbledon.
Muguruza was one of five women -- Williams, Halep, Angelique Kerber and Karolina Pliskova were the others -- to have a spell at world number one. Halep was to end 2017 on top but the popular Romanian, who has yet to win a major, faces a challenge to stay there next year especially with Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka lurking. Five-time Slam winner Sharapova returned from a 15-month doping ban in April and ended the year at 59 in the world.
Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, only played two events in 2017 after taking time away to give birth to a baby son. Her late season plans were thwarted by a lengthy custody battle over the youngster. AFP

Five cricketers who were game changers in 2017
With just a few more matches left for the year to culminate, here are some players who put on unexpectedly brilliant performances in the various formats. These unbeknownst cricketers are arranged in the magnitude of the shock factor as well as momentousness of their exploits in the calendar year thus far. While the unforeseen efforts of experienced cricketers are not taken into consideration for this particular segment, only those with a handful of appearances are examined in order to fulfill the titular criteria.
Quite a few batsmen and bowlers, who were not expected to excel, made a mockery of predictions by stealing the limelight. In all three formats of the game, let us take a close look at five such cricketers whose game-changing exploits surprised one and all during this calendar year.
KESHAV MAHARAJ
From ten Tests in 2017, Maharaj notched consistent performances across a wide variety of conditions. On the predominantly seam-friendly surfaces in New Zealand, he bucked the trend by topping the bowling charts with as many as 15 scalps from the three matches. His career best haul of 6/40 propelled the visitors to a series-sealing victory in Wellington. With India and Australia visiting his shores for high-profile assignments, Maharaj will get plenty of opportunities next year to further his progress in Tests.
43 wickets from 10 Tests at an average of 24.76 and strike-rate of 49.3 with two five-wicket hauls.
YUZVENDRA CHAHAL
When the year began, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were India's primary spin duo across all three formats. A relentless Test season saw both spinners rested for T20I series against England. During the deciding clash, Yuzvendra Chahal emerged from nowhere and became the first Indian bowler to pick up a five-wicket haul in T20Is. His 6/25 spun the visitors into submission on a viciously turning track at Bengaluru.
21 wickets from 14 ODIs at an average of 28.57 and economy-rate of 4.95
19 wickets from 10 T20Is at an average of 14.36 and economy-rate of 7.28 with one five-wicket haul.
SHAI HOPE
Even as eminently respected cricketing minds like Ian Bishop continued to speak highly of him, Shai Hope's initial exploits on the field did not match up to the hype spawned off the field. In fact, from his first seven Tests, the right-hander could only muster a measly average of 17.15 with a highest score of 41. Then, the tide began to turn and how. 2017 has been a watershed moment in Hope's career. The talented Bajan played ten Tests in this calendar year and scored 773 runs at an impressive average of a shade over 45.
773 runs from 10 Tests at an average of 45.47 with two centuries and three fifties.
FAKHAR ZAMAN
Replacing Ahmed Shehzad at the top of the order, Zaman immediately made a mark by instilling much needed intent to Pakistan's batting lineup. The opener followed a 31 on debut with half-centuries against Sri Lanka and England. But he had reserved his best for the final. After being reprieved by Jasprit Bumrah's ill-fated no-ball, Zaman barnstormed his way to a career-defining century against India in the summit clash.
The left-hander's belligerent 114 set the foundation for Pakistan's emphatic triumph in the final.
400 runs from 9 ODIs at an average of 44.44 and strike-rate of 100.5 with one century and two fifties.
STEVE O'KEEFE
Some may allude to West Indies overpowering England at Headingley or Pakistan eviscerating highly-rated teams en route to their Champions Trophy triumph as the upsets of the year.
However, in terms of sheer magnitude of the result, none of them come close to Australia's humbling of the top-ranked India on a rank turner in Pune. Into the fifth Test of his stop-gap career, O'Keefe produced one of the most astonishing bowling performances in modern history.
Although he subsequently managed to smear the then recently accrued momentum under the influence of alcohol, the left-arm spinner had played an instrumental role in breaking Australia's Test drought in Asia.
25 wickets from 6 Tests at an average of 26.92 and strike-rate of 62.7 with two five-wicket hauls.

G. L. Peiris clan faces sure defeat: Minister Dissanayake
The G. L. Peiris clan is facing a sure defeat at the forthcoming local government elections. They don't have any stable political future. I with other SLFP members invite them to join hands with us - the true SLFP - before it is too late to achieve a bright and promising political future, said SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said so addressing the Anuradhapura district SLFP candidates contesting the local government elections.
The Minister said he was optimistic that the SLFP would win the 18 Pradeshiya Sabhas and Anuradhapura Municipal Council at the polls. The nomination papers of G.L. Peiris' party for Mihintale, Thirappane Pradeshiya Sabha was rejected, thus making it a good omen for us to ensure victory, Dissanayake pointed out.
The SLFP candidates of the local government elections have been selected carefully, having looked into their history, conduct, discipline and proficiency along with professional aspects acceptable to all in the village. We are determined to win all local government bodies under the leadership of President Mathripala Sirisena, he said.
He said it is observed that a large number of UNP and JVP supporters are joining hands with the SLFP at village level along with SLFP supporters who were in a dilemma for whom they should work at the elections due to the unwarranted conflicts within the SLFP due to the actions of some hypocrite political elements hoping for the destruction of the long-existing party. We have a clear vision, political ideology and a promising future as far as we remain intact in the SLFP, he emphasized.
He said it is a pride to be a true SLFPer to get an opportunity to work hand in hand with the President who will continue to be the leader of the country and the party for years to come. To become an SLFP member of a local government body at this juncture is exciting as such grassroots level politicians are those who will be future leaders and guardians of the party. Therefore, work hard and move closely with the village community whole-heartedly to create a prosperous country, Dissanayake said.

Godfrey Evans, the chunky wicket-keeper of Kent and England
Rewinding my memory back to the 1950s, Godfrey Evans comes to my mind as a keeper who was enthusiastic, full of energy and one who could rev up the flagging spirits of his team mates even when the chips have hit rock bottom.
As an ardent cricket fan, enthusiast and an analyst, I am disgusted at the way some of our boys are playing the game in India. I wonder whether a person like Godfrey Evans could work a miracle to turn things around.
We have had two captains in the recent past - one a little bit on the timid side and the other looks like a rock star on stage dancing to a different tune! The only redeeming factor of the 2nd T20 was when Upul Tharanga and Kusal Perera was going great guns. Where Tharanga was mastering the Indian bowlers with a clinical eye, cross-batting and lifting the Indian bowlers at 45 degrees angle hitting the sweet spot time and time again to get the maximum purchase, Kusal was somewhat in his prime (well-muscled, beautifully proportioned, with a low centre of gravity helping him to execute his shots square of the wicket on either side with ease since he could balance himself well even with one leg).
A replica of Sanath Jayasuriya, butchering the Indian bowlers even at angles nearly parallel to the ground and hitting sixes at will in this period of play.
The partial Indian crowds, the players and of course the commentators were dumb struck for a while, but then the rot set in, wickets fell like nine pins and the funeral rites were performed in double quick time. In this festive season one hopes not one god but all the other gods put together must find a solution.
Hathurusingha is waiting in the wings, will Hathuru has all the mithuros on his side to enjoy a grand Christmas lunch, or would it be over spiced one wonders, the best will be for Hathuru to have his own recipe.
Godfrey Evans indefatigable spirit and skill behind the stumps were his greatest contributions to English cricket, especially in the golden years of cricket of the 1950s, states Ronald Perry in his book Bradmans Best Ashes Teams.
He goes on to state that no matter whether opposition was 8 for 80 or two for 400, Evans enthusiasm and drive lifted English spirits like no other. It was his personality as much as his diving for miraculous leg side catches or brilliant stumpings that made him such an important part of a winning team.Spectators loved him too, his theatrics smiles and boundless energy made him worth watching. He loved his cricket and it loved him. His batting too had a certain attraction and was never dull except for the odd occasion when he had to play defensively for the team.
Keepers have always been characters, but most likely to go about their business unobtrusively. Evans was too fun loving and extroverted not to be noticed at every chance. And there were plenty of opportunities in his position on the field. If he kept to the menacing spin of Jim Laker and Tony lock, his very presence was intimidating to batsman, who knew that the merest slip forward of the crease would invite swift dismissal. Evans would affect an exaggerated twist of his broad shoulders and upper body towards the square leg umpire.
The gloves would be swept and the pose would be held until the umpire either agreed with the appeal or turned it down. Evans was daring too. He often kept up to the stumps to medium pacers, which took both lightning reflexes and courage.
The stocky and muscular Evans (5 ft 9 ins; 74 kg) loved being up at the stumps, not the least reason being his ability to dive forward of the wicket for a catch or to stop a run. Yet he was equally adept at standing back to Frank Tyson when he bowled faster than any one ever had in Australia.
Perry stated that young Godfrey was brought up in Kent at the familys property Lords, Sheldwich, near Faversham, the 100 acre farm of his once rich stock broker grandfather. Evans mother died when he was three. His father an Electrical Engineer was often abroad. Evans boarded at Kent College from eight to sixteen and at 14 made a quick fire 101 not out for his school in an evening match against choir school Canterbury.
It was his good fortune that the game was witnessed by a member of the Kent county staff at the Lawrence ground Canterbury. It led to his own appointment on the staff at Kent at the beginning of the 1937 season.
He decided to become a keeper like his hero, Les Ames who was also at Kent, along with another, Frank Wooley. The ground became Evans cricket headquarters for the next 22 years, concluded Perry.

The Interpol has issued a red notice on the 33-year-old Jagamuni Sujeewa De Soyza alias Kosgoda Sujee, while a blue notice was issued on Makandure Madush.
Interpol issues a red notice to seek the location and arrest of wanted persons with a view to extradition or similar lawful action and a blue notice is issued to collect additional information about a persons identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.
Kosgoda Sujee is believed to have had a hand in over 10 murders in addition to a spate of other crimes including drug trafficking. Madush too is a wanted criminal and believed to be a mjor drug trafficker.
The Police belive they are residing overseas. However, the duo have carried out their criminal acts unabated here with the help of local accomplices, according to Police sources.
Last week the Police arrested a suspect believed to be directly involved with Madush. He and seven others were arrested with weapons and narcotics at Negombo, according to media reports. Meanwhile Police sources said that requests will be made to the Interpol to issue notices on several other wanted criminals believed to be hiding abroad shortly.

Lest we forget
Do you remember December 26, 2004 That was the day, exactly 14 years ago, when the massive Indian Ocean Tsunami hit Sri Lanka and 13 other countries in the Indian Ocean and African region. It was the deadliest natural disaster in recent human history, killing nearly 230,000 people in just a few hours. Most Sri Lankans did not even know the word tsunami (Japanese for Big Wave) then, but the very word now instills a sense of palpable fear in everyones hearts.
The tsunami triggered by a 9.3 undersea quake took three hours to travel from its epicenter near Sumatra, Indonesia, to the eastern coasts of India and Sri Lanka. It is baffling that there was no warning for thousands of coastal dwellers in these countries despite the availability of the Internet and cellular phones. It was later found that warnings were sent from international earthquake monitoring stations such as the US Geological Survey but there was no system for getting that lifesaving information to coastal villages. These people received absolutely no advance notice.
If we learned one major lesson from that devastating event, it was the dire need for a tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean region. Previously, tsunamis were rarely seen as a threat in the region; in the Indian Ocean tsunami occurrences have been highly variable, with intervals between tsunamis ranging from every few decades to around 500 years. The only country in Asia with any tsunami experience was Japan, which incidentally suffered a massive tsunami in 2011 that killed around 20,000 people.
The massive death toll of Boxing Day 2004 changed everything and there was a big global push for a tsunami warning system. After years of construction, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS) became fully operational in 2013. It can quickly detect undersea earthquakes, discern whether or not they will produce a tsunami, monitor how ocean waves are propagating, and predict where they might end up. This detection and monitoring network then provides information to the regions three tsunami warning centres in Australia, Indonesia, and India. This system uses the latest technology instead of unreliable buoys which have been replaced with a GPS shield using satellite data and computer models able to detect sea level variations from space, with only a minor loss of time and accuracy. Even for so-called near-field tsunamis which can sometimes hit within 10 to 15 minutes, the system should be able to give at least a few minutes heads-up for affected populations.
Sri Lanka did have a couple of instances where the warning system came into play and the authorities regularly conduct drills. The system can automatically text warnings to phones in affected areas, alongside simultaneous television and radio warnings. The tsunami warning mechanism is now ingrained in our minds and the moment coastal dwellers hear about an undersea earthquake in Asia, they are mentally prepared to reach higher ground. Still, education and awareness is much needed. Indeed, technology alone cannot save lives - the warning system has to work with existing infrastructure limitations and preparedness of local authorities. Most people can survive tsunamis with advance warnings. Put to the test, they race for safe ground, scramble up trees or manage to ride debris to safety. Smart planning can maximize these chances.
The other major challenge facing all the affected countries was reconstructing damaged properties  and even more importantly, rebuilding shattered lives. Sri Lanka has come out on top largely in the first category. However, there is no trace of nearly half of the massive quantum of foreign aid running into billions of dollars received by the country. Corruption on a massive scale robbed our chances of building back better after the tsunami. This is an unpardonable crime and it is still not too late to probe the tsunami money trail.
It is even more difficult to get shattered lives back on track  what do you say to a little boy who had lost his entire family to the raging waves To parents who lost all their children While many tsunami affected people have restarted their livelihoods and almost everyone has got a house to live in, there will always be those who cannot come to terms with their loss. They should be well looked after and given continuous assistance and counseling to get on with their lives afresh.
Preparedness is the key to surviving a future tsunami or earthquake. Earthquakes cannot be predicted with the technology we currently have. Speculation is rife as to when the next big earthquake or tsunami will hit our part of the world. Japanese experts expect another big earthquake or tsunami within 30 years in that region. Research suggests the planet could see, on average, 20 high-magnitude earthquakes for each of the next four years which could ultimately affect one billion people. Given this situation, Sri Lankan researchers should be more heavily involved in tsunami and earthquake research. It may be difficult to battle natures fury, but we can still take steps to minimize the damage to life and property.

Shedding culture of secrecy
New report finds right to information varies by ministry
With the passage of the landmark Right to Information Act in 2016, ministries and government departments were supposed to make large amounts of information available for the first time.
But a new report by the World Bank and Colombo-based Verite Research shows that many public agencies still have not.
The law has been in effect now since February of this year. Under three sections, government agencies are supposed to disclose certain information proactively, meaning that such data should be available to anybody, at any time.
Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms
Gayantha Karunathilake
Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages
Mano Ganesan
That information could include budgets, public services, expenditures, and prior disclosures from specific requests under the RTI Act.
But Verite Research calculated that to date, the amount and availability of information from 49 out of the 55 public authorities they surveyed was moderately unsatisfactory. Three more ministries scored lower, as unsatisfactory.
Only the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs received a moderately satisfactory score.
The findings suggest that the implementation of the online proactive disclosure section of the RTI Act is overall limited and uneven across public bodies and categories of information, the authors wrote.
In an interview, Acting Director General of the Government Information Department Sudarshana Gunawardene acknowledged the situation.
We see that theres a huge gap at the moment, he said.
Sabrina Esufally, one of the researchers in the project, said the study establishes an important baseline for ministries to improve from.
For ministries to improve their scores, they should be publishing more information of a substantive nature, she said.
So what actually is being disclosed
The information public authorities are publishing properly mainly relates to budgets. Verite found that 67 percent of ministries are meeting their requirements for this category under the law, even if they are posting to secondary websites, like that of the Ministry of Finance or www.documents.gov.lk. Other areas of information, however, suffer.
Only 13 percent of ministries posted timely and detailed information on the public projects they are overseeing, according to Verite.
In addition, ministries posted minimal disclosures of information on categories such as Public Services and Public Participation, the authors wrote, which can inhibit the ability of citizens to engage with government and access basic services.
Acting Director General of the Government
Information Department Sudarshana Gunawardene
To illustrate this point, the researchers identified the three-most discussed topics in Parliament from September 2015 to August 2017, and then tried to find information about them on the relevant ministries websites.
Those topics, according to Verites parliamentary tracker, were economic policy and development, disaster management, and land.
But the authors found that the Ministry of Disaster Management did not have critical information on public services, which was supposed to be disclosed under the RTI law, on its website.
The absence of such information in the aftermath of a natural disaster could adversely affect displaced persons without access to emergency healthcare and sanitation, they wrote. The recent flooding in Colombo and the Department of Meteorologys lack of information on services emphasizes this point.
Similarly, the Ministry of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms did not disclose information relating to how it operates and its decision-making processes, Verite found.
Worse, during the period of the study, five ministerial portfolios did not even have functioning websites.
These ministries, according to Verite, were the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research, the Ministry of Foreign Employment, the Ministry of Development Assignments, the Ministry of Special Assignments, and the Ministry of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development.
During the monitoring period we were faced with numerous instances where websites and information that was up one day, would be down the other, Sabrina Esufally, the Verite researcher, added.
Lost in translation
The availability of information in all three official languages was also an issue. Verite found that English was the most widely used language for disclosure, followed by Sinhala and then Tamil.
Ministries as a whole scored the worst for their Tamil publications; the website for the Ministry of Women and Childs Affairs, for example, has a Tamil version of its homepage thats actually mostly in English. Only a few key words are in Tamil.
Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue, and Official Languages Mano Ganesan said he was concerned by the reports findings.
Obviously, obviously, obviously the languages should be equal, he said. English is the link language, Sinhala and Tamil are the national languages. English cannot replace Tamil and Sinhala.
But he also said translation is a resource-intensive task, and that change cannot happen overnight.
The will is there, we must not also think that ministries are systematically or willingly doing it, he said. They want to recognize and abide by the law.
He said the Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue, and Official Languages is conducting six-month trainings of language officers to be translators for other ministries.
Adjusting to the new thinking
Despite the mediocre marks, Acting Director General of the Government Information Department Sudarshana Gunawardene said the government has actually made a lot of progress in terms of disclosure.
We are going towards the right direction, he said in an interview.
He added that as much as ministries and public agencies are learning to comply with new technical guidelines, they also need to shed a culture of secrecy.
Traditionally the government looks at information as something restricted, he said. The new legal right to information, by contrast, is new thinking.
The national security mentality that prevailed in the country during the separatist war also contributed to this attitude, he said.
All that aside, he admitted that he sees a huge gap in the information thats supposed to be disclosed under the law, and what actually makes it to the public.
Gunawardene said the focus of the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media now is to strengthen proactive disclosure through workshops, technical assistance, and capacity-building.
He mentioned that his department had hosted a workshop earlier this month for RTI officers in the Western Province.
These officers need capacity-building to better comply with the RTI law, he said. But in the long run, success is due to the enabling environment, the general atmosphere, he added.
We are getting more (RTI) requests, he said. That means people are aware of the situation, and we are responding fast.
For Verites part, Researcher Sabrina Esufally said the Media Ministry had responded positively to its report.
(The Ministry) felt that the methodology and ranking system would incentivize greater proactive disclosure, she said.
Despite the fact that it is still early days, there were some ministries, such as the Ministries of Health, Finance, and Education that were able to obtain relatively high scores, she added.
But until government officials shed the culture of secrecy, proactive disclosures, and responses to RTI requests, will be an uphill battle.
Right to Information Act
The Right to Information Bill was presented in Parliament on March 24,2016 by then Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathila.
The main purpose of the Bill was to provide for the Right of access to information, to specify grounds on which access may be denied, to establish the Right to Information Commission, to appoint Information Officers and to set out the procedure and for matters connected with it.
Subject to the provisions of section 5 of this Act, every citizen would have a right of access to information which is in the possession, custody or control of a public authority. The Right to Information bill was first presented to Parliament on March 24, 2016, and the amended bill was presented in Parliament on June 23 for the second reading.
The RTI bill was amended following the Supreme Courts decision in May that certain clauses of the Bill violate the constitution and that it would need a two-thirds majority in Parliament to become law if not amended.
However a request for access to information shall be refused under following circumstances: Information related to personal information devoid of any public interest, defense matters of the state, confidential details on international agreements, information which might harm the economy of Sri Lanka, trade secrets, medical records, communication between a professional and a public authority which is not permitted to be disclosed, information which might hamper detection of any crime, information which would be in contempt of court, information that would infringe the privileges of Parliament and information which may be harmful to the integrity of an examination conducted by the Department of Examination, etc.
Ministries, departments, public corporations, local authorities, non-governmental organizations that are substantially funded by the government, higher educational institutions, courts and tribunals etc. should provide access to information and shall maintain records.
They must also endeavor to preserve all records in electronic format.

Number of criminals in Pohottuwa nomination lists, alleges SB
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which will contest the upcoming Local Government election under the symbol Pohottuwa (Flower Bud) has included a number of criminals and corrupt individuals in the nomination lists, Minister S. B. Dissanayake charged yesterday. Speaking at a public event in Kandy, the Minister said, individuals accused of murder and those who threw parties to celebrate the raping of women were allegedly included in the SLPP nominations lists.
He also stressed that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will not support the SLPP at the local bodies where the SLFP nominations were rejected.
He said views expressed by some that the SLFP will support SLPP at Local Government bodies where the formers nominations were rejected may be personal ones. Minister Dissanayake also said the SLFP unlike the SLPP has not included any disreputable individuals in the partys nomination lists. Meanwhile, media reports said that the Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) election monitoring organisation was making arrangements to inform the Inspector General of Police about the criminals and corrupt individuals included in the nomination lists of political parties contesting the forthcoming election.

Police nab Pohottuwa supporters
The Police on Sunday interrupted the distribution of free fertiliser to farmers allegedly by supporters of a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or a Pohottuwa candidate contesting the upcoming Local Government election for the Kebithigollewa Pradeshiya Sabha.
The free fertiliser alleged to be election goods had been distributed to selected farmers in front of the house of the said female candidate from the SLPP.
The fertiliser according to the Police allegedly belongs to the Govijanaseva Department where the said SLPP candidates husband is an employee.
The Kebithigollewa Police said they had taken the stock of fertiliser into custody following a complaint that free fertiliser was being distributed to some selected farmers in front of the SLPP candidates house.
The Assistant Election Commissioner for Anuradhapura district Asanka Ratnayake said the Police had received a complaint that free fertiliser was being distributed near the house of a candidate contesting the upcoming LG polls in Kebithigollewa and they had taken immediate steps to stop it.
Ratnayake said the relevant authorities at the GovijanaSeva Department has been informed about the incident and an inquiry too will be conducted by his office to ascertain whether the fertiliser had been distributed as election goods.
He said that the Govijanaseva Department will conduct a separate inquiry into the incident.

Pope pleads for migrants at Christmas mass
VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis in his Christmas eve mass Sunday urged the world's 1.3 billion Catholics not to ignore the plight of migrants who are driven from their land because of leaders willing to shed innocent blood.
So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary, the Argentine pontiff, himself the grandson of Italian migrants, told worshippers in Saint Peter's Basilica We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away but, driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Many engulfed in the ongoing migration crisis were forced to flee from leaders who, to impose their power and increase their wealth, see no problem in shedding innocent blood, said the 81-year-old, who will give his traditional Urbi et Orbi Christmas address on Monday.
The pontiff's plea for hope came as fresh tensions simmered in the West Bank following Washington's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
The announcement by US President Donald Trump on December 6 unleashed demonstrators and clashes, including in Bethlehem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank where Christians marked the birth of Jesus at a midnight mass.
On Sunday, Guatemala President Jimmy Morales said his country would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, following Trump's controversial lead.
Celebrating mass in the ancient town, Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, apostolic administrator of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, used his homily to lambast the wars that the Herods of today fight every day to become greater, to occupy more space. AFP

Prices of drugs will reduce if dollar drops: Rajitha
Prices of drugs will be reduced by five percent in future if the dollar drops, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after opening the new Lanka Sathosa outlet at Payagala recently.
The Minister said the prices were increased by five percent as the dollar value increased but the prices would be reduced by five percent if the value of the dollar dropped.
A paracetamol price has gone up by seven cents. The old price was Rs. 1.30 and now it is Rs. 1.37, he said.
All media speak about the five percent price increase. But they rarely talked about 85 percent price reduction. It is a low level media culture. Today prices of commodities were reduced and a coconut sells in Sathosa outlet for Rs. 65 and one kg of big onions sells at Rs. 135, the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that persons who have allegations cannot contest in upcoming Local Government election, but the leaders of political parties do not know the unsuitable people who represent villages.
The leaders should be informed about them. The Prime Minister removed a name of a person from a CMC nomination list when the media reported that the person is a son of a underworld gang leader, he said.
