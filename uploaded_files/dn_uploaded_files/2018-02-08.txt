Debt-management crisis due to 10 years of mismanagement
The former Government has systematically window dressed fiscal data for over a decade to understate the national debt, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said.
The AG was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday to brief the media on current state of affairs in debt management in Sri Lanka.
He said the former Government, which took loans in a manner that exceeds the ceiling limit of borrowings set by the law, had hidden those figures in financial statements or had transferred them to various other places.
Wijesinghe revealed a dummy account named Investments on Borrowings had been used to balance the account sheets since 2013.
He added the Finance Ministry has in writing admitted that it was really a dummy account and even recurrent expenditure came under this heading.
The Auditor General pointed out state debt management is in shambles today due to its mismanagement for over a decade. He said former Finance Ministry Secretary P.B. Jayasundara is a key figure to be blamed for the total wreck of financial discipline in the country leading to a deepened crisis on state debt management.
Noting that the state debt management is in shambles given the deliberate and complete disregard for financial norms and regulations for over a decade, the AG stated, If anybody questions me of the total figure of the countrys debt as at present, my answer would be that only Waima can sort it out. It is in such a mess especially due to mismanagement in the last 10 years. Taking loans in a manner that exceeds the ceiling limit of borrowings and then hiding those figures from accounting books or transferring those figures to various other institutions have led to this crisis. The former Finance Ministry Secretary, who was also dubbed as the Economic Hit Man, had committed many acts to ruin the countrys financial discipline, he said.
Explaining the sorry state of affairs in the countrys debt, he said the total figure stood at Rs 10.3 trillion as at November 30, 2017 according to the Central Bank statistics. He said this figure according to the Finance Ministry was Rs 8.8 trillion as at December 31, 2016. This means that we have a per capita debt burden of Rs 417,913, he added.
This figure is not inclusive of debt accumulated in Provincial Councils, Local Government Authorities and public enterprises. Added to that, there are Rs 826 billion unaccounted debt. Moreover, the massive loans obtained by Road Development Authority to the tune of Rs 136 billion are not in the books. To be plain, the Pension Department is paying the pension by obtaining loans and it has obtained loans to the tune of Rs 37 billion. That amount is also not included in the books, Wijesinghe explained.
The AG pointed out that keeping the Finance Ministry under the purview of the President was a major factor that contributed to fiscal mismanagement. The Finance Ministry started executing Presidential powers and the former Finance Ministry Secretary took high hand and did not even respect the Ministers. Violating financial regulations became the new norm, he stated.
He concluded that urgent reforms are needed to improve the financial management in state sector, adding that if immediate actions were taken the country could get out of the debt trap at least by another 10 years.
He warned the situation could worsen as the peak of debt repayment comes in 2018-2020.
He added that the Chief Accounting Officers (Ministry Secretaries and Department Heads) must work with backbone to refuse to obey any ministerial order that contravenes the law. He accused that a mafia of Ministry Secretaries are blocking the passage of Audit Bill.

Auditor General laments Forest Dept. inaction over jumbo issue
The Auditor Generals Department is working on a special report on the Forest Conservation Departments inaction over conservation of elephants, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said.
Given the current rate of elephant deaths, Wijesinghe said the country is at the risk of losing its entire elephant population by 2048. He made this remark while addressing a press conference at the Information Department Auditorium, yesterday.
The Forest Conservation Department officials have shirked their responsibilities. Despite the seriousness of the issue, they are fully complacent doing nothing. The Forest Conservator General is dutybound to take action to protect elephants, he noted.
Commenting on the much talked-of resettlement of people in forest lands adjacent to the Wilpattu National Park, the auditor general said the FCD has clearly contravened the law, adding that his Departments special audit report on Wilpattu has detailed many of those issues.
Detailing on special audit inquiries currently being undertaken by the Department, Wijesinghe said financial irregularities in the import of dairy cows have resulted in a loss running to billions of rupees to the government.
He said the report, in this regard, would be produced shortly. Some farms have had to fix fans to keep those imported cattle as otherwise those creatures cannot survive in Sri Lankan climate, he remarked.
He said that a special team has been appointed to look into the issues pertaining to the Sri Lankans working overseas. He said the officials were sent to cities such as Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait to look into the petitions received to the Department.
The auditor general however, regretted that no follow up action has been taken with regard to the special audit reports furnished by the Department on the rice importation scandal, construction of D.A. Rajapaksa tomb and the Coal Procurement tender.
He also lamented the inordinate delay of National Audit Bill, adding that his Department is similar to a man thrown out to sea with his hands tied as he is unable to execute the powers vested on him under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution without the Act.
He pointed out the National Procurement Commission is undergoing a similar fate due to non-passage of the relevant Act in Parliament. While noting that most of the financial irregularities occur during the procurement process, Auditor General Wijesinghe stressed the need of Procurement Commission.
At present, the Commission has only got the power to make procurement guidelines. Procurement guidelines are not admissible before the law. Therefore, those cannot be enforced in Sri Lanka, he commented.

Bangladeshs Mahmudullah eyes maiden series win over Sri Lanka
DHAKA, Wednesday: Acting Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad said Wednesday his team was confident of getting its first-ever Test series win over Sri Lanka after eking out a dogged draw in the opener.
The decider starts Thursday in Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium and follows a controversial drawn first Test in Chittagong that drew censure from cricket's governing body.
The hosts managed a draw despite Sri Lanka leaving them in a precarious position at 81-3 at stumps on the fourth day.
The visitors -- who declared at a colossal 713 for nine in their first and only innings -- criticised the pitch after the match.
Mahmudullah, who is standing in for injured skipper Shakib Al Hasan, said Bangladesh played better at home and were confident of clinching a historic series win in Dhaka.
"We got out of a tough position in the first match. So this game is a great chance for us to win a Test series," he told reporters.
"I think our team is better, especially at home. It will be a good contest, which was mostly the case in Chittagong."
Bangladesh have not won a Test series since beating Zimbabwe 3-0 at home in 2014 and have defeated Sri Lanka just once in their last 19 contests in the longest form of the game.
Mahmudullah said the Dhaka pitch was "result-oriented" and would favour spinners -- conditions absent in the run spree at Chittagong.
The International Cricket Council penalised the "below average" pitch in Chittagong for providing no seam movement to fast bowlers and too heavily favouring the batters.
Batsmen plundered more than 1,500 runs over five days -- including five centuries and six half-centuries.
Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal said Bangladesh would be tough to beat at home on a spinning track, but they had experienced players to deal with the conditions.
"When you look at this pitch, definitely there will be a result. The pitch looks dry. Spinners will definitely come into play. It is challenging for both teams," he said.
"They are really good, especially (on) their home soil. They have performed well here. We never underestimate them, they are playing really good cricket.
"We have more experienced players in our Test side compared to the ODI side. It is still challenging to us but we have some game plans according to the conditions and their players. We need to execute that well."
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will also play two Twenty20 internationals after the Test series wraps up. - AFP

Better start  in life
SOS Childrens Village Piliyandala is a flourishing organization that offers love and kindness to the many little children that call the village `home. There are mothers who have put everything behind to ensure the well- being of these children. The children are raised and educated in an atmosphere of security and unconditional love.
The primary function of SOS Childrens Village is to look after children who have lost their parents. There is also the situation where some of the children in the village come from single parents and others are orphans.
Recently Honorary President of SOS Children's Villages International, Helmut Kutin was in the island having made a special trip with the supervisory board to experience the work done in Sri Lanka.
After 40 years, I wanted to make a special visit, with the supervisory board of the first SOS Childrens village association from Austria. They have come here for the first time to Sri Lanka and are most pleased with the exceptional work that is being done here, said Kutin.
Kutin hopes this visit will further strengthen the resolve of these visitors to continue to provide additional assistance for some of the projects of SOS Sri Lanka.
The year 1979 was declared as the international year of the child by the United Nations and Sri Lanka was one of the few countries in the world who established a separate secretariat for the international year of the child. The secretariat was run by Malsiri Dias. I came here and we found this piece of land in Piliyandala which was provided by the government. After many years I finally handed over the reins to the present President of SOS Childrens Villages International, Siddhartha Kaul. Sri Lanka was Kauls masterpiece and we share the same vision for SOS work, stated Kutin.
Establishing the SOS village in Piliyandala went smoothly, efficiently and swiftly. We had a good supervisory board which was efficiently run by Malsiri Dias. So SOS international along with her and the ministry of Social Services began the task of opening childrens villages in the country. The achievements of the SOS Childrens village in Piliyandala is outstanding. There is a fantastic group of mothers who are a wonderful group of Sri Lankan women. They have worked very hard and are extremely competent. They have made a great difference in the lives of these children, explained Kutin.
Their service is not only to Sri Lanka, but to the many Asian associations around the world. A number of people have been sent here including a Chinese delegation.
These mothers can take good care of the children, while providing leadership to the household. We had one Director called Cedric De Silva who along with Kaul and the architect Angalendran worked together. Angalendran did a brilliant job. He gave the place a homely atmosphere that felt safe, pointed out Kutin.
Kutin also said out that there is a great need to take care of the road children and their well-being.
After 40 years we hope the locals will come forward with their sponsorships and contributions. The main problem in Asia is even though people give, they do not do it regularly. We have a tremendous amount of work to accomplish. We need a committed group of people who will stand together with these children as long as they need it until they become self-sufficient, said Kutin.
Piliyandala is the biggest SOS village in Sri Lanka, and the school is run by the government but the buildings belong to SOS. The school takes care of around 1,000 children.
Our aim is to give them a better start in life. One of the Millennium Development Goals of the UN is education, and for these children a good knowledge of English is vital. This will help them achieve something in life, said Kutin.
The environment at the village is very close to that which you would get in a home in Sri Lanka. There are instances where the young ones find their own partners and marriage take place with the blessings of the elders in the SOS Family. At the SOS childrens village the family bond is so strong, that the youth keep on visiting their mothers.

Brigadier Priyanka Fernando reinstated
The Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lanka High Commission in London, Brigadier Priyanka Fernando, who was suspended, has been reinstated on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
However, an inquiry into the incident has been initiated. Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said the Army will cooperate with any investigation conducted by the Foreign Ministry. He said a decision cannot be taken to punish him immediately, based on a video clip alone. He said there was a tense situation at the time of the incident and as such, an inquiry has been initiated to determine what had transpired.
Brigadier Fernando had assumed duties as the Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lanka High Commission in London in May 2017.
Having a military career spanning 32 years, he had spent 2/3rd of his service on the field and had contributed significantly to the war. An officer of the Gemunu Watch, he has a good service record, according to the Army.
It is also reported that the President had instructed the Foreign Ministry Secretary to reinstate Brigadier Fernando and reprimanded him for having suspended him without a proper inquiry.
However, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maheshini Colonne told the Daily News, that she had not received any information regarding the reinstatement orders by the President.
British Parliamentarians Joan Ryan and Siobhain McDonagh had earlier called on the British Foreign Secretary to withdraw Brigadier Priyanka Fernandos diplomatic papers and expel him from the UK, after he was filmed making unacceptable gestures to those protesting outside the Sri Lankan High Commission in London, on February 4.
Ryan and McDonagh, the Vice Chair and Senior Vice Chair of the Tamil All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), also said in their letter to Boris Johnson MP that the conduct of Brigadier Fernando was inappropriate, unacceptable and threatening, being someone who is serving in an official capacity as a guest of the UK.

The Chinese connection
The Chinese are working towards making China a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful.
In addition to the Third Chinese Film Festival, held in Sri Lanka this February, the 2nd Chinese Cultural Fair will be held at Arcade from March 1  4. In around two weeks comes the Chinese New Year - Chinese New Year of dog.
The Chinese Film Festival is one of the major events to celebrate the Chinese New Year. The Chinese New Year, also called the Spring Festival, is one of the oldest festivals in China, which dates back 4000 years ago. It is the most important one for the Chinese people with the richest culture and tradition. It is a time of joy and family gathering.
J J Rathnasiri
The film Festival which was a resounding success once more showcased some of the finest Chinese movies created in China. The movies were splendid and well received by the audience. The eight films did not disappoint and really made an impression on the audience.
Eight highly acclaimed Chinese films featuring romance, action, fantasy, suspense and fairy tale was screened at the National Film Corporation, starring world famous Chinese Actors.
Chief Guest Secretary of Public Administration and Management, J J Rathnasiri pointed out that culture is an essential part of any country.
Language, history, Literature and economical activities are a part of this. China is one of the worlds oldest civilizations with thousands of years of years of history. When it comes to ancient civilizations there is the Mesopotamian civilization, the Indian Civilization and the Chinese Civilization. China has contributed to world culture by the creation of the Great Wall of China. Sri Lanka and China have enjoyed a good relationship dating back hundreds of years. We know the Fa-Hsien, the Chinese Buddhist monk came to Sri Lanka and lived here for several years.
After 1957, Sri Lanka and China, signed several agreements related to Economic, Health, Cultural and Education. There was also the signing of the historic Rubber Rice Pact, between Sri Lanka and China in 1952 bringing in a lot of advantages.
The Cultural relationship is one of the best facets of the relationship between Sri Lanka and China. The third Chinese Film Festival brings to Sri Lanka Chinese films that will help Sri Lankan people enjoy the many aspects of Chinese Culture and its film industry, said Rathnasiri.
Rathnasiri added that these events can help strengthen the relationship between China and Sri Lanka that began long years ago.
Today we can see the involvement of China in various spheres in Sri Lanka. We know that the BMICH was a gift from China in memory of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. The same goes for the Lotus Tower presently under construction. China is involved in that as well as many other activities, said Rathnasiri.
Economic and Commercial Counsellor Yang Zuoyuan in his address stated that with the great support of the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka, the Chinese Film Festival has been successfully organized in the past two years with attendance of over 2700.
We hope that the Happy Chinese New Year celebrations will bring joy and harmony to the Sri Lankan people, said Zuoyuan.
Zuoyuan explained, that recently the world has witnessed a fast development in the Chinese film industry.
In 2017, 970 films were produced in China. The box office revenue rose 13.45 percent on year-on-year basis to 55.91 billion RMB yuan, about 8.4 billion US dollars. 54 percent of which is generated from China-produced films. The total audience reached over 1.6 billion. The number of screens has increased 23.3 percent to 50,776. China has become the 2nd largest movie market in the world. The Embassy will continue to work with Sri Lankan to promote professional and technical exchange and cooperation in the film field between our two countries, explained Zuoyuan.
The year 2018 marks the first year following the successful conclusion of 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It marks Chinas entry into a new era. It mapped out a new blueprint for Chinas development in the coming decades. The Chinese people from all ethnic groups under the leadership of CPC are working hard to realize Two Centenary Goals.
One is to build a moderately prosperous society by 2020, and to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful by the middle of this century and to realise the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We believe that people all share the same dream for a better future of the world, said Zuoyuan.
China and Sri Lanka are good neighbors, good friends and good partners. 2000 years ago, our ancestors established friendly relations through ancient maritime Silk Road. Now it is time for us to jointly build the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to deepen mutual beneficial cooperation and realize common development.
The year 2018 also marks the 70th Anniversary of Independence of Sri Lanka. In the past seven decades, Sri Lanka has made tremendous progress in all fields. I am confident that Sri Lanka the pearl of the Indian Ocean will shine with even dazzling brilliance, Zuoyuan said.

Complaints galore
On December 6, a reader opened our eyes to unfair practices. What he meant was corruption.
Let us take case by case. Look at the government servants of important departments. They use luxury BMWs and posh Mercedes Benzs wallowed in a standard state salary. Isnt there anyone to question them at sight Why cannot the Bribery Commission take a run along Colombo Fort and Battaramulla to do the needful as ordinary folk will not dare question them on several grounds
The ordinary people are released by courts on bail. They will be held to the closing time - pay a santhosam or wait till next day to get released all manoeuvred by officials to get paid. When it comes to import, the importer will be fleeced all round by officials. The officials from top to bottom will share the collection and drive home in a limousine.
Where could we go with all these complaints

The civic rights conundrum
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has sought the co-operation of political party leaders representing parliament to support legislation to deprive MPs found guilty of serious crimes, of their civic rights. Opening the adjournment debate on the Presidential Commission report on the bond issue and 34 investigation reports of PRECIFAC pertaining to corruption under the Rajapaksa regime, the Premier asked whether political parties represented in parliament would support amending Section 81 of the Constitution to deprive a person found guilty of serious crime, their civic rights. Are the party leaders ready to amend Section 81of the Constitution, or are they scared of doing so, the Premier asked.
The PMs suggestion, however, was shot down, by both, the SLFP, and, the JVP. Speaking during the same adjournment debate, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said since late Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike was stripped of her civic rights, unfairly, they are against being a party to any more attempts to deprive anybodys civic rights. However, the SLFP was not opposed to subjecting MPs found guilty of wrong doing, being subjected to the judicial process.
Chief Opposition Whip, and, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said his party would not back moves to strip anyone of his, or, her civic rights, but would support the government introducing new laws to bar MPs found guilty of corruption entering parliament. We will support passing of such laws to ensure parliament is a place free of corrupt politicians, he stressed.
President Maithripala Sirisena too has opined that he is not amenable to any move to deprive the civic rights of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa although this would not mean the corrupt would be allowed to go free.
The issue of civic rights, of course, is a sore point with the SLFP. It is understandable from a SLFP point of view. The party was forced to endure a long period in hibernation after Mrs. B. lost her civic rights curtsy JRJ. Hence, it could be a knee jerk reaction by the party towards such a course of action, although Mahinda Rajapaksa is today in the opposition camp and has caused a split in the SLFP. Ironically, the party suffered a similar split, with one faction led by the Maithripala-Anura Group and the other by the Sirima-Chandrika-Vijaya trio, following the loss of civic rights of Mrs B. But this implosion was caused from within, when the SLFP was a single unit, while the recent breakaway occurred when then General Secretary left the party to take on MR at the presidential election. What we are seeing today is the fallout of this split, and, what is more, one half of the blues honeymooning with its arch political enemy.
It is however difficult to fathom why both, the SLFP, and, JVP are reluctant to support moves to deprive MPs arraigned for serious corruption, their civic rights, while at the same time not being averse to enacting laws to deny such MPs entering parliament and /or contesting for political office. This indeed is a contraction. Deprivation of civic rights involves both, the taking away of voting rights of an individual in addition to barring such individual from holding any political office. Are the SLFP and JVP saying that taking away the voting rights of an individual is unacceptable while blocking an errant MP from entering parliament, or, holding political office is game Does not this smack of hypocrisy They, (JVP and SLFP) might as well support the amendment proposed by the PM to deprive MPs charged for corruption their civic rights.
But wait a minute. Is it only parliament that has the powers to deprive rogue MPs of their civic rights Not so, going by a recent precedent. A Police Constable, the other day, was sentenced to ten years Rigorous Imprisonment AND deprived of his civic rights, for seven years, by the Colombo High Court after he was found guilty of accepting a bribe. Hence, it is apparent that the courts are empowered to impose civic disabilities on offenders and this includes parliamentarians, arraigned for bribery.
Hence, why not leave the matter for the courts to decide, instead of bringing in new laws in parliament Surely, the Police Constables act of bribery would pale into insignificance, given the enormity of the bribes politicians are known to accept.
Be that as it may, forgetting the little matter of civic rights, now that both SLFP and JVP are supportive of introducing laws to deny entry to parliament MPs found guilty of serious acts of corruption, the government should do just that. This will go a long away in cleansing the body politic, which is today rotten to the core. Our honourable peoples representatives should be made to understand in concrete terms that parliament cannot be made an avenue for enriching themselves. It will be interesting to see if this support will be forthcoming from the Joint Opposition, many of whose members are today being investigated for serious acts of corruption.

Country could emerge as excellent apparel and textile hub - JAAF
Apparel manufacturers must complement and cooperate, rather than competing with each other to achieve desired industry targets.
These views were expressed by Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association Senior Vice President Faruque Hassan yesterday speaking at the inauguration of International Conference on the Apparel industry, held under the theme Productivity Development, Disruptive innovation and Leadership.
The three- day event is being organized by Monash Business School, Monash University.
Asia is emerging as major apparel and clothing hub. I think we shouldnt compete with each other. But we need to complement and cooperate with each other. We are still living in the age of price cuts. But the respect has to be given to fair pricing.
Asia is emerging as a global textile and clothing hub; In 2000 Asias share of textile was 44.92%.
In 2014, global apparel exports were at US $ 483 billion; in 2015, it reduced to US $ 445 billion dollars, indicating a drop of 7.88%. In 2016, apparel industry once again recorded a negative growth globally.
Globally 60 million people are employed in the apparel industry including 15 million women workers, in factories located in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
Hassan also noted that whole value chain of the industry has to be looked at in terms of safely, well-being and dignity and also stressed the need to take measures to improve industrial relations, skills, goals, productivity and innovation. Bangladesh is the second largest apparel exporter in the world after china and accounts for 6.5% market share globally. Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Deputy Chairman Saifuddin Jafferjee speaking at the event said that Sri Lanka could emerge as an excellent apparel and textile hub given its strategic location and existing knowledge base.
Sri Lanka could be a hub where we could develop new models, new opportunities that we can grow in the future.
According to Jafferjee , the productivity improvement, disruptive innovation, effective leadership, sustainability and ethical production have become key concerns not only for manufactures and their major global customers but also for other stakeholders involved with apparel industry including government and etc..
Sri Lanka apparel industry has evolved to a world class manufacturer reaching; an export turnover of US $ 4.7 billion. During the last quarter, industry has registered a 10% growth rate.
During its evolution from a quota driven basic manufacturing era, the industry transitioned into sourcing management and thereafter advanced to supply chain management.
We see that globally manufacturing per say is now yielding the lowest value addition in the total supply chain; and therefore front end services such as innovation, product design and development, marketing, logistics and speed will be differentiators for the industry to focus on in the future.
Presently, Sri Lanka is aspiring to become a total solution provider from innovation to delivery.

Discovering the potential to heal

The Faculty of Medical Sciences (FMS) of University of Sri Jayewardenepura (USJP) will complete 25 years in March this year. To commemorate this important milestone and to auspiciously mark occupation of the newly constructed Phase IV building complex of the faculty an all night pirith ceremony was held on January 19 with the participation of the reverend clergy led by the then Chancellor of the university Late Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Nayakathero followed by an alms giving.
The establishment of a Faculty of Medical Sciences to conduct an undergraduate course for the MBBS and BSc course in Human Biology was approved in July 1992. Dr. H. H. R. Samarasinghe was appointed as the co-ordinator of the new Faculty.
The Faculty was opened on March 1, 1993 and 139 students were registered for the MBBS course. As the first Faculty of Medical Sciences in Sri Lanka we take a lead role in training an entire team of health professionals required for the country realizing the high national need.
Late Professor M.T.M. Jiffry, Professor of Physiology assumed office in January 1996 as the first Dean of the Faculty of Medical Sciences taking up his responsibility with much enthusiasm and motivation.
The initial building of the FMS began with stage I of the building programme on January 12, 1995 and progressed very rapidly. The building was situated on land acquired by the University for the Faculty of Medical Sciences, from Methsevana detention centre adjacent to the main University campus.
The prime objective of the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura established in 1993 as the sixth medical school out of the eight in Sri Lanka, is to turn out medical graduates and graduates of Allied Health Sciences who are equipped with necessary knowledge, skills, attitudes and mind set to provide health care services in any part of the country.
The Faculty offers five undergraduate courses namely Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), BSc Honours in Human Biology, BSc Honours in Nursing, BSc Honours in Medical Laboratory Sciences and Bachelor of Pharmacy Honours. Currently there are 1,287 undergraduates following different degree programmes in the Faculty of Medical Sciences. Each year approximately a batch of 160 students enters the faculty to follow the MBBS degree programme and 75 for the paramedical degree programmes. All these courses are conducted in English.
The Faculty has 17 academic departments and three paramedical units which are staffed by 43 Lecturers, 72 Senior Lecturers and 27 Professors in addition to an extended Faculty consisting of Consultants from the Ministry of Health and the clinical and para-clinical staff who are involved in patient-care activities.
Late Prof. Dayasiri Fernando who was the second Dean, Prof. Narada Warnasuriya and Prof. Jayanta Jayawardena gave the leadership necessary for the faculty to achieve present high standards.
The Stage 3 was completed in 2006 and the departments of Surgery, Paediatrics and the new air conditioned Examination Hall are located in it. The Resource Centre was completed in 2006 and the IT, Language and Clinical Skills laboratories are also housed in it.
The new Paramedical building to provide infrastructure facilities for the new three paramedical degree programmes was completed in 2008 during the Deanship of Prof. Jayanta Jayawardene.
In 2012, with Prof. Mohan De Silva as Dean and Dr. N.L.A. Karunaratne as the Vice-chancellor, the faculty acquired a further five acres of land from Methsevana detention centre to commence the Phase IV Development Project.
Cabinet approval was granted on October 18, 2012 for a total cost of Rs. 1,362,909,935/= (Rupees 1.36 billion) for the Phase IV development project.
A bid submitted with a unique design of a futuristic medical faculty which will serve as a land-mark design in the development of Sri Lankan medical faculties was approved by the Cabinet appointed procurement committee. It houses the administrative division and ten departments of the FMS; modern state of the art Family Practice Centre to serve the health care needs of more than 3,000 families in the vicinity of the university; examination hall with all facilities, a cafeteria with open area concept to enhance the welfare facilities for students and to serve staff and the visitors. The peripheral area will be landscaped with provision for vehicle parking to blend with the natural environment.
Foundation stone for the Phase IV building complex was laid down on March 12, 2014 by then Minister of Higher Education S. B. Dissanayake on invitation by Prof. Mohan De Silva who was the then Dean.
Under the leadership of Prof. Surangi Yasawardene who assumed duties as Dean in November 2014 and Prof. Sampath Ameratunga the Vice-chancellor the Phase IV Building complex project was successfully completed within the target date.
The students of the faculty undergo Clinical teaching at Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital and Homagama Base Hospital, the three teaching hospitals of the faculty. The National Cancer Institute, Maharagama, National Institute of Mental Health, Angoda and certain special units of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka are also used in the clinical training. The Consultants from the Ministry of Health working in these hospitals make the extended faculty under whom the students undergo their clinical training. Community Health training in the Community Health Unit is also mandatory.
The Faculty offers an extensive training programme in Family Medicine at a purpose built modern Family practice centre. The centre also serves the health care needs of more than 2,000 families in the vicinity of the University at a minimum cost.
All students are trained in research methodology in third and fourth years and have to submit a research dissertation at the end of fourth year. Some students with the support of supervisors present their research work at scientific fora nationally or internationally. The Faculty also offers MPhil and PhD degrees mostly in medical and allied health sciences.
Final year students of BSc (MLS) programme are managing two laboratories in Kalutara district under the supervision and discussions are held with Western Province Director of Health in order to strengthen the laboratory service of some selected hospitals of the Western Province with the assistance of our MLS students. 
Research collaborations have been established with key international research groups and laboratories such as University of Oxford, National University of Singapore, Faculty of Medicine University of Trondheim Norway, Gothenburg University and University of Uppsala, Sweden addressing national priorities and current global issues. Academic members and students of FMS, USJ have won many international and national research awards.
The Linnaeus - Palme Student and Teacher Exchange Programme between Kristianstad University, Sweden and FMS, USJ has been functioning for the past five years. The teachers from the School of Health and Society, Nursing Programme, Kristinstad University participate in teaching-learning activities in the BSc Nursing Programme and meet the students who are enrolled in Master of Integrative Health Sciences offered (on-line) through the above collaboration.
The foreign exchange students elective programme attract many foreign students for training in the faculty as undergraduates and post graduates to learn about diseases and services available in a middle income and tropical country. The faculty has provided opportunities to many students, and receives a high demand each year requesting training positions by these overseas students.
The faculty has progressed rapidly to achieve a position to become one of the most sought after medical faculties in the country. In line with the strategic intent to be the best medical faculty in Sri Lanka and to be rated as one of the best in South East Asia, the faculty is pursuing an ambitious programme to develop its infrastructure and research facilities to be on par with the best universities in the Asian sub-continent.
In order to achieve the potential for excellence, a pragmatic approach is needed with careful planning. The students must be trained to provide quality care to patients and to conduct research focusing on health priorities in the country.

Final race for power
With only two days to go for the local government elections, campaigning has come to an end and major political parties will be bracing themselves for the peoples verdict. It is in an electoral outcome that will have far ranging political repercussions and one that will determine the immediate political future of the nation.
Striving for supremacy in a three cornered tussle are the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). Also hoping to make gains are the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the latter being assured of victory mostly in the North and East of the country.
President Maithripala Sirisena has been spearheading the campaign for the SLFP. Despite his many onerous duties as Head of State, President Sirisena has taken time off his schedule to address as many campaign rallies as possible.
Fight against corruption
In doing so, his theme has been that he is fighting against corruption in government from all quarters. As evidence, he has pointed to the findings of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank bond sale and to the reports of the Presidential Commission inquiring into corruption and abuse of power.
It must be noted that the former finds fault with appointees of this government while the latter relates mostly to activities of the previous government headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. President Sirisena has been stressing that his is a fight against corruption in government regardless of the political persuasions of the alleged offenders.
There was some activity in this regard over the weekend with the arrest and detention of Arjuna Aloysius and Kasun Palisena, both of Perpetual Treasuries Limited, the company at the centre of the Central Bank bond sale investigation. Aloysius is the son-in-law of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, a Singaporean national who is currently believed to be in his home country.
The news of the arrest of Aloysius and Palisena filtered in as the President and the Cabinet gathered for Independence Day celebrations at Galle Face last Sunday. They have now been produced before courts and remanded. It is likely that charges will be laid against them by Police who are conducting further investigations.
That President Sirisena chose to engage in a strenuous campaign for what is essentially an election to local government bodies is because he feels this is an opportunity to reform and gain full control of the SLFP. As it is now, the party is deeply divided with the rank and file split in their loyalties between President Sirisena and his predecessor, former President Rajapaksa.
Even the parliamentary group elected under the banner of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at the August 2015 general election is split into two groups: at last count, 51 parliamentarians remained loyal to Rajapaksa while 45 continue to extend their support to President Sirisena.
The Presidents thinking is that if the SLPP can be defeated comprehensively at the poll, it would sound the death knell for the party which is anyway a fledgling political organisation. To be fair by President Sirisena, if he been critical of his coalition partner- the UNP- while on the campaign trail, his criticism of the Rajapaksa regime and the SLPP has been even more strident.
From a UNP perspective, it will have only itself to blame if it does not emerge victorious at the election. If that was to eventuate, it would undoubtedly be because of the damage caused by the Central Bank bond sale issue unravelling at the time of the poll.
The party went in to damage control mode last week, releasing a statement regarding the recommendations of the committee headed by Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana which studied the findings of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank bond issue.
The Marapana committee recommended that Ravi Karunanayake step down as Assistant Leader of the party until investigations into the issue are concluded. To date, Karunanayake has not heeded the partys call and has protested his innocence. Even if he did step down now, many believe that would only limit the damage to the prospects of the UNP. Unfortunately, Karunanayakes stubborn resistance will not help the UNP on Saturday.
Officially, the partys stance has been that it agrees with the concept that wrongdoers should be punished, noting that Karunanayake has not yet been found guilty. In the election campaign, it has also been expanding on the various concessions it granted to the electorate soon after assuming office. Restoration of democracy- as opposed to the repressive tendencies of the previous government- has also been cited by the UNP as being among their achievements.
The party for which this poll is truly a make or break election is the SLPP. It is no secret that the SLPP was formed with the sole intention of carrying forward the Rajapaksa legacy. Without the Rajapaksas as their icon, the party would not command much of a following.
It must be noted that even while the SLPP campaigns vigorously on slogans that lambast President Sirisena much more than they attack the UNP, key figures in the SLPP including former President Rajapaksa himself, remain members of the SLFP! That is because the objective of the Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP is to eventually wrest control of the SLFP leadership- rather than to progress the SLPP to become a fully-fledged political party.
This is why the local government polls are absolutely critical for the SLPP. If the party does not make much headway at the election, the campaign to re-establish the Rajapaksas as leaders of the SLFP will be stillborn. Furthermore, it will be difficult to then prevent parliamentarians currently in the Rajapaksa camp from gravitating towards President Sirisena.
Local Government institutions
In the event the SLPP is successful in making some electoral gains, it still has to contend with President Sirisena whose position as leader of the SLFP is unassailable until he relinquishes office. The earliest this can occur is in January 2020. Therefore, a defeat for the SLPP will lead to its disintegration. However, even if it secures a significant number of Local Government institutions, it still has more work to do to gain parity with the UNP and the SLFP at the next national elections.
What has escaped attention in assessing the relative merits of political parties at this election is the new electoral system that will be put to the test. This is a combination of the proportional representation (PR) system and the Westminster style first past the post system. This is being implemented for the first time in the country and will be watched with great interest. Whereas the first past the post system resulted in landslide majorities for one political party, the PR system often meant that no party got even a simple majority, resulting in parties having to coalitions to stay in office. The new system will add a different dimension, enabling the most popular party to get a working majority without much difficulty.
For instance, if indeed the SLFP vote base splits down the middle between the mainstream SLFP and the SLPP, that would enable the UNP to secure victory in individual wards, giving it an advantage in the final tally of seats in each local council. While that is the thinking in UNP circles, this would however depend on the extent to which the SLFP vote base is divided and to what extent the UNP is able to retain its core vote.
Due to the multitude of factors affecting voter sentiment- and the new electoral system in operation for the first time- it would be foolhardy to make predictions regarding the outcome of Saturdays elections.
There is however likely to be wide regional variations in the result- with the possibility that more than one party will claim overall victory on Sunday morning after all the votes are counted.

Fitch affirms Sri Lanka at B+; Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at B+ with a stable outlook.
The affirmation of Sri Lankas sovereign ratings reflects several factors.
Sri Lankas revised policy framework supports macroeconomic stability. In Fitchs view, policies aimed at fiscal consolidation and maintenance of a disciplined monetary stance under the framework of the three-year IMF-supported programme have improved Sri Lankas policy coherence and credibility.
Although GDP growth of an estimated 3.9% in 2017 fell short of forecasts due to weather-related supply disruptions, we expect growth to recover and stabilise at around 5% in 2018 and 2019.
The shift towards greater exchange-rate flexibility since 2H15 has strengthened the external position, and the planned shift towards flexible inflation targeting should further enhance monetary policy credibility. Credit growth has declined to a more sustainable level of around 15% in 2017 from a high of 20% in 2016.
Fiscal performance has improved following the approval and implementation of tax reforms. Fitch expects Sri Lankas ratio of general government revenue to GDP to improve to 15.5% in 2018 and 16.2% by 2019, from a low of 11.6% in 2014, reflecting the passage of revenue-enhancing measures under the IMF programme.
These include an increase in the VAT rate to 15% in 2016 from 11%, and implementation of a new Inland Revenue Act from 1 April 2018 that aims to simplify tax laws, reduce exemptions and improve the efficiency of the tax system.
We think the increase in general government revenues will support a further narrowing of the budget deficit to 4.8% of GDP in 2018 and 4% in 2019 from an estimated 5.2% in 2017. While these revenue reforms should be positive for a more credible fiscal framework over time, ineffective implementation and/or weaker-than-expected GDP growth remain downside risks to our fiscal projections, Fitch said in the report.
Sri Lankas interest payments as a share of revenues remain exceptionally high at an estimated 38% at end-2017, far above the medians of 9.4% for B and 9.6% for BB rated sovereigns. The expected pick-up in general government revenues should lead to lower ratios over time, but we expect this ratio to remain above the B and BB medians for the foreseeable future. Further, despite the expected improvement in gross general government debt (GGGD) dynamics, GGGD will likely remain above the B median over 2018-2019.
GGGD is forecast to decline to 77.2% of GDP in 2018 and 75.8% in 2019, from an estimated 79.5% at end-2017 under our baseline assumptions, mainly on account of sustained primary surpluses and stable GDP growth rates.
However, even after the forecast reduction, government debt would still remain above the B and BB medians at end-2019.
Further, nearly half of Sri Lanka's government debt is denominated in foreign currency, which increases the risk to debt dynamics in the event of a further depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee.
Sri Lanka's external balance sheet remains a weakness for the rating, with high net external debt, weak sovereign net foreign assets and a low international liquidity ratio compared with rating peers. Foreign-exchange reserves rose to around USD8 billion at end-2017, representing 3.3 months of current external payments (CXP), from USD6.0 billion (2.7 months) at end-2016, but reserves remain below the rating category median of 3.9 months.
Sri Lanka's external debt service outlook remains challenging over 2019-2022. The sovereign's external debt service payments over this period are around USD15 billion against current reserve levels of about USD7.7 billion. The authorities expect to pass a liability management bill in 2018, which would allow them to smooth debt payments by potentially extending maturities over this period. However, the scale of external refinancing over the next few years creates a potential vulnerability for the sovereign, particularly against a backdrop of expected monetary tightening in developed markets. However, Sri Lanka's track record of accessing international capital markets remains a mitigating factor.

Govt to attract US$ 2.5 bn FDI this year
The government plans to attract US$ 2.5 billion FDI in 2018 through foreign investment projects.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama disclosed these facts addressing the gathering during the agreement signing ceremony between the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic on mutual cooperation held in Colombo yesterday.
The program will especially bring in new investors in sectors such as export-oriented manufacturing and services which will generate much needed employment opportunities in the country as well, he added.
He further said that forex earnings will be increased by investing heavily on sectors like IT, wellness tourism, processed food and component manufacturing as recommended by the national export strategy. The agreement will consist of areas including enhance bilateral trade and economic relations, facilitate growth of bilateral investment and identify economic and investment opportunities in both countries. It has also aimed at promoting closer trade and industrial cooperation and facilitates networking activities between entrepreneurial entities of both countries.
Minister Samarawickrama further said that there is a growth in exports from Sri Lanka to Czech Republic since the last decade. It amount to around US$ 55 million with a positive trade balance in 2017.
Our exports to Czech Republic have been mainly confined in the sectors of rubber and rubber based products, tea, coconut and coconut based products and apparel.
Since Czech Republic is a fast growing economy in the European Union, its potentials to become an important destination for our exports and the prospective benefits through an effective cooperation on investment towards our industrial development were especially taken into consideration before signing the agreement.
To strengthen the cooperation in the economic sphere for mutual benefit, we welcome the signing of the agreement on mutual cooperation which would provide a platform to embark on an effective dialogue which leads to formulate and implement a sound framework of economic engagement through establishment of a joint committee to promote bilateral trade, investment and economic relations. In formulating the actions framework under this agreement, special emphasis is to be given to encourage investment cooperation in economic sectors through non-traditional financial instruments.
The Minister further said Sri Lanka has potentials to widen the exports of value added tea to Czech Republic. Since the Czech Republic has a developed automobile industry, Sri Lanka can explore the market opportunity in Czech Republic for the rubber finished products like tyres and other automobile parts. Sri Lanka also has a potential to export to Czech Republic in the other sectors like electronic and electrical, chemical products processed foods and seafood.

Grandson of English cricket icon Denis Compton plays in our Premier League
To carry on the legacy of a grandfather who was an icon of English cricket is not easy. Thats what Nick Compton found out for himself when he first arrived at Lords, the home of Middlesex county which Denis Compton represented right throughout his brilliant career from 1936-64 scoring 136 first-class centuries, 17 of which were for England from 78 Tests.
When I grew up in South Africa I was born in Durban to an English family I was a young sports mad kid. At that age Ive no idea the status of my grandfather but when I first came to England at 12 I stayed with him and it was at Lords, Middlesex that I saw my dreams starting to cultivate, Nick Compton told the DAILY NEWS.
I got to know my grandfather very well before he passed away. I understood the more time I spent at Lords how good he was. No doubt there was pressure but fundamentally he just cultivated those dreams like a (Brian) Lara or a (Sachin) Tendulkar. I wanted to emulate him, the desire and ambitions the genes and family background I had it inside me.
But I found it difficult being at Lords - all the time the expectations were a lot higher. Going to Somerset where I spent five years was a chance to be my own person, develop my own style in a team of stroke players. I dealt with it pretty well I think and I am hugely proud that I had a famous grandfather who had such a great reputation. I liked to carry that legacy on and Ive done my best played in 16 Test matches scored two hundreds and played almost 200 first-class matches. If you offer that to me as a 12-year-old boy walking around Middlesex I would have taken that.
It is ironic that Nicks international career with England ended two years ago against Sri Lanka and at Lords where he made 1 and 19. He was never selected to play for his country after that poor series where he averaged 12.75 with a highest score of 22.
The last year and half for me in England hasnt been easy. Ive got to a point where following my last Test match which was actually against Sri Lanka my game hasnt been in a great place, said Nick. I had two major surgeries to my shoulder and neck. It can happen to any sportsman I wasnt enjoying my batting fundamentally. Its so important to enjoy what you do every day. I was training and practicing but I just couldnt find any rhythm I thought I was being inconsistent.
Fundamentally what has always driven me is the ambition to play international cricket, the hunger and drive to score runs and to be consistent. In the last 1 years I havent been. I played this game 17-18 years professionally. Losing my Test place was a big disappointment I realised that I wasnt even playing to half of my ability, but thats Test cricket. You cant call for your chance, sometimes you are playing when you are not playing well. The great thing about this game is you have to perform when it matters. You have to somehow find a way, he said.
Nicks best memories of a short Test career are scoring a match-winning 85 against the likes of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel coming to bat at 12 for two against South Africa at Durban, the venue where he grew up and being a member of the England side that won the Test series in India where Sachin Tendulkar told him that his partnership with Alastair Cook was one of the main reasons why England won the series. That was a really a big thing for me. I averaged 35 and for a debut series in India it wasnt too bad.
LEARNING TO EAT LUNCH WITH MY HAND
Nick is currently in Sri Lanka playing for Sri Lanka Ports Authority CC in the ongoing Premier league tournament and apart from trying to recapture his lost form he is also helping the club to find its proper identity as a professional unit.
Coming to Sri Lanka for me was an opportunity to get away a little bit. We also know that the English winter is not a great place to be training and play. I spent many years in India, I love my photography and I love travelling. I met some great Sri Lankan people over the years and Id always wanted to come to Sri Lanka as part of an experience, said Nick.
I met a friend of mine Maduranga de Soysa who played a bit of first-class cricket over the last few years in England and he suggested coming over here. He spoke to Omesh (Wijesiriwardene) and between Omesh and me they made it happen. I like to thank Omesh for getting me here and giving me the opportunity to help some younger players. Your career goes through a lot of stages. In your twenties you are ambitious and focussed, its all about playing for England and getting runs, but now I am looking at the game a little bit differently. I really like to see young players who really have the desire to excel to come to a country like this and learn the different styles of cricket, he said.
Omesh who was responsible for getting Nick down to Sri Lanka said, I played 12 seasons in the English league with Dartford thats where I met Nick and developed a friendship. He was keen to come to Sri Lanka and as coach of the Ports Authority team I arranged for him to play for us this season. Nick coming here is a great thing because the youngsters are benefitting a lot from his experience. We hope to end up at least in third place in the tournament. We could have performed better if Nick had not fallen ill soon after arriving in Sri Lanka. He started off with a half century and then fell ill and at one time he wanted to return home. However I managed to convince him to stay and now he has recovered and has got accustomed to the conditions here and enjoying himself. We have plans for him for the future because there is a lot to learn from him. I hope he will return to us next year as well.
Within a short space of time Nick has fitted in well with the Ports Authority team and its players.
The players have been brilliant I cannot speak highly enough for them even for the opposition teams. The conversations Ive had I am learning some of the languages, eating lunch with my hands Ive leant the technique. My dad played for a black team in South Africa when he grew up he was a big fan of apartheid. I always had the underdog inside me and to come to a country where there is a different culture for me its about embracing it, understanding their ways and not trying to impose my British ways but actually learning from them, said Nick.
I fitted in quite well and some of the words Ive learnt sound quite funny. What I really enjoyed is I like the passion. A lot of international cricket now has become a bit stale due to lack of personality in the game. What I enjoyed about here is the people are vocal at times they can be hard on each other on the field but I like that. I like when people express themselves. Some of them have played club cricket in England and they understand me. When I first arrived there was a little bit of apprehension whats this English guy doing here
I am trying to bring in a little bit more discipline, a little bit more structure. Theres no doubt theres a huge amount of talent here but from a Sri Lankan perspective I can see some frustrations maybe because Sri Lanka arent performing at the level they could. I feel that too. I am really bringing in some structure, some discipline and professionalism to this game. If you add that to the disciplines here, to the structure, I have no doubt that there are the cricketers and the talent to flourish, Nick observed.
Having experienced the Sri Lanka first-class club system for over a month and represented Ports Authority in their matches played so far Nick expressed surprise that a bowler like left-arm orthodox spinner Chanaka Komasaru has been overlooked for national selection.
What I see in the team is a fantastic group of players. There is a guy called Komasaru in our team how he is not playing in the Test team I dont understand. Ive faced all the best spinners in Sri Lanka and no one is as half as good as him. You can speak to the umpires, coaches or to anyone and no one knows why he is not playing. He takes five wickets in every game he is 34 years old, prime age for Test cricket. He is fit and bowls 30 overs a game. Its not for me to make selections but we have to open our minds, Nick said.
INSPIRED BY LANKA WINNING WORLD CUP
Nick believes that he was driven to playing international cricket after watching Sri Lanka win the 1996 World Cup. I remember so many great images of the 1996 World Cup where some of my heroes Aravinda de Silva, (Sanath) Jayasuriya and the way that (Arjuna) Ranatunga really galvanised that Sri Lankan team and stood up to the Australians and winning the World Cup was a very strong image for me growing up and wanting to continue my dreams of playing international cricket.
Nick firmly believes that Sri Lanka Cricket should make use of cricketing legends like Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene to inspire the youngsters.
When you look at the examples of Sangakkara and Jayawardene these guys are disciplined individuals. I was fortunate to play against Sanga this year, what an individual Educated man, his practice, his work ethics, his understanding of the game this is the type of people that needs to be interacting with your players all the time. Cricket boards have to get past senior players with this experience working with the young players all the time and making them realise that this is the level it requires, Nick said.
Making a comeback to the England side is furthermost in Nicks mind. In terms of England from my point of view Ive always been very driven in terms of getting re-selected its something that Ive put out of my mind now. Maybe I got slightly intense about it I wanted it too badly. What Ive learnt now is the most important thing for me is to enjoy my cricket by helping others, feeling I am having a good impact on a good young side. That for me will hopefully start build momentum. I feel like I am an experienced guy.
Theres no doubt I still have the attributes to play but looking at that I am trying to put it out of my mind. If it happens its great its a bonus but right now by putting my mind into helping some younger players, seeing a great country maybe my good form could come back, Nick said optimistically.

## Title: A GREAT LOSS TO PEACE AND RECONCILIATION
## Supertitle: Ven Bellanwila Wimalaratana Nayake Thera's demise:
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, February 8, 2018 - 01:00
Ven Bellanwila Wimalaratana Nayake Thera's demise:
A GREAT LOSS TO PEACE AND RECONCILIATION
One of the most prominent saffron-clad Sri Lankan emissaries, Most Ven Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Nayake Thera who brightened the seat of monkhood, socio-religious harmony and reconciliation in our times, having championed the crusade against stinking politics and its hegemonic impact on us, is no more.
His sudden demise at a time his critical guidance is most needed to rid our body politics of its pollutants came as a scathing blow to all moderate and right-thinking segments of our society on the eve of our 70th Independence day, particularly after the passing-away of his university pal, Most Ven Maduluwawe Sobhitha Nayake Thera who had left an indelible mark among all of us. Memories of Ven Wimalaratana Thera, no doubt would linger on in for the rest of our lives in Bellanwila, because he was not only affiliated with Sangha fraternity alone, but also with the laity (Dayaka) who venerated him as an outspoken monk in our country. In one sense, he remained a strong supporter for our social justice and reforms, and in others, he was an author of many books, a role model for his Kotte Sangha Sabha members, an erudite scholar at academic levels, a straight forward voice for the voiceless, and not the least, as the most distinguished monk in the province.
Bornin Bellanwila, just 76 years ago on a noteworthy day (April 14), he belonged to a well-known family lineage of Omaththage in the area in a family of several brothers. It was the then incumbent, Most Ven Bellanwila Sri Somaratana Nayake Thera, highly respected as the pioneer of contemporary revival of the ancient Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya who ordained the present Viharadhipathi, Most Ven Bellanwila Dhammaratana Nayake Thera and also our protagonist in focus, late Ven Wimalaratana Thera as Ven Somaratana's novice monks (samanera) who followed basic Dhamma education in the Vidyalankara Pirivena and also afterwards university studies.
Socialist politics
A fact that remained very distinct in his varsity days of learning was his close association with the then socialist-leftist doctrine of the Philip Gunewardene's era, et al. He also, it is said, was instrumental in organising student protests inside the campus against different issues as young revolutionary monks of the times, an experience that would have perhaps carried him forward into his subsequent firebrand types of protests as he matured later on to be a full-pledged scholar and a social reformer.
Upon the demise of his Guru, Ven Somaratana Thera in 1984, he was compelled to take reins as the Viharadhikari in this huge place of worship since Ven Dhammaratana Thera, his own elder brother, had by then migrated to Singapore on missionary work. Bellanwila temple was his forte afterwards. After receipt of his Doctorate (PhD) from the University of Lancaster in UK and his return, he was invited to the University of Sri Jayawardenapura for academic teaching. There, he rose to be the Dean of the Faculty of Buddhist and Pali Studies until his subsequent pre-retirement due to ever-increasing workload in the temple. He might be one of the most rare personages who had gradually reached the apex of office as the Chancellor in the very university where he served as a lecturer.
Late Wimalaratana Thera as a scholar took to writing at first to university journals, magazines, newspapers, etc before he penned his own books of academic research and value. Buddhism & other Religions, Evolution of Making Buddha Statues, Viharalipi Saraniya, Paramitha Sarana, are among some of the most popular ones he authored.
His Sinhala translation of the Unshaken Mind (Noselena Manasa) was serialized in national newspapers and it grabbed the attention of many an intellectual and readers. There is nothing amusing, like writing or authoring a book for me since it is my simple hobby. It is actually what I enjoy most as I grow older and older, he once plainly quipped to this writer during an interactive meet at the temple many moons ago. He was so close to our hearts and just a few days before his untimely death, he was found giving final touches to his latest research book on a new theme.
Vibrant social reformer
The tripartite combination of Ven Iththepane Dhammalankara Nayake Thera, Ven Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera and Ven Wimalaratana Thera did not take long to emerge as dedicated guardians of the common-folk as the political scenario after 1995s began to take shape, apparently shifting towards a policy of appeasing separatists who were fighting for division of the country. The trio stood their ground firm, unmoved and opposed vehemently to those moves as it would be disastrous to the country, if any division were to take place as planned by some political authorities of the times.
All appeals fell on deaf ears and finally street protests led by the trio, began to swell and rotated round the Parliament roundabout near Diyawannawa, flanked by thousands of protesting monks and patriotic civilians. Their leadership compelled the then government to shelve that plan of action and changed their discourse. Needless to highlight, Ven Wimalaratana Thera who had the gift of the gab and the ability to convey the repercussions of any such ill-conceived political move won the day. For him, any assembly of pre-determined decision-makers was only a public platform where diverse opinions were aired. Hence, late Thera was always invited to speak out his voice, may it be a meeting of monks, politicians or otherwise since he has had the distinguished quality of addressing the concerns of the full picture of the issue in hand. He was admired and respected for such forthrightness and honesty. Ven Thera received much respect for this attitude from all quarters of non-Buddhist dignitaries as well.
Fearless Ven Wimalaratana Thera never stood for communal politics or got onto any such stage during his illustrious life, full of spirits. Nor did he play hosannas to anyone how much mighty he would be since he did not expect any personal favours from any person in question.
Stance on religious amity
Another outstanding feature in him was his very close association with religious chiefs of all denominations through the Congress of Religions which he co-chaired until his demise. He fully believed in reconciliation, co-existence and ethnic harmony and always distanced himself from passions of communal hatred and extreme ideologies, harboured by some of his own community, Maha Sangha and others. Though he at times was subjected to criticisms, he stuck to his guns and challenged his dissidents to prove otherwise, if possible. The presence of Rev Oswald Gomis, Bishop, Rev Kenneth Fernando, Kurukkal and Moulavis in the temple premises soon after the news of his unfortunate death took to wings, proved this touch amply. That was a fitting tribute to his celebrated name, Ven Wimalaratana Thera unbowed in the presence of any mighty person but was a friend of all strata of society.
He always disassociated himself with those extremists, whether they were politically backed or otherwise. He asserted that unless people of all ethnicities would work together, we would never be able to take this country forward. With his death, there falls a huge vacuum among us to find any future replacement as such.
Social service projects
Perhaps only a limited number of Sri Lankans are aware that the Bellanwila Raja MahaVihara has been at the forefront of launching many a diverse welfare projects. A symbolic charge of Rs 20 from each vehicle parking in the yard there, has so far rescued the lives of many patients by dishing out more than Rs 100 lakhs in the past two years. More than a hundred such appeals still reach the temple in search of financial help for medicine or surgery, a unique humanitarian project of exemplary nature. So, is the Community Development Centre at Bellanwila, managed by the temple in order to provide vocational training to school dropouts.
It was one of such pioneering institutes in the country even before state patronage for this sphere came into this effect. Our late Ven Wimalaratana Thera had a great network of philanthropists and well-wishers who would always stand by him either during such projects or the organising of the Perahera or any other event in the temple.
It is also pertinent to mention here that Ven Dhammaratana Nayake Thera in his capacity as the religious advisor at the Buddhist Library in Singapore always assisted Ven Wimalaratana Thera by way of providing much-needed raw materials to such projects. Likewise, the conduct of Sunday school, Elders daycare centre, Pilgrims rest, welfare shops, etc are all patronized by our late Thera, despite heavy expenditure being incurred. Another feature that impressed us was his ability to maintain undisturbed administration of such projects in a relaxed mood, although at times he was critical.
Only a few perhaps know that he was a cricket fan and never wanted to miss a match, either here or abroad. He also possessed a deep knowledge about reputed cricketers and interacted with them whenever time permitted. His passion for music and aestheticism was no less and saw no bounds. He always wanted to assist musicians in whatever the way possible. One of the most felicitation ceremonies he attended was that of Mrs Sujatha Attanayake at Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, about which he later expressed his opinion with this writer in person at the temple. He was so attached to artistes and film producers that he offered all possible assistance to everyone who came to our protagonist.
Bellanwila and Temple
Had late Somaratana Thera been considered the pioneer of the modern revival, it was none other than late Wimalaratana Thera who carried the name of Bellanwila to international fame, and left a niche for itself in overseas chronicles. He widely travelled and won a recognition for himself as a preacher or an intellectual of Buddhist knowledge. At times, he enjoyed very much cracking jokes with whom he feels desirable to do so. And he was the tower of strength behind the annual Esala Perahera spectacle after the demise of Most Ven Sri Somaratana Thera.
He used to spend a fortnight of sleepless nights during the Perahera season, but ensured everything worked well until the Diyakapana ceremony got underway. He was so close to this writer in many fronts, although our Thera seldom had enough free time to relax. His affinity with us in the village was a strong catalyst and he made the day so interesting whenever we all travel outside Colombo once a year to attend the commemorative alms-giving of our Nayake Thera. But in this year, it would be a devastating blow when all of us had to commemorate Him too at any given place, transferring merits. May his cycle of Sansara be short and let him be reborn among us during this procession of Paramithas. May you attain supreme bliss of Nirvana!

Handy hacks to get silkier skin
Cleanse. Tone. Moisturize. That is the basic skincare mantra. Every skin type has its own set of issues and chronic dryness is one of the top reasons for skin aging. You know your skin better than anybody does so take a cue from these dry skin guides in your journey to a dewier, and softer complexion,

Soap or body wash for dry skin 
Look for milder, fragrance-free soaps for dry skin. It is not the same as unscented soap which may still include perfumes. Experts say that for many people with dry skin, the best choice is a mild skin cleanser rather than soap.
Whatever you do, dont use any harsh implements to wash yourself. Flannels, abrasive sponges or brushes can strip away that thin layer of natural oils that keep our skin moist and healthy. Using aqueous cream as soap is often recommended too. 


Hereditary or a health issue 
Dry skin is often hereditary, like the in the case of acne. If either of your parents struggle with dry skin, you are more likely to deal with the same issue. While you cannot control your genetics, there are daily habits that could be contributing to your dry skin. Learning which behaviours dry out the skin and circumventing these habits can help clear up dry, irritated patches.


Identifying a good moisturizer 
Experts recommend that people with dry skin get mild moisturisers that contain no perfumes or alcohols. Often a simple budget moisturiser can do a good job. The moisturiser must also be thick and greasy to seal in the moisture needed for good, dry skin care.
One simple moisturiser test is to put some of your lotion in the palm of your hand and flip your hand over. If it runs or drips, its not thick enough for dry skin.
Say No to harsh ingredients 
Cross out any product that contains toxic ingredients, fragrances, artificial dyes, and drying alcohols. All of which can potentially irritate any skin type but, since you have dry skin, which means you have broken skin, more of these ingredients penetrate your skin and run a higher risk for irritation.


Two moisturizers at any given time 
Get one moisturizer for daytime which should contain broad spectrum UV protection with SPF 30. Your evening moisturizer has to have more regenerating components and heavier emollients in it. In both cases, antioxidants and skin rebuilding ingredients are a must-have.


Retaining its natural moisture 
Once you begin to take care of your skin properly, the flakiness and itchiness of dry skin should improve within one or two weeks. In many cases, a good moisturizer will begin to make your skin look softer and suppler within minutes.
If you have a simple case of dry skin, begin by trying the suggestions in preventing it. If your dry skin persists, contact your doctors office for advice.


Natural home remedies for dry skin 
*Apply an emollient cream two or three times daily to wet skin.
* Dry skin may be improved by taking lukewarm showers or baths and avoiding excess skin scrubbing. Hot water and harsh scrubbing can take away the natural oils that protect skin and make the skin even drier.
*Olive oil contains many antioxidants and healthy fatty acids that are good for your skin. It can soothe and condition dry skin all over your body.
* Honey is considered one of the best natural moisturizers loaded with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and humectant properties. Thus, it helps lock in moisture to make your skin extra soft and smooth. Plus, honey has many essential vitamins and minerals that help improve your skins health. - Compiled by Ruwini Jayawardana

Hasitha Boyagoda to be awarded Ryde Gold Medal
Sri Lanka Under-19 opener Hasitha Boyagoda, who made the highest score in Under 19 ODIs while batting in the match against Kenya in the Under 19 World Cup in New Zealand will be awarded the highest award at Trinity College the Ryde Gold Medal which is awarded each year to the "best all-round boy.
The Ryde Gold medal is the highest honour that the school can bestow. It is awarded on the result of a secret ballot conducted among the senior boys and the staff whose votes, together with that of the Principal, each count as one. Boyagoda has been named for this award and will receive it at the annual prize giving on Monday.
The Ryde Gold Medal was first presented in 1908 to John Andrew, but he was not the first boy in the history of the school to be adjudged the best all-rounder.

Heart for humanity
Youth are the change agents of a society. They are tomorrows leaders, parents, professionals, workers and todays assets. They are often dubbed the backbone of a country. They bring new ideas and energy to add to the pool of knowledge that exists. They can bring enthusiasm and vitality which can lead to new discoveries and developments that can benefit society or even the world at large.
Although not the only drivers of social change, young people are considered as one of the key drivers who bring about change. Sachinda Dulanjana had touched the lives of many and made an impact on social change. The youth is the founder of the H3 Foundation  Hearts and Hands of Humanity; a youth led voluntary organisation which promotes volunteerism. Incepted in 2012 with the vision of setting a convenient platform for young people to get engaged as volunteers according to their own capacity and time availability, the H3 Foundation mostly focuses on people with special needs.
I believe that young people have to play a crucial role in terms of any social cause. Young people should lead the path as pioneers with the energy and passion they have to make this world a better place. Involving young people in social service activities will also give them a different view of life where they could cope and tolerate even the hardest situations in their lives, Sachinda said.
With his parents at the V Awards Grand Finale 2013
He realized why giving back matters when he was in grade six at Ananda College, Colombo. He had gotten the opportunity to take part in the 10th Colombo Ananda College Scout Troop as a junior scout.
This made a great impact in my life while allowing myself to get engaged in a number of social service activities with different types of communities. I became a President Scout at the end of my scouting career which spanned around seven years. This gave me an immense exposure to the field of social work with hands on experience. The mental health restoration program for Tsunami victims in 2004 organised by Ananda College Scout Troop is one the most unforgettable and life changing experiences I have ever had as a junior scout. I took part in school rehabilitation programs, leadership training programs etc through the Prefects Guild of Ananda College. Bridge of Hearts 2010 School Rehabilitation Project in Kilinochchi was one of the projects by the Prefects Guild which I organised. Over 300 children who were in an IDP camp were able to commence their studies in their own school premises after the final stage of the devastating terrorist era, he explained.

Sachinda says that self satisfaction and an immense feeling of accomplishment drives him into giving more of himself to brighten others lives.
In a world where most people just exist rather than live their lives, I prefer to live mine by doing what I always like to do. You may not get any monetary gains for making someone elses life beautiful but I believe there is something worthwhile in it which you cannot buy with riches, he mused.
Sachinda has a number of accolades to his name. He is the Speaker of the fourth Sri Lanka Youth Parliament. He has represented Sri Lankan youth at the 71st United Nations General Assembly as an Official Sri Lankan Youth Delegate to the United Nations. He has been appointed as the Asia Regional Representative of Commonwealth Student Association. Sachinda presented the recommendations of the Asia Pacific Youth Consultation on UN Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security with an Iranian colleague at a globally live streamed special panel discussion after being elected by the fellow youth peace builders from 19 countries in Asia Pacific region. This event was held in 2017 at the UN Regional Headquarters in Thailand. He has been awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Persons (TOYP) Award in 2015 by Junior Chamber International and had been nominated as a regional finalist from Asia for the Commonwealth Youth Worker Award in 2013.

Being a person who loves to live in the moment I see each and every achievement in my life as something to celebrate with the same importance as it motivates me to do better in everything I do. However among all these achievements I believe that my greatest achievement was being able to become an Anandian by passing the Grade five scholarship examination. That is where the journey began! he explained.
He considers the moment that he met former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon during the 71st UN General Assembly as an Official Sri Lankan Youth Delegate to the United Nations as one of the highlights of his journey.
It was also a proud moment to address the globe as a Sri Lankan youth since I delivered the Official Youth Statement of Sri Lanka in the Third Committee of 71st UN General Assembly, he recalled.
On his role as the Speaker of the Youth Parliament Sachinda notes, My main role is to ensure that Parliamentary proceedings take place accordingly as per the standing orders while maintaining good discipline at the house. I am really glad to say that we have set our standards of Sri Lanka Youth Parliament to a position where even the members of the National Parliament can learn many things about how to engage in a meaningful debate with good discipline.
Elaborating the biggest challenge he has faced in his life Sachinda says that he had to overcome many barriers to reach the position he is in today.
One of the main challenges was my own fears which I was able to overcome with the time. Also several times I was challenged by the system just because I was coming from a normal family background which had no political influence. English language was also a barrier for me in the initial stages but today, looking back at my journey, I am really thankful to all those challenges for making me strong and who I am today.
Queried on what he thinks is the most crucial issue that the Sri Lankan youth are suffering from today, Sachinda says that the youth do not have a clear vision about their own future nor the future of the country.
It increases the tension among young people. Throughout last six or seven decades we havent seen that any political leadership of this country sensibly addressing the issues of youth with a good understanding about the grassroots level youth issues. So it has continuously failed us in giving sustainable solutions to youth issues. Young people must actively participate in the democratic process, starting from casting their votes as responsible voters to running for elections to have the decision making power to combat this issue. As long as the decision making power remains with the incapable rulers, there is very less we can do, he opined.
He says that he has a set of role models who influences his thinking. His father, Wijerathna Witharana  a retired police officer - and his mother, Ashoka Dissanayake, are his mentors as he has witnessed their struggle to bring him up to level he is in today.
They have nourished me with the finest lessons of humanity which is the reason behind many of the things I voluntary do. Abraham Lincoln is also my role model since his life story gives us the lesson of patience and not giving up at any point in our lives no matter how hard the situation is, he said.
Sachinda also has an elder brother, Thilina Madushan Witharana, who studied at Isipathana College, Colombo, and is employed in Japan.
My one and only dream is to build a better country where everyone can live happily and peacefully.
" I may take any path which will lead to that dream in the future. I have a strong desire to end my career one day as a diplomat who was able to take the glory of my beautiful motherland to international heights, Sachinda noted.
His advice to youth is to have unconditional faith and to love whatever tasks they take on.
Most of the time young people do not believe in themselves due to various reasons. We must believe in our potential to get the best out of us. I think thats where everything begins. If you can believe in your dream, you are halfway there.
"Also it is really important not to give up our dreams whenever we go through hard times. That is where we need to hold on to our dreams with patience. Finally commitment and self discipline throughout the journey is essential. If you really want to become an outstanding person, you may have to do things which ordinary people may not do! he concluded with a smile.

Hesitant to play lead in   I, Tonya
In a career of almost six years, I, Tonya has marked the first time that actress Margot Robbie has played the lead. She said she was always hesitant about it. The biographical sports drama I, Tonya features Robbie as real-life figure skater Tonya Harding and her connection to the 1994 attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan.
When Robbie landed the role, it was the first time she could call home and said, Mum, Im the main part.
Its a big step, playing a lead, a step Ive been hesitant to make. All the weight of the film rests on your shoulders. And if it doesnt work Its that much harder for you to get a lead role again - especially if youre a woman, Robbie told media. I feel like guys get a few more chances to be the lead in a flop. If youre a woman, and it flops Good luck getting another one, she added.
At the 90th Academy Awards next month, Robbie is a contender in the Best Actress category.

Hettigoda Group gifts school needs to biginners of Sri Dharmarama Maha Vidyalaya
As patrons of the school in their neighbourhood, Siddhalepa, a leading Ayurveda Pharmaceutical Manufacturer provided the beginners of year one schoolchildren with all the school needs for their initial year in school.
Over 35 schoolchildren were present at the school premises to receive this complete package which included everything a young school beginner needed in school.
The 140 year old Sri Dharmarama Maha Vidyalaya had experienced gradual deterioration and decline in popularity as a leading school in the city in the past decade.
The school furnished with three, three storied building as classrooms, two halls, a science laboratory and a computer room had lost its past glory as a leading educational institution in the city as newer schools in the vicinity overtook Sri Dharmarama Maha Vidyalaya in popularity, facilities and size.
The school which once accommodated more than 1500 students had dwindled to a cadre of less than 100 in recent times. It is under the tenure of the present principal of the school, P.K. Marambage that with the support of Past Students Association the school is being resurrected to its past status as a leading education institution in the city of Ratmalana.
The Hettigoda Group has been working consistently on several projects to promote childrens talent and educating them on the importance of preserving our environment.
Among the national level programs undertaken by the Hettigoda Group for children is the popular Kekulu Art Competition where pre-school children are provided a platform to express their natural talents through this All Island Art Competition.
The Herbal Garden Project is another project aimed at educating our younger generation on the necessity of protecting our environment and the value of our indigenous herbs in the ayurveda medical industry.
Childrens welfare and education is a priority in the companys Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

Imprisoning innocents
In April 2013, Shehan was arrested in Kollupitiya and did not know why.
Earlier that day, he had signed for a package being delivered to two of his friends. It turned out that the package had been flagged by police because it contained 360 grams of hash.
To this day, Shehan, who asked that his full name not be used, says he did not know he was accepting a package full of drugs.
Despite his protests, the police charged him with aiding and abetting an offence under the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
They didnt take me to court for an initial hearing; they waited for courts to be over and then took me straight to the judges house, he recalled in a recent interview. I didnt have my lawyer or anything.
He was told that because of the seriousness of his charge, he could only apply for bail from the High Court  a process that would take three months. Then they took me to remand, he said.
When Shehan arrived at the Welikada New Magazine Remand Prison that night, he did not know that it would be his home for the next year.
But thats how the remand system works in Sri Lanka.
Jailed with no conviction
Sri Lankas remand prisons are so overcrowded and the bail process so inefficient, that people like Shehan who are innocent in the eyes of the law end up spending long periods of time locked up.
Department of Prison statistics from 2016, the most recent year data is available, show that Sri Lankas remand prisons hold an average of 8,625 people a day in buildings that are only meant to accommodate 5,034.
That means the prisons are crowded over 70 percent above their capacity.
Of Sri Lankas entire prison population, 80 percent are remand prisoners, meaning that just 20 percent of those doing time have actually been convicted of the crimes they are accused of.
Meanwhile, people spend months, if not years, in squalid conditions awaiting the outcomes of their trials.
On Shehans first night in remand prison, he slept on the floor of a holding room with other prisoners, packed in like sardines, he said.
He was later given a section and a cell. In New Magazine, some six-by-eight foot cells are shared with as many as five people, Shehan said.
Most of those guys are quite scrawny addicts, he said. But Shehan is over six feet tall and had trouble finding enough space on the floor to sleep in his cell. Some people sleep in the halls.
In the mornings, Shehan said he remembered waking to the smell of human waste, as people had defecated in the drains running along the hallways during the night.
Theres no escape, every day is the same, he said. There is nothing to do. There are no board games except for one carrom board for 300 people.
Because of this, some people turn to drugs for mental relief. For this reason, Shehan said, many prisoners call remand prison the university.
(Thats) because they say you pass, or you fail. If you fail, it means you become a drug addict, he said. If you pass, you come out.
Shehan said that while he avoided drugs, he watched many people sink deeper into their addictions, or begin using substances like heroin for the first time.
Drugs are basically the only thing to do, he said.
Shehan had never been arrested before and did not know how quickly he might be granted bail. But others did.
They told me: Listen man, no matter what you do, under this 54 (shorthand for Section 54 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance), youre not going to get out.
They said he would need to wait at least a year before he could receive bail.
I was so angry initially for what happened to me, he recalled. He said he was tortured not just by his confinement, but by imagining what other people were saying about him and saying to his parents, in the outside world.
But I believe being angry for everything is only going to hurt me, he said. Because everyone who put me in here doesnt give a damn and theyre not even thinking about me.
So I did the best I could in there, he added.
Three months into his time at New Magazine, he applied for bail with the High Court. And then he waited.
Bail is the exception
Government officials and politicians have been aware of the situation in remand prisons for a long time.
In 1997, Parliament passed the Bail Act in an effort to relieve some of the overcrowding.
One of the most significant reforms in the Bail Act was that it set the maximum length of time someone could serve in remand to one year. The High Court could extend that period to a maximum of two years, but only by request of the Attorney General.
Nobody in this country should be deprived of freedom unless and until he is convicted by a court of law exercising competent jurisdiction, Professor G.L. Peiris, then the Minister of Justice, said while presenting the bill.
He recognized the consequences of people staying too long in remand.
During that period they come into contact with criminal elements. They cannot re-enter society as the innocent people that they were, he said. That is a great disservice to society and we think that we have to remedy that very sorry state of affairs.
But it appears that that sorry state of affairs still exists.
Kalyananda Tiranagama, a human rights lawyer in Colombo, said in an interview that he believes the Bail Act has failed its purpose.
The Bail Act says bail is the rule, and remand is the exception. But it operates the other way around: remand is the rule, and bail is the exception, he said.
In theory, bail is supposed to act as a surety that someone will re-appear in court after their initial hearing. Bail keeps the remand prison population down and saves the state money: the government spends about Rs. 750 a day housing a prisoner, according to the most recent prison statistics.
But in Sri Lanka, bail is still incredibly hard to get, even if you qualify for it.
Tiranagama said part of the problem is that the law gave police too much power to recommend the denial of bail, which he said is routine. Magistrates often just sign off on what the police ask for, he said.
But most people who are held in remand prison without bail are not seriously violent or connected to large criminal operations, according to the Lawyers for Human Rights and Development, the organization which Tiranagama heads.
In a comprehensive study of remand prisons the group released in 2012, the researchers found that the vast majority of people in remand were those who were accused of selling a small amount of marijuana or heroin, accused of having a hand bomb, or accused of committing an offence while armed with a gun.
These people, like Shehan, must apply for bail in the High Court or Court of Appeal, a process that takes time and costs money. Still others stay in remand because they cannot pay the bail amount set by the judge or produce a qualified surety.
All of these factors contribute to the overcrowding of remand prisons.
The legal framework is good, but in terms of implementation, the Bail Act has failed, said Vishwa de Livera Tennekoon, an attorney-at-law who represents remand prisoners. Indeed, the Prison Departments own statistics show that many people are being held in remand in breach of the Bail Act. At the end of 2016, more than 730 people had been imprisoned for more than two years, the maximum allowed under the law, without a conviction.
One-hundred-and-forty-nine people had been held in remand prison for five years or more.
Reducing overcrowding
Although the overcrowding in remand prisons is a glaring problem, and the continued incarceration of people not convicted of any crime an issue, even prison administrators acknowledge, the issue is not a top Parliamentary priority.
The government authorities do not like to concern themselves with this, Tiranagama said.
But Thushara Upuldeniya, the spokesman for the Department of Prisons, said his agency is taking a number of steps to reduce prison overcrowding.
The most significant, he said, is the urban prison relocation programme. Many of the old prisons are in the centre of towns, with high land values, so cant be expanded, he said.
So the prison department has targeted eight prisons around the island to re-open in new facilities in more rural areas.
One is complete, two are finishing construction, and four are under the design process, he said. They will meet international standards and have enough space.
Upuldeniya said the department is also exploring alternatives to prison, like sending drug users to an 800-person rehabilitation camp in the Polonnaruwa District, and allowing some convicted prisoners to participate in community-based rehabilitation.
A task force under the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement is studying judicial causes for prison overcrowding, like the slow bail process, he added.
Upuldeniya pointed to the fact that overall rates of prison overcrowding, meaning convicted and unconvicted prisoners combined, have fallen over the past five years, from 100 percent overcrowded to about 50 percent. It shows our steps are working, he said.
Life outside
The success of recent reforms did not come early enough for Shehan. He said his year in remand changed him forever.
In May 2013, the High Court granted him bail, and he graduated from New Magazine Remand Prison.
The court eventually threw out all the charges against him, as the case against his involvement with the drug trafficking was too flimsy. He spent over a year in jail for no crime.
Shehan said that after he made peace with the fact that he was going to be imprisoned for a long time, he was able to make something of his life in prison.
He is a professional fitness trainer, and he led 15 people in group exercises over the year. He said he used exercise to help two people get through heroin withdrawal, and he taught English to former LTTE cadres.
But now he wants to leave that part of his past behind. It put me through the depths of depths, and I came out, he said. Now, he teaches workout classes in the mornings, spends time with his family, and works at resorts on the South and East coasts during the tourist season to make money. Every once in a while, though, his old life and his new collide.
Although hes lost weight since being in prison, still people recognize me after four or five years, he said.
That was the case on a recent evening when he called a tuk-tuk while leaving his cousins house.
I get in, and the guy is like, OK, where do you want to go he recalled. The driver then made a little smirk that Shehan said hes come to recognize.
He goes: I think I have met you before. Dont get angry, butMagazine He laughed, remembering the story.
Oh yea, oh yea, he replied. I was there.

Khaleda Zia jailed for five years in corruption case

A court in theBangladeshi capital, Dhaka, has sentenced former Prime MinisterKhaleda Ziato five years in jail in a corruption case.
Judge Md Akhtaruzzaman of the Special Court-5 on Thursday sentenced the two-time former prime minister to rigorous imprisonment. He read out some selective parts of the 632-page verdict.
"The verdict proves no one is above the law,"Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anisul Haque said after the verdict that was announced amid tight security.
Zia, the chairperson of thecountry's main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), along withfive others, was accused of embezzlement offunds meant forthe Zia Orphanage Trust.
Tarique Rahman, Zia's elder son and believed to be her political heir, and four others were given 10 years in the politically significant case ahead of the general elections due to be held in December.
Rahman, the vice chairman of the BNP, has been living in London for the past nine years.
All six were accused of embezzling over Tk 21 million ($252,000) from foreign donations intended for a charity named after former president Ziaur Rahman, Zia's husband.
The four others who were also given 10 year jail-term are former lawmaker Quazi Salimul Haq, former principal secretary to Zia, Kamal Uddin Siddique, Zia's nephew Mominur Rahman and businessman Sharfuddin Ahmed.
Zia's political future
The verdict could possibly bar72-year-old Ziafrom contesting in the general elections as the countrys constitution prohibits a convicted person with over two years jail-term from participating.
Zia, decked in a cream colored printed chiffon sari, a shawl of the same colour, and sunglasses appeared nonchalant while hearing the verdict. She didn't give any reactions.
After the verdict, she was taken at the Woman Cell and Daycare Centre at the old Dhaka Central jail. The Jail authorities have already renovated the cell.
Defence lawyer Khandakar Mahbub Hossain said, this verdict failed to reflect the truth. "We will go to the higher court against this," he said, adding that he hoped Zia would receive bail promptly.
BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Alamgir accused the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of trying "to keep the BNP out of politics".
"They have already detained more than 3,000 of our activists and leaders from various parts of the country," he said.
Alamgir said, anticipating "what the verdict would be", Zia had earlier ordered all the BNP activists and leaders to "refrain from any violent protests and processions".
"We call peaceful protests all across the country from Friday noon," he said.
The BNP had boycotted the last election held in 2014 as it wanted the elections under a care-taker government.
Police use tear gas
But supporters hit the streets and clashed with police and blocked roads in Dhaka in the wake of the verdict.
Earlier, thousands of BNP leaders and activists escorted Zias motorcade on the way to the court despite an overwhelming presence of security forces deployed in the capital.
Activists of the ruling Awami League and its affiliate organisations also had occupied key points of Dhaka city to stop BNP supporters from demonstrating.
Anticipating blockades and protests, the government had detained several senior BNP leaders while several others have gone into hiding.
The Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called on Bangladesh government to stop arbitrary arrests and detentions of opposition BNP activists. It also accused the government of violating the rights to free expression and peaceful assembly by preventing opposition supporters from demonstrating.
Dhaka-based group Ain O Salish Kendra said a "total of 1,786 persons have been arrested in the last eight days".
The HRW, in a statement on Thursday, said Bangladesh should publicly order the security forces to abide by international standards on policing demonstrations.
Brad Adams, Asia director at HRW, said it was crucial for security forces to act with restraint at all times.
"The Bangladesh governments claims to be open and democratic ring hollow as it cracks down on political dissent," he said.
First female prime minister
Zia was catapulted into Bangladeshi politics in the early 1980s when her husband former President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated.
She became the Muslim-majority country's first female prime minister in 1991 after democracy was restored.
In the 35 years of her political career, Zia has spent times in jail on a number of occasions. This is for the first time, she has been convicted.
Zia faces a total of 37 cases out of which chargesheets have been submitted in 17 cases.
After skipping the hearings for as much as 143 times over the last six years, Zia finally appeared before the court on October 19, 2017 and obtained bail.
Asif Nazrul, Professor of law of Dhaka University, calls it "a controversial verdict". "There are many people in the country who will view this as a politically-motivated verdict."
Nazrul said many people will see that as a tactic for removing the main contender in the election and a way of "demonising a political opponent".

LG polls: Corruption accounts for over 50% of complaints
The 'Program for the Protection of Public Resources', an election monitor connected to Transparency International Sri Lanka, has received nearly 150 complaints relating to local government elections.
Of these complaints, more than half are related to the abuse of State resources, Transparency Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said at a press conference on Wednesday.
In one such instance in Kurunegala, 20 sewing machines belonging to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce were discovered at the home of a supporter of a minor political party, Obeyesekere said. The police stopped the distribution of the machines and are holding them in custody until after the elections.
In Kegalle, the election monitor reported to the authorities that a building owned by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Education Department was being used for election campaign activity by an opposition party. The police then sealed off the building.
Obesekere also said his organizations reporting was also able to stop interviews for politically motivated job recruitment at the Hambantota Port.
In such specific instances, the Elections Commission and other authorities have been able to take action, Obeyesekere said.
He cited the case regarding the distribution of sil redi in 2015, which recently ended in the conviction of two senior public officials, as a reminder to public officials to follow the bribery, corruption and elections laws. Because some local government bodies were dissolved two years ago, what we are seeing is that there is greater involvement of state assets connected to the central government, such as the use of backhoes related to particular line ministries, or the fact that central ministerial vehicles have been used, he said.
Obeyesekere said persons who knew of such incidents should report them to the Program for the Protection of Public Resources at 071 010 25 70, 071 135 09 90, or [emailprotected].

Long-lasting dengue prevention method to be launched
A self-sustaining programme that helps provide long-term protection for communities from dengue is to be launched in Sri Lanka soon.
Monash Universitys World Mosquito Program (WMP) is set to be rolled out in Sri Lanka following the signing of a Collaboration Agreement (CA) by Secretary, Ministry of Health (MoH), Janaka Sugathadasa at a ceremony in Colombo with Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson.
The agreement advances the partnership between Sri Lanka and the WMP in tackling the threat of mosquito borne-viruses such as dengue in Sri Lanka.
It comes after Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishops announcement last year of the AUD 1 million partnership and funding commitment to help establish the WMP in Sri Lanka.
With support from the Australian Governments innovation Xchange, WMP will use its ground-breaking research to trial the introduction of naturally occurring Wolbachia bacteria to Sri Lankan mosquito populations.
Wolbachia prevents dengue from being transmitted between people and also has the ability to block other mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika and Chikungunya.
WMP Program Director Professor Scott ONeill said the agreement was an important step in establishing the programme in Sri Lanka.We are extremely pleased to be working with the National Dengue Control Unit, Ministry of Health, in seeking a long-term solution to the dengue burden in Sri Lanka. We look forward to rolling out the program to local communities in the Colombo area, he said.
Mosquito-borne viruses pose a global health threat for a number of reasons and our program provides an affordable solution to improving health security in the region.The program will be established across three sites in the Colombo area over the next 12 months, with the first mosquito releases to take place next year.
Its hoped the programme will expand its Wolbachia method to further sites in Sri Lanka in the future working in collaboration with local partners and subject to approval from the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health.
Since 2011, WMP has been conducting field trials using the Wolbachia method. Long term monitoring has shown that when a high proportion of mosquitoes in an area carry Wolbachia, local transmission of the disease has stopped.
Sri Lanka is the tenth country to become part of the program, joining Brazil, Colombia, Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, Fiji, Vanuatu and Kiribati.Working to help protect the global community from mosquito-borne diseases, the World Mosquito Program (WMP), formerly the Eliminate Dengue Program (EDP, is a not-for- profit initiative led from Monash University, Australia.
It uses a safe, natural and effective method to reduce the threat of viruses such as Zika, dengue and Chikungunya. Through collaborative and innovative approach, WMP helps protect local communities from these diseases in Australia, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific Islands.

Mohamed Nasheed takes centre stage in Maldives crisis
THE MALDIVES: A decade after he swept to power in the Maldives first democratic elections, exiled Opposition Leader Mohamed Nasheed is again pushing for change -- by force if necessary -- as his island homeland spirals into crisis.
Nasheed made history in 2008 when he defeated Maumoon Abdul Gayoom -- then Asias longest-serving leader -- after three decades of unchallenged rule.
In the years that followed, the charismatic young president won international renown as a campaigner against climate change and the rising sea levels posing an existential threat to the low-lying Indian Ocean archipelago.
But he fled into exile after he was convicted and jailed in 2015 on a terrorism charge widely seen as politically motivated.
Now Nasheed, whose tumultuous life in prison and politics has earned comparisons to Nelson Mandela, is back in the global spotlight after a Supreme Court ruling that has plunged his homeland into chaos.
He is calling for help to depose President Abdulla Yameen, whose refusal to comply with the courts order to release high-profile political prisoners drew international censure.
The surprise court ruling -- since overturned after the president declared a state of emergency and arrested two top judges -- opened a new chapter for the veteran opposition leader, who has appealed to regional superpower India to send in troops and restore democracy.
Nasheed spent decades building a pro-democracy movement in exile before his 2008 election.
He was repeatedly arrested for speaking out against the government in the 1990s and he established the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), now the main opposition, in exile in Sri Lanka and Britain after leaving the Maldives in 2003.
He returned in 2005 and was elected president three years later on a promise to make the holiday paradise islands carbon neutral within a decade.
In 2009, he held an underwater cabinet meeting in an effort to press the world to cap carbon emissions. He also raised eyebrows by announcing his intention to buy a new homeland to relocate the Maldives entire population.
But he was pushed aside in 2012 after weeks of street protests over the sacking of a judge, and a year later lost a controversial run-off against Yameen -- half-brother to his old foe Gayoom.
By 2016 he was again in exile in London, securing political asylum with the help of high-profile human rights lawyer Amal Clooney.
Yameens regime, furious, tore up his passport. Nasheed insisted he was a refugee but still a Maldivian national.
In early 2017, he announced from Colombo his intention to challenge Yameen for the presidency -- even though stepping foot in the Maldives would result in his arrest.
Yameen has slowly ratcheted up his crackdown on dissent, using troops to shut down parliament and jailing critics, as the Maldives battered image as an idyllic island paradise fades into mirage. - AFP

Most Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera
A great loss to world Sangha community
The sudden and untimely passing away of the late Most Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera (Deputy Prelate), would undoubtedly result in a major setback not only for the Sangha community in Sri Lanka but also for the entire Buddhist world as a whole.
The reason is that the good name of the late Anunayake Thera is inextricably enlivened in our minds forever to such extent. Many are aware that the late Anunayaka Thera has played a prominent role in any sensitive situation on behalf of the ordained and the lay people alike. In this manner, he was able to win the highest veneration and admiration as a monk who pioneered to resolve any issues in unbiased manner, without any hidden interests, whenever the country was faced with various national and religious issues.
People born with many talents, skills or exceptional abilities are reported from time to time. Where such abilities are concerned, we can rightly say that late Most Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Anunayaka Thera belonged to that category of illustrious personalities born with such intellectual abilities.
In my personal view, it is only the few virtuous people who can invariably be equated to the calibre of the late Most Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Anunayake Thera as such great personalities are very scarce today when we consider educational background, honorific titles and accolades, temples they stayed, talents and so on. Going by this line of thinking, there are only few persons who are fortunate to be born with all these aptitudes, potential and unique qualities and in this sense, the Anunayake Thera is one of them.
He descends from the Udugampola Sangha community, of much repute and historical significance. The temple where he was ordained is also a well-known sacred place in the country. Most Venerable late Bellanwila Somarathana Nayake Thera dedicated himself much to bring this historic Bellanwila temple back to its glory.
His brother in ordination, Most Venerable Dr. Bellanwila Dhammarathana Thera is well known for his illustrious career as a renowned Dhamma preacher and propagator the world over in his Buddhist missionary activities in Singapore and Asian countries.
The name of Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya stands synonymous with the Bellanwila Perahera, late Most Venerable Bellanwila Somarathana Nayaka Thera (the former late chief incumbent and his teacher), Bellanwila Viharaya, then Bellanwila pinnacle tusker, generations of indigenous medical practitioners of Bellanwila, Bellanwila Bo Tree, bird sanctuary, ponds for the elephants and reservoirs, to name a few.
It has to be mentioned that the whole Buddhist community is in profound grief today because late Most Venerable Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera who has followed the footsteps of these erudite generation of monks, has radiated in the world as a famous Buddhist leader and a great national peace crusader, the void of which he created cannot be filled in many more years to come.
As a respected academic, his service and contribution to restore multi-religious, multi-ethnic peace, unity and reconciliation is immeasurable. His praiseworthy contribution and dedication to the literary world to quench the thirst of Dhamma knowledge for the people would certainly be well treasured in the minds of the whole Buddhist community in the future too.
May the late Most Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera be born again among us to survive and preserve Buddha Sasana with more vigour, vim and vitality with the blessings of all the virtuous effects he accrued by his noble service to Buddhism, the world Buddhist community and the nation!
Agga maha panditha Kotugoda Dhammawasa Nayaka TheraSupreme PatriarchSri Lanka Amarapura Nikaya
A life of erudition and service
The passing away of the Venerable Bellanwila Wimalarathana Nayaka Thera marks a conclusion of a life dedicated to scholarly pursuits and service for the Sasana and society. By the time he passed away, he was Chancellor of Sri Jayewardenepura University, where he served as a professor in Pali and Buddhist Studies for a long period of time and Chief Incumbent of Bellanwila Rajamahaviharaya which was not only a well-known centre of religion, but also a centre for social service.
He gave leadership and guidance to the multiple activities of the Vihara on behalf of his monastic brother, the Most Venerable Bellanwila Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera who is active in Singapore running a centre for Buddhism and Buddhist higher learning.
The Venerable Thera had both traditional monastic learning and modern university education which he completed by getting his doctorate in Buddhist studies from Lancaster University, UK. During his university days in UK, the Venerable Thera lived at the London Vihara associating with such great Buddhist scholars and leaders as Ven. Dr. Hammalawa Saddhatissa Thera and Dr. Walpola Rahula Thera, a Buddhist scholar monk known throughout the world who later became the Vice Chancellor of Sri Jayewardenepura University.
The life of the Venerable Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera is a good combination of both erudition characteristic of a typical Sri Lankan Buddhist monk and social service. At the university, he taught Buddhist studies to many generations of students while continuing with his academic research. His work on the great physical marks of the Buddha, dealing with the Buddhist history, art and doctrine, remains his unique contribution to the field of Buddhist studies. In addition, he published several works both in English and Sinhala on themes such as Prajnaparamita literature of Mahayana Buddhism.
By the time he passed away, the Venerable Thera was completing a work on Anagarika Dharmapala whose service to the nation, he felt, was not adequately understood or appreciated by the subsequent generations.
Beyond his academic pursuits, the Venerable Thera was keen to maintain the Bellanwila Rajamahaviharaya as a proper Buddhist vihara with clean, neat and well-organized environment equipped with facilities for the thousands of devotees who flock there every day. As one of the most popular religious centres around Colombo, Bellanwila Viharaya had substantial material resources at its disposal with which the Venerable Thera turned the monastery into a social service centre by establishing a vocational training centre for the youth, and a day care centre for the elderly. Through these acts of social consciousness, the Venerable Thera was establishing a new identity to the traditional Buddhist monastery as a place where not only the religious needs of the people were taken care of, but also provided material support to the society.
All these activities did not stop him from playing a very active role in national, religious and social issues of the country. A remarkable character of his activism was that he did not represent the narrow interests of any particular group of people or of any particular political party. He transcended such narrow boundaries and represented the national and religious interests from a broad perspective.
While he believed that Buddhism should be preserved in this country and as the main religious tradition of the country that Buddhism should provide guidance to all other religious communities of the country, he did not neglect the presence of religions other than Buddhism and communities other than Sinhalese amidst us. In this sense, his sense of justice and fairness was exemplary.
The Venerable Thera retained his independence by not going after those who are in power to receive undue favours. This made him a straight speaker in matters of religious and national interest, and he was not hesitant to be outspoken when he felt that society was not on the right track.
His demise marks a loss of one of the leading spokesmen of the Sangha on broader national and religious issues. He leaves behind a great legacy of an erudite monk with a keen sense of social service and also leaves for the rest of the Buddhist monastic community a great challenge of national and religious leadership to take upon itself.
May the Venerable Nayaka Thera attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!
Asanga TilakaratneSenior Professor of Pali and Buddhist StudiesUniversity of Colombo
A great propagator of Dhamma
The death of the Most Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera, a brilliant scholar and highly respected Buddhist Monk, is an irreparable loss to the entire Buddhasasana and the country.
Prior to his appointment as Chancellor of the prestigious University of Sri Jayewardenepura, the Venerable Thera was an Associate Professor, Lecturer and Visiting Lecturer at the University.

After obtaining his degree from Vidyalankara University (Kelaniya University), Venerable Bellanwila Nayaka Thera obtained a PhD from the University of Lancaster, United Kingdom.
On February 28, 1956, 14-year-old Gilbert entered the Order and assumed the name of Wimalarathana which rhymed well with his brothers name Dhammarathana. They were pupils of the highly respected Nayaka Thera Ven. Bellanwila Somarathana who ushered the beginning of the Golden Era of the Temple.
Venerable Dr. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Nayaka Thera was a brilliant student at Pravachchanodaya Pirivena in Molligoda, Wadduwa and Vidyalankara Pirivena and entered the University of Vidyalankara, Kelaniya.
Internationaly famous, Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera was a pious monk who committed his whole life to serve Buddhism. Undoubtedly the learned monk was an ornament to Buddhasasana. He was an eloquent Dhamma preacher. The Venerable Theras presentation and deliverance were very appealing to the heart of the listeners.
This noble monk was a prolific writer. Some of his writings were Buddha Sampradeya Sankruhya  1984, Buddhadhamma Saha Venat Agam  1989, Budupilimaya Mudra Saha Asana  1991, Budupilimaye Vikasanaya  1995, Prajaparamita Sahityaya  2001, Vihara Lipi Saraniya  2006, Hityaya Saha Kalawa  2006 and Budupilimayata Pera Buduhamuduruwo  2010.

Further Dr. Wimalarathana Thera organized vocational training centres for the youth. He also granted university scholarships for undergraduates. The Venerable Thera organized health camps for the benefit of men, women and children and initiated housing projects for the poor.
The Venerable Nayaka Thera was instrumental in organizing the annual perahara at Bellanwila Temple. It was not second to the cultural pageant of the historic Kandy Perahara.
Venerable Bellanwila Wimalarathana Nayaka Thera was loved by all irrespective of colour, caste or creed. He was humble, unassuming and always ready to help anyone who needed his assistance. He gained lot of happiness in helping others. It may have been a habit he gained in his Sansaric journey.
Venerable Sir, I go down on my knees and worship you. The meritorious acts and social activities that you performed in this birth will undoubtedly help you to attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
Premasara Epasinghe
Fearless voice of the motherland
The sudden demise of Most Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera, who was ordained as a monk at the very famous Bellanwila Rajamahaviharaya in Sri Lanka, generated painful tremors in the hearts of all patriotic and peace-loving citizens.
He provided an unprecedented and unique service to our people and the international and inter-religious communities by transforming the Bellanwila Rajamahaviharaya into an outstanding icon of the Sambuddha Sasana, our country, our national cultural heritage, and the intelligentsia by the sagacious manner in which he was able to outstrip in that process the traditional beliefs, approaches, and administrative limitations that hindered.
The highly regarded service he rendered to the Buddhasasana Karyasadhaka Mandalaya as one of its senior members and many other national and religious organizations as an active participant became clearly evident because of independence of thought, impartiality in appraisals, impersonal and apolitical objectives that were underlying. His service in support of the national effort to build up lasting national reconciliation and development through national and religious harmony by his fearless articulations and critical writings wase not second to his scholarly contributions to literary and Dhamma publications.
It is because of that unique contribution made by the late Most Venerable Anunayake Thera that his untimely demise is felt by all impartial and like-minded people as a deep loss to the nation that is hard to replace.
The highest honour that we could bestow on the late Most Venerable Anunayake Thera is to impartially, equitably, correctly and jointly enliven all such efforts of true patriots for the protection of the Buddhasasana, our motherland, and our people by providing necessary guidelines to the government and the people.
May the late Most Venerable Anunayaka Thera attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Moves to solve problems of Uma Oya affected
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that the Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development had compiled a report regarding the measures taken by authorities targeting the people affected by the Uma Oya multi-purpose project.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appearing for the respondents informed that the Ministry of Mahaweli Development has taken measures to solve such issues including the drinking water problem, housing problem and crop damages due to project.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Vijith Malalgoda fixed the petition for March 27.
The Deputy Solicitor General made these remarks consequent to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice, and four individuals, including M. D. P. Manatunga, who are residents of the Bandarawela area who have been victimised as a result of the Uma Oya multi-purpose project.
The Attorney General had earlier submitted in Court, a copy of the Cabinet memorandum issued regarding the Uma Oya project.
The Cabinet memorandum submitted by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment had identified the main socio-economic problems in the areas affected by the Uma Oya project.
The Cabinet memorandum stated that the ingress of water into the head face tunnel which occurred on December 4, 2014 resulted in some socio-economic problems including drying up of wells, developing cracks in houses, damaging crops around the areas of water ingress into tunnel located in the District Secretariat areas of Bandarawela and Ella.
The petitioners claim that as a result of the Uma Oya project, not only have their homes and crops been destroyed, but they have lost access to clean drinking water, citing this as a violation of their fundamental rights. Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, N. Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture, the Central Environment Authority and the Attorney General have been named as respondents in the petition.
Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with Sugath Atapattu, Prabhani Samarweera and Chathurika Sewwandi appeared for the petitioners.

Murali won Observer Schoolboy Cricketer award 27 years ago
Workds highest wicket taker in Test cricket Muttiah Muralitharan first came to limelight through the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer contest some 27 yeas ago.
Then a highly successful bowler in school cricket, Murali was adjudged Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in 1991 when he was playing for St. Anthonys College, Katugastota.
The four-decade-old history of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has given that much-needed inspiration and motivation to the countrys budding schoolboy cricketers to extend their playing careers beyond school level.
There have been many outstanding players who aggregate over 1,000 runs or capture over 100 wickets during a season but only a few have taken such performances to the next level. Playing for a reputed club after ending their school careers and winning the Sri Lanka cap thereafter has been the dream of every schoolboy cricketer but only a handful would eventually fulfill that dream.
One such outstanding player who not only had achieved that goal in style but had also gone to erase world records in Test cricket, had emerged through the premier school cricket awards show some 27 years ago. The big news in school cricket during that era was about a magical off spinner who had shattered the dreams of all batsmen in inter-school cricket at that period.
Having come to the limelight to enjoy rich harvests of over 100 wickets each on successive seasons, the soft-spoken and publicity-shy young cricketer from St. Anthony's College, Katugastota ultimately turned out to be the biggest headache to all top batsmen in world cricket.
The stepping stone for the young lad for international cricket was the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title he had in 1991. After making his Sri Lanka debut soon afterwards, he cemented his place in the national team in next to no time.
He eventually became the highest ever wicket-taker in Test cricket, establishing several other world records in international cricket. He was none other than spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan who returned to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year stage in 2011 as the chief guest, some 20 years after his crowning glory.
Speaking at the 33rd Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards night as the chief guest, Muralitharan looked emotional when he went down the memory lane. You are the future Sri Lanka players. You must keep the Sri Lanka flag flying wherever you go, he told the gathering.
Play hard and dedicate yourself, then success is bound to come. As young cricketers, you must keep in mind that only 11 could play in a team. When you get that rare chance of playing, you must put your heart and soul and give hundred percent to the team, so that success will come your way, Muralitharan had told the gathering, while paying a tribute to the Sunday Observer for its role in rewarding the outstanding schoolboy cricketers since 1979.
Don't be disappointed if you fail once or twice in the early stages of your career. Keep on trying and success if bound to come your way," he was quoted as saying.
Muralitharan also advised the schoolboys present at the show. Keep absolutely cool even when the going is not the way you want. I learnt this from my captain Arjuna Ranatunga (another proud recipient of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 1980 and 1982) who sported a cool head even when the going was not good. Arjuna used to take pressure off the players when the going is not to his liking. He doesnt show any anger  thats why he is called captain cool, Muralitaran said.
Born on April 17, 1972, Muralitharan has achieved loads of records which would be hard to emulate. He is the only person to capture 800 wickets in Test cricket. Representing Sri Lanka in 133 Tests, Muralitharan has accounted for 800 scalps with an attractive average of 22.72.
With his deadly off breaks, Muraitharan has enjoyed match bags of ten wickets or more on 22 occasions which too accounts for a world record. No other bowler has captured five wickets or more on 67 occasions in Test cricket. His one day international record too is equally impressive. In 350 ODIs, the master spinner has captured 534 wickets with an average of 23.08.
It is heartening to see the Mega Show is completing its 40th anniversary this year. Most importantly, the countrys national mobile service provider has been associated with Lankas first-ever school cricket awards show for 11 years. Together with the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel management, SLT Mobitel's Chief Executive Officer Nalin Perera is extending the fullest support to make the Mother of all Shows a resounding success once again as it continues to remain the dream of every schoolboy cricketer!
With the completion of the annual big matches and most of the traditional and tournament fixtures by the end of nex month, the cynosure of all eyes would be the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Contest.
Meanwhile, the voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, conducted under three categories - Platinum, Gold and Silver, has now reached its last lap.
Hence, its high time to support your alma mater by voting for your favourite schoolboy cricketer and motivate the next generation cricketers. It will be a morale booster for those outstanding young cricketers as the cream of them prepare to enter the club arena with the hope of proudly wearing that Sri Lanka cap eventually.
It is good to discover that several others have followed the Sunday Observers initiative to hold similar awards shows to commend the achievements of schoolboy cricketers after every season. But the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year remains the Mother of all Shows.
Needless to say how important it is for schoolboy cricketers to win an award as recognition to their commendable achievements after a strenuous season. It is not just appreciating their achievements but also a big inspiration for them to step into the big league. All past winners of this prestigious title have repeatedly said what a big inspiration the award had been to their cricket careers. Since its humble beginnings at Nawaragahala in 1979, the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has gone from strength to strengthen.

## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, February 8, 2018 - 01:00
Nitty-gritty of Securities Exchange Act
Continued from February 6
The following is a brief analysis pertaining to several important provisions of this new Bill :-
THE PROPOSED NEW SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMISSION, OBJECTS AND POWERS
The long title of the proposed new Securities Exchange Act provides that it is An Act to establish the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka; to Regulate Market Institutions, Public Offers of Securities, Market Intermediaries; to deal with Market Misconduct; and to meet the challenges encountered by Securities Markets in an effective and efficient manner.., and seeks to seamlessly consolidate the several aspects which must come within a Law that would regulate a capital market.
The Objects of the proposed Act are (a) to establish the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka for the creation and maintenance of a fair, efficient and transparent securities market; (b) to protect the interests of investors both local and foreign; (c) to ensure the maintenance of high professional standards in the provision of services under this Act; and (d) to mitigate systemic risks in the financial system.
The Objects have not been substantially revised, except for the inclusion of the object of the mitigation of systemic risk in the financial system, which is vital, and was implicit under the old Act as well. Protection of investors is still a paramount consideration over other competing interests such as competition and capital formation, which have been given parallel importance in jurisdictions such as the US.
The Commission largely comprises of the same, except for the replacement of the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, with a Fellow Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka who is not engaged in Auditing as nominated by its Council. This was to eliminate any conflicts of interest that could arise from an Auditor, who provides professional services to listed market Regulatees becoming part of the Commission, and also in view of the fact that under this proposed Act, Auditors have certain obligations.
The term of office of every appointed or nominated Commission Member is for three years and is limited to a maximum period of two successive terms of office, which is an important provision from a governance standpoint.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
A further safeguard to ensure the independence of the Commission has been included whereby the Minister, when appointing Commissioners must have regard not only to that persons integrity and standing, but also the likelihood of any conflict between the interests of the Commission and any interest which that person has or represents.
POWERS OF THE COMMISSION
The powers of the Commission include, (a) to advise the Government on the development of the securities market and to assist in the effective implementation of the policies; (b) to encourage and promote the development of securities markets in Sri Lanka; (c) to give general or specific directives to any person or persons including market institutions, market intermediaries, registered persons, clearing members, trading participants, depository participants, issuers, investors or recognized market operators; (d) to give general or specific directives to supplementary services providers of market institutions, market intermediaries or listed pubic companies from time to time; (e) to grant a licence to a body corporate to operate as a market institution and ensure its proper conduct; (f) to grant a licence to any person to operate as a market intermediary and ensure its proper conduct; (g) to register a person advising clients on sale or purchase of securities for and on behalf of a market intermediary as a registered person and to regulate their conduct in the discharge of their duties; (h) to issue general or specific directives to listed public companies or listed foreign entities from time to time; (i) to issue specific directives to any person to prevent the imminent infringement of this Act, regulations or rules and to restrain infringement; (j) to regulate the listing and trading of securities in an exchange; (k) to regulate the issuance of securities; (l) to prohibit or suspend the listing of any securities or to delist the listed securitiesor to take such steps as the Commission considers necessary for the protection of investors; (m) to regulate a takeover or merger of a listed public company or any matter connected therewith; (n) to inquire and conduct investigations into any activity of a market institution, market intermediary, a registered person, a listed public company or a listed foreign entity; and (o) to conduct investigations into any alleged violation or contravention of the provisions of this Act or any regulation, rule, or directive.
THE DIRECTOR GENERAL AND STAFF
The Director General under the new Act will come under the direct purview of the Commission, and shall be appointed and also removed by the Commission.
The Staff of the Commission shall also be appointed by the Commission, and their terms of service and remuneration shall be determined by the Commission. These are further provisions which strengthen the independence of the Commission.
MARKETS AND MARKET INSTITUTIONS
Part II of the Act under the heading Markets and Market Institutions, contains the provisions pertaining to Exchanges, Clearing Houses and Central Depositories.
EXCHANGES
Chapter 1 of Part II which deals with Exchanges (which is defined to mean a stock exchange or a derivatives exchange licensed under this Act) among other things, sets out the threshold requirements to become an Exchange which gives paramount importance to governance and investor protection, the duties of an Exchange including to ensure an orderly and fair market in securities that are traded through its facilities, to act in the public interest having particular regard to the need for the protection of investors, and other administrative and operational requirements.
In fact, there is specific provision which imposes a duty on a Director of an Exchange to act at all times in the public interest having particular regard to the need to protect investors.
There is also new provision, which enables the listing of securities of an Exchange, on such Exchange, which would become immediately relevant when the demutualization of the Colombo Stock Exchange takes effect.
CLEARING HOUSES
Chapter 2 deals with the regulation of Clearing Houses for the purposes of clearing and settlement and among other things, sets out the threshold requirements to be licensed as a Clearing Facility, provisions pertaining to regulation and supervision of the clearing house and its members, establishment and administration of a settlement guarantee fund etc.

CENTRAL DEPOSITORY
Under the proposed Act, there is also a separate Chapter for the regulation of Central Depositories. Under the present operative Act, the Central Depository Systems (Pvt.) Limited (CDS) has been registered under generic provisions.
GENERAL PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO MARKETS AND MARKET INSTITUTIONS

Not a  typical  boy-meets-girl romance
She is a star who has grown strength- to-strength as an actor and Kareena Kapoor says she has always been comfortable in her own zone.
The actor will soon be seen in Veere Di Wedding, which marks her first film after the birth of son, Taimur.
Kareena, who is regarded more as a contemporary than a senior by Alia Bhatt and Sonam Kapoor, credits her confidence in her 18-year-long career to have helped her gain the respect of these actors.
I think I have always carved a place for myself. Times change, generations change, people come and go. But I think its maybe because of my confidence. Its in the way one carries themselves. Thats very important. I take it as a compliment but I think I have always been pretty much in my own space. Right from Refugee till Veere Di Wedding, the actor said.
The star said Veere... was not the quintessential Bollywood romance with which her filmography is full of and that is why she took up the project.
Its a different kind of movie. Its a story of four friends. Its not the typical boy-meets-girl romance which I think Ive done so much of. So I thought this should be different. Its a small film, made by women. The producers are women - Rhea (Kapoor) and Ekta (Kapoor). I think its a special film and people will appreciate it. PTI

Pathfinder Foundation, NMF host dialogue on India-SL Maritime
The first bi-lateral conference between the National Maritime Foundation (NMF) and Pathfinder Foundation (PF) will focus on developing a platform for analytical and innovative discussion, focusing specifically on Maritime Security and Maritime Domain Awareness covering the Indian Ocean, which would favourably impact on the countries in the Indian Ocean Region will be held on Februar y 8, (today) at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
Admiral R.K. Dhowan with Directors of NMF, Admiral Jayanath Colombage, Director, Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives at PF with Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke and Directors will be key resource personalities of the conference.
The Indian Ocean Region which is home to nearly one-third of worlds population is of high economic and strategic significance due to its location and traffic that passes through it. It is estimated that nearly half of worlds containers, one third of bulk cargo traffic and two thirds of oil shipments pass through the Indian Ocean. Also, there is a shift in global economic weight and influence from Atlantic and Pacific oceans to the Indo-Asia-Pacific.
The rise of China to number two position and India to number seven position in the world economic order is a clear example of this economic shift. With a growing population in India and already a large population in China, there will be a requirement for an increase in production and trade. Therefore, in the 21st century, the Indian Ocean has become the key ocean for energy, trade and food security.
Sri Lanka, although a small island state in the Southern tip of India, is seen as the epi-centre of the Indian Ocean. Due to the geographical proximity of the two countries and the vital location in the Indian Ocean, it is quite logical that India and Sri Lanka jointly take the leadership in ensuring maritime security.
There is a strong need to monitor the maritime domain with a view to detect and deter prospective threats, which can emanate from states or non-state actors. There may be a requirement to include other states such as Bangladesh, Mauritius and Seychelles in enhancing the MDA concept to cover the wider India Ocean.
There is rationale to engage in academic discourse on maritime security and MDA in the Indian Ocean, with a view to develop a policy framework for the attention of policy makers in both the countries.
Pathfinder Foundation together with the National Maritime Foundation, India has embarked on an initiative to conduct a first bilateral dialogue on India-Sri Lanka Maritime Security Cooperation in the Indian Ocean, Exploring Convergences. Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director, Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives at PF and BaranaWaidyatillake from Lakshman Kadiragamar Institute will be the speakers from Sri Lanka.
Vice Admiral Pradeep Chauhan, Director NMF and Capt. Gurpreet Khurana, Executive Director NMF will provide perspectives from India.

Plans to attract US$ 2.5 billion FDI by 2018 through foreign investment
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said yesterday that the government plans to attract US$ 2.5 billion FDI by 2018 through foreign investment projects, especially to bring in new investors in sectors such as export-oriented manufacturing and services.
This will generate much-needed employment opportunities in the country as well, he said.
He added that forex earnings will be increased by investing heavily on sectors such as IT, wellness tourism, processed food and component manufacturing as recommended by the national export strategy.
The Minister was addressing the gathering during the agreement signing ceremony between the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade of Sri Lanka and Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic on mutual cooperation held in Colombo yesterday.
The agreement will consist of areas including enhanced bilateral trade and economic relations, facilitate growth of bilateral investment and the identification of economic and investment opportunities in both countries. It also aims at promoting closer trade and industrial cooperation and facilitates networking activities between entrepreneurial entities in both countries.
Minister Samarawickrama said there is a continuous growth in exports from Sri Lanka to the Czech Republic since the last decade. It was amounting to around USD 55 million with a positive trade balance in 2017.
Our exports to the Czech Republic have been mainly confined to the sectors of rubber and rubber-based products, tea, coconut and coconut-based products and apparel.
Since the Czech Republic is a fast growing economy in the European Union, its potentials to become an important destination for our exports and the prospective benefits through an effective cooperation on investment towards our industrial development were especially taken into consideration before signing the agreement.
To strengthen cooperation in the economic sphere for mutual benefit, we welcome the signing of the agreement on mutual cooperation which would provide a platform to embark on an effective dialogue which leads to formulate and implement a sound framework of economic engagement through the establishment of a joint committee to promote bilateral trade, investment and economic relations. In formulating the actions framework under this agreement, special emphasis is to be given to encourage investment cooperation in economic sectors through non-traditional financial instruments, the Minister said.
The Minister added that Sri Lanka has potential to widen the exports of value-added tea to the Czech Republic. Since the Czech Republic has a developed automobile industry, Sri Lanka can explore the market opportunity in the Czech Republic for the rubber finished products such as tyres and other automobile parts. Sri Lanka also has a potential to export to the Czech Republic in other sectors such as electronic and electrical, chemical products, processed foods and seafood, he said.

President calls for new political culture
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday urged the public to have faith in him to establish a new political culture devoid of corruption, fraud and family rule, in the same way he voluntarily transferred significant Presidential powers to Parliament, as promised during the Presidential Election 2015.
The President who was speaking at the final rally of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party held at Polonnaruwa yesterday evening, pointed out that he gave up extensive Presidential powers amounting to a king and is fulfilling his promise for a corruption free country which he will also succeed at. The President emphasised that he would never allow any room for corrupt politicians to rule regardless of whether they are with or separate from the government.
He said that he walked out of the Rajapaksa regime in 2014 because he wanted to fight corruption, misappropriation and nepotism which ruled the country. I am not ready to work with corrupt politicians or save them. I will never shield them.
I have not stolen a cent in the last 50 years of my political career. The biggest challenges against developing that this country faces are a corrupt political system and politicians, who we must get rid of, the President said.
President Sirisena also remarked that he is not engaged in vengeful politics. He requested leaders of the previous regime to participate in a debate on the development initiatives initiated by the government for the last three years.
We are trying to elect honest and corrupt free politicians from the grass roots level to develop our villages. The UNP also has gone for the same theme which aims at developing the village, he said.
Yet former President Rajapaksa requests people to turn this election into an opportunity to topple the government, President Sirisena also pointed out. President Sirisena added that the present government is not selling off its resources and assets like the Rajapaksa regime did. He observed that there has been a rapid development process implemented in the last three years.
I will not allow this country to be separated, nor will I ever let anyone sell off this country. I promise to protect this country with my life, the President added.
President Sirisena also expressed his confidence that the SLFP would secure a great victory at the forthcoming Local Government Elections.
President Sirisena said the present government has achieved much progress in the reconciliation process.
He said a trilingual school will soon be established in Sri Lanka by investing Rs. 7.5 billion funded by the Indian Government. The President added that health sector, international relations, agriculture and other key sectors in the country are progressing steadily in sync with cultural and social developments.

The race for the runner-up berth ahead of knockout
The new season 2018, seems a lot more relentless than the last calm days of December 2017....so much has already happened in this current Dialog league and still more anticipation with the last few matches on the cards.
Kandy already own the trophy and can rotate players with the luxury of a job well done ..and with a minimum of traditional drama too.
Accepted they carry the best depth and quality both on the pitch and off the bench as well.
The clinical nature of their strategy has been untouchable this season, and envied by thousands.
The lions have roared and delivered as required ...enough proof last week when then played catch up rugby to beat Army from behind in the last quarter....and celebration all round, especially their diehard faithful, face paint and lion kit all inclusive.
The pride in yet another title echoed way beyond the Nittawela cauldron and huge inspiration for another 5 generations of school kids watching avidly from the stands and throughout the central district..... its a monumental achievement in that sense, and full credit to a grand committee for pulling it off.
But alas, that is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg in chilly Colombo The days have changed, its still pitch dark at 6am and jumper weather in the city by the sea ...mornings are visibly colder and till 6.30ish too dark to start jogging etc...The evening, thank the experts and greater beings upon Mount Olympus...is still longer and light enough by 7pm to be enjoyed by all rugby hearts island wide.
That iceberg, I hear you claim....indeed it is that battle for 2nd and 3rd in the league ...that is directly and hugely significant for the knockouts that loom larger than life itself.
The Dialog knockout is also Sri Lanka rugbys most treasured possession ...and none other than that famous bone of utter contention, kindly and generously gifted by Lady Clifford to separate the men from the boys in the middle.
During my playing days, the 80s and the 90s, the Clifford Cup was jealously guarded by the SLRFU within its close confines at Longdon Place for outright battle.
The stature of the tournament and prestige, reflected by the thousands that jam packed all venues irrespective of any creature comforts, and happily stood, rain or shine, to watch our Sri islanders run out to thunderous applause and massive cheering for the entire match.
The atmosphere, a shade more electric than the mind could handle.
Players were mobbed when they scored and passion for the code and after match social, pretty intense and highly regarded.
Amidst all this, a brand of running rugby and skills that had many swooning left, right and centre.
Havelocks, CR&FC, CH&FC, Kandy, commanding respect and adulation on an unimaginable level ....every weekend was huge and massively partisan. It divided friends, family, school, neighbours and even the local markets.
Shopping was an experience and plenty of gifts had the home team won and your try the clincher....rugby was simple, gloriously amateur, and driven by skill and passion to its core.
In 2018 the Clifford Cup will herald the knockout phase of Sri Lanka rugbys impressive and busy calendar, which includes...The league, the knockouts, the club 7s, the regional Asian 15s series, the Asian 7s circuit, the Super 7s here at home, the Commonwealth and Asian Games 7s plus the juniors Asian tours as well.
All told an intensive essay of blood and guts that leaves no room for soft thoughts and less performance based on luck.
The game is entirely professional and demands standards that must be matched both on and off the field....from training to ice baths, from oxygen tents to selectors on tour and everything in between the posts. Survival is the challenge!
Friday this week is February 2018 and in more ways the battle for 2nd and 3rd clearly the defining thoughts amongst all reasonable islanders contemplating this month of Independence...and Sri island rugby in all its Suntan colours
Who will it be ..Havies, the Sailors or Maitland boys showing sparkling finish over the last two weekends
CH vs CR at Longdon Place on Friday 9th 4pm.
Havelocks vs Kandy at Nittawela on Sunday 11th 4pm.
Both are mighty significant and a grand reflection of the battle lines to decide who will face the league champs in the knockouts...
Its an all or nothing theory based on fitness, performance, mind, skills and fundamental to all ...injuries to key players
This assurance is key to morale in the dressing room plus mind wellness and strength in the middle ...there is no greater luxury for a coach and management, than having your full squad fit and ready, injury managed and pride intact for the confrontation.
The psychology of knowledge is vital and most telling ...under pressure and victory at stake .....its too intense for casual thoughts and less belief.
News buzzing and heating the rugby wires this week has been a fab step up for the Maitland Crescent marauders signing Sri captain and ex Havelocks mainstay ..Sudarshan Muthutanthri. He was away in NZ playing for Auckland in the recent national 7s tournament.
Muthu is the best back row forward in Sri, has phenomenal workrate, is efficient both in attack and defence ...has been rated by the Japanese and gives CH a massive intravenous shot in their performance arm.
The endorphins will flow as long as those breakdowns are sorted and balls ripped for turnovers.
Muthu, Sasanka and in form tank Yoshita will add dimension and lethal finish to the biggest hearts from Maitland. Prospects for even more inspiration and fight in the CH corner just stepped up.
Skipper Rohitha will be most comfortable having his fellow Thomian forward joining the hard graft boiler house unit ..and some good memories from STC XVs season, which chi chi also captained.
Watch out for Muthus skill fitness and superior power at the graft work on the deck ...The reason he is hailed as the islands best ball dog by miles.
Island rugby is buzzing and the players great examples to the school kids watching ....at all levels.
Top marks to the papare.com network for keeping the rugby yards as intense around this partially green globe ...much credit to Ganeesha David, whose passion for the game and efficiency, is the next level ....and sets the papare roll out as a strong working unit.
Enjoy all of this and the league breathing its heaviest last quarter before the Clifford Cup grips our senses and rewires those expectations...its been the best so far, but only a small sample of the battles ahead ..Cheers cheers and calm and collected to the middle.
Its all to play for this intimidating month of 28.
Bula bula Sri Api!

Rattan Craft to intensify handicraft exports
Deepthi Wickremasinghe of Viveca Rattan Craft who had won the world by making and exporting new and modern products, is to intensify handicraft exports.
Sri Lanka is a fertile ground for handicraft artisans. It is no secret that the creations of their hands are invincible in the world.
But, the demand for such traditional creations is not everlasting. The needs of buyers change from time to time and country to country. In such a background, if the value of the product is not increased and does not evolve to suit the demands of the modern world, the attraction of the customers towards that product drops.
Deepthi Wickremasinghe, starting his life as a banker, left his profession to generate the inventor living in him. Interested in production research, he sought a new dimension to spread his business acumen.
Deepthi was eager to grasp an angle in rattan, bamboo, reed and banana fibre-related industry hitherto unseen by most craftsmen. Rattan products and house beautification field is high in quality and standard.
I left the bank and started to manufacture rattan-related furniture. All products were not of traditional standards but products of modern fashion, conforming to international standards. I exhibited those products at the Architect Exhibition in the year 1994. Surprisingly, most star-class hotels in Colombo invited me to provide my products to decorate their lounges.
Founder of Viveka Rattan Craft Deepthi Wickremasinghe made his first venture into the local market, but his target was the export market.
He sought the help of the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) in order to make his export export dream a reality.
I inquired from the Export Development Board whether there are opportunities for rattan products in the international market. The officials of the EDB edified me on how to enter the international market with my products.
 Furthermore, they gave me several opportunities that were not given to an apprentice entrepreneur. The tours to and exhibition opportunities in Sweden, the Netherlands and Japan are special among those opportunities. The Asia Expo Exhibition of Japan is one of the best opportunities that opened export opportunities in Japan for me.
Within a very short time, Deepthi succeeded in uplifting Viveca Rattan to a high position locally and at the international level as result of maintaining the quality and standards of his products optimally.
A group of German entrepreneurs investing in Viveca Rattan was a great opportunity to broaden the operations of his Company in the international market and an endorsement of his products from Germany.
Deepthi is well versed in facing the ups and downs of his Company with equanimity and restraint. When the German investors left the country due to the war situation and the market was collapsing in the face of local and global economic crises, he successfully faced those challenges.
Working to earn profits is the general nature of a businessman. But, I wanted to do something nobody else in Sri Lanka did.
That is one of the secrets of his success.
Buyers were under the deep-rooted impression that rattan products from Sri Lanka disintegrate and get attacked by weevils within a very short time.
Some said that the finish was not good enough. But, everybody accepted that the rattan products from countries such as India, China and Vietnam were of very high quality. I thought that, if the craftsmen in those countries are producing furniture of high quality, why could we not do the same. Truly, I changed the international and local attitude about the rattan products of our country.
Deepthi has secured several awards for rattan products of Viveca Rattan. But, he says the most valuable award surpassing all those awards has been presented to his Company by its buyers.
An Indian buyer who purchased our products at a trade exhibition highly valued them. He said, The products of your Company are of better quality than Indian products.
Presenting a traditional product with added value according to modern social necessities is an invaluable feature in Deepthis business.
Once, I got an order from a childrens hospital in Japan to produce rattan cots to hold infants. I knew that there were generally more chances of the child suffocating on milk by laying them on a flat surface in the cot after being fed. I created a cot with the ability to adjust and raise the part of the surface holding the waist part of the infants body, while providing them with soft comfort. We received a great demand for that product from Japanese mothers.
The experiments Deepthi conducted to promote environment-friendly products using indigenous raw material has to be valued greatly.
I produced the travelling bag used by foreigners visiting the hotels of Sri Lanka to carry their goods during their visits to the beach or even on tours and shopping sprees, by using palm and coconut leaves. It is very a popular products for tourists accommodated in the hotels of Sri Lanka.
Rattan is imported as a raw material for the products of Viveca Rattan, as the raw materials available in Sri Lanka are of low quality. But, because of the huge drain of foreign exchange caused by this, Deepthi expectation is to make his products utilizing locally available raw materials. We must be happy as a country for his experiments using environment-friendly raw materials such as Gallaha reeds, banana fibre and palm leaves (Thal Kola) proving to be successful.
The assistance rendered by State and Private Sectors are less for this industry. An entrepreneur like me would not have been generated, if not for the assistance given to me by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board.
I obtained all my overseas experience through the assistance given to me by the Export Development Board. I obtained publicity in my business by participating in trade exhibitions.
In conclusion, the final question was as a low level exporter, how did your bring fame to Sri Lanka in this field to the international standard. What is the secret of your success
Most of our entrepreneurs import as much overseas products as possible and market them in Sri Lanka. But, I wanted to produce and export a product capable of competing with the products of other countries of the world. Necessity and dedication are not enough to achieve that.
I did a surprising amount of research in this field, developed the quality of our products to suit lifestyles and fashions, needs of the modern world and human behavior patterns and added value. That is the secret of my success.

Sangakkara calls for Test pay minimum to stop T20 exodus
HONG KONG, Wednesday: Sri Lankan veteran Kumar Sangakkara has called for Test cricket to introduce a minimum match fee for all countries to stop young players ditching the long-form for lucrative Twenty20 leagues.
Sangakkara, the fifth-highest run scorer in the history of Test cricket, retired from the first-class game last year but has continued playing for domestic T20 franchises around the world, including in this weeks Hong Kong T20 Blitz.
The 40-year-old praised the shorter format for spreading the game's popularity to new markets but warned that without change Test cricket could face a battle to remain relevant for young players and fans.
"T20 is the ideal format to introduce -- you talk about the Americas, with China," Sangakkara told AFP on Wednesday.
"Since its inception it's been a huge pillar of strength for world cricket.
"But there are a few negatives ... a lot of young players taking up T20 instead of playing international cricket.
"There are various things that have been discussed, about parity of pay, especially when it comes to match fees for Test cricket.
"Shouldn't there be a blanket minimum pay for Test cricketers
"The top countries are being paid a certain Test match fee -- shouldn't that be reflected all throughout the Test-playing countries"
Currently, international match fees paid to cricketers from different Test nations vary wildly, with the sport's so-called "Big Three" -- India, England and Australia -- far ahead of the rest.
According to a survey last year by ESPN CricInfo, Australia's captain Steven Smith was due to earn $1,469,000 in 2017 while Zimbabwean skipper Graeme Cremer pocketed just $86,000.
Twenty20 competitions have sprung up around the world, from Australia's Big Bash League and India's IPL which stretch out over many weeks to smaller competitions in Hong Kong, Bangladesh, and the UAE which last just a few days.
TESTS 'THE PINNACLE'
Players from poorer nations can often earn more in the Twenty20 world than by representing their countries at Test level.
The MCC world cricket committee last month endorsed calls for wage reform at its annual meeting.
Fans as well as players need to be canvased on the changes required to keep Test cricket as the sport's pinnacle, including day-night and four-day Tests, said Sangakkara.
"We need to understand what Test cricket means to players and what it is to fans," he said.
"Relevance in sport is so important in terms of not just growing the sport but also sustaining it.
"I think international cricket is very strong still. For any player, I think the honour of representing their country be it in Test, one-dayers or T20 cricket, it's still the pinnacle of the game."
Sangakkara, who is appearing for Galaxy Gladiators Lantau in this weeks Hong Kong tournament, also praised the shorter format for extending his career.
"T20 is definitely the easiest format at my age to stay competitive in," said Sangakkara, who retired from the first-class game in September.
Sangakkara went out at the top with a remarkable final flourish for Surrey in the English county championship, finishing as the competition's top scorer with 1,491 runs at an average of 106.50.
"I'm definitely a has-been!" he joked.  AFP

Fitchs outlook for the banking sector is negative, based on its assessment of a difficult operating environment.
This is reflected in an increase in Non Performing Loans(NPLs) following a period of rapid credit growth and some capitalisation pressures.
Structural factors, such as governance standards, GDP per capita and levels of human development, are high compared with the B and BB medians and continue to provide support to the rating.
In the United Nations Human Development Index, Sri Lanka ranks in the 61st percentile compared with the B median of the 36th percentile.

Udayanga's money laundering bared
As police officers and senior prosecutors from the Attorney Generals Department race to finalise preparations to travel to Dubai and repatriate former Ambassador Udayanga Weeratunga to Sri Lanka, more information is coming to light about Weeratungas involvement in alleged money laundering into Sri Lanka.
Weeratunga, an accused in the 2006 MiG deal in which the Air Force was cheated into paying US$ 14.7 million into a shell company controlled by business associates of Weeratunga, was placed in immigration detention in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, February 4.
Immigration officers discovered that his passport had been invalidated for travel by the Department of Immigration and Emigration pursuant to a court order.
According to documents filed with the Supreme Court, an independent money laundering investigation conducted by the CID has revealed that Weeratunga has received wire transfers in a value in excess of US$ 4.1 million from companies and bank accounts including Cyprus, Panama, Russia, Latvia, Marshall Islands, Belize and the United Arab Emirates.
A CID affidavit said that investigators suspect that some of these entities do not engage in licit business activities (generally referred to as shell companies), and that the reasons given for these bank transfers included payments to him for software development, building materials, rent and for tea, while others gave no reasons for the transfer.
The investigating officer further affirmed that she believes that the bank accounts of Weeratunga contained proceeds of unlawful activities conducted by the former ambassador. Investigations by the CID and FCID have not revealed any involvement by Weeratunga in the fields of software development or building materials, nor any payments from Weeratunge to entities involved in software development or building materials, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation.
The FCID claims that Weeratunga was complicit in the forgery of the contract for the MiG deal, and that he conspired with individuals in Singapore and Ukraine to mislead the Air Force into paying US $14.7 million for goods and services, where the Ukrainian government supplier says they received only US$7 million.
The whereabouts of the remaining US$7.7 million are unknown, and are the subject of a wide ranging asset tracing and recovery investigation underway by both the CID and FCID.

It is the UNP government that made representations in Geneva and saved former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from being charged for war crimes, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing a public rally at Uyanwatta, Matara last evening.
The Government was not only successful at Geneva, but we were also able to regain the GSP plus status and also had the ban on fish exports to the EU revoked, the minister said
Unknown to you we have commenced the construction of a state of the art theatre and the Nilwala Recreational Park on the banks of the Nilwala River. This recreational park would be completed by 2019. We commenced work on the fourth stage of the Matara Water Project a few months ago under which we would be able to provide drinking water even to Beliatta.

Vote for UNP to strengthen economy-PM
A vote for the United National Party on February 10th will empower the government to strengthen the countrys economy and speedup development, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing the final rallies yesterday evening.
For the nation to move forward, the people should have freedom, while the nation should have a strong and stable economy. Today, the people have the freedom even to criticise the government, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
It is only when there is a stable economy that the government can commence new development projects. We are still repaying the debts passed on to us by the previous government, the Prime Minister said.
Matara is a district that thrived on an agricultural economy, mainly tea, rubber and cinnamon.But we intend to change this in the future and make Matara an industrial district. We plan to establish six Industrial Zones in the Hambantota and Moneragala Districts and two in the Matara District, namely Weligama and Kamburupitiya, the Premier said.
In future, Matara would be an industrial and not an agricultural district. We also plan to develop the tourism sector. We will be inviting investors to establish industries in the Matara district this year,the Prime Minister said.
It is this government that introduced the new electoral system under which elections have become extremely peaceful. It is our government that even approved the 25% female representation in Local Government bodies. Today, you have the opportunity to elect the candidate of your choice to represent your village at the Local Council. By establishing the Election Commission we have ensured that elections will always be free and fair, the Prime Minister said.
Minsters Mangala Samaraweera, Malik Samarawickrema,Member of Parliament Buddika Pathirana, Members of the Southern Provincial Council and United National Party Local Government candidates were present.

Appointed to lead Sri Lanka in T20I series v Bangladesh:
Wheel turns a full circle for Chandimal
The wheel has certainly turned a full circle with Dinesh Chandimal being handed Sri Lankas T20 captaincy for the two matches against Bangladesh to be played on February 15 and 18 at Dhaka and Sylhet.
Two years ago Chandimal was treated as an outcast being shoved out of the captaincy when he was the officially appointed leader of the Sri Lankan team that went onto to win the World T20 in Bangladesh.
Chandimal was dropped from the team because of poor form and when Sri Lanka won the final it was vice-captain Lasith Malinga who went onto accept the trophy and not Chandimal.
Two years down the line Chandimal finds himself entrusted with not only the countrys Test captaincy but also being asked to lead the ODI and the T20I teams as well, as Sri Lankas white ball captain Angelo Mathews is still nursing a hamstring injury and has been ruled out of the Bangladesh tour.
Chandimal last appeared in a T20 international more than a year ago.
Malinga who covered himself with glory is no longer within the radar of selection and there are doubts about him being selected into future national squads after failing to attract a bidder in the recently concluded IPL auction.
The 15-member squad announced yesterday comprises a mixture of youth and experience. Youth in the form of two young seam bowlers Asitha Fernando and Shehan Madushanka aged 20 and 22 and inexperienced spinners Jeffrey Vandersay and Amila Aponso. The experience comes from the recall of leg-spinning all-rounder Jeevan Mendis at the age of 35.
Mendis last experience for his country was three years ago in the World Cup match against Afghanistan at Dunedin where he figured in a match winning partnership of 58 with Thisara Perera with his contribution being nine not out.
However since then he has been a consistent performer with bat and ball for Tamil Union in domestic cricket and around the world in T20 cricket with a season of English cricket thrown in for Derbyshire last year for good measure.
Thisara Perera who led Sri Lanka in their last six T20 internationals has been overlooked for the captaincy although he is a member of the squad.
SRI LANKA T20 SQUAD: Dinesh Chandimal (captain), Upul Tharanga, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Perera, Thisara Perera, Asela Gunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella, Dasun Shanaka, Isuru Udana, Shehan Madushanka, Jeffrey Vandersay, Akila Dananjaya, Amila Aponso, Jeevan Mendis, Asitha Fernando.

Woman axes intruder to death during rape attempt
A woman living in the tenth village of the Galenbindunuwewa Police Division has axed a man to death in the early hours of yesterday morning, when he broke into her home in an attempt to rape her, Galenbindunuwewa Police said.
The deceased has been identified as a resident living in the ninth village of the same division; 38-year-old Yapa Mudiyanselage Tennison Kumara Ratnayake. The man was unmarried, police said.
The woman who attacked him has been identified as 54-year-old Hidda Devayalage Gedara Karunawathi.
Police have taken the woman into custody, along with her axe. They further reported that the woman had informed them that the man, who was drunk at the time, had broken into her home and attempted to rape her and thus, in self-defence, she had attacked him with the axe.
The inquiries into the deceased mans death were carried out by Anuradhapura Magistrate K. D. S. Harshana, who visited the scene of the crime. Postmortem investigations, in the meantime, have been directed to the Anuradhapura Judicial Medical Officer (JMO). The woman too, has been directed to the JMO to carry out tests to ascertain whether she was sexually assaulted or not. Investigations are continuing.
