Sri Lanka - German Training Institute in Killinochchi a boon for northern youth
The Sri Lanka - German Training Institute which is under construction in Killinochchi will strengthen the process for reconciliation in the country, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He was speaking at the Unity Day celebrations of the Federal Republic of German in Colombo.
Sri Lanka and Germany enjoy 62 years of bilateral ties.
It will be further strengthened with the establishment of the German funded training institute in Killinochchi, the minister said.
He said irrespective of religious differences, all youngsters will get the opportunity to overcome issues faced due to unemployment with the establishment of the training institute.
Samarasinghe said the Sri Lanka - German Training Institute at Katubedda was established in 1958.
"The second training institute that will be established in Killinochchi will enable the northern youth to enhance their technical education. It will also assist the development projects in the northern province," the minister said.
Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Sri Lanka Juergen Morhard was also present.

5 effective Tips for a younger-looking Smile
A smile is often the first thing you notice about a person. It lights up your face and, if you have a nice one, can make you more attractive. Some even think a nice smile can turn back the clock.
One 2011 study determined that people found smiling faces to be more attractive and youthful -- with some faces deemed up to three years younger when they had a smile on!
But what if you don't have a Hollywood megawatt grin Decades of chewing, grinding and sipping through your teeth can leave your smile a little lackluster. And receding gum lines, yellowing and shifting can make for an aging smile.
Luckily, there are plenty of little steps you can take to preserve and protect your smile.
1. Go sugarless: Dry mouth is a common complaint as we get older. There are hundreds of medications on the market that list dry mouth as a side effect - including those used for incontinence and blood pressure. These drugs cause our mouths to produce less saliva, causing discomfort and making swallowing more difficult. But less saliva is also bad news for your oral health as saliva is what helps prevent decay and infections in the mouth.
The NIH recommends chewing on sugarless gum or sucking (not biting) on sugarless candy to help keep the saliva flow going in your mouth. These are also a great alternative to sugary candy and drinks - such as juices and sodas - that create acids in the mouth which eat away at your precious tooth enamel. But just be careful, as sugar-free products can sometimes cause stomach upset.
2. Avoid stains: Discolored teeth are instantly aging. "As we get older, our teeth do get darker,"American Dental Association spokesman Richard Price told The Huffington Post. Price says that as we age, the internal part of the tooth begins to shrink, while the amount of dentin - which is yellowish - increases. As the enamel wears down, we see more and more of the dentin showing through.
To blame are our diets and lifestyle choices. Red wine, some carbonated drinks, coffee and teas can all cause surface stains. "Anything that will stain a carpet will stain your teeth," Price said.
But if you just can't resist your morning cuppa, try switching from black tea to green or herbal teas which are less likely to stain. And while you may be tempted to brush your teeth immediately afterwards, it's best to swish with water and then wait at least 30 minutes before you brush, so you don't damage your enamel.
3. Cut back on snacking: We know snacking can be bad for our waistline, but it's also not great for our oral health. Frequent snacking, like munching on those potato chips at your desk or sipping a can of cola, can keep the acid levels high in your mouth for an extended time as you snack throughout the day. Sugar is obviously found in junk foods, but also in things like bread and cereal. They produce acids which, in turn, contribute to a breakdown of your tooth enamel. Price also says to avoid hard candies, which are akin to "bathing your teeth in sugar," while you suck on them all day.
If you must snack, Price recommends snacking on things like celery sticks or cucumber slices, that won't linger on your teeth.
4. Whiten and brighten: As we age and our enamel thins out, we're bound to lose some of the pearliness of our teeth. Depending on which route you want to go and how much you want to spend, there are a variety of whitening products on the market which can help you get your teeth several shades whiter. Over-the-counter strips are a more economical option which you can do from the comfort of your home. You can also get custom-made whitening trays to fit your teeth with a trip to the dentist that usually have more potent whitening power. If you don't want to fuss with whitening at home, your dentist can do an in-office session as well, with options like laser whitening and bleaching. It's best to talk to your dentist before using any of these options, to discuss what's best for you. Treatments can sometimes cause sensitivity and gum irritation, so Price says you should always start a bleaching regimen under your dentist's supervision.
5. Fight inflammation: Food or bacteria around the tooth that enter your bloodstream can lead to inflammation. And that inflammation can contribute to chronic diseases in the body, such as high blood pressure and diabetes.
According to Price, anything that's good for your body is also good for your oral health. "Skin does two things: it keeps blood in and germs out. Gums are skin," he explains. "If you're brushing and your gums are inflamed, they're more apt to bleed. When they bleed, there's a hole in the skin for blood to get out and germs to get in."
Brushing and flossing properly - for at least two minutes - twice a day can help keep inflammation at bay. There are other foods that you can include in your diet that are also thought to keep inflammation at bay. Foods like fatty fish, which are rich in Omega-3s, beets, kale, tomatoes, blueberries and garlic are also known to help fight inflammation. Many spices, including turmeric, cinnamon and ginger, have also been known to help.

Call of the Coir
"Actually coconut tree is a "Kapruka" (Tree of Life) for me. My family and I depend on this. We make various products such as brooms, carpets, wall hangings and brushes and sell them at the village fair or take them from house to house and sell..."
His voice tells us the story of traditional coir community. The traditional coir industry has a long history of more than 100 years. Piyasena, 52, who hails from Ambalangoda is one of the thousands who make a living out of coir.
Coconut is highly valued and spoken of with great respect. More than as a source of food and medicine, it is recognized for its cultural significance and economic importance.
Fibre extracted from the outer layer of the coconut is known as coir fibre. It is used to manufacture various artistic and other useful products. Sri Lankan coconut coir and coir-based product manufacturers have been known well for centuries.
Nihal Mendis
Sunil Shantha from Akurala, Ambalangoda, who is a 65-year-old coir product manufacturer, said he started making brooms and carpets at the age of 15.
His father was a well-known carpet manufacturer in the area. Without the Government support, he said that it is difficult to sustain the industry.
Forty two-year-old Ranjan de Silva from Kandegoda said he started making coir products at the age of 12 and he learned the art of making carpets and brooms from his grandfather. He has been in the industry for the past 30 years, but unlike in the past they eke out to meet their daily expenses.
He remarked that the synthetic products have taken a toll on the coir industry as well as the environment. If the Government can control the importation of synthetic products, things will be a bit rosier, he said.
C. Nihal Mendis, a coconut mill owner from Kahawa, said that he manufactures products to the international market. But he could not export his products directly due to financial difficulties.
"I have all the machines required for manufacturing good products to the international market. But I export my products through a mediator. My coir mill has already provided employment opportunities for around 25 workers. But if I could start direct exporting I could provide job opportunities for more workers and also be able to bring good foreign exchange to the country. There is a huge demand for our coir products especially in countries such as UK and Australia," he said.
He said it was pathetic to say that not a single official of the Divisional Secretariat in his area or a Provincial Council takes interest in solving the issues of coir manufacturers.
He also urged local authorities to help coir products manufacturers financially to expand the industry. Since there is a significant drop in sales, some manufacturers do not get a proper monthly income.
"I have a highly advanced machine used for manufacturing geo textile and we export them. Geo textile is a blanket made out of coir fibre, widely used to prevent soil erosion. South Korea, US, Netherland, Germany and Spain are the main buyers of our geotextile products," he said.
According to the Export Development Board, Sri Lanka is the largest supplier of brown fibre to the world with annual exports of fibre of more than 100,000 mt. The country is also famous for its value added coir products such as coir twine, brushes, brooms, coir mats, rugs and geotextiles.
Sri Lanka also produces a range of rubberized coir-based horticulture products such as coir pots, baskets, basket liners, seed trays, hanging baskets, weed control mats and coir poles.
"Sri Lanka is world's largest exporter of coir fibre. Yet, Sri Lanka's coir industry is in urgent need for infrastructure upgrading for it to sustain its coir supremacy. New technology infusion to our coir sector can greatly enhance our coir demand in the competitive global marketplace." EDB spokesperson said.
The production of coir and associated products has flourished in the Southern coastal belt and in the districts of Kurunegala and Puttalam. Coir products are exported and used to make carpets, doormats and decorative items. Coir products can be found in every village market place since they are effective, inexpensive and highly utilitarian.
Industrial Development Board (IDB) has taken various measures to uplift country's coir industry. IDB also provides training programmes for industrialists and improves management skill of coir mill owners, according to its Deputy Director M G Bandula.
"We also provide financial assistance by introducing low interest loan schemes in cooperation with state banks. We annually organize various competitions such as best entrepreneur of the year to encourage those who engage in the industry," he elaborated.
He added that the coconut-based industries play a vital role in sustaining a viable economy at all levels. Production sector is the largest which comprises two sub sectors where the formal sector representing coconut based manufacturing industries for export markets, and informal sector representing mostly cottage based industries engaged in the manufacture of products and by products for the local market.
Meanwhile Galle district has long been one of the country's principle coir producing and processing area with around 20-30 coir mills ranging from large exporting firms to household producing and processing coir. Some have fully mechanized, but many units at cottage and household levels still operate with traditional producing methods or immediate technologies at best.
"People those who do it as a household business earn only about 100-150 rupees per day. Craftsmen manufacturing carpets, brooms and other handicrafts can earn around 200-250 rupees per day. Workers at the coir mills earn Rs 400 or 500 a day," he added.
National Crafts Council Assistant Director (Southern Province) K M G Kamal said that the National Crafts Council provides assistance for those who produce coir based artistic handicrafts by providing training and market opportunities for them.
"There are about 100 coir product manufacturers in the districts and we have registered them at the National Crafts Council. So the Crafts Council provides opportunities for them to sell their products at its island wide sales outlets and Laksala also provide opportunities for them to sell their products. We also organize exhibitions and trade fairs in every three months to promote these products and generate more and more market opportunities for these craftsmen. We also provide opportunities for them to exhibit their products at foreign exhibitions especially in India," he said.

Jake was a mentor to many, and his work will continue to inspire. He will be truly missed by those who knew him."

"If there are angels in heaven, they just got a little prettier," she continued in another post. "Because Jake is up there painting their faces... putting lashes on them..." Fellow actress Jenna also shared her sorrow at Jake's death. "I am absolutely devastated today by the passing of my dear friend @ByJakeBailey," she wrote. "The most loyal, beautiful soul in every way. I love you"

China makes cheating in examinations a crime
CHINA: Students trying to copy in examinations in China will face a jail term of up to seven years as the government has brought a new law making cheating a crime.
The new law, effective from November 1, will make cheating on major exams in China a crime punishable with a jail sentence. Parents involved will also be seriously punished, according to the law.
The amended criminal law, which will take effect from November 1, stipulates that those who aid in cheating will be sentenced to three to seven years in prison and face penalties, state-run China Radio International reported. The law also stipulates that people trying to impersonate during examinations will be detained by police. In the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, 14 cases related to exam violations were found in the national college entrance exam last July, including nine cases of cheating.
Previously, college students involved in exam-related fraud were only punished by their universities, through warning, disqualification of their degree or dismissal.
Every year, China mobilises its security forces in a big way to prevent copying specially in the nationwide entrance test Gaokao in which nearly 10 million students took part last year.
The entrance determines the future of education and job opportunities of high school students.
Last year, public security departments across the country have pressed in drones and exposed cases of producing, selling and using telecom instruments used for copying.
The Ministry of Education last year warned that cheating students would be stripped of the enrollment qualification for a period ranging from one to three years.

Doggy Halloween
The 25th Annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade took place on Saturday and pooches of all shapes and sizes, and even some of their owners, flaunted their cuteness and creativity. Over 250 dogs strolled down the catwalk in the center of the park to win Best in Show. The grand prize winner would receive an Apple Watch, which is a treat more for the owner instead of the dog, who had to be on display in a crazy costume for hundreds of New Yorkers.
There were costumes ranging from the modest store-bought vampire or pirate getup, to full-blown stroller displays and entire families taking part in group costumes of characters in famous films and books.

It seems her grandfather won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry! Yeah, we think she should be excused for just this time. As one Redditor commented, perhaps her punishment should be bringing her grandpa to class one day!

'Growing Up' and 'Settling Down' don't have to go Together
Gloria Steinem's fight for the equality and empowerment of women began decades ago, from her co-founding of the National Women's Political Caucus to her launch of the iconic Ms. Magazine, to her more recent honor of earning the Presidential Medal of Freedom. At 81, the feminist champion continues to travel the world, fighting for the rights of women -- and shows no signs of stopping.
Steinem's frequent travel actually began long before she became involved with women's rights. The self-described "vagabond child" spent years crisscrossing the country in the family trailer rather than attending school, as her parents considered travel to be an education. Eventually, however, Steinem rebelled against this idea.
"I, of course, wanted to be like other kids," Steinem tells Oprah during an interview for "SuperSoul Sunday." "I wanted to go to school like other kids."
As she matured, Steinem maintained this rejection of rootless wandering and instead began believing that she would someday stop and settle down. Then Steinem experienced yet another shift.
"I got rid of the myth that we're supposed to grow up and settle down -- that those two things go together," she says.
Steinem had instead realized that her own urge to settle down was far more than just the rejection of her parents' lifestyle.
"I thought I was rebelling against a traveling way of life, but really what was happening was I was finding my own and, also, something my father never did, which is making a home," she says. "My discovery is, really, that we all need both."

'Hello' Music Director explains why Adele uses Flip Phone
Since Adele released the music video for her new single, "Hello," on Friday, viewers around the internet have wondered: Why is she using a flip phone in 2015!!
Xavier Dolan, the director behind the video, took to Twitter to let us know: Xavier Dolan @XDolan: Iphones in movies make me uncomfortable. Like I'm shooting a commercial. Now get it over it. #flipflopfreakout pic.twitter.com/3vZgbJ7qwD
Uhh.................................hmm.
Dolan explained his stance further in an interview with People on Saturday.
"It's just not that big of a deal," he said. "It makes me uncomfortable filming iPhones because I feel like I'm shooting a commercial."
"Those things: iPhones, laptops, all those elements, to me, they bring me back to reality: That's not what you want," he continued. "You want to get out of your own life; you want to enter someone else's; you want to travel somewhere; you want to be told a story. I'm realizing maybe I've been more distracting than anything else with that flip phone, but it wasn't intentional!"
We're sticking with our interpretation that the song just takes place in 2007 or something.

'Hello' There - Adele's First Song in Three Years
Remember how Adele made you feel all the feels with every single song she ever wrote Well, she's done it again.
With her debut album, 19, in 2008 and then with her sophomore album, 21, in 2011, Adele sung her way into the hearts of people all around the world. Then she just disappeared.
Now she's back and greeting her fans with a new single, conveniently titled "Hello." The emotional black-and-white music video was directed by Canadian filmmaker/actor, Xavier Dolan.
Adele fans will not be disappointed with this heart wrenching ballad. Seriously, there have been so many times that the world needed the 27-year-old singer's impossibly powerful vocals and emotional lyrical dexterity.
While 21 was her last album, Adele did croon the theme song, Skyfall, for the 2012 James Bond movie of the same name. This hit even earned her an Oscar. "Hello," which was released early Friday morning, is the first single off her upcoming album 25, which comes out Nov. 20.
Adele wrote an open letter on Facebook recently about her new album. "My last record was a breakup record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record.
I'm making up with myself," she said. "Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did." It sounds like this could be her most poignant album yet, which is equal parts scary and exciting.
Adele announced the track list for 25 as well, with songs titled "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)," "When We Were Young," "Water Under the Bridge," "Love in the Dark" and "I Miss You."
It sounds like fans might never stop crying when listening to Adele's powerful, raw emotional music. Yahoo

Helping to focus and develop social skills: Classical Music
He began playing the classical guitar when he was just eight years old. It comes as no surprise then that he performed at the prestigious Carnegie Hall when he was just a teenager. Years later, Dr. Paul Cesarczyk arrived in Sri Lanka, not only to perform, but to teach eager, aspiring musicians. He is pleasantly soft spoken but direct with his students, and his music  you can sample some on YouTube - reflects similar nuances. We caught up with him for a moment after one of his workshops, a day before his concert at the Russian Cultural Center, for a rapid round of Q & A.
Q: Classical music is not a popular music genre today. Why would you say its still important
A: Classical music is actually a wonderful way to supplement standard education: there are notes that are written down, a methodology to it and it helps you develop skills. It develops focus, agility with your hands and if youre in a band, even your social skills.
Its something I believe can help with anything in your life.
Q: How do we revive classical music
A: There are several things we can do. For one, there is media coverage, like this interview, which can really help. Secondly, when high level artistes perform at concerts, so people see the value in the music. And also very importantly, through one-on-one private lessons like at my workshops.
Q: Tell us about how you came to learn to play the classical guitar, and about your personal relationship with music.
A: Music is kind of everything, you know  its how I earn my living, how I communicate with people, how I interrelate, through education.
I was eight years old when I started playing the classical guitar, my father taught me, and I was actually six years old when I played the piano.
Both my parents were musicians.
Q: Sri Lankas art and music scene seems to be coming into its own now. Beyond entertainment, do you feel music can play a social role
A: Definitely. Music is the ultimate social tool for reconciliation. It has a role to play in self diplomacy, and it reminds us that we are all interconnected  you and I might enjoy the same kind of music regardless of where we are from or our languages. And music does this better than images, because images require interpretation, but music goes directly into our emotions.
Q: During your stay, youve met members of the Guitar Association of Sri Lanka, and guitarists like Amaranath Ranatunga. Can you comment on the impression that Sri Lankas music scene has left on you
A: I respect and admire Amaranath Ranatunga very much. I believe he is doing something difficult (teaching classical guitar at the University of Performing and Visual Arts)  he is a flag-bearer for classical music. I think he has planted the roots here. It has only been three rushed days here so I cant really comment on the music scene, but I can say from my travels that Sri Lanka is extremely beautiful.
Q: Is there a key lesson you give your students who aspire to be classical musicians
A: Every student has their own potential, and everyone is at a different level. If there is a trademark of mine, it is this  I try to help students achieve their potential, I dont make them imitate me or someone else, but help them find their own potential.
Q: You have toured widely in Europe, Asia and America. What have you learnt, as an artist, from your experiences in all these countries
A: Everybody wants the same thing. And that is, to be encouraged, and find beauty in the arts. There are some things classical music doesnt do  it doesnt feed people, or provide shelter or things like that, but it can change peoples minds. Music doesnt change the world, but it changes people And its people who change the world. So thats whats wonderful about it.

How James Bond actors grandfather spied on the Nazis
UK: To James Bond fans, Q is the geeky genius responsible for the barely believable gadgets that help keep Daniel Craigs 007 alive. But for Ben Whishaw, the actor who plays the character, the role has a greater dash of realism.
In a tale to rival any Bond plot, it can be revealed that the actors paternal grandfather was a multilingual British spy, blessed with a photographic memory, who was planted inside the German army during the Second World War.
The story of why Whishaws grandfather, Jean Stellmacher, agreed to act as an undercover British agent, and how he came to adopt a new identity, were only revealed to the family by his wife, Olga, 50 years later, as her husband lay on his deathbed.
The couples exploits have been collected in a book, Piercing the Waves, by Stellmachers daughter, Ingrid, which will be published next year. In it, she also reveals her parents desperate efforts to enter Britain with no papers after the war ended, which culminated in an almost fatal attempt to row the 19 miles between France and Jersey in a stolen boat.
Every step of my grandparents story is remarkable, Whishaw told The Daily Telegraph. Including how they tried to get into this country.
Stellmacher was born in 1922 in Istanbul to a Russian mother and a German father. He was called up by the German army while at university in Istanbul. With no emotional connection to Germany, and after telling a tutor of his horror at the prospect of fighting for Hitler, he was introduced to a contact at the British Embassy who, it transpired, was attached to the intelligence services. Faced with the opportunity to acquire a mole within the German army, the British urged Stellmacher to obey the order to enlist, and instead to spy for them.
It is not clear where, or with which regiment, Stellmacher served, but the fact that he spoke seven languages suggests that he may have worked in some form of staff liaison role. He is thought to have been blessed with an eidetic memory - the ability to recall sights and sounds effortlessly - and it is said that he passed information to the British about plans for the German invasion of North Africa.
In 1942, he escaped across the German lines and turned himself over to the British in Cairo. He was subsequently assigned to the Intelligence Corps, but was then faced with the prospect of trying to assimilate while bearing an obviously German name.
His real name, and obviously mine, would be Stellmacher, said Whishaw. But he was no more going to be in the British Army with a German name at that time, than he was going to come to England with one after the war.
Why he chose with the name Whishaw is still a mystery - the family believes it may have been the surname of a senior officer - but Jean Vladimir Stellmacher became John Victor Whishaw. After the war ended, he was sent back to Britain and demobilised in 1947.

Lanka prepared to face El Nino weather effects
Disaster Management Centre Deputy Director Pradeep Koddippili today said officials at district level have already been educated in preparing themselves to face fluctuating climate patterns, such as, floods and drought.
Koddippili when asked whether Sri Lanka is now experiencing the effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon, he said that there is no sign that the present climatic disturbance is a result El Nino effects.
He said that officials dealing with natural calamities are well prepared to face the El Nino weather effects in the last quarter of the year. We have already prepared for the monsoon and boats have already been despatched to the districts in need, he said.
Atmospheric variations in the surface temperature in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean could cause an El Nino oscillation. Sri Lanka faced an El Nino oscillation in 1997.

Makeup Artist gives Disney Princesses a Gory Makeover
This exercise in makeup and imagination highlights domestic violence, societial expectations of women and beauty standards. Reflections on those important issues are reflected in the updated article.
Makeup artist Shonagh Scott re-imagined Disney princesses as the victims of their own tales, and we seriously can't get enough. Is it too late to change our Halloween costume
In what Scott calls her "Happily Never After" series, Ariel, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Elsa and Snow White each meet their demise in a most awesomely gruesome fashion.
First up is Ariel. Looks like Ursula finally had enough of the mermaid singing about "whatchamacallit's" and combing her hair with a fork. So, in Scott's vision, the red-headed beauty had her vocal chords removed by her enemy.
Then there is Snow White. The Evil Queen didn't just want to kill her competition, she wanted her face to melt off first. In the detail, you can see the poison from the apple working its way into Snow's veins and chemically burning her face. It's a different ending that puts a harsh light the standards of beauty to which we're all held.
Cinderella is by far our favorite: The heel of her glass slipper is poking out of her cheek. The story Shonagh came up to accompany this image is artful: "Cinders tripped down the stairs, face planted her shoe & impaled her face." It certainly puts a new spin on Cinderella's perfect night with Prince Charming that is not so graceful.
When it comes to Belle, the Beast couldn't keep his temper and lashed out, literally. This look casts Belle as a victim of domestic violence in a frightening role that imagines her life if she had not been able to tame the man who Disney made her consort. Unfortunately it is the more likely to be true ending to a story like hers.
Kudos to Shonagh on both her imagination and talent. Recasting these perfect princesses as fallible women who succumb to the darker aspects of their fairy tales is a captivating, brave and clearly gory exercise.
It takes them off their pedestals and recasts them as the mere mortals that most of us women are. We are both officially creeped out and mesmerized at the same time.

Not yet another trivial tactic: Address Nae
For a Sinhala film to be successful within this country it has to simply attract many filmgoers. Also it has to be made with a moderate budget. In a country that is smaller than a single state in India one cannot expect handsome revenue by making an epic film for Sri Lankan audiences.
There exist three kinds of filmmakers in this country. First is the breed of local filmmakers who feel the pulsation of natives and make films to a very local audience. While majority of them cater to masses some stick to making mainstream films that attract a special segment of viewers.
The third kind of local filmmakers who make art house movies do films to stand out in international film festivals more than for local audiences. However it is very unbecoming to see them wasting their talents on projecting sex let alone discrimination to minorities in their movies. An art house movie maker does not have to confine to these types of trivial tactics.
Benchmarking with the plots of French films that has sex in abundance is not an excuse. They could instead benchmark with various styles of movie making in the art house genre. Indian, Japanese let alone some Sinhala movies lined up to be shown at the international film fest in Colombo this year (IFFC2015) will be an eye opener for local art house filmmakers.
The art of catering to a very local market
Jackson Anthony is a director who makes films for a local audience. He made Juliet ge Bhoomikawa and Aba before his latest creation Address Nae. We can easily read his movie making temperament if we carefully read the three films of his. When Jackson made Juliet ge Bhoomikawa decades back critics tried to brand him as an art house movie maker.
When he came back decades after with Aba he was labeled as a filmmaker who harps on Patriotism. Now he has made a totally different one to the first two. How are we going to label him now
We have to accept the fact Jackson set a trend in the local cinema by making Aba. Since of making Aba up to this date local filmmakers are unable to break the barrier of making historic films. Many filmmakers did not identify the lucrative market for such films which has been there like an iceberg until Jackson made Aba. Eventually a gamut of films in this genere was made and many more are in the pipeline. Jackson must have read Matalan and Sandeshaya once again on his quest towards Aba project. He has been smart enough to foresee the magic and ability of this genre of films to contribute towards pumping Oxygen to a dying local film industry.
With Address Nae Jackson has brought to fore the magic that was in 70s decade films making us to identify him as a trend setter.
One would recall how filmgoers of the 70s decade enjoyed films that were rich with songs, comedy and action. An actor like Gamini Fonseka or Alexander Fernando could keep the viewers at the edge of their seats with their action sequences while Freddie Silva and Don Sirisena induced humour to these films. Vijeya Kumaratunga catered to lovers.
Address Nae too has all these ingredients. Action sequences of Jackson Anthony and Roshan Ravindra in the film is nothing second to what Gamini and Alexander did. Jackson as the director doesn't use cables and special effects to project fighters as superheroes and sticks to basics. That also is significant.
Jackson also gets Mahendra de Silva to portrait the greatest comedian of all times Charlie Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin himself portrayed Adolf Hitler in his silent movie The Great Dictator. Jackson writes the script opening doors for Mahendra to follow suit and in the process brings out the greatest performance by this world class actor.
The plot in Address Nae revolves around shanty dwellers. These people engage in all sorts of unlawful acts to make a living. Acting like beggars and fortune tellers and indulging in prostitution is part and parcel in the lifestyle of these people.
Music scores harmonizes with the story well. The Reggae style theme song is very appropriate for the film and blends with the storyline perfectly. Jackson uses Rohana Weerasinghe to compose the exact music that he needed for the film. Prof Sunil Ariyaratne did the same with Victor Ratnayake in Anupama and Sarungalae. A film is not an Opera and the film director should educate the music director of his limitations in the project. Jackson has done it well.
There are also major drawbacks in the film. Casting is poor and some artistes fail to project a credible performance. Some dialogues are directly taken from old films. One prostitute talks ill of a client who has been acting like an animal the previous day. We have heard the same dialogue in Soldaadu Unnahae from Malini Fonseka's voice decades back. The storyline has no focus thus the whole movie resorts to mere incidents. Hence we could only talk of direction and performances by the artistes. The blame again has to be put on the script.
Jackson directs Roshan Ravindra marvelously to bring out his acting prowess. Roshan Ravindra is geared with all capabilities to become an actor to reckon with.
His voice is a major strength that adds credibility to his acting. Thus filmmakers should make use of this actor.
Kamal Addaraarachchi does justice to his character. However the poor script does not allow him to add more credibility to the character. Thus he too becomes a mere performer. Jackson Anthony himself as Nasiwatte Hitler brings out a commendable performance.
All-in-all Address Nae is an original Sri Lankan film and no Indian actors are imitated by any of the artistes.
The script though poor too is original. Thus Address Nae becomes a very local film with the power to make revenue and set a new trend in local cinema.

Rod Stewart too 'busy being a rock star' for kids
Rod Stewart was too "busy being a rock star" to spend time with his children. The 'Maggie May' hitmaker admits he was unable to pen tracks about his kids 20 years ago because he was "writing about dirty weekends" but says now he's older, he's happy to make his heart an "open book".
He shared: "Twenty years ago, I couldn't have written a song about putting my son to bed. I was so busy being a rock star writing about dirty weekends that it wouldn't have felt right.
"Now I'm of the age where I can sing about whatever I want. I suppose the older you get, the more your heart becomes an open book."
And the 70-year-old rocker also opened up about family life with his third wife Penny Lancaster and their children Aiden (4) and Alastair (9).
He told The Sun newspaper: "Well, actually it drives me up the wall sometimes. The four-year-old has got the devil in his system. Probably because he's seen Spiderman, he climbs up everywhere. A year ago he was dressing up as Mary Poppins and if I show him pictures of that now, he gets so embarrassed.
"I feel sorry for Penny sometimes. Last night, I was really stroppy, my elder son was stroppy, the little one was stroppy and she was just a jolly person trying to make everybody happy.
"It's funny how kids take it out on their mums. My ten-year-old shouts at his mum and she does everything for him. She blew up his Fifa 16 on the iPad because it's American and she tried to plug it in here in England." Music News

South Asia quake death toll tops 300
AFGHANISTAN: The death toll from the earthquake that shook parts of South Asia has risen above 300.
The number of dead in northwestern Pakistan has risen to 229, disaster management officials said, bringing the overall toll for Pakistan, Afghanistan and India to 306.
In one northern Afghan town, 12 schoolgirls died in a stampede as they tried to evacuate their school during the quake.
The girls, between 10 and 15 years old, were crushed in their Taluqan city school's stairwell, between the first and second floors, local police spokesman Abdul Khalil Asir said.
Monday's magnitude-7.5 earthquake was similar to a magnitude-7.6 quake in nearby Kashmir that killed more than 70,000 in 2005. But unlike the quake 10 years ago, this one happened deep inside the Earth, some 223 kilometres (139 miles) below the surface.
Earthquakes at this depth typically cause less damage on the surface than shallower quakes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The epicenter of the earthquake, near the Afghan city of Jarm, is a rural and sparsely populated area. Many people in this region live in mud brick buildings prone to collapsing. The mountainous region and poor infrastructure make assessing the aftermath difficult.
First responders scrambled to the affected areas. Many of the villages most violently shaken by the quake are not easily accessible. Additional reports of fatalities and damage are expected to continue trickling in.
Afghan broadcaster Tolo TV showed images of collapsed structures. Photos showed collapsed houses and buildings turned to rubble.
According to Wais Ahmad Barmak, Afghan state minister for disaster management affairs, about 4,000 houses were either severely damaged or destroyed.
The USGS issued an orange alert on the quake.
Significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response, the USGS said.

Taliban vow to help Afghanistan after deadly quake
AFGHANISTAN: The Taliban Tuesday urged charity organisations not to hold back in delivering aid to Afghan victims of a devastating earthquake, saying militants in the affected areas were ordered to provide complete help.
Rescuers are battling to access some of the worst-affected areas across multiple provinces that are effectively under militant control, a huge challenge to any official aid efforts.
But the Taliban on Tuesday promised to pave access for aid organisations. The Islamic Emirate (Taliban) calls on... charitable organisations to not hold back in providing shelter, food and medical supplies to the victims of this earthquake, the group said on its website.
It similarly orders its Mujahideen in the affected areas to lend their complete help to the victims and facilitate those giving charity to the needy.

US govt. seeks a few good hackers for cybersecurity
US: Alejandro Mayorkas, a high-ranking Department of Homeland Security official, opened a speech over the summer in Las Vegas before hundreds of hackers with a dare.
I challenge you all to make my phone ring during my remarks, he said, brandishing a flip phone the size of a soda bottle. Take a shot, he said, urging the crowd to hack his phone. Then he sweetened the deal: There would be a government job for anyone who succeeded.
The conference's volunteer organizers, known as goons, soon interrupted Mayorkas for a long-standing tradition at the cybersecurity convention DEF CON: First-time speakers take a shot of whiskey on stage.
That was my first of the day, by the way, Mayorkas said after downing the Jack Daniels, but it won't be my last.
Mayorkas was just one of a fleet of federal officials who attended Black Hat and DEF CON this year. The two gatherings have grown into annual pilgrimages for security researchers, hackers and hangers-on. Their mission Enlist hackers to protect the homeland.
Black Hat attracts cybersecurity companies that are eager to mingle with government officials and secure government work. The DEF CON crowd skews toward the Hollywood hacker stereotypes of geeks in casual or slightly punk attire. But people at both events share a passion for tearing apart computer code to figure out how to make systems safer.
And they just might be the government's best hope as cyberthreats, including financially motivated hacks and digital espionage, continue to increase.
That's why Mayorkas was just one of many government officials to descend on Las Vegas over the summer. Elsewhere at the conferences, a Justice Department official tried to calm fears about a controversial computer crimes law that security researchers often say criminalizes their work. And Federal Trade Commission representatives were seeking hackers to help find technical threats to consumers.
They are all struggling with a cybersecurity recruitment gap: Federal agencies trying to beef up their cyber skills are battling everyone from tech giants such as Google and Microsoft to Nike for talent - and all too often losing.
Even when trying to recruit for its most elite roles, the federal government is striking out. In July, the Justice Department's inspector general reported that the FBI's flagship cybersecurity program had not filled 52 of the 134 computer scientist jobs authorized under the Justice Department's Next Generation Cyber Initiative, a 2012 effort to predict and prevent cyberattacks.
The audit cited the agency's relatively low salaries and extensive background checks as roadblocks. One agency official told auditors that the FBI loses a significant number of people to its drug policies, namely that applicants must not have used marijuana in the previous three years and other illegal drugs in the past 10.
In some hacking circles, that's a dealbreaker.
I got weird looks from some computer security friends in the Bay Area when I turned down pot because, among other reasons, I was considering jobs in the government, said Jonathan Mayer, a Stanford computer scientist and lawyer who recently relocated to Washington.
FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the pot problem during a 2014 speaking engagement, according to the Wall Street Journal. I have to hire a great workforce to compete with those cyber criminals, and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview, he said, adding that the agency was grappling with the question of its evolving talent pool.
The background check can be particularly drawn-out for those who self-identify as hackers, said Peiter Zatko - better known by his online handle Mudge - who worked at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's cybersecurity research division for three years starting in 2010 and later at Google. Because I came from an area that included the word hacker, I had a huge target on my back, he said, citing his extensive background check.
It took more than five years to receive a security clearance, Zatko said.
And then there is the issue of pay. Quite frankly, we're not going to be able to match some of the private-sector opportunities financially, Mayorkas said in an interview.

Warning to pharmacies for selling drugs at higher prices
A flying squad will be set up to detect private pharmacies selling drugs at higher prices violating the agreement made in connection with the prices of drugs, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. He expressed those views during a meeting held with around 100 district pharmacy organizations representatives 18 districts. The meeting held in Ratnapura recently.
According to Minister Senaratne all should pay attention towards the contents in the rules and regulations and not in the drug policy. There are about 3,000 pharmacies country wide but only around 1,000 pharmacists are there.

The minister said the punishment that should be given to the pharmacies which violate the policy will be decided soon. The first and main objective of drafting the rules and regulations is lowering the prices of drugs. An agreement had been made with private pharmacies about the percentage of profit they earn and it is 85 percent.

Minister Senaratne stressed that the people feel the value of the policy by the low price and the doctors feel the value of the policy by the high quality of drugs. Once the drug quality test laboratory set up in Sri Lanka prescribing drugs in trade names will be totally banned. It will take about two years to do this. We cannot close down 2000 pharmacies which cater to people who do not have a pharmacy to buy drugs. (Govt.Info)
