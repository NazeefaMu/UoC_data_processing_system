Afghanistan spinners, the best in the world  Sarfraz Ahmed
ABU DHABI, Saturday: Sarfraz Ahmed, the Pakistan captain, had praise for the Afghanistan side, and admitted his side had been shaken on their way to a nervy three-wicket last-over win in their Super Four match of the Asia Cup.
We were shaken, Ahmed said. The way Imam, Babar and Shoaib played towards the end was fantastic, but to chase 250 in these conditions against the Afghanistan spinners who I think are the best in the world, you have to bat really well.
We get confidence from the way we won, added Ahmed. As you know, the team has improved a lot on its fielding over the last few years, but today we didnt show that. Regardless, the team has been motivated by this performance.
Malik, who has enjoyed a good run in Asia Cup tournaments through the years, stuck around even as wickets fell around him.
Being a senior player, when youve played enough cricket, you know when you already have a start, the goal is to bat till the 50th over, he said. At one point the required rate was almost 10 but I kept telling myself to bat till the end because we had batsmen to hit the big shots later.

Attempt to discredit Government - Minister
Women's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said the news that circulated a few days ago about a couple who lived for some days consuming only Murunga leaves as they did not have anything to eat, is a fabricated news aiming to discredit the Government.
Minister Bandara said so while addressing the media after visiting the couple's house.
It has now been revealed that the couple had received all welfare benefits including the Samudhi given by the government and that the story was an attempt to discredit the government.
The minister visited the couple on the advice of President Maithripala Sirisena, who paid special attention to this issue.
She told the media that measures will be taken to construct a new house for the couple by the Government.

CEB to distribute 10 mn LED bulbs to save power
The CEB plans to purchase 10 million LED bulbs through an open international tender and provide them to consumers at a subsidised price to encourage them to use electricity sparingly, Power and Rrenewable Energy Minister D. Ranjith Siyambalapitya said.
Using electricity sparingly is equally important as generating it, the Minister said. Today more than two million people use ordinary electricity bulbs for lighting as they cannot afford the more expensive LED bulbs.
The Minister was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the Rupavahini Volleyball Tournament at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium, Colombo, on Saturday.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said in the future they hoped to provide these LED bulbs to consumer houses using less than 90 units of electricity per month, through the meter readers. One could save 60 percent of electricity by using an LED bulb instead of a normal bulb.
According to projections, by using these 10 million LED bulbs during peak hours, they hoped to save 300 megawatts of electricity, which is almost equal to installing an additional power plant, the Minister said.

China comes out ahead  in Vatican deal
CHINA: The landmark deal between China and the Vatican is a win for Beijing, giving official recognition to bishops appointed by the government despite a crackdown on religion, and potentially softening the ground for full diplomatic relations after 67 years of estrangement, analysts said.
The two sides signed a provisional agreement on Saturday on who gets to name senior churchmen, an issue that has bedevilled ties for decades, and China quickly said it hoped for an improvement in relations.
That is bound to mean consequences for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province, and which has watched helplessly in recent years as its giant neighbour has picked off its few remaining diplomatic partners.
With its outsized international influence, the Vatican is the most important of Taiwans 17 remaining friends, and its only European partner.
The agreement on bishops makes no mention of diplomatic relations, but some see the writing on the wall.
Its difficult not to see this as the first step towards a switch, said Jonathan Sullivan, a China expert at the University of Nottingham.
Its not on the cards yet, but Beijing has made no secret of its desire to poach Taiwans most important remaining ally. Ying Fuk-tsang, a professor of divinity at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Beijing is bound to use any new leverage to seek the Holy Sees recognition.
The current Taiwan government has taken a toughened line against Beijing, which knows that turning the Vatican would be a major blow to Taiwans diplomacy, Ying said.
Beijing and the Vatican severed ties in 1951, two years after the Communist Party seized power.
The party tolerates no alternative power centres and a decades-long impasse has played out over who presides over the now roughly 12 million-strong Catholic faithful -- communist-approved prelates or those who preach to underground pro-Rome churches.
Since taking office in 2013, Pope Francis has sought to improve ties with China.
As part of the deal, the pope recognised seven Beijing-appointed bishops. No other details were disclosed.
The apparent Vatican concession is striking because it comes as China is waging a broad religious crackdown.
President Xi Jinping has moved aggressively to tighten the Communist Partys grip on all aspects of society, including worship.
Top leaders have recently called for the Sinicisation of religion, code for greater party control.
In Chinas remote western Xinjiang region, UN estimates say one million members of Muslim minorities are held in internment camps where rights groups say they face communist indoctrination.
Christian worshippers and clergy in central China told AFP recently that illegal churches were being raided or bulldozed, and religious materials confiscated.
Churches have been required to display the national flag while removing religious imagery from public-facing spaces, and paperwork seen by AFP shows clergy are being pressured to divulge personal information about parishioners.
Underground clergy told AFP they remain fearful because the agreement does not mention safeguards for them or their followers, with one priest saying worshippers doubt the sincerity of the government.
An official priest in close contact with the underground community said that while the deal solves the problem of the seven bishops, it says nothing about how future bishops will be appointed.
And it cannot solve the real problem and situation of the church.
Chinas religious crackdown has drawn growing overseas criticism, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday deploring awful abuses in Xinjiang.
He added that Christians were suffering too as authorities are closing churches, burning Bibles or forcing them to renounce their faith. But Francesco Sisci, an Italian Sinologist at Chinas Renmin University, said a rapprochement could provide the Vatican with now-scarce leverage in China because it will now get at least some recognition from Beijing.
Its not a football match, its not a zero-sum game. Both sides hopefully gained a lot in this, Sisci said.
It is true that dozens of churches are being torn down, at least partially. But thousands more are standing or being built. It will be not be easy, but if the Vatican doesnt try to help now, when should it

Currency devaluation not a  phenomenon peculiar to SL - Hakeem
The currency depreciation in the face of the US Dollar is not a phenomenon particular to Sri Lanka, but common in many countries in South and East Asia. Therefore, it is very unfair to interpret this tendency as a fault of the Government, SLMC Leader and City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
He said the currency depreciation rate is much higher in countries such as, India and Indonesia than in Sri Lanka. Minister Hakeem said so after participating in a ceremony held at the Badi-ud-Din Mahamud Vidyalaya in Kandy on September 22.
Minister Hakeem said the only way we could arrest this tendency is by increasing foreign investments and boosting exports. He said increased purchase of imported goods may also jack up prices.
As such, there was no cause for anxiety thinking that the rupee depreciation was a problem endemic to our country only, Minister Hakeem said.
He said the economic polices of U.S. President Donald Trump had caused this situation. Americas economic war with China and the European Union had caused the currency depreciation in several countries, Minister Hakeem said.
He said the present IGP is an efficient and talented officer but the manner in which he expressed his ideas had caused some problems.
A government should bring in a new Constitution within its first year in office. Prolonging it had caused objections. In this situation no one could expect the 20th Amendment to succeed, he said.

Dhamma and Gender Equality
The most significant happening on Binara Poya day was the admission of females to the sasana or founding of Bhikkuni Order. Maha Prajapati Gotamis determination and commitment in making numerous requests to Buddha for the admission of female candidates to the order made it possible. Prajapati Gotami, a role model for women-folk; was Queen Mahamayas [Buddhas mother] sister. The Buddha was residing at Kapilavasthus Nigrodharamaya when she approached him pleading his consent for women to enter the sasana. They say, the Buddha after turning down the request three times, finally allowed the admission to the order on conditions It was granted on a Binara full moon Day. Among prejudiced religious practices, Buddhism can definitely claim to have the least prejudices against women.
Bhikkhuni order introduced to Sri Lanka by Theri Sanghamitta during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa flourished in the island for about 13 centuries and disappeared after the Chola invasion in the 11th century. As described in the in the great chronicle Dipawansa, Bhikkhuni order established became advantageous to the Sasana. Hindu influence changed the practice of Buddhism during the Polonnaruwa era that followed five decades of Chola rule where anti-feminism and caste system was featured in sasana that ended with the expulsion of Cholas by Wijayabahu. Such influences affected the Buddhist thought resulting in the denunciation of any attempt to revive the Bhikkhuni order.
In the Cullavagga of the Theravada Vinaya, for the proper functioning of the Buddha sasana, it is an essential requirement to have all four types of assemblies of disciples, [Bikkhu, Bhikkhuni, Upasaka, Upasika] one of which is bhikkhunis.
Buddha and Bimbadevi
The emotional meeting between the Buddha and Bimbadevi took place at the palace in Kimbulwatt-pura, 26 centuries ago when the king sent a message to Bimbavo, for her to reply in the negative,
Surely, if I am worthy of any affection, Sidhuhatt will come and see me.
The Buddha having made inquiries, and being told that she had declined to appear, invited his two chief disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana to accompany him to her chambers, demonstrating his modest qualities and courteous regard for the lady, his former partner in sansara advised others, Bimbadevi not having seen me for a long time, she is extremely distressed, unless you allow its natural course her heart will slash. In the event she touches the Tathagata [Buddha], please do not attempt to obstruct her
She was relaxing in her abode dressed in uncaring clothes, and head shaved. As the Buddha entered, like a spilling over bowl she was unable to hold her high regard. For a moment she failed to remember that he is the lord of the world, Yasodhara held him by his feet and sobbed desperately. However, realizing the kings presence, she rose up and took a seat.
The principle of Reciprocity and Non-dominance
In Buddhism as a general rule, the relation between the genders is governed by the principle of reciprocity and non-dominance.

What matters being a woman, if with mind firmly set grows in the knowledge of the right law with insight
-their gatha: Stanza voiced by Theri Soma
Sumedha and Samitha in Paduma Jataka
In many traditional past lives of the Buddha[Jataka], Siduhatt and Yasodharavo lived as husband and wife. The accord began with Paduma Jataka where Sumedha thapasa, a young Brahmin acknowledged as a future Buddha by the then Dipankara Buddha, while waiting for Dipankara Buddha to arrive in the city of Paduma, he being unsuccessful in buying flowers as offering for the enlightened one, as the king had already taken all the flowers, notices a girl carrying some lotuses in her hand and offers her money with the intention of buying at least one of the flowers. It ended with love-at-first-sight for both the young hearts. Samitha the girl, offered five of the flowers free to the boy, but on condition that he weds her and would continue to do so in all future lives as well.
The concord continued as they wished; she had been a great strength to him with her devotion, her purity, and had been precious to him until he aimed at Buddhahood. This resulted in countless merits. Also known by other names, Bajjacatchayana, Rahula matha, Bimbavo her sorrow in her last birth was unspeakable, but her dignified approach miraculously transformed all worries into divine contentment. The blessed one recognized her patience and sacrifice that facilitated his achievement not only in this birth but in earlier births too. Buddha on this occasion said, I will acclaim the honourable qualities of Bimbavo in her own house by linking the Cannda-Kinnara Jataka, a touching account of the couple in one of their preceding births, born in the confines of Himalayan range as fairies.
The Buddhas invitation for women to contribute to the sasana by making them qualified to enter the Bhikkuni Sangha  with ample openings for public life had greatly enhanced the status of women. A number of books have been authored in Islamic and Hindu societies on the changing standing of women, but strangely little in BuddhismMiss I.B. Horner, Pali scholar in 1930 wrote a book titled, Women under Primitive Buddhism. Buddhas teachings undeniably have the least prejudiced approach against women. Their importance to society was recognized very much enhancing their rank among men.
Myth of Garudhammas
The Buddha's decision in sanctioning the establishment of an Order for women, in the fifth year after his enlightenment was blemished by the inclusion of garudhammas on them. Who incorporated them in the Bhikkhuni Vinaya rules They are nothing but attachments by male chauvinists.
The rules blatantly subordinate Bhikkhunis to Bhikkhus. Rule four recognized the bullying to which Bhikkhunis would be exposed to. Concessions to male superiority are seen in laws 1 and 8. Rule 1 has been the most irritating in practical terms and obviously discomforting in societies where the salutation observance was strict.
Why should a Bhikkhuni always pay reverence to a Bhikkhu however junior the latter may have been Chronicle says Theri Prajpati Gotami, despite Ananda Theras support was unsuccessful seeking immunity from this rule. Obviously, they are not backed by Buddhas initiative or idea.
1. Bhikkhus to have precedence over Bhikkhunis in matters of salutation, irrespective of any other considerations like age and seniority.
2. Bhikkhunis could not observe the annual vassana in a district where there were no Bhikkhus.
3. Bhikkhus set the dates for Bhikkhuni Uposatha ceremonies.
4. Confessing lapses by Bhikkhunis had to done before the assembly of both Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis.
5. Judicial processes in case of Bhikkhunis had to be undertaken by both the Sanghas.
6. Upasampada initiation of Bhikkhunis to be given by the Bhikkhu Sangha as well.
7. A Bhikkhuni should never abuse a Bhikkhu.
8. Bhikkhus can admonish Bhikkhunis, but not vice versa.
Nuns ordinations give women the chance to choose out of an often harsh male domination system and take part in almost equal partnership with the male monks. It meant that the Sangha, both men and women, that laymen take refuge would now include of both monks and nuns.
The Buddha took precautions like a parent, to protect Bhikkhunis from the dangers of the wandering ascetic lifestyle; the same opportunities on the trail of practice. The Buddha thereby built protective measures into the monastic rules, the Patimokksha, in order to secure the nuns.

Dollar appreciation : PM SAYS WILL TIDE OVER CRISIS
As much as the government had moved forward after facing and surmounting several crises in the past, it will take suitable steps to overcome the crisis faced due to the appreciation of the US Dollar.
The appreciation of the US Dollar has adversely affected both the countrys economy and the home economy and the government has already initiated necessary action to face this crisis successfully, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this observations addressing a meeting held at the Nattandiya Lourdes Maha Vidyalaya after opening the schools resource centre on September 22.
The Prime Minister said whatever economic difficulties the government faced, it had increased financial allocations to develop education in tune with new world trends. Moreover, several programmes including the Gamperaliya, Grama Shakthi and Enterprise Sri Lanka had been launched to develop the rural sector.
The governments endeavour was to allocate 6 percent of GDP towards education. It ought to reach that target notwithstanding economic difficulties faced by it, the Prime Minister said.
Although there is a global economic crisis today, the government would not and had no intention whatsoever to curtail funds allocated for education and health. Although the global economic crisis was a hot topic of discussion, we should find out the actual reasons which caused it, the Premier said.
In 2008, the US economy totally crashed causing a depreciation of the US Dollar.
As such investors in the US, including those in the US share market withdrew their investments to their home countries to gain more dividends. Now, the situation had made an about turn.
Today, US industrial production has increased causing rapid development.
The relief measures granted to US citizens by President Donald Trump had enabled them to purchase more goods and increased the profits of US companies. The US Federal Reserve which purchased money at low interest has increased interest rates twice, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
As a result, there was a rush among businessmen in other countries to invest in the US share market and other US enterprises. This had decreased dollar reserves in countries such as ours. When dollar reserves decreased, our currency depreciated. We are today faced with this crisis situation, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said the Euro depreciated by 1.3 percent, Sterling Pound by 1.3 percent, Australian Dollar has depreciated by 6.5 percent, Indonesian Rupiah by 6.8 percent, Korean Wong by 4.5 percent, Philippine Peso by 7.5 percent, the Singaporean Dollar and Malaysian Ringgit by 1.6 percent and the Indian rupee by 11 percent.
This was a world economic crisis. We will bravely face it without abandoning or running away from it, the Prime Minister said.
This situation would impact on oil purchases too. Fuel prices had increased owing to this. We are not able to import fuel from either Iran or Russia because the US had imposed sanctions on them. As such, prices would further escalate due to limited oil resources available,  the Prime Minister said.
The Premier said when the government assumed office, the price of a barrel of oil was 45 US dollars. Later it increased to 80 US dollars and now it has deceased to 77.50 US Dollars. Rise in the price of fuel impacted on the price of goods.
Although the actual price of certain goods had not increased, the increased transport costs had added to the market price of goods. All countries in the world had faced this plight except the US.
He said 443 million US Dollars had been withdrawn from our market including the share market. As a solution to this problem, countries like Argentina, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey had increased Central Bank interest rates. If we followed suit interest rates on business loans had to be increased. As such, the government had to give much thought before taking this measure.
The Prime Minister said the Sri Lankan rupee had depreciated by 9 percent. In this situation importers were asking for more dollar allocations to import goods. Exporters dont bring the dollars earned to the country instantly.
They keep those earned dollars abroad for the maximum possible period to earn more interest. The government had to cope with this additional problem too.
Amidst this situation, the country had to face a new development caused by the Customs duty war between the US and China and Canada and the US. This increased the prices of goods in the world market.
Added to this, Japan increased customs duties against US products and the US did the same to Japanese goods. This also caused the increase in price of goods, the Premier said.
This situation was expected to continue for about a month. The government was now busy discussing measures to meet this situation successfully. They had held discussions about this with the Finance Minister and the IMF because they had to find 4000 million US Dollars to repay the foreign debt and interest by next year. Whatever the situation, the government would never allow the economy to crash, the Prime Minister said.
This situation had brought both benefits and losses. Although the increase in prices of goods was a loss, this had benefited exports and the tourism industry, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister also opened a resource centre at the Marawila Sri Gunaratana Vidyalaya and Nattandya Wahalapitiya Maha Vidyalaya and also presented the Act of Appointment to Ven. Haldanudana Pannasooma Nayaka Thera at a ceremony held at the Sri Pusbparamaya, Pilakatumulla, Nattandiya

Drought in Anuradhapura continues
The drinking water crisis in Anuradhapura will worsen if the region does not receive sufficient rainfalls. The Mahaweli Water Management Committee has not supplied water to Nuwarawewa so far.
Divisional Water Supply Engineer Hashitha Witanage said the Nuwarawewa water level had dropped drastically. He said 16,000 cubic meters of water were normally taken per day from the tank and the volume has now come down to 5,000 cubic meters. The tank received 3,000 acre-feet of Mahaweli water two weeks ago via the Kalawewa and Nachchaduwa.
''The Thuruwila tank provides 19,000 cubic meters daily. That is enough to cater to stage one and two towns. The Tissawewa received 300 acre feet of Mahaweli water which was marginally sufficient for the area including the sacred city zone. Now the available water is enough only for two weeks, Withanage said.
Anuradhapura people request responsible parties to temporary stop large-scale ceremonies to preserve the water for drinking.

Extended voting at Maldives election
Polling booths in the Maldives closed Sunday after three hours of extended voting.
An election official said voting was extended due to technical glitches involving electronic voter registers, as well as a heavy voter turnout.
More than 260,000 of the 400,000 citizens of the Maldives were eligible to vote at about 400 polling stations across the islands that comprise the Indian Ocean archipelago.
Incumbent President Yameen, of the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), is seeking a second term on the platform of development for all, running against senior lawmaker Ibrahim Mohamed Solih who is backed by a coalition of opposition parties, led by the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP).
The Maldives Election Commission had set up as many as 472 ballot boxes, including at four polling stations abroad in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the United Kingdom.

Emphasising that the elections were held by the rule book, Ahmed Akram, Commissioner and spokesperson at the Maldives Elections Commission, said nobody can prove any malpractice or lapse. Amidst growing scepticism over the Commissions independence, Akram told The Hindu from Male over telephone, I dont know how they [critics] define free and fair election. As far as we are concerned, each and everything we have done is by law and regulation.- AFP, THE HINDU

FAO highlights plight of SL women in agriculture, rural sectors
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released their Country Gender Assessment of the Agriculture and Rural sector in Sri Lanka on Thursday. The report details the ways in which women are insidiously discriminated against in the sector and offers recommendations to improve treatment of and remuneration for women.
Despite making up a large portion of the workforce and facing what Nina Brandstrup, FAO representation for Sri Lanka and Maldives, calls an excessive work burden, much of the labour that women in Sri Lankas food and agriculture sector engage in is unskilled, unpaid, and unrecognised. As a result, women work, but they do not reap the rewards of their labour.
Of employed women in Sri Lanka, 29.7 per cent work in the agriculture sector, but the majority practise subsistence agriculture in what is called the small economy and few reach higher paying jobs in the sector. One study done by the FAO found that only 20 per cent of the top three positions in mixed rural development societies are held by women.
As a result of what FAO describes as a combination of stereotypes, longstanding patriarchal culture, and lack of skills, women in agriculture are relegated to informal taskssuch as gardening nad housework, and are not protected by labour laws.
Their work is lower on the value chain and upward mobility hindered by the very fact that their low incomes and lack of land inhibit access to loans. It is a perpetual cycle of inequality.
Pulled up by high scores on education and health but brought down by low scores on female empowerment, Sri Lanka is ranked in the middle on global womens rights indices. When it comes to education, one FAO representative explained, it is worth noting that women in the agriculture sector only have access to training for micro-enterprises. Such training does not give women the chance to gain familiarity with modern agricultural practices and move into more commercial (and thus higher paying) roles.
FAOs recommendations include immersive gender sensitisation training for decision makers in the private and public sector, training programmes related to technical skills, and increased collection of gender segregated data. FAO representatives also commented that adequate budgetary provisions and allocations are essential.
But for some, this is not enough, to truly reach equality, actions must be taken beyond policy and training. In a panel discussion, Kamani Jindasa, an advocate for womens rights, said sustainable actions will be gender transformational not just gender responsive. Gender specialist Siriyani Perera noted that there is no womens movement in rural communities and stressed the importance of bringing rural women together.
As Vishaka Tillekeratne, a consultant for the FAO report, put it, If we count the money spent on gender training, we should have revolutionised society by now.

Growing in Virtue
Ven Kumbuke Visuddhi Citta Thera
Kayena samvaro sadhu  sadhu vacaya samvaro
Manasa samvaro sadhu  sadhu sabbattha samvaro
Sabbattha samvuto bhikkhu  sabba Dukkha pamuccati.
Good it is to be restrained in the body; good it is to restrain speech.
Restraint in mind is good; good is restraint in everything.
One who is restrained in these points thus will be freed from all kinds of Dukkha.
(Dhammapada  Verse 361)
Virtue is a good quality for a human being or any other animal. Human beings could grow in virtue. This means that they have the potential to cultivate or develop virtues within themselves. Some other animals too have virtues. For instance, a dog would not bite the hand that feeds it. This signifies the virtue gratitude. It also wags its tail in order to be thankful to a person and also when someone needs to be given a warm and heartfelt welcome!
Another word for Virtue is Discipline. In the Buddhas teaching, Virtue means Sila.
Kaya vacaya samodanamsilam- Sila is restraint in body and speech.
A devout lay devotee leading a household life observes the five precepts (Panca Sila):
1. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking the life of another (including oneself).
2. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given.
3. I undertake the precept to refrain from sexual misconduct.
4. I undertake the precept to refrain from telling lies.
5. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking any intoxicants.
The Eight precepts, Ajivatthamaka Sila (Eight Precepts with Right Livelihood as the Eighth) and The Ten Precepts are the other sets of precepts observed by lay devotees, especially on full moon days. However, these precepts could be undertaken and observed in conformity to ones convenience, on any day.
When administered for children  I undertake the precept to restrain the senses. Generally, Buddhist monks observe The Ten Precepts (Pabbajja Dasa Sila) throughout their lives. One becomes restrained in the five senses namely eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body by observing these precepts.
The Eight Precepts
1. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking the life of another (including oneself).
2. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given.
3. I undertake the precept to refrain from non-celibacy.
4. I undertake the precept to refrain from telling lies.
5. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking any intoxicants.
6. I undertake the precept to refrain from eating solid food at the forbidden time. From noon till following day dawn.
7. I undertake the precept to refrain from dancing, singing, playing a musical instrument, watching amusements and adorning the body with flowers, unguents and perfumes.
8. I undertake the precept to refrain from sitting on high and luxurious seats.
Certain liquids such as tea, coffee (without milk), herbal drinks, fruit juices(without the pulp) except juices made out from large fruits such as jackfruit, papaw, pineapple, watermelon etc. and medicines are allowed during this time. Fruit juices are allowed only before mid-night and medicines are allowed at any time. [Medicines need to be taken only to bring relief to and cure any ailment or discomforting the body.]
Ajivatthamaka Sila
1. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking the life of another (including oneself).
2. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given.
3. I undertake the precept to refrain from sexual misconduct.
4. I undertake the precept to refrain from telling lies.
5. I undertake the precept to refrain from backbiting.
6. I undertake the precept to refrain from using harsh or abusive speech.
7. I undertake the precept to refrain from useless or meaningless conversation.
8. I undertake the precept to refrain from the wrong means of livelihood.
The Ten Precepts
1. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking the life of another (including oneself).
2. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given.
3. I undertake the precept to refrain from non-celibacy.
4. I undertake the precept to refrain from telling lies.
5. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking any intoxicants.

9. I undertake the precept to refrain from sitting on high and luxurious seats.
10. I undertake the precept to refrain from accepting gold and silver (money).
After all, virtue is the base that supports all good deeds. This means that when you set yourself in virtue or the precepts, the actions you perform become inevitably virtuous and pure!
Some examples of virtues are Loving-kindness, Altruistic joy, Equanimity, Generosity, Patience, Tolerance, Honesty, Gratitude, Steadfastness and Heedfulness etc.
Loving-kindness- It is the feeling of friendliness, intimacy and cordiality. And it is the wish for oneself and others to be peaceful, well and happy.
Kindness (Compassion)  It is the feeling of sympathy or helping like at the sight of someone enduring pain or suffering. As an example, the thought of offering some food to a beggar who is in hunger is a kind thought.
The Kindness of the Buddha to help worldly beings realize the Four Noble Truths by expounding the Dhamma is known as Great Compassion.
Altruistic Joy- It is to be happy at the success of others. For instance, it is to wish thus: How wonderful! when someone is doing well in life instead of being jealous of them.
Equanimity  It is to have and sustain a balanced mind amidst the vicissitudes in life namely gain and loss, fame and defame, praise and blame and pain and pleasure.
Generosity- Generosity means the act of giving. It is giving of something that the receptor is in need of. One needs to learn to practice giving with a free hand, lavishly. However, one should not do so wastefully, but with frugality.
When one practises generosity, both the donor and the receptor are blessed with five qualities namely longevity (Ayu), complexion (vanna), happiness (sukham), energy (bala) and wisdom (panna).
Patience- It means to endure something unpleasant with a balanced mind. For instance, one may learn to be patient when encountering heat, cold, hunger and thirst on certain occasions. One also needs to be patient amidst unpleasant situations like when being scorned, blamed etc. though it may seem quite hard and absurd at times.
Tolerance- It is the capacity to endure continued subjection to something unpleasant or environmental conditions without adverse reaction.
Honesty- It means not cheating or free of deceit but truthful and sincere. That is working with a pure heart and not expecting any reward in return. However, when you work honestly, it happens so, that eventually you would receive what you deserve! Moreover, honesty is a virtue that protects you as the saying goes: Honesty is the best policy.
Gratitude- It is to be in help or help in return to a person who has helped you when you were having a hard time. In other words, it is to be grateful to a person who has helped you during some stage in your life. It could even be a good thought radiated towards that person.
Steadfastness- It is to arouse effort from within, to sustain the effort thus aroused and to bring it to its completion. In other words, it is to be energetic in order to perform good deeds.
Heedfulness- It is to hastily engage oneself in performing meritorious actions. In other words, it is to be quick and vigilant in performing good deeds.
A plant grows to be a tree. The tree is like the individual and its fruits can be compared to the virtues of the individual. Each virtue is unique as it belongs to the individual. The plant needs to be watered and well looked after; else it would dry and get destroyed. Likewise, during ones youth, one needs to grow in virtue!
In a nutshell, the following Dhammapada verse is apt stating:
Jiranti ve rajaratha sucitta  atho sarirampi jaram upeti
Satam ca dhammo na jaram upeti  santo ha ve sabbhi pavedayanti
(Dhammapada  verse 151)
Even the beautifully decorated Royal Chariot is subject to decay; even so is the body: subject to change and destruction. However, the virtues among the Noble Ones are not subject to decay; thus pacifying among themselves these virtues are pervaded everywhere.
Above all, virtues need to be appreciated as Sir William Shakespeares saying goes: The evil that men do lives after them; the good is often interred with their bones.

History of Bhikkhuni Order: A brief study
Binara Pasalosvaka Poya occupies a significant place in the history of Buddha Sasana. It is on this Poya day, Bhikkhuni Sasana was founded. When the Buddha was residing at Nigrodharamaya in the city of Kapilavasthu, Mahaprajapathi Gothami requested permission for women to enter the Order.
Buddhist scriptures tell us that after an initial reluctance, he decided to grant permission, but after laying down eight tenets of the code to be followed by the Bhikkhunis. The Queen and the 500 Sakyan princesses who accompanied her agreed to follow. Ordination was conducted thereafter. The Bhikkhuni Order in India however, lasted not more than 5 centuries as it went into extinction with the decline of Buddhism from the late Gupta period.
Today, therefore, it may be appropriate for us to take a brief journey through the history of the Bhikkhuni order in Sri Lanka.

Higher ordination was not given to dasasilmathas (ten preceptors) in Sri Lanka because the Sangha led by the three Mahanayaka Theras decreed that the Order of Nuns (Bhikkhuni Sasana) died down centuries ago in the country and cannot be revived except by a Bhikkhuni of the Theravada unbroken lineage. This was not possible since the lineage, even in remotest Chinese Buddhist territory, had gone extinct. 
Every Buddhist knows that it was during the 3rd century BC, the Bhikkhuni order was established in Sri Lanka under the guidance of Sanghamitta Theri.
The Princess Anula, wife of the younger brother of King Devanam Piyatissa, along with 500 other women, joined the higher ordination of Buddhism as Buddhist nuns.
Within a short period of time, the Buddhism earned many followers in Sri Lanka. During that time, the island had a large Buddhist religious community of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis who advocated the Buddhist teachings across the country.
The Bhikkhuni Sasana lasted till the end of the Anuradhapura Era. The final mention of a Nunnery in the Chronicles was during the reign of Mihindu the fourth (956-972) who built Mahawallaka Nunnery for Theravada bhikkhunis.
Visits to China and Tibet
History tells us that in 429 CE, Bhikkhuni Devasara took a cutting from the Sri Lankan bodhi tree at Anuradhapura, and travelled to China with a group of bhikkhunis to establish a bhikkhuni sangha there.
At the same time the mission left to China, Bhikkhuni Chandramali led the second group to Tibet, described as a greatly hazardous journey. In Tibet, they translated six Tibetan texts from Sanskrit to Tibetan including the Tibetan Tripitaka which was called the Kanjur.
Bhikkhus in China politely asked the visiting group whether some of them would be willing to return home and bring more bhikkhunis so they would have enough quorum for an ordination. While some of the original bhikkhunis stayed behind, others Returned to Sri Lanka. They gathered the requisite number of bhikkhunis to make a quorum for the ordination and four years later, arrived back in China. It is said that over 300 Chinese nuns were ordained at the Nan Lin Southern Forest Monastery in Nanjing.
Unlike Sri Lanka, Chinas bhikkhuni lineage, has continued to the present day in an unbroken upasampada (ordination) lineage. And, in between, the bhikkhuni order was transmitted to Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam from China. There are now thousands of Taiwanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Chinese bhikkhunis.
Extinction
Around the 11th century, however, the Order of Buddhist nuns slowly began to lose its place among Buddhist culture in Sri Lanka. There is a number of reasons for this catastrophe.
In 1017 Cholian tribes, who were extremist Hindus, came down from India and conquered the Anuradhapura Kingdom and as a result, the Bhikkhu and Bhikkhuni orders disappeared and became defunct. After 50 years of the Cholian rule though, Vijayabahu the First (1055-1110) expelled the invaders. During this half century, the local Buddhist practices became more and more under Tamil and Hindu influence.
Since the fall of the Anuradhapura kingdom, fewer women were inclined to join the Buddhist clergy. There were only a few Buddhist nuns left to perform the higher ordination for the novices. Only a senior bhikkhuni can perform the ordination of bhikkhunis. It cannot be performed by a Buddhist monk.
Dipavamsa
Vijayabahu the First wanted to revive the Bhikkhu and BhikkhuniOrders. He got down Bhikkhus from Burma for the ordination of Sri Lankan bhikkhus. However, there is no indication that he got the services of senior Bhikkhunis from Burma.
According to Professor Ranaweera Gunawardene, there was a Burmese inscription which speaks of the existence of Theravada Bhikkhunis in Burma in 1196CE. Even in 1279CE according to inscriptions, nunneries had existed in Burma.
So, the bhikkhuni order died out in the Theravada tradition. However, women continued to practice. Womens monasticism took different forms, for example, eight and ten-precept nuns.
Dr Hema Goonetilake, a renowned Buddhist scholar and researcher, gives us interesting insights into the Bhikkhuni Order in Sri Lanka. He says that Dipavamsa of the fourth century BC a work authored by Bhikkhunis, and it was the first Chronicle to have been documented in Sri Lanka. It gives in detail the establishment of the Bhikkhuni Order, its history, development, expansion and the spiritual and intellectual successes of the bhikkhunis.
This is in contrast to the documentation in the Mahavamsa written in the sixth century CE based on the Dipavamsa where Bhikkhu scribes had ignored the services of Bhikkhunis except for the initial events and brief references. Dr Goonetilekes contention is that Mahavamsa which gives the male history of the Theravada fraternity appears to be a deliberate effort to delegitimize the services of the bhikkhunis.
Dr Goonetilleke brings up the argument which is made today by many among the Sangha in Theravada countries that there is no possibility of resuscitating the Bhikkhuni Order as the traditional requirement of an appropriate lineage does not exist. However, she points out that it is not possible to strictly adhere to the rules and regulations as set out earlier for the reestablishment of the Theravada Bhikkhuni Order.
Revival
In the latter part of last century, there were attempts to revive Bhikkhuni Order in Sri Lanka.
Higher ordination was not given to dasasilmathas (ten preceptors) in Sri Lanka because the Sangha led by the three Mahanayaka Theras decreed that the Order of Nuns (Bhikkhuni Sasana) died down centuries ago in the country and cannot be revived except by a Bhikkhuni of the Theravada unbroken lineage. This was not possible since the lineage, even in remotest Chinese Buddhist territory, had gone extinct.
Yet, in 1996, a group of dasasilmathas led by Sister Kusuma went to Buddha Gaya and received higher ordination from a South Korean senior Bhikkhuni and later received ordination again from Sri Lankan Theravada monks led by Sumangala Thera in Rangiri Dambulla Vihara. Thus, some believe, the lineage or Order of Bhikkhunis was restored. The event was organised by Venerable Mapalagama Vipulasara Thera.
Six months later, Sumangala Thera got these 20 bhikkhunis to confer ordination on 22 samaneris of Sri Lanka along with many from other countries. Most of the bhikkhunis have gone to other countries to build the bhikkhuni sangha.

Iran points finger at Arab separatists
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday pointed blame at Arab separatists for a deadly attack on a military parade and accused an unnamed US-backed Gulf state of supporting them.
Tehran also summoned diplomats from Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain for allegedly hosting members of the group suspected of links to Saturday's attack near the Iraqi border that left at least 29 people dead.
Four militants attacked a parade commemorating the start of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war in the southwestern city of Ahvaz, capital of the border province of Khuzestan.
Officials and an eyewitness said the gunmen were clad in Iranian military uniforms and had sprayed the crowd with gunfire using weapons they had stashed in a nearby park. - AFP

Kayes and Mahmudullah lift Bangladesh to 249-7
Abu Dhabi, Sunday: Mahmudullah Riyad and Imarul Kayes knocked half centuries to lift Bangladesh to a fighting 249-7 in their Super Four Stage match against Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.
Riyad scored 81-ball 74 with two sixes and three boundaries while Kayes -- recalled as a back-up to strengthen the batting -- made 89 ball 72 not out to help Bangladesh recover from a precarious 5-87 at Sheikh Zayed Stadium.
Opener Liton Das scored 41 and Mushfiqur Rahim made 33 but Bangaldesh - who won the toss and batted -- owed their total to a solid 128-run stand for the sixth wicket between Riyad and Kayes.
Kayes gave good support to Riyad as the two built the innings after Bangladeshs star batsman Shakib Al Hasan was run out for nought.
Kayes hit six boundaries as Bangladesh played the dangerous spinning duo of Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman who managed a wicket each.
Both Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lost their opening Super Four matches, need a win to stay in the hunt for the September 28th final in Dubai.

## Title: A LOCKER FULL  OF WILLS
## Supertitle:

## Date: Monday, September 24, 2018 - 01:00
A LOCKER FULL  OF WILLS

The Office of the Public Trustee having made an application to court to open the last wills of 252 persons whose last wills had been lying in a safe for over 70 years, was granted permission to open them before the Registrar of the Colombo District Court in March this year.
The incumbent Public Trustee Sanath Weeratne has been the driving force behind this measure, having come across these last wills that had been lying in a locker for more than 70 years, overlooked by many of his predecessors.
The 24th Public Trustee to hold this office, he is committed to restoring the trust of the Office of the Public Trustee and do the right thing to those who had placed their trust in the Public Trustee and deposited their last wills.
After so many years, he is uncertain however, if he would be able to ensure justice to all the last wills that were thus stored away due to many demographic and other changes, but he promises that before he leaves office, he would do his utmost to ensure that the Office of the Public Trustee functions in a manner that upholds the trust placed in them by the public.
Speaking to the Daily News, he said Although I am the Public Trustee I dont have the right to open these sealed envelopes that have been lying here for 70-plus years. Hence, we made the right applications to court and court initially gave us the order on March 29, 2018, to come and deposit all the last wills. So we took the period from 1931 to 1992, because given the lifespan of males and females in Sri Lanka, we could safely assume that for the last wills deposited from 1992 to 2018, there is a likely chance that they may still be alive.
He said that the Public Trustees Office had 252 last wills that they had to take to court and the court made an order for them to deposit them and open these last wills in the presence of the Registrar of the Colombo District Court. According to Weeratne, that was a starting point. The case has come up a few times since then and the last date it was taken up was September 17.
The court also made an order on a subsequent day for the Public Trustee to take measures to make relevant inquiries to see how many of these people are dead. Out of the 252, the Public Trustee has been named as the executor in 160 of these last wills. So we wrote to the divisional secretaries and the information we have to date is that out of the 252, we have not received any details from the district secretaries in relation to 106 last wills. Of the balance 148, we have received information and details from the district secretaries, he added.
Delving into history
Going into details of the 148 last wills, the Public Trustee has got confirmation that 46 of them are no longer alive. Now they know for certain that 16 of them are alive. Further, in 86 cases, the district secretaries have said that they cannot find any information. This is fair enough, taking into consideration that they are digging up information after over 70 years.
Of the 46 confirmed as deceased, the Public Trustee is the executor of 31 of those last wills and the Public Trustee is the non-executor of 15. These last wills are of those who we know for certain are no longer alive, Weeratne said. Of the 16 who are confirmed to be alive, the Public Trustee is the executor of 10, while we are not the executor in six of them.
With regard to the balance 86, where the divisional secretariats have said that they dont have information on any of them, the Public Trustee is the executor of 58 of them and the Public Trustee is the non-executor of 28 of them. To date, they know that with regard to the 148 last wills that the Public Trustee has information on, the Public Trustee is the executor of 99 of them.
In my personal view we are talking of people and properties which were located in our country 70-plus years ago when information technology was at a very primitive level and institutions and the system functioned at a different level. Therefore, some of this information may not be recorded and some of these properties may not even be there today.
Some of these properties, however, maybe worth over a billion rupees and could have been misused or fraudulently enjoyed by generations. If a person had come to the Public Trustee in 1931, paid the Rs. 200 fee and deposited his last will with the Public Trustee and it had been locked up in a cabinet for over 90 years and if that person did not want anything to be given to their kith and kin and wanted their properties gifted to charity, but nothing happens. That person has breathed his last and is no longer alive and the family of that person will assume that the deceased person had not left a last will and they would have gone through a testamentary proceeding, which is as if the person has died interstate, without a last will. They would have accordingly distributed that persons properties between his children and grandchildren. But what it means is that the person who had trusted the Public Trustee to execute his last will back in the 1930s, has been deprived of justice and what he wanted in his last will has not been done, which is wrong, said Weeratne.
He noted that when they were browsing through the last wills, with court permission, there was one particular last will where this person had wanted 200 acres of his property in one location, another 50 acres in another and another 60 acres in a third and so on to be sold and the money used to construct a school for the blind. In this case, the absolute discretion was given to the Public Trustee, but this had not happened because the last will had been sitting in a locker way after the person had died. This is absolutely unfair, as this person had relied on the Public Trustee and placed all his faith in this department to execute his last will after his demise and we had let him down.
He said that there was another will where a lady had specifically mentioned that her jewellery in one box be given to this daughter and the jewellery in another box be given to another daughter. But after 70 years the will is still tucked away in a locker and her will was not executed even though she had completely trusted this department to execute her last will.
Right thing to do
Therefore, I thought the right thing to do is to at least now look into ways that this can be rectified. However, it is a very difficult task as we have to identify properties of people who had owned them many decades ago. Now these properties may have gone down three to four generations. But I cannot say this is not possible and finish my term and let the next Public Trustee worry about it. That is not the service of the Public Trustee.
What the Public Trustee should have ideally done is, knowing they have the wills of people from 1930, they should have written to the Registrar of Births and Deaths and the grama sewaka officers and the divisional secretaries and find out details of these persons. We have a register with the names of the persons who have deposited their wills with us and we know where they lived at the time, so we could have inquired from the respective grama sewaka offices or divisional secretaries. We should have done this at least once in 12 months or at least published a news release. These people wrote their last wills and deposited it with us because they did not want their relatives to know about it. But when you leave it here for over 70 years, we have no other option but to find out in this way. Perhaps this is not what the person wanted, but in such instances where such a long time has lapsed, then we have no choice but to go about it in this manner, Weeratne noted.
This case is coming up in court again in January and out of the 252 last wills, where the Public Trustee is not the executor, there is provision in the Civil Procedure Court of our country for us to make an application from the District Court seeking the court to appoint the Public Trustee as the executor, in the event nobody comes forward. So the court has the power to appoint the Public Trustee as the executor and they might do that, he said.
Then, we get down to the practical aspect and the difficulties faced to undo our mistakes. How do we get about this We will have to go to a village or a suburb where the demographics have changed. With new developments, how do we identify the lands This will be upsetting for a lot of people when the Public Trustee comes knocking on their door asking questions on how they got this land and so on. But that is what the Public Trustee will have to do. If there is no information, then yes we will have to inform court, but the idea is to do the right thing and send a strong message to everyone out there that now the Public Trustees Office is functioning in line with the concept of the Public Trustee. This is a huge step in the right path and we have to do it no matter how hard.
From 1993 until September 19, 2018, the Public Trustee has another 146 last wills deposited with the Department. Altogether, there were 269 which were deposited since January 1993. But 123 were taken back as anyone has the right to come and withdraw their last wills at any time by providing us the details and signing the necessary documents, Weeratne said.
Although there are private law firms, the people who deposited their last wills with the Public Trustee trusted this office and it is the duty of that Office to uphold that trust and dignity. Hence, Weeratne has instructed his officers to do a check on the balance 146 last wills. That is the right thing to do, he said.
Though little known, the Office of the Public Trustee is one of the oldest and richest government departments in the country. Things over the years however have not gone too well for a department which is supposed to win the trust of the public. According to its 2016 Performance Report to Parliament, it had 1,067 active trusts, 140 active estates and contributed a little over Rs. 14 million to the Treasury. From 2012 to 2014 however, it was contributing an average number of Rs. 6 million to the Treasury, even though 35 active trusts and eight active estates were added to its portfolio during the same period.
Highlighting the importance of the use of digital platforms, Weeratne said that in order to take it to the next level and keep up with modern times, the Public Trustee must initiate measures such as active websites and integrate the systems with the Immigration and Emigration Department, Pensions Department, and Registrar of Births and Deaths and Marriages so that the Public Trustees Department is kept better informed to serve the public more efficiently, despite limited funding and assets.
Weeratne also greatly appreciated the guidance and support of Justice and Prison Reform Minister Thalatha Athukorale and the Secretary to the Ministry in turning around the Public Trustees Department to regain the trust of the public and serve them better, upholding the dignity of the institution.

From Mae Chee Kaew to forgotten tales
In the Pali suttas, whenever the Buddha relays a teaching or discusses a subject with Venerable Ananda, Venerable Ananda often replies with the inspired utterance, "It is wonderful, it is marvellous Lord", in praise of the Buddhas great wisdom. Now with regards to the biography that details the life and practice of Mae Chee Kaew, I am sure that all sincere Buddhist practitioners will respond in such a way, because the life and practice of Mae Chee Kaew truly was wonderful and marvellous.
Many contemporary Buddhist practitioners have come to feel grateful that Bhikkhu Silaratano made the considerable effort to collate and translate this work, as it gives a rare glimpse into the life of a truly gifted female practitioner from more recent history, a life that is truly inspiring to both men and women alike.
The Sinhala readership should feel blessed as the biography of this great saint is now available in Sinhala as translated by Tilaka Kudahetti, published by Sahitha Poth Piyasa.
Buddha is purported to have been born in 563 BCE in the area of India now known as Nepal. Buddha is a title which means The Awakened One or the Enlightened One.
The actual name of Buddha is Siddhartha Shakya, but he came to be known as Gautama Buddha (the Sanskrit form of his family name), Mahatma Buddha (Mahatma is a title for a good and wise person) or sometimes, Shakyamuni (an honorific meaning Sage of the Shakyans). He was born into a prominent family. His father was Suddhodana, an elected chief of the Shakya clan. His mothers name was Maya. From the time of his birth, Siddhartha was seen as being destined to be a great king.
Buddhas mother died within a few days of his birth, and he was raised by his mothers younger sister. At the age of 16, his father arranged his marriage to a cousin who was his same age, Yasodhara. They had a son named Rahula.
The family was wealthy enough so that Siddharthas father could provide for his sons every need and want. Siddhartha led a sheltered life never being allowed to leave the palace walls so that his father could shield him from knowledge of human suffering.
These tales almost forgotten in the contemporary setting are now available as a collection compiled by Halaliye Karunathilaka. The collection is published by Sahitha Poth Piyasa.

INDIA: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spent his 68th birthday on September 17 in his Lok Sabha constituency, Varanasi, has posted a heartwarming new picture from his trip on Instagram. The adorable picture shows PM Modi with, as he calls them, his young friends. However, what makes the photo delightful is how PM Modi pulled off his favourite pose while being photographed with kids.
The picture shows him playfully pulling a boy's ear while a little girl looks at him. Since being posted about two hours ago, the picture has collected quite a few reactions on the photo-sharing app.
My young friends and I, says the caption posted with the photo. It is also accompanied with the hashtag #Varanasi. PM Modi was in the temple city for two days. During his visit, PM Modi interacted with students of a primary school and launched various development projects worth over Rs. 550 crore. The picture had collected over 4.8 lakh likes and a ton of reactions within the first two hours of its posting.
Awesome pic sir, says one Instagram user. Too cute! say another.
This isn't the first time PM Modi has been photographed pulling a kid's ear. There have been several such pictures, each more delightful than the other.
During Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's visit to India back in February, Prime Minister Modi tweeted a throwback photo featuring Mr Trudeau's nine-year-old daughter Ella-Grace Margaret.
Another similar picture was posted by actor Akshay Kumar back in 2016. It shows PM Modi pulling the actor's son, Aarav's, ears. Akshay, along with wife Twinkle Khanna and son, was attending the International Fleet Review in Visakhapatnam. - NDTV

Establishment of the Bhikkhuni Sasana on Binara Full Moon Poya Day
Mothering  a sage
The Buddhas initial rejection for a Bhikkhuni Sasana is scoffed at by feminists from some quarters. They question why the woman cannot achieve the Nibbana. This shows their lack of common sense as well as ignorance of teachings. The Buddha was only reluctant to install the bhikkhuni order, but he preached to women such as his mothers and wife: Maya, Pajapathi and Yasodhara.
Prajapati had the support of 500 wives of princes. They all shaved their heads, wore yellow robes, and met monk Ananda. Only following monk Anandas continuous request did the Buddha accept the Bhikkhuni Sasana on a Binara Poya. Prajapati became the first nun in the Buddhist order, but on eight conditions:
1. The monk shall be given priority in respect and deference over the nun.
2. The nun shall spend rain retreat away from the monks.
3. The nun shall seek consent from monks about Uposatha and teaching of Dhamma.
4. Upon violating a rule, the nun shall be punished before the community of both nuns and monks.
5. The nun shall confess any wrongdoing before the community of nuns and monks.
6. The nun shall be ordained before a gathering of nuns and monks.
7. The nun shall not treat a monk badly.
8. The nun shall not teach a monk.
Maha Pajapathi Gothami  the name goes on to mean that she would have a large retinue - played an instrumental role in the Buddhas lay life, by bringing him up following Queen Mayas death.
She was Mayas younger sister. Dandapani and Suppabuddha were her brothers. She had Nanda and Sundari Nanda from King Suddhodana, hence they became the Buddhas step-siblings.
The Buddha always stressed the fact that the woman can always achieve Nibbana being a laity. Women entering the monk establishment will lead to more complications. If the monk order has the lifespan of 10,000 years, the Buddha went on to say, it will go down to 5,000 years when women join it. He likened the Bhikkhuni participation as a house full of women being vulnerable for smugglers. It will disturb the peace of the monk mind and make the path for misuse, mostly.
Suddhodanas death left no reason for Pajapathi to remain laity since she was already a Sotapanna. She was looking out for a chance to approach the Buddha on initiating the nun order. The Blessed One visited Kapilavatthu to settle the row between Sakyans and Kolyans on obtaining water from River Rohini. The Buddha preached the Kalahavivada Sutta, and 500 princes became monks leaving their wives alone. Gothami had the support of these wives. The validity of Gothamis ordination became an issue because some nuns did not like to become nuns under her. The Buddha interfered and declared the validity of Gothamis bhikkhuni status.
Gothami once made an elegant looking robe for the Buddha with a distinctive material. The Buddha refused to accept it alone and suggested it should be given to the whole order. Gothami was feeling down, but then she realised it was to her own benefit  to accrue more merits.
No more re-becoming 
Andrew Olendzki translates a stanza from Theri Gatha which is uttered by Pajapathi Gothami. The stanza is reproduced along with the translators introduction.
The woman who is said to have composed this poem was Prajapati, the Buddha's stepmother and a Queen of the Sakyas. Her younger sister was Maya, married to King Suddhodana only after Pajapati herself was unable to conceive an heir. Queen Maya died in childbirth, and it was Pajapati who raised Gotama as her own son. After his enlightenment, Pajapati also left the palace and became the first of the bhikkhunis, the order of nuns.
The third stanza suggests that her attainments included the recollection of past lives, by which she was able to verify empirically the truth of continual rebirth the flowing on (samsara) from one life to another. This process, as she mentions in her poem, is fueled by craving and by not understanding. In the second and fourth stanzas, Pajapati declares her attainment of Nibbana, of final and complete liberation in this very life.
It is remarkable to think that when Maya is remembered in the last stanza, the author has in mind not the icon of motherhood and sacrifice that Maya became in the Buddhist tradition, but a dearly-loved younger sister who died tragically young without ever seeing what her son had become.
Buddha! Hero! Praise be to you!
You foremost among all beings!
You who have released me from pain,
And so many other beings too.
All suffering has been understood.
The source of craving has withered.
Cessation has been touched by me
On the noble eight-fold path.
I've been a mother and son before;
And father, brother  grandmother too.
Not understanding what was real,
I flowed-on without finding [peace].
But now I've seen the Blessed One!
This is my last compounded form.
The on-flowing of birth has expired.
There's no more re-becoming now.
The Buddha proved his gratitude by attending to Gothami when she was ill. He preached to her consolation.
When it comes to discipline, however, the Buddha seems to have been stricter for the Bhikkhuni by making 311 rules for Bhikkhunis, whereas 227 for Bhikkhus.

At least 12 patients who sought recently treatment from the Nuwara Eliya hospital for eye-related conditions have complained they had experienced partial vision loss, following the administering of a drug via an injection.
Hospital sources said some patients had complained of complete vision loss following treatment.
Nuwara Eliya General Hospital Director Dr. Aruna Jayasekara said that he had been informed of some complications suffered by several patients and they were currently under treatment.
According to hospital sources, 55 patients had been treated with the same injection and 12 patients had developed complications, following treatment.
Dr. Jayasekera said following treatment, some of the affected patients were already showing improvement in their conditions.
He said samples of the drug from the batch in question have been sent to the drug-testing unit at the Health Ministry for investigations.

Pliskova floors  Osaka to win Tokyo title
TOKYO: Former world number one Karolina Pliskova stunned Japanese tennis sensation Naomi Osaka in straights sets to capture the Pan Pacific Open on Sunday.
The fourth seed needed just 63 minutes to complete a clinical 6-4, 6-4 victory over the newly crowned US Open champion in Tokyo, bringing Osakas 10-match winning streak to a shuddering halt.
Im just happy it didnt go to three sets, said the Czech, who had been taken the distance in her previous three matches.
My serve is my biggest weapon and it was key today, added Pliskova after scooping an 11th career title.
Naomi was maybe a little bit tired, you could see that. But the future is bright for her and congrats to her for an incredible few weeks. The players had split their previous two meetings, but Osaka started the final as favourite after her historic New York triumph.
And the third seed began in menacing fashion, thumping an ace down the middle on the first point and holding her first two service games to love.
But Pliskova slowly turned the screw and broke for 3-2 with a fizzing backhand her opponent swished well wide.
The Czech was soon a set to the good after unleashing another brutal drive, Osaka caught flat-footed and dumping it into the net. Runner-up in Tokyo two years ago, Osaka climbed to seventh in the world rankings after becoming Japans first grand slam singles champion but she looked lost for ideas against Pliskova.
The 20-year-old buried her head in a towel during the changeover and things barely improved in the second set, Osaka whacking her racquet against her sneakers in anger at her wastefulness.
As the strain began to show, a dejected Osaka called for coach Sascha Bajin and groaned: I feel so stressed out! Sensing blood, Pliskova broke for 5-4 after a poor Osaka drop shot gifted her an easy put-away and moments later she delivered the coup de grace with a sixth ace that Osaka barely wafted her racquet at.
For Pliskova, it was a first tournament victory since Stuttgart in April -- and the first since wedding long-time partner Michal Hrdlicka in the summer.
The first one this year was before the wedding, smiled the Czech. Im just happy that I also have a title as a married woman.

Pope Francis honours Holocaust victims
Pope Francis on Sunday paid homage to Holocaust victims who perished in the Vilnius ghetto, 75 years to the day after the Nazis liquidated it, and warned 100,000 Lithuanians gathered for mass against pernicious attitudes leading to genocide.
Seventy-five years ago, this nation witnessed the final destruction of the Vilnius Ghetto; this was the climax of the killing of thousands of Jews that had started two years earlier, the pontiff told faithful in a homily in Kaunas, Lithuania's second city.
Pre-war Lithuania was home to a thriving Jewish community of more than 200,000 people, with its capital Vilnius a hub of learning known as the Jerusalem of the North.
According to historians, around 195,000 -- nearly the entire Jewish population -- perished at the hands of the Nazis and local collaborators under the 1941-44 German occupation.
Today around 3,000 Jews live in the EU and NATO member state which has a population of 2.9 million, the majority of whom are Catholic.
Recalling the Holocaust, Francis prayed for divine discernment to alert the faithful to any reappearance of that pernicious attitude, any whiff of it that can taint the heart of generations that did not experience those times and can sometimes be taken in by such siren songs. The pope also said he would pay tribute to Holocaust victims at the Vilnius ghetto memorial later on Sunday at ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of its liquidation. - AFP

In high profile Asia Cup Super Four match against India
Shoaib Maliks classy 78 carries Pakistan to 237/7
DUBAI, Sunday: Shoaib Malik once again displayed his value to the team at the age of 37 when he hit a flawless 78 off 90 balls (4 fours, 2 sixes) to take Pakistan to a total of 237-7 in their Asia Cup Super Four match against arch rivals India at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Winning the toss and batting first Pakistan were poised to get towards a total of around 270-280, but some excellent bowling at the death by India especially Jasprit Bumrah saw them score only 26 runs off the last five overs. It left Pakistan pondering whether they had put enough runs on the board to contain the strong Indian batting line up.
Malik once again proved a thorn in the oppositions side when he defied his age to play another classy innings in hot conditions hitting fours fours and two sixes. Yuzvendra Chahal struck in his first over by breaking the opening partnership  trapping Imam ul Haq lbw for 10, a review that India won after the appeal was over turned by the umpire.
Kuldeep Yadavs introduction in the 11th over brought the downfall of Fakhar Zaman who has so far had a rather lean tournament with the bat with scores of 24, 0 and 0. Yesterday he looked in good nick to get over that period when he hit a six and a four in his innings of 31 off 44 balls but got out in the most unusual manner  losing his balance on a sweep and being declared out lbw. Pakistan lost the in-form Babar Azam needlessly when skipper Sarfraz Ahmed misjudged a run and left his partner high and dry to be run out for 9. Sarfraz and Malik set about repairing the innings carrying the score from 59-3 to 165-4 being involved in a 107-run stand off 138 balls that was ended when Sarfraz (44) hit a tame catch to his vis-a-vis Rohit Sharma at cover when he failed to clear in the infield.
The Indian bowlers in particular were tight in their lines and lengths and hardly made run scoring easy for the Pakistanis. The Indian ground was also brilliant making Pakistan work hard for every run. They moved around the field like a well oiled machine reminiscent of Sri Lankas fielding when they won the World Cup in 1996. Pakistan decided to turn on the heat when the 42nd over bowled by Kumar produced 21 runs that included two sixes hit by Asif Ali who decided to take the fight to the bowlers, but India came back strongly when they picked up Maliks wicket at a crucial stage of the game when he was caught down the leg side off Bumrah.
After Chahal had sent back Asif Ali bowled for 30, Bumrah picked up Shadab Khans wicket for 10 as India snuffed out any late attempt for a late surge by Pakistan with some excellent death bowling.

SL prisons to learn from foreign systems
The Justice and Prison Reform Ministry is studying the prison systems of other countries to improve local prisons and the welfare of prisoners.
Justice and Prison Reform Minister Thalatha Athukorale recently visited Singapore to study its prison system.
The Minister told the Daily News that there could be more lessons to be learnt from the prison systems of other countries, regarding the security of prisoners, welfare activities, the arrangement of prison cells, and the advanced technology used.
Minister Athukorale said that she closely studied the steps taken by the Singaporean government to improve prisoners welfare, get rid of corruption in prisons, and rehabilitate prisoners. She had visited some prisons, including the prison at Changi.
She said the Singaporean Home Minister assured maximum support for prison and judicial reforms taking place in Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the present security situation in prisons, she that instead of a prisons intelligence body, a prisons police has been established, and it will be empowered with legal authority to participate in prison affairs. The formation of the prisons police has been executed for the first time in the history of local prisons.
The Minister said there is no person held responsible for the detections made by the prisons intelligence unit. It is learnt that on some occasions, the decisions of the intelligence unit were not executed or were tampered with by politicians or high-ranking officials.
That cant be allowed. Minister Athukorale said. As a result of tough decisions we have taken recently to stop the activities related to the drug racket operated by some underworld members from prisons, some of my staff face death threats. My ministry is determined to take correct decisions to anticipate any threat to justice.

Smart  drugs
The original smart drug is piracetam, which was discovered by the Romanian scientist Corneliu Giurgea in the early 1960s. At the time, he was looking for a chemical that could sneak into the brain and make people feel sleepy. After months of testing, he came up with Compound 6215. It was safe, it had very few side effects  and it didnt work. Piracetam did have one intriguing side-effect, however. When patients took it for at least a month, it led to substantial improvements to their memories. Today piracetam is a favourite with students and young professionals looking for a way to boost their performance, though decades after Giurgeas discovery, there still isnt much evidence that it can improve the mental abilities of healthy people
More and more people are turning to drugs to improve their performance at work. One recent survey involving tens of thousands of people found that 30% of Americans who responded had taken them in the last year. Do they really work And what would happen if we all started taking them
Honor de Balzac was a great believer in the power of coffee. The renowned French writer had a punishing schedule  every evening, he would scour the streets of Paris for a caf that was open past midnight, then write until the morning. It is said that he would consume 50 cups of his favourite drink in a single day. Eventually, he graduated to eating whole spoonfuls of coffee grinds, which he felt worked especially well on an empty stomach. As he put it, after a mouthful of gritty coffee: Ideas quick-march into motion like battalions of a grand army to its legendary fighting ground and the battle rages. It may have worked. Balzac was prolific and produced nearly 100 novels, novellas and plays in his lifetime. He died of heart failure at age of 51.
Use of smart drugs on the rise
US respondents reported the highest rate of use: in 2017, nearly 30% said they had used drugs for PCE at least once in the preceding 12 months, up from 20% in 2015. But the largest increases were in Europe: use in France rose from 3% in 2015 to 16% in 2017, and from 5% to 23% in the United Kingdom.
Mind-bending
The original smart drug is piracetam, which was discovered by the Romanian scientist Corneliu Giurgea in the early 1960s. At the time, he was looking for a chemical that could sneak into the brain and make people feel sleepy. After months of testing, he came up with Compound 6215. It was safe, it had very few side effects  and it didnt work. Piracetam did have one intriguing side-effect, however. When patients took it for at least a month, it led to substantial improvements to their memories. Today piracetam is a favourite with students and young professionals looking for a way to boost their performance, though decades after Giurgeas discovery, there still isnt much evidence that it can improve the mental abilities of healthy people. Its a prescription drug in the UK, though its not approved for medical use by the US Food and Drug Administration and cant be sold as a dietary supplement either.
Brain gains
Two increasingly popular options are amphetamines and methylphenidate, which are prescription drugs sold under the brand names Adderall and Ritalin. In the United States, both are approved as treatments for people with ADHD, a behavioural disorder which makes it hard to sit still or concentrate. Now theyre also widely abused by people in highly competitive environments, looking for a way to remain focused on specific tasks.
Ritalin is a stimulant intended to treat ADHD but is often abused by people seeking to improve their focus. Both drugs also come with serious risks and side effects.
Amphetamines are structurally similar to crystal meth  a potent, highly addictive recreational drug which has ruined countless lives and can be fatal. Both Adderall and Ritalin are known to be addictive, and there are already numerous reports of workers who struggled to give them up. There are also side effects, such as nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, stomach pains, and even hair loss, among others.
Do smart drugs work
Short-term side effects of study drugs
They include: Anxiety, disrupted heart rhythm, feelings of restlessness, increased blood pressure, irritability, lack of appetite, mood swings, potentially dangerous cardiac issues, trouble sleeping, unhealthy weight loss.
In the race to get ahead be it in sports, work, to make money or study many of us are doping ourselves with stimulants.
To keep up, to beat fatigue or lack of sleep we prop ourselves with substances. The consequences are literally mind-bending and are devastating.


So far, these so-called smart drugs are approved only at specific doses for specific conditions, such as narcolepsy and ADHD. There are significant concerns about what their impacts may be when used by healthy people, potentially at levels outside prescription doses.
Adderall and psychosis
Adderall is a brand-name drug that contains the nervous system stimulants amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Adderall was officially approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in 1960 and has, in recent years, become ubiquitous. From the years 2002-2006, the sale of the drug increased by an estimated 3000 per cent. In 2010 alone, 18 million prescriptions for Adderall were issueda surge that has put significant pressure on drugstores. Adderall can also cause unwanted side effects, though. It can cause psychosis. Psychosis is a serious mental condition in which a persons thinking is so damaged that they lose touch with reality.
Symptoms of psychosis can include:
Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real)
Delusions (believing things that are not true)
Paranoia (feeling extremely suspicious)
The drugs connection to psychosis dates back to its earliest uses.
What are study drugs
The term study drugs refers to prescription drugs used to increase mental stamina and focus to enhance studying. As mentioned, these medications are prescribed to treat ADD and ADHD, which both alter self-discipline, attention span, impulse control and hyperactivity for kids with ADHD.
Study drugs and the brain
Stimulants, which study drugs are, tend to increase energy and concentration levels while decreasing the need for sleep or food. As time passes, these alterations to the flow and cycle of dopamine can rewire the brain and have negative impacts on the brains reward centre.
As a result, a teenagers brain is altered, and their ability to feel joy or pleasure without the chemical support of these study drugs is severely hindered.
The more frequently these study drugs are consumed, the more firmly entrenched this brain recircuiting becomes. Over time, tolerance forms, meaning that more and more of the drug is required in order to achieve the desired effects.
When study drugs eventually exit the bloodstream, withdrawal symptoms can occur within hours, demonstrating both an emotional and physical dependence on the drug. Cravings and withdrawal symptoms are very much tied to the method of abuse combined with the frequency and potency of the dose.
Study drugs tend to increase blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. Repeated abuse, especially in high doses, can lead to a host of severe medical conditions from a seizure, to a stroke, to a heart attack. It can cause long-term harm to the cardiovascular system and the heart when used regularly and in high doses.
The most commonly reported study drug heart issues are tachycardia (irregular heart rate) and hypertension (high blood pressure). While not nearly as common with study drugs, there have been reports of sudden cardiac death.

Soldiers killer  still at large
The suspected killer of a soldier attached to the Ambepussa Sinha Regiment camp remains at large with the Police still unable to identify a possible suspect.
The soldier was found stabbed to death with a sharp object at his guard post at around 4.40 am on Friday.
Speaking to the Daily News, OIC of the Mirigama Police, Chief Inspector Chinthaka Peiris said they had not received any lead to the possible suspect.
We are currently recording statements from soldiers within the camp, he said.

However, inside sources were able to reveal that the soldiers duty weapon had gone missing during the incident and that it was the second weapon to go missing from the camp in recent times. Several months ago, a weapon at the camps armoury was found to have disappeared without explanation.
According to camp sources, the perpetrator is believed to have arrived on a motorbike from outside the camp before committing the act. The use of Police sniffer dogs along the suspected route used by the killer had not provided any results as yet.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Army has commenced their own inquiry into the killing, Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said.
The Military Police will conduct their own inquiry apart from Police investigations, he said, adding that a course of inquiry as required by government institutions in similar circumstances will also be conducted. The deceased soldier was identified as 21-year-old W.M.N.S. Jayasena, a resident of Bulathkohupitiya, Kegalle.
Camp sources say the soldier was on duty at the post between 2.00 am - 4.00 am before being discovered dead in the guard room at around 4.40 am on the day.

Sri Lanka Women remain  8th ranked as men in ODIs
The latest two series in the third round of the ICC Womens Championship delivered closely fought games and propelled West Indies out of the bottom half of the table as the teams test their competitive edge with the ICC Womens World Twenty20 2018 less than 50 days away.
Reigning World T20 champions West Indies drew their three-match series at home to South Africa 1-1 while India defeated Sri Lanka 2-1 in an away series of the eight-team tournament, which sees sides compete for four direct qualifying spots in the ICC Womens World Cup 2021 in New Zealand.
The results mean the West Indies have moved up one place to fourth position on the points table led by New Zealand. The defending ICC Womens World Twenty20 champions are on nine points while South Africa are not far behind with seven points and in seventh position. India are in sixth position with eight points while Sri Lanka have drawn their first two points with a victory in the last match of the series. All four teams have played nine matches each so far.
In Sri Lanka, Indias 10-match victory run against the home side was brought to an end in the final encounter of the series by captain Chamari Atapattus match-winning century. The hard-hitting batter, whose amazing 178 not out against Australia in last years World Cup is acclaimed as one of the great all time knocks in the womens game, eclipsed a century by rival captain Mithali Raj earlier in the day.
Raj had scored 125 not out, but Athapaththus 115 helped the side make it with just one ball to spare. The second match of the series too was close as India won by seven runs after notching an impressive nine-wicket victory in the opener.
Sri Lanka captain Chamari Atapattu: Were a bit disappointed that we did not win the series, despite coming very closer in the second game, However, we are taking a lot of confidence out of this series, since, there is clear indication of a turnaround of our teams performances, especially under our new coach Mr. Harsha De Silva. Between the two teams, we did not see much of a difference. We won the third game and lost the second game very narrowly.
We are looking forward to do well in the T20 series, and then move on and further capitalize on what we have achieved in this ODI series, against a very strong Indian team. We had some good outcomes  we are once again working as a team, every individual has started to understand their role and our confidence levels have gone up.
India captain Mithali Raj: We won the series but would have ideally liked a 3-0 score-line to garner maximum points since we had not lost to them in an ODI for five years. I thought we were close to doing that but Chamari produced a fine innings to take the final game away from us. It was a competitive match to cap the series and could have gone either way.

Travel ban on MPs
The Cabinet has taken a decision not to allow government MPs to travel overseas on sitting days of Parliament, a Senior Minister yesterday confirmed. The decision will especially be in force during the month of November when Parliament debates the Budget 2019.
The MPs however will be allowed to travel outside the country for medical and family emergencies.
The decision comes in the wake of several instances of the House being adjourned due to lack of quorum.
Last Thursday, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also raised concerns over the lack of quorum of MPs and urged all the MPs to prevent recurrence of such instances in the future.
In an announcement, Speaker Jayasuriya stressed the importance of maintaining the quorum of 20 MPs during the sittings and pointed out that it is a Legislative responsibility of both the Government and the Opposition members.
Parliament sittings ended due to lack of quorum of 20 MPs on September 6, August 9 and July 19 in the recent months. According to a previous statement made by the Speaker of the House, Parliament spends over Rs. 4.5 million for each sitting.

Water management issues deter investors, says Minister
Water management issues prevailing in various part of Sri Lanka have become an impediment to attracting and sustaining investments, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
At a workshop held under the theme Water Resource Management and Allocation for Drinking Water at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo, the Minister said issues in areas such as Iranamadu and Rajanganaya in the distribution and sharing of water had made it difficult for development partners to plan funding within their loan cycle with a projected possibility.
He said that it is timely to set up an authority to look into these matters and find solutions.
In our country, there is still a lot of water flowing to the sea without serving any purpose. In order to ensure the optimum utilisation of water resources, the difference between various stakeholders had to be rectified, the Minister said.
This workshop, jointly organised by the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry and National Water Supply and Drainage Board, was chaired by Minister Hakeem with the participation of of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake and a number of donor agencies.
The objective of this workshop was to enhance the understanding between the Mahaweli Authority, Irrigation Department and National Water Supply and Drainages Board.
The necessity of planning and coordination of water resources, history of water resource management, and combined water resource management and water distribution are some of the topics that were discussed at the workshop.
An active committee was formed to look into the issues that were raised during the session.

A welcome move
The decision taken by Cabinet to ban government Ministers and MPs from travelling abroad during the period that Parliament is in session, no doubt, will be welcomed by the public, some, albeit, with reservations. Those who belong to the latter category may query as to what gains will they reap even if all the MPs are present in the House given the levels to which Parliament debates have deteriorated, not to mention the foul language and the fisticuffs that are thrown in for good measure.
The recommendation to restrain Government MPs from making overseas trips during the eight days Parliament meets for a month originated from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who had raised concerns about the increasing number of occasions that Parliament had to be adjourned due to lack of a quorum, according to media reports. The President too has expressed his consternation about non-attendance of MPs in Parliament while Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had even taken up the matter with the party leaders after he had to periodically adjourn sittings in the House for want of a quorum.
On one occasion as much as two dozen members of Parliament were abroad at one and the same time which alone speaks for the attitude of MPs towards the country's supreme legislature to which the people elected them to represent their interests. Most often our MPs don't go overseas all by themselves but also take their spouses and family members with them. We once had a Foreign Minister who even went to a country in the north pole in which Sri Lanka had no interests with wife and brood in tow. This Minister was so often overseas that once Parliament had to vote a Supplementary Estimate to meet his foreign travel bills. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was known to travel abroad with huge delegations who were accommodated in super-luxury hotels.
Not just Parliamentarians. The travel bug had now even bitten our Provincial Councillors and Pradeshiya Sabha members. It was only recently that the President had to intervene to stop an en-mass departure abroad of members of the Central Provincial Council on what was billed as a study tour.
There can be no objection to MPs going abroad, providing some benefit is accrued to the country from such visits. What is relevant here is the cost benefit factor. Has the country gained by such visits Sometime back we were told that some MPs had gone to a certain country to study garbage disposal methods in that country. From what we see around us, either the MPs had not learned anything from the trip or this was just another fib to enjoy an all paid for junket abroad.
According to the Cabinet decision, Government MPs are permitted to travel abroad (during sittings days of Parliament) only in case of medical treatment and family emergency. Who will check the veracity of the claims Given the shenanigans of our people's representatives it will be only child's play for them to overcome these obstacles.
Not just the above reasons. All needless travel abroad by MPs should be put a halt to. Some parliamentarians go abroad even for the flimsiest of reasons when the task could be accomplished by our ambassadors and envoys at the other end. It amounts to a sheer waste of tax payers money. There are MPs who go abroad for seminars and workshops while others go on so called study tours. It is moot whether our MPs would have the capacity to absorb anything on these study tours given the recent revelation that over one third of our peoples representatives have not passed their GCE(O/L) exams, some even not going further than Grade 8.
Now that the Cabinet has decided to curtail Ministers overseas visits during Parliament sitting days, measures should also be taken to make it mandatory for all MPs to attend Parliament which coughs up Rs. 4 million of tax payers money for each sitting day. We say this because even when they are not abroad, most MPs don't attend Parliament but merely arrive and sign off to ensure they receive their allowances. Steps should be taken to penalize such MPs who show scant regard for their duties and obligations towards their electors.
During the time of late President Premadasa it was rare for the House to go without a quorum. He left strict instructions that all government MPs be present in the House and answer all criticism leveled by the Opposition. Similarly he wanted all questions raised by the Opposition at the start of the sittings or at adjournment be replied to. This is quite in contrast to what is happening today when Ministers are not present in the House to provide answers, or, most often, even the MP, whose questions remain in the Order Paper, doesn't turn up on the due day.
It is hoped that with this restriction imposed on Government Ministers and MPs, they would pay more attention to the business of Parliament, or, at least ensure that a quorum is maintained, to end the spate premature adjournments that is being witnessed on a regular basis.

As Dr Praneeth Abhayasundara noted, the Buddhist writers have been much neglected over the recent history. Many literary festivals were introduced to recognise artistes of many disciplines, save for creative artistes of Buddhist works. The Buddhist Literary Awards Festival was initiated in 2007 to redress this predicament. A felicitation volume on Professor W S Karunathilaka was also launched to coincide with the event. The work is edited by Senior Professor R M W Rajapaksha, Professor G J S Wijesekara, Senior Lecturer Sudath Senarath, Senior Lecturer Kumudu Nayani Gamage and Lecturer Vindhya Weerawardena.
