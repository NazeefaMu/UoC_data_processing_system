Australia take 2-0 lead after Brisbane win
BRISBANE, FRIDAY: Australia set a new record run chase at the Gabba in Brisbane on Friday as they cruised to a seven wicket victory over India in the second one day international.
After Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and chose to bat, the visitors finished their 50 overs at 308-8, thanks largely to a second successive century from opener Rohit Sharma (124), following his 171 not out in the first ODI in Perth on Tuesday.
But the total always looked too small to defend on a flat Gabba wicket and once Australia's openers Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh put on a 145-run stand, the result never looked in doubt.
Finch and Marsh both scored 71 while captain Steve Smith (46) and George Bailey (76 not out) continued their good form as they guided Australia towards the victory total.
India had some hope when Smith was bowled by Umesh Yadav going for an ugly heave with the score on 244, but Bailey and Maxwell put on 65 runs from only 49 balls to see Australia home with six balls to spare.
India looked to be well in the game as the two Australian openers started slowly, struggling with their timing and placement.
The Indian bowling was far tighter than it had been in Perth and the required run rate began to creep up.
But after the first drinks break the Australians began to attack at every opportunity.
Finch brought up his 50 in the 21st over and Marsh in the 22nd as the two openers began to accelerate.
Finch raced to 71 then tried to smash left arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja over mid-off only to be caught brilliantly in the deep by a diving Ajinkya Rahane.
Marsh was dropped for a third time on 69 in the slips but this time it didn't cost India, as two runs later Ishant Sharma squared him up and he got a leading edge to Virat Kohli at cover.
But Smith and Bailey calmly went about their work and batted India out of the game.
Earlier Sharma's golden run continued with a chanceless century.
He enjoyed big partnerships of 125 with Kohli (59) and 121 with Rahane (89) as the Indians punished a below-par Australian attack.
Although the score was the biggest by an international team in ODIs at the Gabba, the Indians looked headed for a much bigger total until they lost a clatter of wickets in the final few overs.

Celine Dion's husband, manager Rene Angelil dies
CANADA: Celine Dion's husband Rene Angelil, who discovered the Canadian pop diva and long managed her career, died Thursday aged 73, after a struggle with cancer.
Dion announced his passing in a Twitter message, saying: "Rene Angelil passed away this morning at his home in Las Vegas after a long and courageous battle against cancer."
A spokesman for the singer, Marc Olivier, said more information would be given in the coming days, but for now the family wished to be left to mourn in private.
News of Angelil's death triggered an outpouring of sympathy from Dion's fans, with the singer's name trending on Twitter worldwide.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his condolences to Dion and to Angelil's six children, including three from a previous marriage.
Angelil's home city of Montreal announced that flags would be flown at half mast in his honour, as mayor Denis Coderre paid tribute to "a monument of the entertainment world."
Born in Quebec to Lebanese-Syrian immigrants, Angelil started out in music dabbling in yeye -- French 60s music -- before trying his hand at comedy, and finally settling on a career in music management.
As a talent agent, he signed one of the biggest names in Quebec music, Ginette Reno, but the arrangement ended abruptly in 1981, leaving Angelil destitute and desperate.
Just then, another opportunity arose.
At age 12, Dion had recorded a demo tape with her mother and sent it to Angelil. He was so struck by her voice that he signed her to an exclusive management contract -- mortgaging his house to finance her debut album.
"I'd never heard anything like it. For me, it was the most beautiful voice in the world," he would recall in interviews.
The businessman set out to make Dion the biggest singer in the world.
His protegee and future wife went on to become one of pop's music's best-known voices, winning five Grammy awards including for the "Titanic" theme song "My Heart Will Go On," and collaborating with stars from Stevie Wonder to Barbra Streisand.
Behind the scenes, Angelil invested Dion's earnings from concerts and 220 million albums sold worldwide in restaurants, dance clubs and golf courses. He launched clothing lines, perfumes and other Dion branded merchandise, building an empire of wealth for them to share.
"There is no other manager like him," Dion once said. "Ninety-nine point nine percent of what's happened to me (my success) is because of Rene."
In 1994, when she was 19 and he was 45, the couple married in an extravagant wedding ceremony that was televised live in Canada, and splashed all over glossy magazines.
"My mother wanted to kill him," Dion said later.
Eventually the couple landed in Las Vegas where Dion played nearly 1,000 shows, earning her more millions.

Centurion Root, Stokes transform Third Test
JOHANNESBURG, FRIDAY: Joe Root hit a thrilling century for England as he and Ben Stokes transformed the third Test against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium on Friday.
England were 238 for five when the threat of lightning brought an early close on the second day, 75 runs behind South Africa's first innings total of 313. Root was on 106 not out, his ninth Test century. A fifth-wicket partnership of 111 in 78 minutes off 97 balls with Stokes (58) swung the match dramatically in England's favour after a four-pronged South African pace attack had reduced the tourists to 91 for four.
Root and Stokes counter-attacked, posting a fifty partnership off only 35 balls in a match where the average scoring rate had hovered at around three an over on a pitch offering help to the fast bowlers.
Root reached the first half-century of the match off 77 balls with nine fours.
Stokes, who hit a dazzling 258 in the drawn second Test in Cape Town, got a hostile welcome from Morne Morkel, fending a bouncer off his glove for a single.
But in the next over Stokes pulled a short ball from Rabada for six. He reached his fifty off 46 balls and his innings lasted 54 deliveries before he offered a caught and bowled chance to Morkel off a leading edge. Root continued to bat aggressively and reached his century off 126 balls when he punched Chris Morris through the covers for his 16th four.
England got off to a bad start when Kagiso Rabada had Alex Hales caught at second slip for one. It got worse when Hardus Viljoen took a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket, having England captain Alastair Cook caught down the leg side by wicketkeeper Dane Vilas for 18.

Colossal dinosaur cast goes on display in NY
US: A cast and fossils from a brand new species of titanosaur, one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered, went on display on Thursday in New York for the first time.
It comes from a species so newly discovered that its scientific name has not yet been formally released, say the paleontologists who made the extraordinary find in 2014, in Argentina's Patagonia region.
The remains of the giant herbivore, which would have lived 100 million years ago, were excavated in the desert near La Flecha, 135 miles (216 kilometres) west of Trelew, by the Argentinian team.
The colossal exhibit unveiled at the American Museum of Natural History is 122 feet (37.2 metres) long. It is so enormous that its head and neck extend out of the room into a lobby near the elevators.
The animal was a young adult of unknown sex, that would have weighed 70 tons or as much as 10 African elephants, the museum said.
Paleontologist Diego Pol, who helped lead the excavations, told AFP that the discovery was a "once in a lifetime" moment.

Comedian takes office as Guatemala's new President
GUATEMALA: Jimmy Morales, a former TV comic elected Guatemala's new president on a wave of public revulsion against widespread graft, was to take office Thursday in a ceremony attended by leaders from the Americas.
Police were deployed throughout the capital to ensure security for the event.
Invitees included US Vice President Joe Biden, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa and Central American leaders. Spain's former king Juan Carlos also arrived at a military airbase to take part.
Morales, 46, was previously best known for a television role as a country bumpkin who nearly becomes president. Elections on October 25 elevated him to the office of head of state for real, by a landslide, despite having no political experience beyond an unsuccessful run for municipal office in 2011.
His victory was attributed to widespread public disgust with corruption, especially after his predecessor, Otto Perez, was felled by a major graft scandal. Yet his political support is weak, with his conservative FCN-Nacion party holding just 11 seats in the 158-seat Congress.
Thus far, Morales has given few concrete indications of how he intends to make good on his vows to fight corruption, or respond to the country's high murder rate and poverty. "I will work with all my heart and strength not to let you down," he said after his election triumph.
His government is expected to be unveiled hours after the inauguration ceremony, which was pared down on his orders to save money.
The FCN-Nacion party was formed by former military officers, some of them linked to atrocities committed during Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war.
Morales has denied the party has anyone tied to civil war abuses in its ranks. But one of its newly elected lawmakers is Edgar Ovalle, a former officer accused of human rights violations in the war who is fighting prosecutors' efforts to strip him of immunity.

First female driver in Formula One Maria Teresa de Filippis dies aged 89
Maria Teresa de Filippis - the first woman to compete in a world championship Formula One grand prix - has died at the age of 89.
Italian De Filippis started three grand prix races in a privately-entered Maserati 250F, finishing a best place of 10th at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium.
The Naples-born driver also tried to qualify for the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix, and again the following year in a Behra-Porsche, before leaving the sport following the death of team owner Jean Behra later in 1959 and retiring aged just 23.
De Filippis was a founding member of the Maserati Club and also honorary president of the Club Internationale des Anciens Pilotes de Grand Prix F1 for retired drivers.
Former F1 driver Alexander Wurz paid tribute to De Filippis, writing on Twitter: 'We lost another pioneering member of the Motorsport world today, Maria Teresa de Filippis, the first woman to race in F1. RIP' The late Lella Lombardi is the only other woman to start a Formula 1 race, making the grid in 12 grands prix between 1974 and 1976.
Britain's Divina Galica, South African Desire Wilson and Italian Giovanna Amati have also all tried to qualify for the races, but been unsuccessful.

Suffered 32 broken bones in his head
Fraudster Allen Stanford reveals brutal attack in jail
Convicted fraudster Allen Stanford has spoken for the first time about the 'hell' of being locked up in a Florida jail for 110 years after being indicted for masterminding the second-largest Ponzi scheme in history.
Stanford hit the headlines in England in 2008 when he signed a deal with the ECB to play a series of five Twenty20 matches in the Caribbean, worth a combined 10million, in an attempt to raise the profile of the game among young people in the area.
But the following year the Texan was charged with fraud worth $8billion and sentenced to 110 years in jail, causing huge embarrassment to the ECB and Giles Clarke, who was chairman at the time.
Now the former billionaire has spoken for the first time about a brutal attack in prison in 2009 while awaiting trial that left him with 32 broken bones in his head.
Allen Stanford pictured in the aftermath of the 2009 attack in which he suffered 32 broken bones in his head. The Texan former billionaire was jailed for 110 years for his part in an $8bn Ponzi scheme.
In an interview with the BBC from his high-security prison in Florida, the 65-year-old said: 'I was on the phone trying to reach my daughter inside a four-man cell that they had crammed 10 of us into, and I was attacked from behind.
'Some guys slammed my head into a concrete wall, split my skull open and then proceeded to put me in a choke hold... and then they stomped on my face and broke 32 bones in my head and face... 'After my brain swelling went away five days later they did an eight-hour operation to repair the damage. Thirty-two fractures were put back together with mesh and titanium screws. They then put me into a 7 by 6 ft 'hole' - that's the slang we use for the special housing unit where they separate you from everyone else.
'And I was left there for a month to recover and I saw the doctor one time in that 30 days to remove some stitches. I was given no antibiotics and no painkillers. I was put on psychotropic drugs which is the worst thing you can do for someone with a severe brain injury. I had severe concussion and my skull was cracked.
'I was pre-trial, I was presumed innocent... I was denied bail and my treatment, I would call it barbaric.
It was something you'd think you'd receive if you were in North Korea or Iran or Russia or somewhere, but not the US.
'My memory began to go on me... I was having residual bleeding on my temporal lobe which they refused to do an MRI on and refused to give me proper neurological care on.'
Talking about life in prison, Stanford added: 'It's really beyond comprehension when you're in a penitentiary - there's four levels of custody: camp, low, medium - and I'm in the maximum security setting - and I'll just use some penitentiary language here; a penitentiary is violent... and it is a violent existence, and it will test everything you are made of.'
Stanford maintains his innocence and claims he has been made a scapegoat by the US authorities for the financial crisis in 2008.
He said: 'Will I apologise No. Mark my words... I am going to walk out the doors of this place a free man.'
Moving on to cricket, Stanford says he is sorry for the impact his game had on the ECB and English cricket in general.
Stanford was also criticised for what was considered to be inappropriate behaviour around the players' wives and girlfriends during the game.
He added: 'It's very sad. I have nothing but respect for the English cricket board and I love the sport of cricket.
'I'm very sorry. It breaks my heart and there's nothing I can say other than that was not caused by Allen Stanford.
'That was caused by the wrongful prosecution, an over-zealous and wrongful prosecution.'
And on the issue of cavorting with some of the wives and girlfriends of the England players, he said: 'To tell you the truth I don't remember doing that.
'It's one of those blurry blank spots. What I remember is going down there, I didn't know who they were.
I just saw a group of young gals sitting there and they were waving at me and the camera was following me around and they said "come over here and take your picture with us" so I did.
'There was one chair shy of having us all sitting there, so I said "here come sit on my knee", and we were going to take a picture and that was the end of it.
'I had no idea those were the English players' wives and that created quite a bit of an uproar. But I apologised for it.
I went over to the English locker room and I apologised to the guys. I said "look I was just over there having fun with the crowd like I always do, I was just horsing around, I didn't mean anything by it", and they accepted my apology.'

Hawk-Eye: A decade of accuracy
It's probably the one thing that ruffles Roger Federer. Hawk-Eye, the electronic line calling service, which has taken the doubt out of close line calls, adding a bit of drama instead as players and crowd await its result, has weaved itself into the fabric of the sport.
With an admittedly 3.6 mm margin of error, the system which has now entered into its 10th year in the sport, may be loved or loathed, but either way it's here to stay.
Elaborating on its operation, Hawk-Eye senior systems engineer Fares Saudi, who's in the city for Chennai Open says, "We usually arrive about 4-5 days before a tournament to set up the system.
After we've successfully calibrated it, we book the court and we hit several balls close to the line. We measure the mark the ball leaves and compare it to the distance we've successfully tracked. We have to always take this with a pinch of salt because the ball mark that is left on hard court is not actually accurate. What we track is when the ball makes first contact with the ground, the mark will always be between 5-10 mm further than that."
Ruling out any changes to the present non-invasive method of tracking, Saudi adds that the focus is on improving the accuracy further with every passing year.
"When the system was introduced in 2006 the margin for error was around 4 maybe 4.2 mm, well below the ITF standard of 5mm. Now it's 3.6 mm which is a significant improvement.
We are trying to update the way we measure the flatness of the courts and check whether there are any undulations - bumps or ditches in order to be more accurate." The system, however, is rendered insignificant at clay court tournaments, primarily because the mark that ball leaves is quite accurate.
"As soon as the ball touches the clay it leaves a mark. Also the French Open prefers to stick to its traditional methods.
The only issue is when the umpire or player gets confused on which mark it was. Maybe five years from now, or sooner they may opt for Hawk-Eye to avoid this confusion.
At tournaments like Wimbledon where we cannot go by ball mark, we use ultra-motion cameras which capture 500 frames per second."
While Djokovic is quite the pro at it, Federer isn't as dismal at calls as he's portrayed to be, adds Saudi. "Djokovic is very good at challenges. Del Potro is famous for being quite bad, because, I think he doesn't really judge it on the merit of whether the ball was in or out. It's more like does he really want to win the point."
"When a player has zero challenges that's when TV really wants to see where every ball landed," he goes on to add.
On the flip side, the system has probably taken characters out of the sport. Nobody can break a racquet on court without being handed a warning these days.
John McEnroe would, for instance, have never mouthed the often imitated and now immortal line, "You cannot be serious," directed at umpire Edward James' refusal to rule his serve in at the 1981 Wimbledon final.
While Hawk-Eye may have lent on-court decisions a greater measure of accuracy, it has left the sport largely bereft of emotions and moments.

Indonesia on alert as police probe attacks
INDONESIA: Army trucks thundered through Indonesia's capital Friday as authorities boosted security at possible terror targets and probed the suspected Islamic State cell blamed for Jakarta's deadly militant attacks.
Four of the five men killed in suicide and gun assaults Thursday had been identified, and a subsequent search of one of their homes found IS-related evidence, including the group's flag, National police spokesman Anton Charliyan said.
The rapid-fire series of bombings and a shootout between gunmen and police erupted in a busy part of the capital, lined with malls and foreign missions, shocking moderate-Muslim Indonesians and leaving two civilians and five attackers dead.
Authorities in the world's most populous Muslim country have blamed a network of Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia that was forged in the radical jihadist group's war in Syria and Iraq.
"An alert has been imposed throughout Indonesia," said Charliyan.
"National police are on their highest alert, especially in areas considered targets of terror, like police stations, government offices, and embassies, with army backup."
He did not elaborate on the army's role but AFP reporters saw a convoy of a half-dozen military trucks filled with heavily armed troops in central Jakarta.
Stepped-up police security was also seen at some foreign embassies, and officers in Jakarta and on the resort island of Bali patrolled in riot gear and with assault rifles.
Indonesia's worst terror incident in seven years killed five attackers, a Canadian and an Indonesian man, according to police.
Charliyan said the number of injured was revised upward from 20 to 24 -- three foreigners, six police officers and the rest Indonesian civilians.
The attacks spilled out in dramatic fashion on a bustling street at mid-morning, transfixing Indonesia's hyperactive social-media world, as images and videos of the carnage went viral.

S. Korea, China defence officials discuss N. Korea nuclear test
SOUTH KOREA: South Korean and Chinese defence officials met in Seoul on Friday with North Korea's latest nuclear test high on the agenda, as pressure grows on Beijing to take a tougher line with ally Pyongyang.
The director-level talks are held every year, but were completely overshadowed this time around by the North's fourth nuclear test last week, which triggered global condemnation and the promise of fresh UN sanctions.
"The two sides will discuss the security situation on the Korean peninsula, as well as the wider region," a defence ministry official said.
The talks came two days after South Korean President Park Geun-Hye urged China to step up to the plate and support genuinely punitive sanctions that would help bring Pyongyang to heel. "I believe China is aware that if its strong determination is not put into actual, necessary actions, we will not be able to prevent a fifth or sixth nuclear test," Park said.
China is North Korea's chief diplomatic protector and economic benefactor, but traditional ties have become strained as Beijing's patience has worn thin with Pyongyang's behaviour and unwillingness to rein in its nuclear weapons ambitions.
But China's leverage over Pyongyang is mitigated, analysts say, by its overriding fear of a North Korean collapse and the prospect of a reunified, US-allied Korea directly on its border.
US Secretary of State John Kerry has also urged China to take a stronger line with North Korea, warning in a call to his Beijing counterpart last week that it can no longer be "business as usual".
North Korea says the January 6 test was of a miniaturised hydrogen bomb -- a claim largely dismissed by experts who argue the yield was far too low for a full-fledged thermonuclear device.
But whatever the nature of the device, it was North Korea's fourth nuclear test since 2006, and further evidence of Pyongyang's intention to continue developing its nuclear weapons capability in the face of international censure..

Three-way split for winners of record US $1.6 b lottery
US: Three winning tickets in California, Florida and Tennessee are to split the profits of a world record $1.6 billion lottery jackpot drawn in the United States and watched live by millions.
The winning numbers were 4, 8, 19, 27 and 34, drawn from five white balls, and 10 as the so-called Powerball number on a red ball, capping weeks of frenzied ticket buying for the record jackpot.
The odds of winning were at least one in 292 million, but so great was the mania that lottery executives warned people not to splurge life savings or retirement plans on what they called cheap entertainment.
The three-way split means that each ticket holder is entitled to $528.8 million -- which they can either choose to claim in a one-off cash payment or receive in annual payments for 29 years. That means that Gloria Mackenzie, an 84-year-old woman from Florida, still holds the record as the highest individual winner in a Powerball jackpot after her solo ticket scooped $590.5 million in May 2013. "It's official! There were three jackpot-winning tickets in tonight's Powerball draw: California, Florida & Tennessee," California Lottery tweeted.
The bonanza payout was the result of 20 Powerball draws with no overall winner and had started at a modest $40 million on November 7.
Swarms of people, many cheering and chanting, descended on the Los Angeles convenience store where the California ticket was sold, local television stations reported. There was a windfall too for Balbir Atwal, owner of a 7-Eleven franchise in Chino Hills, a Los Angeles suburb, who will pocket a $1 million bonus for selling a winning ticket.
"I didn't expect this big crowd but my Chino Hills customers love me, and I love them," he told CNN, grinning broadly.
In the southern state of Tennessee, the winning ticket was bought in Munford, a small town of just 5,000 residents, northeast of Memphis.

Tyson Fury named fighter of the year by Ring magazine
Tyson Fury has been named Fighter of the Year by influential boxing publication Ring magazine after he dethroned world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko.
Fury travelled to Dusseldorf in Germany last November and made the Ukrainian look every one of his 39 years as he earned a unanimous points decision. Fury's fellow British world champion Anthony Crolla and his coach Joe Gallagher were also recognised in the annual awards.
Tyson Fury's achievement has been recognised by influential boxing publication Ring magazine.
Crolla said he was 'honoured' to be named 'Most Inspirational' boxer after recovering from a fractured skull and broken ankle sustained chasing two burglars to first draw with and then defeat Darlys Perez to win the WBA lightweight crown.
As well as Crolla, Gallagher coaches world champions Scott Quigg and Liam Smith and the latter's brothers Paul, Stephen and Callum and was named 'Trainer of the Year'.
He said: 'Thank you for the award.
Absolutely flattered and speechless to win this after buying magazine for years.'
Fury was given little chance of beating Klitschko who had not lost since 2004.
But despite the frustration of seeing the fight postponed and rescheduled, he dominated in front of more than 50,000 fans.
Since then however the traveller was stripped of the IBF title after he was unable to fulfil his mandatory obligation due to a rematch clause with Klitschko.
That means the WBO and WBA belts will be on the line when the two touch gloves again later this year. Fury tweeted on Monday: 'Can't believe it. OMG. So proud.'
He follows in the footsteps of fellow Brit Ricky Hatton who won the award in 2005 while the 27-year-old's victory was also named 'Upset of the Year'.
Fury saw off competition from Canelo Alvarez, Gennady Golovkin, Roman Gonzalez and Floyd Mayweather to win the main award. Mayweather, who retired after beating Andre Berto last September, did win 'Event of the Year' along with Manny Pacquiao for their May 2 fight.
With the long-awaited clash smashing through the four million pay-per-view barrier, Mayweather banked more than $200million with Pacquiao not far behind.
