To live by homegrown medicines
The World Health Organization estimates that over two third of rural population of developing countries rely on traditional medicines, mostly plant drugs, for their primary health care needs. Also, modern pharmacopoeia contains over 25% drugs derived from plants and many others which are synthetic parallels built on prototype compounds isolated from plants.
If we take Sri Lanka, we find four systems of traditional medicine have been adopted: Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Deshiya Chikitsa. The Ayurveda and Deshiya Chikitsa systems use mainly plant and herbal preparations for the treatment of diseases - the former uses about 2,000 species, the latter about 500. The plants are used singly or as mixtures.
We also witness a rapid growth of interest in traditional medicine in Sri Lanka due to two major reasons: first, the interest shown by both rural and urban people in complementary medicine and secondly, the interest shown by both local and foreign pharmaceutical industry for their input requirements. At the same time, the overharvesting of medicinal plants to serve national and international markets, raise the need for new national policies which should integrate health, environmental and economic perspectives.
Therefore, investments are needed for the development of appropriate cultivation and harvesting strategies which will simultaneously meet the demand for locally available medicinal plants. Simultaneously, there must be immediate effort to ensure the conservation of diverse biological resources and the preservation and application of local cultural knowledge on the use of these resources.
Survey
This writer believes that any systematic conservation and harvesting of local medicinal plants should start from basics. First, we should have a clear understanding of both the supply issues and the factors driving the demand. We also should find out the extent of the current and future medicinal plant market. Without this basic knowledge, we cannot plan for both the conservation and sustainable use of the habitats of the medicinal plants.
In early 2014, a group of four Sri Lankan experts investigated the current situation of countrys medicinal plant industry by gathering up-to-date information on the types of raw materials required, their aggregate quantities, heavily used and rare materials, family wise distribution, challenges faced by stakeholders as well as other pertinent issues. Their report was issued under the caption  A survey on medicinal materials used in traditional systems of medicine in Sri Lanka.
The result of their report was very revealing. They listed a total of 302 plant species belonging to 95 families, dominated by Leguminosae family. Out of these, 46 species belonging to 35 families were used intensively. A large portion of herbal materials was of completely local origin (71.13%) while 26% were imported and the rest (2.87%) can be obtained by both routes. Leaves were the most highly used part of the plant (22.2%). High price, poor quality, insufficient or totally absence of continuous supply and adulteration were the main constraints faced by the stakeholders. The unavailability of systematic cultivation and processing protocols, incorrect identification, and lack of proper quality control methodologies were identified as major challenges of the industry.
Their conclusion was that the scenario of the medicinal material industry in Sri Lanka was bleak. The results clearly demonstrated the need to implement a national strategy to address the major challenges faced by different stakeholders.
One reason why the development of existing conservation systems has been hindered was due to the non-availability of up-to-date information on medicinal materials and other related issues. The writer believes that this information could be effectively incorporated for the formulation of a sustainable development strategy for this industry.
Constraints
While addressing the policy issues, there is a need to highlight various factors like constraints, traditional knowledge and indigenous uses, marketing and trade, patent, quality control/standards etc.
Our medicinal plants sector is facing many constraints:- (1) Rapid depletion of the resource-base, due to many reasons, mostly man inflicted (2) Impoverishment of rural people, (who are stewards of the resource base and the holders of traditional ecological and medical knowledge), due to inequitable marketing channels, (3) Inefficient, imperfect and opportunistic medicinal plant trade, (4) Exploitative and adulterated drugs supply situation, (5) Deficient toxicology studies and standard preparations to improve the quality, efficacy and effectiveness of the traditional drugs, (6) Unsustainable wild-harvesting. (7) Lack of coordination amongst various stakeholders, particularly, Ministries of Health, Agriculture, Environment, Forestry, Science and Technology, and also Provincial Governments, private traditional medicine sector, research institutes, NGOs etc.
Any National Policy should give serious thought to settle these basic issues.
Benefits
Given the present bleak situation, it is advisable for the Government to develop a strong commitment to develop a National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines. In fact, some time ago, a policy dialogue was initiated regarding medicinal plant conservation and statements of support for such a policy were forthcoming from many of the stakeholders in the sector, including the private companies which depend upon a continuous source of raw material supply.
This dialogue needs to be continued more vigorously so that with the joint support of governmental, non-governmental and private sector, the process of developing and enacting a national policy on medicinal plants can be completed.
In this writers opinion, any national policy for sustainable development of medicinal plants resource should aim to:- (a) Conserve medicinal plants in protected areas, herbal gardens, sacred groves, preserve plots and forest areas rich in medicinal plants, (b) Conserve through cultivation, Joint Forest Management, gene banks etc, (c) Develop medicinal plant conservation areas inside as well as outside protected areas, (d) Research and development efforts for developing agro-techniques, extension and dissemination of information on cultivation of super genotypes. (e) Establish linkages between farmers and pharmaceutical industries for promotion of organic and contract farming, (f) Formalise efficient marketing techniques by providing information and possible interventions at various levels. (g) Formalise systems to resolve the problems of exploitation.
Marketing
The policy should intensively cover the field of marketing. In the medicinal plant industry, the various actions needed include: setting up of a national level authority, responsive marketing cooperatives, organisation of formal market, dissemination of market information, creation of international market opportunity etc.
Quality Control/Standards
Another important factor is quality control and standards. This constitutes an area where policy should be very specific. A nationally recognised set of quality control standards should be developed for the preparation of traditional medicine. This step would pose serious challenges as traditional medicine often contains a number of constituent plants, unlike allopathic medicines.
Some of the unique aspects of traditional medicinal preparation that would need to be considered include specific means of identifying and collecting constituent plants, including seasons for collections and appropriate age of plants, ecological origins, cleanliness in processing and adherence to documented procedures in the ancient texts of relevance.
It is important to ensure that the plants used as medicines are not toxic in any way. This is therefore, one area in which modern technology can be of great service. In addition, standard preparations need to be developed to make quality efficacy and effectiveness of the traditional drugs.
Institutional framework
All these suggestions look nice on paper. But, in order to make them effective there should be a solid institutional framework. This writer firmly believes that we should have a separate Ministry to administer traditional medicine. In this aspect, we can learn a lesson from India.
India has a separate ministry called The Ministry of AYUSH to ensure the optimal development and propagation of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy healthcare systems. It was formed in November 2014. The Ministry focuses its attention for development of Education and Research in all five healthcare systems.
The Ministry is in the process of drafting a new National Policy on AYUSH, incorporating National AYUSH Mission, bringing out Minimum Standard Requirements on Ayurveda, amendments in various Acts concerning AYUSH, enhancing quality of traditional medical education through Regulatory Bodies, provision of infrastructural facilities for drug industry to ensure safety and efficacy of AYUSH drugs etc.
Vacuum
Medicinal plants sector in Sri Lanka today is operating in policy vacuum. Immediate action is therefore needed to produce clearly defined policies to regulate medicinal plants conservation, cultivation, marketing and trade, exports, domestic drug production and coordination efforts and information.
While it is true that indigenous healing does not have all the answers that Western medical science is perceived to have, it is also true that Western medicine does not have all the answers for diseases found among Asian and African peoples.
Any National Policy, therefore, should focus on unlocking the indigenous knowledge imbedded in the practice of indigenous healing and on the interaction of the two medical systems (Western and indigenous) for the benefit of the people.

Nadal, Djokovic launch French Open assaults
PARIS, MONDAY: Record nine-time winner Rafael Nadal and title-holder Novak Djokovic set off Monday ahead of a French Open collison course, while champions past and present meet in the womens first round.
Nadal is bidding to become the first player in the Open era to win 10 titles at any Grand Slam event, with a spectacular return to form in 2017 once more marking the Spaniard out as this years Roland Garros favourite.
Three clay-court titles at Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid suggest the 30-year-old is poised to end a three-year drought at majors -- his last Grand Slam triumph came in Paris in 2014.
But the fourth seed is aware of the threat posed by mercurial Frenchman Benoit Paire, who will have considerable support on Court Suzanne Lenglen.
He is not an opponent you want to play against in the first round. A player with big talent. Great serve, great hands and fantastic backhand, said Nadal.
Hes a dangerous opponent. I need to play my best. Nadals long-time nemesis Djokovic will look to draw inspiration from new coach Andre Agassi, the 1999 French Open champion, as the Serb begins the defence of his crown.
This time a year ago Djokovic was on his way to completing a career Grand Slam, holding all four major titles at the same time following his maiden success in Paris.
New inspiration
But a drastic dip in performances, including a shock second-round loss at the Australian Open, left Djokovic scrambling to stop his career from hitting the skids. A chance phone call led to Djokovic sounding out Agassi, who agreed to work with the Serb on a temporary basis -- but only after persuasion from his wife and former tennis legend Steffi Graf.
Hes someone that inspires me a lot, said Djokovic.
Thats one of the things I felt like I needed is new inspiration, someone that knows exactly what Im going through, on the court, off the court.
He has been through all these transitions, he has been in my shoes before playing Grand Slams, being the best in the world, and facing all the challenges that are present in tennis, in professional sport. The world number two will open against 65th-ranked Marcel Granollers of Spain, and although a semi-final showdown with Nadal is on the cards, Djokovic refused to look beyond the first hurdle.
You start a tournament from the same line with everyone else. You fight for the trophy, as everybody does. Thats the way I approach it, said Djokovic.
Alexander Zverev downed Djokovic in Rome to become the first player born in the 1990s to land a Masters title.
The German, seeded ninth, begins his campaign against veteran Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, appearing at Roland Garros for the 14th time.
10 to 15 contenders
Reigning womens champion Garbine Muguruza arrives in Paris with just three clay-court wins this year, all of which came in Rome before a neck injury forced her out of the semi-finals.
She faces an early examination of her credentials against 2010 champion Francesca Schiavone, 37 next month and set to retire at the end of the season. Its very strange to find first round two past champions, said Muguruza, who defeated Serena Williams in last years final.
With Williams, Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka all absent, and world number one Angelique Kerber crashing out on Sunday, Muguruza knows the opportunity is there for a number of players.
I feel like there is 10, 15 girls that can win the trophy, she said.
Second seed Karolina Pliskova figures to be among those in contention, but the Czech has won just two matches on five previous visits.

NDB committed to backing women entrepreneurs
NDB recently held its third consecutive workshop on Empowerment of Small Scale Women Entrepreneurs in Matale. The programme was aimed towards empowering women in the area to participate fully in building financial stability.
The objective was to ensure the inclusion of womens talents, skills and energies in developing sustainable livelihood for their families and communities.
This programme was initiated by the NDB Microfinance Unit and NDB Matale Branch. NDB makes every effort to see mirco level entrepreneurs get to the next level and this was one initiative to help them do so.
Today, women are seen as key contributors in decision making and are actively marking their presence in the entrepreneurial industry.
Microfinance services have become an important tool as they start contributing to the economy by providing support to uplift and encourage especially women. Over the years, many organizations have worked towards empowering women and have seen positive growth in their skills through the support of microfinance in most parts of the country.
Present-day women are recognized as an imperative catalyst in economic rejuvenation, especially in developing countries. Thus NDB takes every effort to provide constant encouragement and propel financial guidance for Sri Lankan women with a determination to grow in their life.
A special guest at this workshop was Srimathi Sandya, Proprietor of Neat Fashion, Kandy, who started off at the micro level. She spoke of her path to success and shared her experiences of being a female entrepreneur.
As women we must learn how to be determined and not let problems let you down, to be successful in any business one must never compromise on the quality and keep developing what you do Shalika Priyangani - Micro Finance Officer of NDB, in her presentation, discussed on how to improve knowledge on financial information and financial security. The problem starts when you dont know what happens to the money you earn. It is important that you discuss with the Bank on ways to make most of your savings without having to use your capital to pay up loans
The workshop also included a special discussion by Dr. JayanthaWijesekara  Pediatrician, Matale Base Hospital, on how to secure a good health. The participants were given invaluable health tips and advice on how to avoid Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, Heart Disease and about developing good health habits amongst children.

## Title: Need of an inter-religious dialogue

Need of an inter-religious dialogue
Religions imbue the people with principles and values particular to each religion. People who have imbibed these from ages past, transmit them to their progeny and they endure through the centuries. People of different religions live side by side tolerant of one another in solidarity and in peace and at times in conflict. Conflict over religion is the worst of conflicts. Without making room for the rule of law we will never be able to protect or even assure the dignity of all our human lives. Any harm done by someones thought, word or deed may seem unintended. Harm sometimes seems not purposefully done. Yet injury is injury. And injury, especially injury under cover of religion, should never be allowed.
POLITICAL NEUTRALITY OF TOLERANCE
As for tolerance, we are too tolerant of all the wrong things: bribery, corruption, fraudulence, procrastination, unpunctuality, inattentiveness, inaccuracy, indifference, inefficiency, laziness, neglect, dirtiness, despotism, nepotism, favouritism and dishonesty.
We describe ourselves as a tolerating or tolerant people. Tolerance is like a virtue of tolerating a person or people, a religion or culture we do not like. But when you examine tolerance, it seems an indifferent or a negative attitude. Diverse perspectives of life exist among human beings. We just let them be. Others dont matter to us. Most of us dont do any positive harm to others, nor do we do any positive good. We repel any desire to proscribe any activity disagreeable to us as long as it does not physically fetter us.
We show indifference to the public wrong and social harm others do, do we not even under legal cover Wrongful damage may however take place: the positive good such as upholding the law is neglected, punishment to wrong doers is delayed and omitted. There are groups of trouble makers who disturb the peace and hide themselves in a cowardly manner when the law catches up with them. Intellectual approach has little effect on them as they are moved by prejudice and frenzied emotion. Vacillation on the part of the powers that be encourage the anarchists to fish in troubled waters.
In general we think of tolerance as a virtue even though we are uninterested, uncaring, unsympathetic and unmoved by the ignorance, poverty, hunger and thirst, helplessness and indigence of the other. Perhaps, we may not consider him or her a brother or sister or even as a neighbour.
Nevertheless, every individual is independent, autonomous and self-determining and deserves respect. The idea that one should be free and let others too be free is generally accepted. Yet that no one should coerce anyone else to act one way or another as regards ones decisions, beliefs, while it is accepted today among some urbanized and cultured people, is not accepted by some others, even among urbanized and educated people.
Everyone should be accorded the rights of human dignity and the freedom to know and follow ones own interests and pursue ones own way of life according to one's own informed conscience; so each should be tolerated by others.
Tolerance brings about political neutrality on the part of those in political authority and does not control the religious activities of citizens as long as such activity does not become a public annoyance and an exasperation in the public square. In this sense, certain trade union as well as political and religionist activities are an absolute public nuisance.
INTERRELIGIOUS DIALOGUE
Religions have religious scriptures, traditional teachings, ethics and morals, rites, celebrations, peaceful public proclamations and demonstrations, patterns of behaviour and motivations behind them.
In the context of Sri Lanka and many countries of the world, inter-religious dialogue is of crucial importance. In inter-religious dialogue one discovers a world view, the Weltanschauung, particular to each religion. In sincere dialogue we discover that which is good, true, beautiful and holy in other religions and begin to appreciate it.
What Pope Benedict said in August 2005 to the representatives of Muslim Communities in Cologne, Germany is very relevant to us also. He stressed the need to approachinter-religious and intercultural dialogue with optimism and hope. It cannot be reduced to an optional extra. On the contrary it is a vital necessity on which in large measure our future depends. He was not just expressing an opinion but speaking as Pope, he was stating the public stand of the Catholic Church on the matter.
When religious leaders see to inter-religious dialogue seeping down to the ordinary rank and file of the followers of the four main and even other religions of our country, they will come to be more open to the believers in religions other than their own and come to appreciate that which makes those followers good persons who go after what is true and beautiful. Each one also needs to be aware that dialogue is between persons who are not perfect at all.
Pope Benedict XVI had written when he was yet a Cardinal, What is required is reverence to the others belief along with the willingness to seek truth in what I find alien  a truth that concerns me and that can correct me and lead me further. What is required is to look behind what may appear strange in order to find the deeper reality in concrete.
I must also be willing to let my narrow understanding of truth be broken open to learn my own beliefs better by understanding the other, and in this way to let myself be furthered on the path to God, who is greater  in the certainty that I never wholly possess the truth about God and am always a learner before it, a pilgrim whose ways to it is never at an end. (Instead of God, some use Absolute).
Truth and beauty are simply too profound, too transcendent, to infinite, too immense, too unfathomable, for any one person or one people, no matter which religion they belong to, to possess fully.
Simply put we need one another in our research for what is good and holy, for what is true and beautiful. But the teaching is also meant to expose those who approach dialogue in an opportunistic spirit for personal gain, and not just in the area of worldly politics but also in the world of religious politics. (Edward J. Alam, since 1996, Professor in the Faculty of Humanities of Notre Dame University, Louaize, Lebanon. Vidyajyoti Journal of theological Reflection, May 2016, p. 383).
In any community, teachings of the Religions, based on right reason, is important and cannot be overlooked. On right reason depends on the direction of the scientific culture and technological societies and even professional associations, political establishments and governments that control and direct the socio-economic, banking and financial, trade and commercial development system. Any system could be turned away from inevitably possible evil and much harm and injustice to people only through the intervention of ethics and morals emanating from religious norms and guidance.
Advanced human sciences too need the guidance of ethics and morals to stay on course lest they drift to totalitarian despotism to provide solutions to human problems by unacceptable methods of social engineering. When religions themselves and religious leaders depart from ethics and morals and teach in their schools distorted principles, norms, standards and social models, public chaos can result. Even terrorism is justified by some religious leaders and this is unacceptable.
RELIGIONS TURNING EVIL
It is therefore important that through interreligious dialogue, religions remain unsullied, uncontaminated by misreading, misinterpreting, misunderstanding the scriptures and the teaching of the doctrine over the centuries and by impurities of the practices of adherents accumulated through the ages.
One should be ready to accept that where flawed human beings convene together, discuss, decide and act, and adopt a system of doctrine or belief, or even any law they could fall short of good understanding, make mistakes, commit blunders and decide badly, accumulate customs and traditions that could ultimately lead them to uphold and follow falsehood, do wrong, even gather filth, commit injustice, lead others into long lasting error and sad estrangement.
This happens not because the precious pearls of the religions have lost their lustre, but because flawed human beings in their pride and arrogance have perverted idealism and covered the pearls with the mud, dirt and the filth of their own lives and visions. This has happened in the history of religions and it is happening today.
Religions can veer away from her pristine path under corrupt political patronage which extends economic support sometimes and exerts subtle pressure on religious leaders to compromise on principles of religion and religious positions. It is indeed a tragedy when religions themselves turn to evil, and drive some adherents to practice evil and commit crime and shed blood, and in the name and authority of religion, cause sad tears to flow from the eyes of the innocent men, women and children.
This is happening not only among the ISIS but it is also happening among Sri Lankan citizens because some notorious religionists force themselves into the establishments of others, disrupt government departments and disturb even courts of law disregarding not only courtesy and good behaviour but even the tenets of their own religion, the guidance of their own leaders and the law of the land. They interpret all other positions contrary to their rigid stand and the law of the land itself as arbitrary impositions and therefore disregard it.
What can cleanse such practice of religion and the adherents of such a religion If the religious leaders wish to incorporate into their religion an expression with a character alien to and in disharmony with its original essence and rightful heritage, what can restore it to its pristine self and authority If the salt loses its flavour, what can make it salt again It is only fit to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. (Gospel of Matthew Ch.9, v 50)
AUTONOMY, RECOGNITION
Religions are not a substitute in place of the knowledge of truth and empirical knowledge through human sciences and of civil law. Sciens in Latin means the knower and scientia means knowledge. Though religions have inspired education and the establishment of higher institutes of learning, the widening and deepening of knowledge and understanding, religions are not a substitute for universities of the arts, the various sciences, medical science, law, sociology, economics, banking, financial and commerce studies, which should maintain their own autonomy.
Autonomy does not mean they are independent of all or any human approach. In serving humanity, they need to dialogue with human beings.
Then there is the occurrence and manifestation of recognition. One is recognized in a bus or train, in the market place, in a crowd, as someone dedicated to a cause, as a seeker, as a friend, a fellow pilgrim on the journey of life. Recognition also helps identify and name who we are and what value is shown in our regard.
And so in a multicultural, multi religious, multi lingual society one could focus on recognizing, accommodating and respecting a variety of different values that enhance society.
RELIGIONS DIALOGUE STABILIZES
Dialogue is a discussion, an exchange of views between two persons or groups of persons, often on matters of mutual interest.
Today a wide range of dialogue on a variety of topics takes place in the newspapers, in the mass communications media.
A conversation rooted in religions could take place an ideas exchanged on views on religions, religious doctrines and teachings. Religions place is in society, not confined to the enclosure of the place of worship.
Co-existence among religions, cooperation between religious persons, religions promoting community understanding, social justice, stability and peace come about through the right practice of ones religion. Propagation of any religion should never become a conflict-creating competition; friction need not arise in religious persuasion.
Distortionists of religion tend to undermine truth, justice and fairness and other human values to collect followers to their religious tradition. Distortionists arbitrarily distort the interconnection between fundamental principles of a religion and propagate half truths.
The purpose of inter-religious dialogue should be to come to a better mutual knowledge and understanding of the religion and beliefs of other adherents; dialogue is coming to a deeper comprehension, a deeper appreciation of what is good and true, what is of value, what is to be upheld and preserved today and for posterity.
Dialogue helps us to discover in the other the good and the true that we do not have; through dialogue we come to rediscover the good and the true and the holy that we have but have neglected to esteem and appreciate sufficiently. In dialogue we discover the beauty manifested in the other, perhaps in a different form and come to aesthetically appreciate what others treasure.
Through dialogue, all differences, reservations, tensions, dislikes, aversions, doubts and questions, suspicions and worries are not going to disappear. To the extent the climate in which we come together gradually gets cleansed of pollution, becomes unadulterated and purer, to that extent dialogue becomes mutually beneficial to all. Occasions of dialogue establish openness and a mutual availability to speak and to listen, and enhance human solidarity and friendship.
TRUTH OF THE MATTER
Through dialogue we could come to mutually rediscover and uphold common truths that we value. We could come to recognize that we could live according to the truths we uphold. We could come to recognize that we should avoid inter-religious conflict; and that where there could arise tension, we should patiently discern what is true, just and fair and what promotes the common good of all.
We cannot live in unity and peace if we continue to remain unrecognized and unreconciled. We all nurture a hope in our hearts  to be truly free from tension and threat and to be at ease, to be content and to be at peace. Dialogue could become a socially energizing adventure.
In spite of the Government promoting reconciliation, there are government party elements and government servants who in their prejudice and ignorance willfully deny the rights of people and sow dissension and animosity. In spite of the Government declaring zero tolerance for sowing religious animosity, animosity is sown in society today. This has happened at Aluthgama; it is happening, for example, at Siyambalanduwa, Moneragala. The Government has to call some UNP-SLFP party members to order and sanity, because here and there a prominent party man and his followers who are indeed politically insane are moved to unlawfully interfere in civil administration!
Yet people look beyond stupid politicians. And they hope against hope, in the context of present reality which at times is frustrating to say the least. Government should govern and not let rash party men run riot.

New hues on the Block
Bright eyes, bright lips and bright cheeks  Thats colour blocking for you! Slash out the most important rule of make-up and just dive in to one of the biggest trends of the season!
Colour blocking is an understated trend. The most recent celebrity to sport it was Aishwarya Rai Bachchan at the Cannes Film Festival. Amping things up with her blue eyes and tangerine lips! The look made headlines, and set tongues wagging  despite how a volley of people loved and loathed it, the look didnt go unnoticed. And, irrefutably, the look has caught every beauty enthusiasts fancy. The reasons to try out colour blocking are aplenty: It accentuates every feature of your face. If you like standing out in a crowd, colour blocking your makeup is the way to go and it lets you experiment with a riot of bright colours!
While the look isnt easy to sport, its well-worth a try. But, you ought to follow a few guidelines in order to not make a beauty blunder. It is important to adhere to a list of contrasts, as per your skin tone:
Fair skin tone: People with fairer to wheatish skin tone can always do a match of bright eyes (red, yellow, electric blue) and deep/dark lips (maroon, brown, purple). Bright eyes and bright lips might look great, but could get a tad bit loud!
Dusky skin tone: Wheatish complexion can carry off any match! But the sexiest would be a match of deep/dark eyes (maroon, bottle green, dark blue) and deep lips or bright lips (red, pink, purple)
Dark skin tone: With colour blocking, the darker the skin tone the more fun it becomes! Dark skin tone, anything goes! Bright eyes with bright lips, dark eyes with dark lips or a mix and match of both!
Remember the skin tone is hardly the thing to worry about when it comes to make-up, especially colour blocking. Keep in mind other things which can help you slay your look! For example, your eye colour, sharpness of your eyebrows and thickness of your lipstick.

No epidemic so far
No epidemic has been reported from flood affected areas in the country or any other area so far. However, the people should pay extra attention towards the safety of their food and water during these days, acting Director of the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry Consultant Virologist Dr. Samitha Ginige told the Daily News yesterday.
According to Dr. Ginige, the public should drink boiled and cooled water, and eat home-cooked meals as much as possible. Meals should be taken as soon as it is cooked. Food should be stored in clean containers and they should completely covered without letting flies contaminate them.
Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap after using the toilet, before cooking meals, before taking meals etc. All fruits and raw vegetables should be thoroughly washed with clean water before consuming. Eating green leaves, salads and other raw vegetables is discouraged during these days, he said. Requirements for flood victims such as chlorine, cleaning chemicals, Doxycycline tablets to prevent rat fever etc are now available with all PHIs, MOHs and OPDs of State hospitals in the affected areas free of charge, he said.
People should not contact with contaminated flood water because they can get infected with rat fever. Wells should be properly cleaned before re-using.

Noren buoyed for major challenge
WENTWORTH Monday: Sweden's Alex Noren believes his win in the European PGA Championship at Wentworth on Sunday puts him in with a chance in the season's three remaining major championships.
Noren shot a 10-under-par 62 to claim the title -- coming from seven shots off the pace -- to land the European Tour's flagship event, his fifth win in less than a year.
The 34-year-old missed the cut in the US Masters in April and has only one top-10 finish in a major to his name -- ninth in the British Open in 2012 at Royal Lytham.
But Noren, who will move into the top 10 in the world rankings after his win, says his confidence is high heading into next month's US Open at Erin Hills, Wisconsin.
This tournament in my mind compares a lot with a major, he said after his win on Sunday.
What I wanted to do is play better against a better field and better courses, tougher courses. And I view this as a very difficult course against a very tough field.
So then this is very close to a major in my mind. So my confidence goes up.
It's just work towards your goals and trying to kind of improve on my weaknesses and improve on my strengths, and trying to figure out where I'm losing shots and where I'm gaining shots.
But overall, a win like this brings your confidence up, and that's what I've always needed, to believe in myself, and then it's easier to focus on what you need to do. Noren was plagued by a wrist injury before winning four tournaments in 11 starts last year but says his biggest battle in golf was keeping the ball on the fairway.
He added: I never had a good game off the tee. So I was always quite worried where the ball was heading and I couldn't really play really difficult golf courses well.
That's what I worked the hardest on, to get the ball somehow on the fairway a bit more often.
I think that gives me a little bit more calmness, and then I can concentrate on the whole game and not just worry that I'm going to send a few out-of-bounds every round.
When I was injured, I always knew I was coming back to some sort of form. But maybe it made me think a little bit more to train a little bit smarter.  -AFP

North Korea fires missile into Japans maritime economic zone
SOUTH KOREA: North Korea test-fired a missile Monday into Japans maritime economic zone -- the latest in a series of provocative launches that have ratcheted up tensions over its nuclear weapons ambitions.
It was the Norths third ballistic missile test in as many weeks and the 12th this year -- carried out in defiance of UN sanctions warnings and US threats of possible military action.
US military monitors said the short-range missile flew for six minutes, while Japan said it fell into the countrys exclusive economic zone (EEZ) -- waters extending 200 nautical miles from its coast.
The launch comes in fresh defiance of tough talk from US President Donald Trump, who promised last week at the G7 summit that the big problem of North Korea will be solved.
Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe swiftly condemned the test and vowed concerted action along with its US ally.
We will never tolerate North Koreas continued provocations that ignore repeated warnings by the international community, Abe told reporters.
As agreed during the G7 summit, the North Korean problem is the international communitys top priority. In order to deter North Korea, we will take concrete action with the United States. The North has been stepping up efforts towards its ultimate goal -- developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that can deliver a nuclear warhead to the continental US.
The isolated but nuclear-armed North has test-fired a missile almost every week for the past three weeks.
The latest, a short-range Scud, flew about 450 kilometres (280 miles) before landing in the Sea of Japan (East Sea) between the Korean peninsula and Japan, the US Pacific Command said.
Mondays test also marked the second time this year that a North Korean missile fell provocatively close to its neighbour Japan.
Despite Trumps strident warnings, Secretary of Defense James Mattis said in an interview that aired Sunday before the launch that a war with North Korea would be catastrophic. The North Korean regime has hundreds of artillery cannons and rocket launchers within range of one of the most densely populated cities on Earth, which is the capital of South Korea, he told CBS News.
This regime is a threat to the region, to Japan, to South Korea. And in the event of war, they would bring danger to China and to Russia as well.
But the bottom line is, it would be a catastrophic war if this turns into a combat, if were not able to resolve this situation through diplomatic means. Mattis declined to say what kind of action from Pyongyang would constitute a red line for Washington, saying the administration needs political manoeuvre room.
South Koreas new president, Moon Jae-In, ordered a meeting of the national security council to assess the launch, which came a day after North Korea said its leader Kim Jong-Un had overseen a test of a new anti-aircraft weapons system.
The South condemned the test as a grave threat and a challenge to the new leader who advocates dialogue with the North in a break from his conservative predecessors.
That the North repeated such provocations after the inauguration of our new leadership... is a direct challenge to our demand for peace and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, the foreign ministry said.
The missile launches, and Pyongyangs threat to stage its sixth nuclear test, have prompted calls for tougher UN sanctions and a warning from Trump that military intervention was an option under consideration.- AFP

Notes from the heart
Down to earth Shashika Nisansala has it all. Success, beauty, talent and commitment. Her journey started around 17 years ago, as a young woman taking part in a singing contest. Her victory at that contest showed her promise and potential.
I feel that my musical talent is inherent coming from my paternal line. Without my understanding from my youngest days I have been able to sing from the time I could talk. My father too had the inborn ability to sing, but he did not have the opportunity to develop this talent into a vocation, and he was very keen that I really develop my talent and become a professional singer. He did not just want me to become a singer but one who had received training as one. This was his dream.
My father received his education in the science field, but was not able to realize his own potential to sing due to the fact that he did not have a teacher. And he was not able to really progress in the field and develop his inborn talent. Not only did he have this talent but he had the aptitude of playing musical instruments as well. My father worked as a technical officer in an engineering department. He had this passion and love for music, yet followed a very different path, said Shashika
Shashika has been influenced by some of the greats in the Sri Lankan Music industry.
I grew up listening to Sujatha Attanayakes songs, since I loved that style of music and the timbre of her voice and the lyrics themselves. Then I listened to Deepika Priyadharshani, Nanda Malini and Nirosha Virajini. So I developed a liking for these distinct patterns. At the age of nine or 10 I learnt music as a subject. I have this passion for music which I can only describe as inborn, stated Shashika
The singing contest Thurunu Shakthi provided the platform for Shashika to rise in the music industry.
I first properly entered the field of music when I participated in Thurunu Shakthi which was a singing contest which was done by the National Youth Council and Rupavahini in 1999. It featured Lankan singers and songstresses in three stages  District, Regional and National. I came first in Singing. At the district level I performed one of Nirosha Virajinis songs and I performed one of Sujatha Attanayakes song at the regional level, and in the finals I got to perform a new song. I did my A/Ls in 2000, and for some time I was involved in exams. Then I did three CDs  Paramita, Nisansala Sandak, Kandulu Bindu. Then I started doing singles, lots of television theme songs and film songs and overall I have sung 220, explained Shashika
Family has always been a pillar of success for Shashika.
My biggest strength in life are my parents, it was because of my fathers great interest that I set on this path. My father exposed me a lot to Radio and TV childrens programs by filling in applications so that I could participate in them. I took part in auditions and have taken part in many programs. I have a little brother who is also very supportive of me.
So from my early days up until now my parents have been a great influence and help to me. I received 3 As for my A/Ls and went to Kelaniya. Then I subsequently got married, but in my education and my singing, it has been my parents who have been my rock. Without them I dont think I would have got this far. They have been like a shadow always present in my life. I got married in 2008 meeting my husband at University. He too is a great help to me. I have two sons. So when I am engaged in my work, it is my parents who take care of the boys. My husbands name is Suranga. My boys are Mihin, 7 years old and the youngest is Hirun, 3 years, pointed out Shashika.
Shashikas magical voice was always created to command the attention and capture the imagination of her fans.
When I was young, more than become an artiste I wanted to get involved in the field of education. I wanted to be a singing teacher and pass on my knowledge to the next generation. But at the same time having loved listening to songs by Sujatha Attanayake and Nirosha Virajini I had this yearning to sing and put out songs of my own. I wanted to display my talent at singing and make my name known. However I did not have great expectations having no background in music. I did not know anyone in the field and did not have the economic backing to enter the field. But I still had the talent and the luck and this was enough to make me succeed. I also feel that if you can do something well to the best of your abilities, if you have that commitment then along with luck and talent you can really achieve something. After winning Thurunu Shakthi I go invited to act as well. But I did not go into acting since I felt I did not have the aptitude for it and also I was not really interested in it. So I decided to do what I know best which is singing, elucidated Shashika
Shashika says she has been in the industry for almost 17 years, and she is just getting started.
I have received more than 15 accolades at prestigious festivals. I am successful because of my training and my whole hearted devotion. I also make many efforts when it comes to my creations. I feel that in the future I can continue to be efficient and successful. From the time I was small I have loved the musical side of life. Even though I am very busy these days with my family I still give have an ear. My singles normally follow the theme of love but up until now I would like to say that my songs are diverse and touch on many themes, informed Shashika.
A good song is its own reward for Shashika.
I do not really compete with anyone, I follow my path and sing for my own pleasure and the pleasure of my fans. So the reward I have is their interest and pleasure in my songs and the love I get. So I am under no pressure from the industry. So I am very light hearted and I receive much satisfaction from my vocation. It stimulates and interests me. At concerts I see for myself how much joy people get from my music at indoor shows and open stage shows. I feel the love. It is hard work but no pressure as such, summed up Shashika.

Profane does not set the world aflame
It's not the swearing per se. It's not the oaths, the expletives or the vulgarity. Really, it's not! I admire strong language. After nearly 40 years in newsrooms, I speak it fluently.
One of the most affecting memories from childhood involves my schoolmate and neighbour Ferna, at age 11, getting his mouth washed out with soap for uttering a swear word. I cannot recall the specific word, but I do remember the gagging and foaming, amidst promises never to repeat the offence.
I was certainly careful to keep my own language G-rated in front of his mother after witnessing that disturbing event! Personally, I don't find profanity inherently offensive as some people do. To me it depends on the context. That's not to say my language is a shining example of pristine purity. I can swear with the best of them when the occasion demands it.
Sophisticated vocabulary
For many working-class people, the F-word seems to me to be hardly countable as an expletive. Rather it is used as a reinforcing adverb: It's f****ing cold/hot/terrible' or whatever. Some purists argue that this shows an inability on the part of these speakers to use (or even to have) more sophisticated vocabulary, but I doubt this. In my view, nothing is regrettable in linguistic usage.
In the puritanical 60s only those considered ill-bred louts would dare drop the word bugger or the F-bomb unless they were really hurt or wild-bull mad. Three decades on, the word has become so commonplace that its shock value seems quite lost. You see the whole darn surprise element has been negated by the expletive explosion. It is actually the repetition because the more you hear it, the blasted words sound like an idle threat or a battery operated torch. The more you use them the less power they have.
Oh sure, there was a time when an F-bomb in the right hands could destroy an octogenarian ladies cut-throat bridge party. That would, in the old girl lexicon have proved deuced awkward. But when they rain down in an almost uninterrupted barrage in casual conversation it shows a profound lack of creativity and a limited vocabulary.
It amounts to a type of lethargy, a kind of dim-witted avoidance of the effort it takes to say something truly startling.
People who can find no better means of expression than to keep harping on the same two or three tired, predictable, well-worn expletives are letting everyone down - most of all themselves. I've given it some thought, and here's my solution: Let's all make a conscious effort to come up with some new idioms to express the surprise, disappointment and confused anger that are so much a part of our daily lives.
Now, when I say new, I don't mean to insist that you have to put that much personal creativity into it. But we can stand on the shoulders of generations of people who cared enough to give us amusing baubles rather than dirty diapers.
A loyal reader of mine suggested the resurrection of By jove! That's very British, and it may turn out to be among the phrases that sound right only in one of those dialects. I'm a fan of Oh my sainted aunt!
Tremendous fun
Oh my God is almost always dreary as well as blasphemous in the eyes of many church doctrinaires. Besides, OMG is a sad example of tediousness among the young. Which is why I'd like to resurrect Oh my sainted aunt, Oh my stars, or the truly delightful Oh my stars and garters, which has the added feature of sounding a little bit racy, in a Victorian way, though it isn't, and is tremendous fun to say.
You don't have to be a comic-book character to utter expressions of strong astonishment or dismay such as Great Scott! Great Caesar's ghost! or Hell's bells! Those are best delivered in something close to a shout, but for a milder effect you might go with Holy socks or its rhyming variant concerning underwear. There was virgin aunt Rhonda who tickled everyones fancy when astonished with: Well, butter my buns and call me breakfast!
Disbelief is most often signalled by simply spewing out: What the ... without finishing that question such as, What the devil, What the deuce, or What in blazes!
But early exposure to objectionable vocabulary is not so uncommon. And some of the bluest outbursts that come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings can often make us see red. And particularly so when the profane becomes high-octane.
Grandson Kingco, when around four, was no exception. But as I said earlier, it depends on the context. The only extenuating circumstances weighing in his favour were his surroundings. He was domiciled in a country where swearing appears to be a national pastime.
At the time he had been scandalizing his grandmothers, aunts and the rest of the family by using certain unutterable words. One particular taboo word could clearly be described as 'ineffable'. That doesn't mean he knows the meaning of the word although he does know it's taboo in this neck of the woods. The 'swear jar' where he had to deposit a buck every time he dropped a 'potty' word or phrase was already full.
Foamy mouthwash
They tried the universal deterrent of threatening to wash his mouth out with soap. Fat hope! The technique in this instance failed miserably. Rather than fear the frothy, foamy mouthwash, he seemed to savour the prospect of its sudsy flavour. Reaching out for the glass of bubbly liquid he expostulated: "Oh goody... gimme that and gimme a straw I can blow bubbles!" But Kingco also realised that even the differently-abled were no exception. In an environment peopled by a bunch of versatile opponents in the art of vituperation was Charlie, his deaf and dumb play-mate. Charlie could lip-read and expressed himself quite effectively with hand signs to make his point.
Despite his deficiency in hearing and unable to mouth the spoken word he could out-cuss the best of them in the same offensive faculty with dramatically communicative mouth and hand gestures.
After one such episode following his gesticulated hurling of vile imprecations at a whole bunch of his mates Kingco appeared more curious than offended. He came home and posed the pertinent question: "Does his mother ever wash his filthy hands with soap"

Rains the main beauty pain
The pre-monsoon drizzle is a respite from the sweltering heat, indeed! But, make-up wise, the downpour season calls for extra caution. So, what are the dos and donts Here are guidelines to follow...
The message for the season is clear: Go minimalistic! As a rule, always use water-resistant products. Waterproof and cream-based foundations help keep your skins base uniform, without making it appear cakey.
Skip the eye-shadow or at the most, opt for subtle colours like beige, brown and pink. Steer clear of glitter, fake falsies and gloss during the day, especially while stepping outdoors.
Choose cream blushers and gel-based eye liners for a lasting effect. Do away with the kajal. This look is less messier and smudge-safe.
Pre-monsoon also happens to be that time of the year, when your skin gets flaky and dry. The skin on your lips is the most sensitive, so ensure you scrub them well-enough. Stock up on hydrating lip masks. It is liquid matte all the way for your pout, this season. Lipsticks in darker shades are also raging this season. Opt for berry, deep plum or marsala and go easy on the eyes to make a striking statement.
The importance of using a good SPF (even when it looks gloomy outside) cant be overstated. Slather on sunscreen even when indoors. Always ensure you keep your skin make-up free, toned, and pores closed before applying it.

Weather situation
The Meteorology Department said there could be heavy rainfalls of above 100 millimetres within the next 36 hours.
They noted that the depression in the East central Bay of Bengal has intensified in to a Cyclone storm MORA and it is moving away from the island.
As a result, cloudy skies, windy and showery conditions are expected over the country. They said that strong winds about 80 mph can be expected over the country. These windy conditions are especially expected over the western slope of the central hills and surrounding sea areas.
Showers and thunder showers will occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, South, North-Western and Central Provinces. Particularly in the western slope of the central hills, heavy falls above 100 mm can be expected at some places. Showers and thunder showers are also expected in several places in Northern and North- central provinces and in the Trincomalee districts.
The sea area off the coast extending from Puttalam to Trincomalee via Kankesanturai and sea area off the coast extending from Galle to Batticaloa via Hambantota can be very rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 70-80 kmh at times. Naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant in this regard. According to the Meteorological Department, the water level is falling in Ratnapura, Ellagawa, Millakanda, Putupaula, Baddegama and Panadugama.
Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed that 14 districts are currently affected due the heavy rains and out of these 14, 4 districts namely Galle, Matara, Kalutara and Ratnapura are severely affected from landslides in addition to the floods.With heavy rains forecast to continue up to June 1, 2017, it is feared flooding may get worse and may also affect the condition of other districts where coping mechanisms may be weaker.

Foods are subsiding, Irrigation Department Director General M.Thuraisingham said on Sunday.
If it does not rain today and tomorrow, I can say that the situation returns to normal, he said.
The water level of Kalu Ganga is currently receding. It has already deflated to a minor flood level,he said.
The flood-hit areas are on the way to recovery, he said.
There were reports that the water level of Polgolla was rising, but it is not so. Actually, the level has decreased and is at three feet, he pointed out.
There is no need for fear for the people in Panadura that floods will attack their areas through an opening or some possible wreckage of a sluice gate which is holding water from Kalutara, he said.
Our Irrigation Department workers have taken care of the sluice gate leak which they said has posed a flood threat in Panadura, he said.
The workers have arrested the leakage, he confirmed.
The water level of Gin Ganga has also deflated. The bund leak in Galle related to the river too has been arrested by laying sand bags with the help of the soldiers of the Sri Lanka Army, he said.
The leakage found in bunds is a minor matter. We ask the public not to have any fears over their being broken, he appealed.
The water level in Nilwala River has also subsided. The situation is returning normal, he added.

Their remains were kept in a relatives house in Rohalewatta, Horana and the funeral was held at the Horana UC cemetery on May 27 afternoon amidst a large gathering of mourners.
The other three bodies are kept at the Horana hospital morgue for identification since no one had come forward to identify them so far.
Several politicians including Ministers Mano Ganeshan and Palani Digambaram and organizer Kithsiri Kahatapitiya who attended the funeral ceremony at the Horana UC grounds were booed by the restless crowd saying no single official had so far come forward to lend assistance to the affected people. They said bodies were found through their own effort.
Meanwhile, a two-year-old child and the childs parents who were rescued by the people have been admitted to the Horana hospital for treatment.

Small hydropower industry debunks negative theories
Sri Lankas small hydropower industry came out strongly against negative theories and myths that plague the industry, despite it showing tangible evidence that such negativities have no foundation.
Secretary of the Small Hydropower Developers Association (SHPA) Prabath Wickramasinghe said the SHP industry is faced with numerous problems due to issues created by NGOs in particular, none of which are factual.
There are delays in obtaining various government approvals due to unreasonable and baseless allegations by these NGOs and reluctance of government officials to give their consent due to pressures exerted on them by these interested parties.
He lists some of the issues the SHPA has been grappling with. Firstly, that mini-hydropowers (MHPs) harm fish in streams and negatively impact the eco system.
This theory has no scientific evidence as no post audit has been conducted on the subject to quantify such impacts. While construction is in progress, there will admittedly be an impact which is a hallmark of development, but this is relatively low when compared with other development projects.
He adds that existing regulations imposed by the Department of Agriculture and the CEA are all complied with, including the height of the wier being less than 3m and sufficient environmental flow to be released to the downstream of the wier for the protection of aquatic life.
Freshwater streams are impacted much more by other factors, including the use of weedicides, pesticides and fertilizer by farmers which are washed into streams, the dumping of garbage into waterbodies and use of dynamite to catch fish, says Wickramasinghe.
Another factor he brings up is that the impact from MHPs are localised with the overall impact to aquatic life, if any, is less than 1%, given that of the 15,000 kms of rivers and streams in Sri Lanka, MHPs use less than 200 kms, which is just 1.3%.
Theres also the allegation that MHPs clear forest land for construction, which Wickramasinghe says is a negligible area.
Of the 180 MHPs, only approximately 15 are in forest areas, utilising just one hectare or less. This from a forest cover of 1.86 million hectares. Other development projects including plantations, shifting cultivation, firewood collection, house construction, infrastructure and roads took 490,000 hectares of forest, while MHPs used only 15 hectares which is 0.0031%. It is apparent, that 99.997% of the deforestation that has taken place due to development is not related to our industry.
He adds that even to bring the impact up to 1%, 4,885 projects would have to be located in forest lands, where currently only 15 are operating.
Wickramasinghe also highlights that there are no MHPs in environmentally sensitive areas, as approvals are not granted for projects in these locations.
He reiterates that each MHP is a legal body, incorporated in Sri Lanka, with offices located at the site and most often in Colombo.
Our teams are all responsible individuals working for responsible organisations. It is easy then for these companies to be targeted by NGOs, publicising baseless information. For example, in the mass destruction of fish, can NGOs take action against farmers for using fertilizer and pesticides that run into streams or the illegal dynamite fishing They wont because of the huge backlash in the case of farmers and the inability to find those responsible for dynamite fishing. But when it comes to a company, it is very easy to point fingers with baseless information.
The MHP industry in Sri Lanka, since its inception in 1996, now has a total of 169 projects producing 337.77 MW and has been named by the World Bank as the best performing project of its kind. It has also become the sought after role model by countries in Africa and South Asia as well as the World Bank. There has been a saving of Rs 19 billion on foreign exchange given the industrys contribution to the national grid with a generation of 4,000 in direct employment for 4,000 and 5,000 indirectly, says Wickramasinghe.
Thus, Wickramasinghe states the naysayers should look at the industry objectively, both from the fact that the industry is contributing not only foreign exchange via projects being emulated overseas and by contributing to the national grid by reducing the quantity of imported fossil fuel being used, but also the fact that it produces a cleaner, greener energy that is ecologically sustainable.

South Africa pursue great obsession
JOHANNESBURG, MONDAY: South Africas quest for a major international cricket trophy has become enough of an obsession for star batsman and one-day international captain AB de Villiers to put his Test career on hold.
When he announced in January that he was cutting back on Test cricket, De Villiers, 33, said the main goal for the rest of his career was to win the 2019 World Cup in England.
But a victory in the Champions Trophy, also in England, would go a long way to relieving the pressure that has built on South African teams during 19 years of near-misses and outright failures in global events -- pressure that has seen South Africa labelled chokers because of their tendency to perform well in limited overs cricket but crumble in one-off knockout games.
Gary Kirsten, South Africas coach during their previous Champions Trophy campaign, in England in 2013, confronted the issue head-on by discussing the perception with his players, rather than having it as an unseen or unspoken elephant in the room.
South Africa reached the semi-finals but Kirsten, who had already announced he did not plan to renew his contract, acknowledged they choked when they were beaten by the hosts.
South Africa were the first winners of the Champions Trophy, then known as the ICC Knockout, in Bangladesh in 1998.
Since then, six further knockout/Champions Trophy tournaments have produced four semi-final appearances, all of which ended in defeat.
During that period, four World Cups and six World Twenty20 tournaments have seen a further four semi-final defeats to go along with semi-final and quarter-final defeats in their two pre-1998 World Cups.
In several tournaments South Africa have been impressive in the group stages before falling at the penultimate hurdle.
There is additional pressure for South Africa this year because they were ranked as the number one team in one-day international cricket when they arrived in England for a three-match series against the hosts leading into the Champions Trophy.
Following successive 5-0 clean sweeps at home against Australia and Sri Lanka last season, as well as a 3-2 series win away against New Zealand, De Villiers said: If we play the type of cricket we have played in the past couple of years I believe that no-one can stop us. Our biggest strength is the balance in the squad. AFP

Sri Lanka-China trade relations : Time to focus on unexplored Chinese markets
Sri Lankas strategic location has been a crucial factor in its engagement with other countries in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and with the rest of the world. As figure 01 depicts, Sri Lanka is situated between the oil shipping lane and Chinas String of Pearls(a chain of strategic maritime centres which stretches from China to the Middle East via South East and South Asia).
This has spurred the recent expansion of Chinas trade relations with Sri Lanka, which has led to a significant trade imbalance. While Sri Lanka needs Chinese imports to grow, far more can be done to increase its exports to China. This article explains the nature of the trade imbalance, and the policy priorities for Sri Lanka to address the gap.
I. Sri Lankas balance of trade with China
Modern trade relations between Sri Lanka and China began with the signing of the Rubber-Rice Pact in 1952, several years before the establishment of formal diplomatic relations. Despite the continued absence of any active trade agreement, total trade between the two nations doubled in the decade 1990 to 2000, from US$ 125.6 million to US$ 256.2 million.
I.1. Imports from China
As figure 02 depicts, China had become the third largest import partner of Sri Lanka by 2010. By 2015, Chinas imports to Sri Lanka were valued at US$ 3727 million in 2015, accounting for 20 per cent of total imports to Sri Lanka  only marginally below India, which accounted for 23 per cent of imports.
While India remains the top source of imports, the growth rate of imports from China is far greater (except in 2014),as shown in figure 04. During the period of 2010-2014 overall growth in Indian imports was only 56.2 per cent, whereas the overall growth rate of Chinas imports was 175.3 per cent.
I.2. Exports to China
Compared to its significance as an import partner, Chinas importance as an export destination for Sri Lanka is remarkably low. Specifically, Sri Lankas exports to China in 2014 were valued at only US$ 173.5 million, accounting for just 1.5 per cent of Sri Lankas total exports that year. Sri Lankas sluggish exports to China, along with the dramatic increase of imports, especially after 2000.
Exports to China increased 7-fold from 1985-1989 to 2010-2015, compared to an approximately 29-fold increase in imports from China in the same period. As depicted in figure 05, this has led to a starkly negative balance of trade with China, causing a deepening trade deficit during the period of 2000-2009 onwards. The trade deficit has accounted for 26.4 per cent of Sri Lankas total trade deficit in 2014.
However, under liberalised and globalised economic conditions, the expanding deficit should not be regarded as a major issue. Specifically, major imported products from China such as knitted and crocheted fabric of artificial filament, woven fabric of synthetic staple fibres, and dyed cotton are vital raw materials needed for the production of major local exports, particularly garments and textiles, which account for43 per cent of Sri Lankas total export earnings in 2015.
In addition, imports from China include electronic products and consumer durables such as air conditioners, cameras, televisions, washing machines and mobile phones, for which Sri Lanka does not have a comparative advantage in production.
The import of these products from China is therefore still crucial for Sri Lanka, and overall, trade relations between Sri Lanka and China are generally beneficial for both countries.
II. Policy priorities for more mutually beneficial trade
Despite Sri Lankas need for Chinese imports, more can be done to redress the imbalance of trade. Sri Lanka and China are currently negotiating to form a free trade agreement that would enable more mutually beneficial trade for both countries and offer potential to redress the trade deficit.
Sri Lanka should capitalise on this initiative to focus more on export-oriented relations with China, by nurturing unexplored opportunities in the Chinese market.
The Sri Lanka Export Development Board has already recognised over 500 products in which Sri Lanka has a comparative advantage, only 24 of which are being produced domestically by China.
There are 299 products on the list that are not currently exported to China. Sri Lanka therefore has great potential to increase its exporting capacity by introducing the new products highlighted in figure 06to the Chinese market.
All of 299 products are currently being produced in Sri Lanka and exported to countries other than China.
What is more, the first three products  printed circuits, parts of electronic integrated circuits and micro assemblies, and chemical/allied industry preparations  can be exported to China at a zero tariff rate, while manioc, banana, chemicals, and footwear and leather products have low tariff rates of 8.3 per cent, 6.9 per cent and 8.5 per cent respectively.
Although other countries already export these products to China, there is potential for Sri Lanka to penetrate Chinese markets due to growing demand and the low tariffs applied.
In this context Sri Lankas corporate or government representatives need only negotiate with possible buyers in China to introduce these products into Chinese markets.
In addition to the above products, Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard Universitys Kennedy School of Government has noted that Sri Lanka could expand its export basket by producing medical equipment, using its comparative advantages in textile and rubber sectors.
For long-term mutual benefit, however, it is necessary and therefore strongly recommended that Sri Lanka and China conclude a free trade agreement.
When considering export strategies, the government should recognise and identify the diversity of Chinese consumer preferences across cities and regions, rather than targeting the Chinese market as a whole.
Sri Lanka should therefore work to establish strongcity-to-city links, built on mayor-to-mayor relations, which would lead to beneficial trade relations based on the specific market requirements of Chinese cities.

This has impacted livelihoods as this also affects sales of other products, which are purchased by tobacco consumers, they said, adding that many consumers are seen switching to illicit products.
They requested that the Minister maintain prices of legal tobacco products at reasonable levels, not implement the proposed ban on stick sales and not introduce regulations that will affect their business and livelihoods in a drastic manner.
They added that tobacco traders have conducted business in an ethical manner respecting the laws and regulations with respect to the tobacco trade, and requested the Finance Minister to consider their position for future policymaking.

Traits of a successful captain
In addition to being a good player, a captain should have a wide knowledge of tactics, states the late Trevor Bailey, in his book Trevor Baileys Cricket Book. It is surprising the number of fine cricketers who have little or no appreciation of the game outside the narrow setting in their own sphere.
Bailey further adds that ideally a captain should have that almost indefinable quality which is sometimes called leadership. This is a vital asset if one is commanding a young and comparatively inexperienced side. But it is a very different matter attempting to inspire a mature side other than by personal example. According to him one should obtain the best results of this type of a team if they respect you as a player and like you as a person. Any attempt to treat them in the same way as an enthusiastic schoolboy eleven is fraught with danger. Indeed, Bailey says that, he feels today every captain should take an advanced psychology course. Otherwise he will be lost in trying to deal with the temperamental outbursts which have become an accepted part of modern sport. Great patience and infinite tact is needed for this delicate operation.
Bowlers react variously to treatment, except that they all lap up praise avidly. One has to be cursed to produce his best; another pleaded with on bended knee, with perhaps a business introduction as added bait; while yet another will be moved by a patriotic roll on the drums.
Bailey states that on tour captaincy is quite another matter. The captain can produce a team in the fullest. As a result England those days were a better combination abroad; and while leadership is infinitely more exacting, it is considerably more satisfying.
Bailey has had the pleasure of serving under three different captains during his five MCC tours- late Freddy Brown, late Sir Leonard Hutton and late Peter May. All three have been good captains, he adds, but entirely different in manner, approach and technique.
Len Hutton was a complex character, Bailey adds. He became captain of England because he was the finest batsman in the country and was strongly supported by the popular press, but he was only grudgingly received by many of crickets hierarchy. With a blaze of publicity and no experience of captaincy, he was handed the highly controversial trip to the West Indies.
Len has always been a quiet and solitary man. He is seldom to be found in a crowd, preferring to brood alone. The cares of captaincy made him retreat still further into himself, so that he became even more difficult to understand.
Typically he was determined at whatever cost to be a success as the first professional skipper. He never spared himself in this aim and it took a great deal out of his far from robust frame, both mentally and physically. It certainly hastened his retirement from the game, states Bailey. Len served a tough apprenticeship with the pre-war Yorkshire when his county was the biggest factor in English cricket. He was brought up to play hard, to give nowt and to accept Nowt. He carried this hard uncompromising approach to the game to the task of captaincy, and, aided by an exceptionally powerful attack, and Hutton became the most successful Test skipper of all time. By nature he was a cautious leader who would gamble only on certainties. His ability to sum up and asses the weaknesses of opposition batsmen were masterly, and he regarded any looseness from his bowlers as nothing short of criminal offence. His tactics were a blend of defense and attack. He would order batsmen to be attacked until it looked as though it might cost runs----then straight back to a defensive field. Len Hutton could not stand giving anything away to the enemy concludes Bailey.
Although this book was written more than fifty years ago, modern day captains could take valuable lessons, from this articles. As I always thought psychology plays a major role in captaincy, as he states an advanced level course in that subject could do a world of good for budding captains in Sri Lanka. The uncompromising attitude of Len Hutton is another point worth taking note of. How he has to coax the bowlers to get wickets is another interesting point to keep in mind and finally win at any cost unfortunately is the Name of the Game these days where the rat race is rampant.

Two Uma Oya drinking water projects to be completed by June 30
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that two out of the four remaining drinking water projects targeting the people affected by the Uma Oya multi-purpose project are to be completed by June 30.
The Attorney General made this remarks consequent to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice, and four individuals, including M.D.P. Manatunga, who are residents of the Bandarawela area who have been victimised as a result of the Uma Oya multi purpose project.
The Supreme Court was further informed by the Attorney General that the Provincial Director of Agriculture in the Uva Province has taken necessary steps to grant compensation to the farmers whose crops were destroyed by the Uma Oya multi-purpose project.
At a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had ordered the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment to complete its drinking water projects by early this year.
The Attorney General had earlier submitted in Court, a copy of the Cabinet memorandum issued regarding the Uma Oya project. The Cabinet memorandum submitted by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment had identified the main socio-economic problems in the areas affected by the Uma Oya project.
The Cabinet memorandum stated that the ingress of water into the head face tunnel which occurred on December 4, 2014 resulted in some socio-economic problems including the drying up of wells, developing cracks in houses, damaging crops around the areas of water ingress into tunnel located in the District Secretariat areas of Bandarawela and Ella.
The petitioners claim that as a result of the Uma Oya project, not only have their homes and crops been destroyed, but they have also lost access to clean drinking water, citing this as a violation of their fundamental rights.
Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment N.Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture, the Central Environment Authority and the Attorney General have been named as respondents in the petition.
Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with Sugath Atapattu appeared for the petitioners.Deputy Solicitor General Palinda Ranasinghe appeared for the Attorney General.

Most armies, police forces and governments throughout the world are studying with great interest how the Indian army tied a protestor to the bonnet of an army jeep and then drove through a crowd of stone pelters, secure in the knowledge that nobody would pelt a stone at the army jeep, with a man tied in front!
Revolutionary! said the former president George Bush as he sat fishing at a stream near his ranch, This is what we should have done when we invaded Iraq, we should have tied Saddam on the front of a tank and captured all the cities!
Brilliant idea! said the present president of the US, Maybe we can pick one fellow from all the countries I have banned and tie them to all the buildings across our country, so no plane will crash into them!
You can start with Trump Towers! said his wife.
Of course dear, well have ten of them strung up on all the buildings that have my name. Imagine that would be the biggest safety measure we could provide, and would certainly help sell all our buildings! Give me the number of the Indian general, I need to talk to him and invite him here as a consultant!
In North Korea, the young dictator scratched his head thoughtfully, We could also make a human shield! he said, Have staves and poles put up around the palace grounds and on the roof of my palace!
What do we do after that sir asked his general, puzzled. Tie hundreds of men and women on them, so the whole area where my family and I live, becomes covered with a huge shield, and America wont pelt any missiles at us, for fear of hitting these innocent citizens!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Thats brilliant sir!
Yes, but call the Indians and ask whether they will tell us what knot they used so our people wont untie their ropes!
Yes sir, well try and get their army major on the line sir!
In the mountains of Afghanistan and elsewhere where terrorists hide there was the sound of raucous laughter and the scraping of machine guns, What an ingenious plan! said the chief terrorist.
Next time we send a missile to shoot a plane in the air, we will paint a man sitting on the pointed edge, so the anti- missile guns wont shoot it down!
There was the sound of machine guns banging each other and again the same raucous laughter as the roughly clothed men rejoiced at their leaders brilliance.
They all looked in the direction of the country from where the idea had originated and gave a 21 gun missile salute in thunderous respect.
Somewhere in the skies a plane fell out of the air.
Sir! said the PA to the bearded leader of the country where the idea had come from, We are truly leading the world with our make in India ideas..!

The government will provide life jackets to all families in flood affected areas, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said. Two thousand life jackets were already distributed among those who had not left their houses despite the flooding, Minister Abeywardena said.
If victims receive life jackets, they will be able to stay safe until they are rescued, Minister Abeywardena said.
Some people do not leave their houses disregarding the dangerous situation they are in. They keep climbing up until they reach the roofs and calls for emergency rescue units only after when they realise that they are in jeopardy. Life jackets will be provided taking into account this situation, Minister Abeywardena said.

Mora moves away,but more showers likely
The depression in the East Central Bay of Bengal has intensified into a cyclonic storm Mora.
It is moving further away from Sri Lanka, the Meteorology Department said.
The Duty Officer said the effects of Mora cyclonic storm will subdue only after June 2. Under the cyclonic storm influence cloudy skies, windy and showery conditions are expected over the country, the Meteorology Department weather forecasts said.
It is sad the cyclonic storm is moving towards Bangladesh and it will lash Myanmar, and perhaps Eastern India with flooding, rain and strong winds as well.
The Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, North-western and Central provinces will receive showers or thundershowers and heavy falls above 100 mm can be expected at some places particularly in the Western slope of the central hills. The cyclonic storm Mora is now moving towards Bangladesh and it will lash Myanmar, and perhaps Eastern India with flooding, rain and strong winds as well.

Successive governments have dumped employees in SLPA
Successive governments have dumped employees in the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and have looked at SLPA as a place where they could get employment for the unemployed in the absence of real economic growth, said Managing Director SLPA, Sarathkumara Premachandra.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC agent Annual General Meeting, he said that although the government and the professionals of SLPA would like to run it with half the number employees today, this is not realistic in the current economic environment.
Are we wrong in employing unemployed in the short term till our country can provide employment through development Hence SLPA has been leading the biggest CSR project by creating breadwinners for well over 5,000 additional families!
In addition to overstaffing, SLPA has to maintain a railroad with over 30 km of tracks including two locomotives and a shunting yard simply to allow the Government Railways to import occasional carriages. Premachandra said that additionally, all government agencies such as Customs are provided with facilities free of charge and even utility bills are absorbed by SLPA.
He also said that SLPA has over 600 houses for employees maintained by the Authority. Roads inside the port from Ingurukade to Kingsbury Hotel, from Modara to the Southern Breakwater, all our ports, quays, breakwaters, harbour lighthouses around the island and other common facilities too are maintained by this workforce.
We generate our own electricity and this has stabilized the port during uncertain power situations. We have an understanding with CEB to help them manage crisis situations.
Premachandra said they have a fleet of dredgers that maintain the depths of the harbours. They have engineering workshops that can turn out anything required that cannot be purchased locally. Thats why our 33-year-old JCT cranes are working like brand new.
He said that the ongoing project of expanding the internal port road to six lanes up to 10 km is costing them Rs. 4 billion and maintenance cost is borne by SLPA. However 70% of the container traffic that uses the road are for SAGT and CICT.
Loan repayment for South Port last year was Rs 1.528 billion while there are other expenses in maintaining six other harbours.
All these require men and women. True, we have 9,500 men and women. They do not idle as some would like to accuse. They manage and operate the ports of our motherland winning accolades from the international maritime community.
He said that despite all odds, SLPA last year made a net profit of Rs 10 billion after tax and that this was an 83% increase over the previous year in spite of Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) losing 100,000 TEU to competition.

AG to seek new Ports Ministers instructions over Hambantota petition
The Attorney General (AG) yesterday informed the Supreme Court that he is required to take instructions from the new Ports and Shipping Minister regarding a Fundamental Rights petition filed by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara. Nanayakkara sought an order to quash the Framework Agreement entered into by the Government of Sri Lanka with two Chinese companies.
The Attorney General had raised preliminary objections against this petition on several grounds earlier.
When the petition was taken up before Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Gooneratne, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for several respondents including Sri Lanka Port Authority informed Court that the AG is required to take new Ministers instructions following the cabinet reshuffle.
The AG had raised preliminary objections against the petition citing that the Memorandum of Understandings (MOU) pertaining to the Hambantota harbour had been signed on three occasions in 2007, 2012 and 2014.
ASG Rajaratnam had informed Court that these agreements had been signed with Chinese companies while the petitioner Vasudeva Nanayakkara was functioning as a Cabinet Minister and alleged that the petitioner has not disclosed the facts of the case.
The first and second phrases of the Hambantota project were signed in 2012 and 2014. This is a continuous and uninterrupted process from 2007. The petitioner has concealed this fact through his petition and he was a member of cabinet at the time of cabinet paper was presented, Rajaratnam added.
He further informed Court that the final agreement between the Chinese companies and Government of Sri Lanka is yet to be finalised and thereby the petition cannot be maintained. The Attorney General had moved Court that the petitioner be dismissed for non-disclosure of the material facts of the petition arguing that the petitioner does not have locus standi to invoke the Courts jurisdiction. The petition will be taken up for support on June 14.
The petitioner cited members of the Cabinet of Ministers, members of the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (referred to as the CANC and also sometimes referred to as the Committee of Secretaries), the Director General of the Department of External Resources of the Ministry of National Polices and Economic Affairs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited and China Communications Constructions Company as respondents.
The Petitioner states that this petition relates inter alia to the infringement and imminent infringement and continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, by the arbitrary, capricious, mala fide and illegal and unlawful decision of the respondents to enter into an agreement with the Peoples Republic of China for the promotion of investment in Sri Lanka by Chinese investors and lease and convey and enter into an agreement or in any other manner dispose approximately 15,000 acres of land and/or 50 square kilometers.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner. ASG Sanjay Rajaratnam with DSG Nerin Pulle appeared for the Attorney General.

Ever wondered how to become a filmmaker with 10 dollars Join Art in The Village featuring Kolamba Talkies.
An impelling screening of How to become a filmmaker with 10 dollars, a film about two wannabe-filmmakers stuck in a small Indian-ocean island where local cinema is dying trying to discover a path to realize their film-making dream presented by Wannabe Films showcased by Art in The Village featuring Kolamba Talkies will be held on June 4 at 7 pm, at The Sooriya Village located at No.49, Skelton Road, Colombo 5. Admission free.
The Sooriya Village brings Art in The Village, the ultimate open mic event, an opportunity not only accepting, but celebrating and promoting artists to perform through all forms of the word Art itself. Art in The Village provides artists from musicians to dancers to dramatists to film directors to writers and much much more to showcase and discuss their art with audience members. Every month Art in The Village will be screening a unique collection of art produced by local artistes from all corners of the nation.
The very first Art in The Village will begin this June featuring Kolamba Talkies screening How to become a filmmaker with 10 dollars, a film by first time filmmakers Dennis Perera and Chandana Prasanna and the film was nominated in the Best Director category at Barcelona Planet Film Festival 2016.
Kolamba Talkies (KT) came to light in 2014 as a concept that brings Sri Lankan Indie filmmakers together through a chain of screenings. Given that its common to have the works of many new generation filmmakers go unnoticed on the web without making it to a screen or without any constructive dialogue being formed around it mainly because the only spaces that accommodate such works are a limited number of film festivals and competitions held annually and the amount of productions that come about on a daily basis are far too many in number to be accommodated at such events. KT tries to fill this void with a monthly casual gathering that provides a space to all those who want to share their work and thoughts on productions and even to seek assistance for their ongoing work. KT is committed to keep away from formal structures of the industry and holds its screenings at homes, garages, open spaces or similar informal gathering spaces where there are no bureaucratic or thematic limitations welcoming all film and art enthusiasts!
First time filmmakers Dennis Perera and Chandana Prasanna presents How to become a filmmaker with 10 dollars, a film recognized internationally at the Euro-Fest - European International Film Festival 2016, Barcelona Planet Film Festival, and the Los Angeles CineFest where the film was selected as a Semi-Finalist. A story about two friends, with just 10 Dollars in their hand, set to interview famous local filmmakers in a bid to find a way to realize their filmmaking dream. With a handy-cam borrowed from a colleague and a guerilla-style shooting setup, they try to talk with as many filmmakers as possible, in the hope of cracking the secret of becoming a filmmaker. Featuring award-winning filmmakers Vimukthi Jayasundara, Sanjeewa Pushpakumara, Prasanna Vithanage, this documentary follows an unconventional and heady journey, which reveals interesting aspects of Sri Lankas dying film industry and the story of few people who are still not ready to leave the sinking ship.
Dennis Perera who has studied the arts of theater, film direction, television programming and acting both formally and informally in and out of institutions, is the director of Thathagatha (2007) and Gotaimbara Kolama play performed in 2016 among a few other short dramas. He is the writer and director of Three wheel diaries a film which is to be screened in the future among other short films directed by him. How to become a filmmaker with $10 is his first collaborated documentary film with his friend Chandana.
Chandana Prasanna debuted his film career with the short film Ape Kale Weerayek (2005) which was awarded one of the 10 best shorts in 2005 by Sri Lanka National Film Corporation. Later he worked with several directors on some guerrilla film projects as a writer, director and an editor. He edited Boodee Keerthisenas latest feature Alone in a Valley (2017) and guest directed Thisara Imbulanas debut feature Nino Live (2017).

SYDNEY, MONDAY: Australia are relishing the prospect of uniting their big four pace attack for the first time at the Champions Trophy -- and sending a message to England ahead of the Ashes.
Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson are all fit and poised to bowl together given conducive conditions at the tournament in England and Wales.
In Australia they are seen as potentially the most potent pace quartet since the mighty West Indies teams of the 1970s, 80s and 90s.
Injuries have prevented the strike bowlers from playing together in the same Australian squad and coach Darren Lehmann is licking his lips at the opportunity to let them loose.
Its the first time weve had the big four available, Lehmann said.
It would be great to see them go at it and see how they go. Theyre quality players and weve got a quality squad. AFP

Cabinet decides to stop vehicle purchases for Ministers and MPs

President Maithripala Sirisena agreed to cancel all vehicle imports for ministers this year, Digital Infrastructure and Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando said in a twitter post, today.
The Minister tweeted, I requested president at cabinet to cancel all vehicle imports for this year for ministries, President agreed all will be cancelled this year.
The vehicle budget consisted ofRs. 154 million to purchase new vehicles for the Ministry of Defence, Rs 120 million for vehicles for the Finance Ministry, Rs.43 million to purchase a vehicle for the Deputy Minister of Rural Economy and Rs. 16 million to purchase a vehicle for the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade.
The import of luxury vehicles for Ministers and MPs was a strong point of debate among the general public for over a year as legislators face public outcry over their decisions to purchase expensive vehicles.
Last week, Parliament took up the debate on a supplementary estimate which sought approval to spend more than Rs 360 million to purchase vehicles for some ministers and renovate official residences of others.
The government provides each Cabinet, Deputy and State Minister with an official vehicle and two other vehicles as well as a vehicle permit. In addition, vehicles are also provided to the personal secretary, media secretary, the two coordinating secretaries and public relations officer of every minister. Cabinet this year also approved request made to increase the maximum price of a vehicle by eight million rupees and to provide funds for only one vehicle for a Cabinet, State or Deputy Minister.
Earlier in March, the government sought Parliamentary approval to spendRs.288.2 million to purchase vehicles for several Ministers, Deputy Ministers and State Ministers.
Minister Fernandos plea to halt the purchases of luxury vehicles in a time of disaster however is not new, the government postponed its decision to spend Rs 791 million to purchase 28 vehicles from June to November of last year when its decision coincided with the explosion in Salawa and there was a public outcry against the government for purchasing vehicles at a time of tragedy.

Call for lab accreditation in SL for quality patient care
The greatest commitment of a healthcare provider is to heal the patient while practising evidence-based medicine.
Additionally with the upward trend in the number of medical laboratories vying to provide the required services, a patient has a wide choice.
Dr. Saroja Siriwardena, Consultant Chemical Pathologist, said, Accreditation is a status granted by a third party by using stringent criteria to assess the quality of all processes followed by the laboratory, thus ensuring the credibility of the results issued by it.
Inaccurate reports can be a costly and time-consuming exercise for the patient, with added discomfort and inconvenience due to re-sampling for re-checking at another laboratory.
Thus laboratories have the utmost responsibility to ensure accuracy of its reports as well as timely delivery of results to accelerate the process of medical decisionmaking.
All patients desire to have the most accurate and trusted test report which guides the clinician towards the correct diagnosis and management of the ailment.
The patient could be assisted to make an informed decision on selecting an accredited laboratory.
However, Sri Lanka does not call for a legal requirement for accreditation.
Yet some medical laboratories have invested significantly in order to be certified as accredited.
Providing national quality standards as the backbone of accreditation, the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB) guides the framework within which laboratory performance is evaluated. ISO 15089, a laboratory standard from the International Organization for Standardization, specifies the quality management systems, designed to facilitate and affirm particular requirements for quality and proficiency in medical laboratories, Dr. Siriwardena said.
She said that the SLAB promotes voluntary accreditation and allows a laboratory to be accredited for only a selected number of the tests performed at the laboratory, while offering services for a wide test menu.
"The accreditation status and the tests accredited in each medical laboratory are available at the SLAB website which the public can access.
Internationally, the globally recognised gold standard for laboratory accreditation is set by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), a professional body of pathologists in the USA.
Describing this standard, Dr. Siriwardena said, CAP advocates accountable and high quality laboratory services by ensuring that all the tests offered by the index medical laboratory are of the highest standards. Each laboratory is thoroughly evaluated throughout the year by sending samples from USA for proficiency testing for all the tests on offer, for which a minimum score is specified as 80% accuracy. All methods on all platforms used, should have been verified as acceptable performance, using many criteria. A physical inspection is undertaken by CAP assessors at the onset and every other year thereafter, making it a continuous process.
Moreover, the working condition of all equipment, storage of reagents and transport of samples are closely scrutinised.
The minimum qualifications of staff, their requirements of training, continuous professional development programmes, safety programmes and overall management need to be satisfactorily fulfilled.
Commending laboratories seeking this standard she said, CAP accreditation therefore is one of the toughest laboratory accreditation programs in the world and it is no wonder that CAP accredited laboratories are highly esteemed. Once the accreditation status of laboratories in the vicinity is known, it is not difficult for any patient to make an informed choice on where to get their laboratory tests done.

A blot on the escutcheon of good governance
It is with deep regret that the Muslim citizens of Sri Lanka have to complain about Ven Galagodaatte Gnanasara Theras mocking at Allah and Koran in public to right thinking intellectuals and honest politicians who belong to the majority community-mostly Buddhists.
All followers of the Buddha will agree with the main tenet of Buddhism as tolerance to other religions. Then, why is the learned monk alone intolerant to Muslims and their religion, Islam Is he a communalist, an atheist or an agnostic However, the Buddhist monk is a lawbreaker without any respect to law and justice. It has been amply proved without any legal action.
As a spokesman of the affected Muslims living in Sri Lanka, I sincerely appeal to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the promoters of Yahapalanaya to deal with this unruly behaviour in order to maintain the discipline imposed by Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

## Title: Dangers of Pirated Software

## Section: Finance
## Date: Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - 01:00
Dangers of Pirated Software
Never has there been a greater time to be a pirate. Not since the days of Black Sam Bellamy has it been so lucrative either. The need to pillage and plunder, though, has shifted from the Caribbean Sea to the Internet. Gold coins and fine rum have given way to software discs and downloads, as software piracy has grown into a highly profitable venture.
In a global survey published by Business Software Alliance (BSA), Sri Lankas rate of unlicensed software installation was 79 percent in 2015. Simply put, 4 out of 5 people had installed unlicensed software products that were obtained illegallypirated software. In monetary terms, thats a commercial loss of USD 163 million to software manufacturers. [1]
The survey also presented findings about the prevalence of malware or malicious code, such as viruses, trojans, keystroke-capturing software, spyware and ransomware, in pirated software and on the websites and peer-to-peer networks where they were commonly shared and sold. It also quantified the cost in time and money for dealing with the effects of malware found in pirated software. And strengthened the results of a report [2] published by International Data Corporation (IDC) in 2013:
36 percent of downloaded pirated software includes malicious malware.
20 percent of pirated CDs and DVDs infect the host PC with malicious malware.
15 percent of software coming through normal delivery channels is improperly licensed or infects host PCs with malicious malware.
The BSA concluded the report with a regression analysis, which asserts that the higher the rate of unlicensed PC software, the higher the likelihood that it contained malicious malware. A correlation coefficient of 0.79, indicated a very strong positive correlation between the presence of malware in pirated software. [3]
Note that this correlation does not prove or disprove causation, but it clearly shows that when unlicensed software rates are lower, malware encounter rates are also lower.
Cyber-Security Threats
Pirated software tends to undermine a computers security features. And often leaves it open to malware that could compromise data, or jeopardize the security of a computer network. Any one of these problems could quickly escalate into costly damages that become far more expensive than the money a pirate could have saved by buying or illegally downloading the unauthorized software.
Furthermore, people that use pirated software have no guarantee that their sensitive data, activities and communications will be safe from cybercriminals that intend to do harm. Kaspersky, a cyber security consulting firm, has been warning its clients that pirated software disrupts computer operations, gathers sensitive information, and displays unwanted advertising for over a decade.
In 2014, a study published by IDC and the National University of Singapore (NUS) revealed significant amounts of malware in unlicensed software after testing more than 800 PCs purchased with unlicensed software pre-installed, unlicensed software DVDs, and through unlicensed software and activation keys illegally downloaded from the Internet. The tests covered over a dozen countries across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The study concluded that on average, a user of an unlicensed software package has a one-in-three chance of encountering malware. [4]
Moreover, infection rate multiplied by the number of unlicensed software packages in the world suggests there are in excess of 500 million infected unlicensed software packages in circulation. The report also found that more than 40% of consumers did not routinely install automated security updates, which can also enable malware infections of PCs. [5]
In a corresponding survey of nearly 1,000 PCs from 15 countries, the IDC-NUS study found that 1 in 5 respondents said that unlicensed software infected their PCs with a virus; 2 in 5 said it substantially slowed their computers and had to be uninstalled; and 1 in 10 said it destroyed files. [6]
For these reasons, software piracy directly affects the profitability of the software industry. And because of the money lost to pirates, software publishers have fewer resources to devote to product development and research, have less revenue to justify lowering software prices and are often forced to pass these costs onto their customers.
Conclusion
Given the evidence, it should come as no surprise that BSA's 2016 Global Software Survey found that computer users around the world cited exposure to security threats from malware as the main reason not to use unlicensed software.
Those who use unlicensed software: increase their risk of exposure to a debilitating virus that can destroy valuable data; are subject to significant fines for copyright infringement; and risk potential negative publicity or personal embarrassment. It sounds extreme, but it happens a lot more than one might think. Businesses worldwide spent up to half a trillion dollars (USD 491 billion) cleaning up after pirated software in 2014. Thats USD 127 billion dealing with security issues and USD 364 billion dealing with data breaches. [7]
If these reasons have not deterred you enough, consider the following. Users of unlicensed software forfeit some practical benefits as well. Increasing their chances of the software not functioning correctly and depriving themselves of access to customer support, upgrades, technical documentation, training, and bug fixes.
So do the right thing for you and your business. Ensure that you protect your IT infrastructure and data by investing in licensed software.

Expolanka records Rs 63 bn revenue for 2016/2017
Expolanka Holdings PLC recorded a revenue of Rs 63 billion for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 supported by a growth of 13% and profit before tax (PBT) of Rs. 1.75 billion for the year ended 2016/2017.
Commenting on the results Hanif Yusoof, Group CEO, Expolanka Holdings PLC said, The year has been challenging, while in our core sector logistics operating profits grew backed by solid volume growths we were unable to convert this success to net profit growth. This was largely due to write down in passive investments and impact on exchange with the strengthening of currencies in the sub-continent.
Logistics recorded a revenue of Rs. 54 billionposting a growth of 15% in comparison to the previous financial year. The years positive results were mainly driven by the sustained performance of the Indian subcontinent along with market growth in Hong Kong and China.
Both ocean and air freight businesses recorded double digit volume growth driven by positive sentiments from the largest customers in the US and Europe trade lanes.
The leisure sector continued to show positive signs during the period recording a revenue of Rs 4.6 billion. Outbound ticketing operations performed well, posting a high level growth in profitability. Nevertheless, in spite of this commendable performance, the proposed exit fromits Indian ou tbound business will have an impact on future revenue.
The group aims to offset this by increasing the value propositions under the leisure umbrella,offering end to end solutions for corporate and personal travel.
Expolankas Investments sector recorded a revenue of Rs. 4.3 billion with the passive investments impacting on overall group profitability leading to the 14% reduction from the previous period.
In the next financial year, we hope to focus more on high growth markets and broad base our customers and products portfolio in the Logistics sector whilst looking at increasing operational efficiency and leveraging on technology. We are getting closer to our goal of becoming a true multinational.
Expolanka Holdings PLC has been in operation since 1978 and has a workforce of over 2300 employees. Headquartered in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the Groups network spans more than 17 countries in Asia, Africa, USA and the Middle East.

Flooding at pumping stations could cause water scarcity
A shortage of water supply is a possibility due to water pumping stations being affected by floods, it was reported.
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board Area Engineer M. K. Lesti said the Wakwella water pumping station is currently at a risk of being affected by the rising water level.
If the water level rises by two feet, we will have to deactivate and remove the electronic panels in the supply control system, Lesti added. We cannot allow these panels to be damaged by water. If they are damaged, water supply will be disrupted for a very long time, he said. All areas from Ahangama to Hikkaduwa will not receive water for the next two to three days if we are to shut down the panels and remove the water pumps, Galle Area Engineer Lesti pointed out. The current volume of stored water at Wakwella is about 20,000 cubic metres, which would be sufficient only for about three hours, he added.
However, we will keep supplying water to hospitals. If the water level goes down, we will be able to supply water without interruption, Lesti also said.

Floods and its aftermath
More rains have been predicted while this is being written adding to havoc created by the worst flood to have hit this country in decades. Already over 160 lives have been lost, dozens reported missing and thousands displaced with the numbers likely to escalate. Over 1,200 houses have been completely damaged and according to latest reports nearly half million persons have been affected by the flood disaster. Adding to the woes of the affected are the lack of essential supplies such as food and water, with large areas still unreachable due to the raging flood waters. The government however had moved in promptly to mitigate the disaster ably assisted by the tri-forces with an Air Force officer even losing his life during the mercy mission. Ratnapura and Kalutara bore the full brunt of the flood disaster with the majority of deaths and displaced reported from these two districts. Schools have been closed in the disaster areas where life has all but come to standstill. There is also the very real possibility of an outbreak of disease that always follows a major flood and the government should be prepared to meet this challenge as well.
More disaster was averted by the Ceylon Electricity Board which promptly cut off power supplies to the affected areas but for which the death toll would have risen due to electrocution of the already stricken flood victims. Sluice gates too were opened in the many reservoirs to mitigate the effects of the raging floods while prompt evacuation of persons in the landslide prone areas and those living on the river banks too helped in arresting the death toll.
The disaster no doubt rallied all citizens of the country to the assistance of the victims which has always been a hallmark of Sri Lankans during times of crisis. This was seen in ample measure prior to this too such as during the Tsunami catastrophe although there were vultures too who preyed on the victims. The various media organisations too deserve praise for mobilsing the public in providing assistance to the flood victims, an opportunity that that did not lend itself prior to the advent of the electronic media in the days bygone, another instance where the communication revolution had stood the public in good stead. Both the President and Prime Minister are monitoring the situation firsthand and have deployed the full force of the government machinery to deal with the aftermath of the disaster. The President has also ordered that all red tape be dispensed with in the provision of relief to the flood victims while daily briefings are been arranged to handle fresh crisis situations that might crop up affecting the victims. The President also has issued instruction to grant the maximum compensation to the next of kin of those who perished in the flood disaster.
The Opposition too, it has to be mentioned, has not thought it fit to fish in trouble waters and have extended support to the government to deal with the emergency situation. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has appealed to all countrymen to put aside all differences and rise to the occasion to provide succor to those affected. The clergy of all faiths too have appealed to their flock to rally at this moment of crisis. Dry rations and relief items are being collected in churches and temples countrywide as during the Tsunami with the public lending their unstinted assistance. The Mahanayakes in the meantime have appealed to all Buddhists to consider setting off a part of the funds earmarked for Amisa Pooja on Poson Poya day to help people affected by floods and landslides. The victims therefore are assured of help from all quarters but what is important is getting them back on their feet following their harrowing ordeal.
The flood waters not only claimed lives but also the very future of the survivors. In the deluge were washed away all their possessions and meagre belongings. All electrical goods in the homes consumed by flood waters cannot be salvaged and so are the books and clothes of school going children. Most of the half a million affected are now living in temporary shelters, some with only the clothes on their bodies. For them providing cooked meals and other forms of sustenance alone would not suffice. They need to start life afresh after the flood waters recede and here is where the government and also voluntary organisations will have to step in. The corporate sector too could assist in this noble endevour. A herculean task awaits the government in helping to rebuild the lives of the unfortunate victims and a collective effort is called for. A similar scenario that prevailed in the aftermath of the Tsunami now confronts the nation and the government will have to be equal to the challenge the like of which confronted the Chandrika administration in the wake of the Boxing Day catastrophe. On that occasion that was a national outcry for unity among all disparate forces and a similar call is warranted in this instance too if the country is to overcome the monumental natural disaster that has visited upon it.

GM to wrap India sales: Chevrolet cars that will say farewell
One of the biggest auto makers in the world, General Motors began its India journey in 1996 - much before the likes of Renault and Nissan, and around the same time as Hyundai.
Twenty-one years on, the American company has under one per cent share in the otherwise vibrant Indian car market.
For GM, the journey of 21 years has hardly been vibrant - failing to find a foothold here even as rivals pushed the pedal to accelerate.
In a market dominated by Maruti Suzuki 800s, GM offered Astra under the Opel brand. While the car did come as a fresh and premium package, it could not find mass appeal.
From hereon, the company dabbled with Corsa and Vectra under Opel and a number of vehicles under the Chevrolet brand.
Barring momentary jolts of success, not one car managed to become a common sight on Indian roads. Another problem may have been GM's inability to connect with its buyer base.
"They (Chevrolet) failed to invoke a connection with the general masses," says Col. YS Katoch, co-founder of CarXpert, a service-providing company for multi-brand cars. "The decentralized dealer model seems to be the pain point for the company where there was no control over pricing and other after sales services."
Agrees Nitin Vaijal, an independent car-trading analyst, who says Chevrolet's image value never really took off in India. "Some of their vehicles were good and solid offerings.
The Optra is a case in point. But many found taking their cars to the service centres as an uphill task. A section of buyers who still went for these cars eventually began leaning elsewhere," he says. While GM has promised to continue providing service and spare parts to owners of Chevrolet cars in India despite folding sales, GM's Chevrolet current offerings will now bid farewell to Indian shores.

Government to provide Rs. 2.5 million per house affected by floods

The government has decided to grant a compensation up to a maximum of Rs. 2.5 million per house which was destroyed in the adverse weather conditions, Minister Rajita Senaratne said today.
Minister Senaratne said this while speaking at a media briefing held at the Ministry of Disaster Management, Colombo. 
Minister Senaratne said that this allocation was done by the government insurance scheme that covers all the houses in the country.
He also said all unauthorized constructions will be removed and the illegal dwellers will be moved to alternate residences.
Families with members who have died by landslides and floods will receive a compensation of Rs. 100,000 per individual, Minister Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said that the Cabinet has approved to allocate Rs. 2 billion for entrepreneurs affected by the floods. 
The Minister said that changes were made to the financial allocations made for dry rations given to affected families.
Accordingly, the government has allocated Rs. 1800 per family of four per a day.
The allocation for each meal prepared for a displaced, has increased up to a Rs.300 as well, he said.
Compensation programs are currently being prepared to aid small and medium scale tea estates that were destroyed by landslides, Minister Senaratne also pointed out. 
The government will take necessary steps to increase the compensation package in due time, as there is a considerable inflow of foreign aid.

Government will defend decision makers of flood relief work: Wickramaratne

State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said today that the Government will defend decision makers of the public sector involved in flood relief work.
He said this while addressing a press conference at Sirikotha.
Minister Wickramaratne requested the public officials to take necessary decisions without fear, adding that the President, Prime Minister and Finance Ministry are behind them for their defence.
At this emergency situation, the public officials may not be able to adhere to procurement procedures. They may hesitate to do so thinking that they might be questioned later. This situation was due to abuse of power by few officials in the past, but we always defend the officials who go beyond their limits to help people he said.
He said that his Ministry has initiated a special programme through banks to help small scale enterprises affected by floods and landslides.
He said that the Ministry will obtain details of affected small scale entrepreneurs in each district by Friday.
Wickremaratne further noted that a programme to distribute school books and stationary items to enable children to go back to their schools from next week has also been initiated with the support of banks.
The Deputy Minister, pointing out that the majority of deaths were caused due to landslides, called on the Geologists to do a comprehensive study, to produce a report to the Government.
Most of the recent incidents were related to mud-slides where the upper soil falls. The researchers may update the Government on necessary revisions to existing laws and regulations he added.
The Deputy Minister observed the inundation of Southern Expressway was a wake-up call to take precautions in this regard in future Expressway constructions.
He also commended the tri-force personnel for their invaluable service rendered towards relief work.

Greener underneath coconuts
We hear the term biodegradation or biodegradability more often now than ever for all the reasons you can imagine. The term often used in tandem with recycling although the latter does not directly involve biological mechanism for the degradation. Biodegradation is the degradation mechanism related to living materials involved with microorganisms such as bacteria over a certain period of time. These materials are then used as growth materials for fresh life forms, biogenesis, e.g. plants, animals etc. On the other hand recycling is the reuse of produced materials individually or collectively by way of processing to different components, which may or may not be degradable. However, to our interest we will explore the biodegradability or biodegradable materials produced with related to coconut or coco as it is referred to as opposed to recycling or recyclable materials.
In Sri Lanka we have an established coconut-based industry largely for the consumption of its milk and oil as food, a Sri Lankan dish without them is almost inconceivable. The coconut tree is sometimes attributed to the tree of the heaven (Surathura) by our ancestors, as the whole coconut tree is used for many different applications and none is being spared as waste material in daily life.
Historical aspect of coconut
In the bygone era Sri Lanka has been one of the few tropical countries whose history intertwined with coconut fibre or coir products especially in the rural areas for the local market such as floor mats, doormats, brushes, ropes and mattresses. This is largely due to its mass availability thus the cost effectiveness. However, with the dawn of the countrys open economic policy in the late 1970s the end products based on coir have been gradually replaced by the cheap alternative yet mass production of petroleum based product commonly known as plastics. The plastic find was revolutionary yet with some dire consequences, notably the non-degradation of its processed object. The global impact on non-degradation of plastics has been alarming in modern times, hence the lookout for plastic alternatives, in the form of biodegradation. In other words the world is looking for damage limitations. As a blessing in disguise we are deemed to reconsider what our ancestors did before with a hint of science and technology smeared with engineering over it.
Advances in coconut products
As coir consists of considerable strength that can be applied by itself or reinforced with other suitable materials. Scientists have shown various properties of coir, the mechanical properties and degradation of the fibre over time subsequent to different processing techniques, but we do not intend to investigate such techniques in detail as that would be of academic relevance. However, as we embrace science and technological development in the contemporary world, the other significant uses of the coconut have been explored and discussed too, especially for advanced applications as a potential biodegradable material. In such matters the coir of the coconut becomes a pivotal part of the ongoing research and development across the board both academically and commercially. As with research studies pointing positive health impacts related to coconut milk and oil it is also noteworthy to look at some of the brighter side of the coir products as a separate entity, an emerging green product development.
It would be a tough task to throw away any of the components that derive from coco due to its versatility as discussed before. However, all these components have to be dissected carefully in order to produce a material that is of significance. In terms of coir, this can be processed to fabricate many commodities with considerable strength and biodegradable factor.
Products of coir
In some parts of the developed world the coconut coir logs are used as a biodegradable erosion control option for hills, banks, shorelines, and other erosion prone areas. The logs can be effectively used in restoration projects, stabilization areas, and construction job sites due to its moisture retaining properties. Ease of Installation, providing nutrients to surrounding areas, allowing for deep rooting of plants, helping to build into existing contours, requiring no chemical treatment, high air and water permeability, environmentally friendly, safe for surrounding wildlife, biodegrades over 2-5 years, effectively holding seeds and saplings in place are some of the benefits of these coir logs. In addition to finely made coir logs, mats, blocks and wattles can also be named as some of the products for erosion control purpose.
Biodegradable chairs and flower pots
Coir can be made as different layers to blend with latex and to stack them onto each other for desired stiffness and fibre density. Dutch designer Jorrit Taekema has fabricated a biodegradable chair out of such layered coco fibres. It appears as if a proper sofa type chair though its durability, strength and sustainability have not been evaluated. Moreover, biodegradable flower pots are widely made for the gardens.
Biodegradable erosion control blanket
100% chemically untreated coir fibre blankets can be fabricated. They are woven in different threads and sizes. Since they are of high amount of lignin (cellulose containing), coconut fibres are decomposition resistant. They last far more than other blankets and are tear resistant. For all these reasons, when the germinating period of a plant lasts for more than a vegetative season, Coir fibre blankets are used in bioengineering methods for superficial stabilization. These blankets are used in slope and bank covering, slopes with erosion control problems and complete biodegradation is estimated within five years.
Decorative pots and hanging bowls
Appropriate decorative pots and hanging bowls can also be created using coir and latex with better air circulation, water absorption with high water and fertilizer retention properties. Weed prevention disks & mats can be made to provide continuous soil cover to retain moisture and prevent soil erosion while preventing weed growth.
Scope of coir products
In an ideal world there could be plenty of limitations around us but in a world with many creators and innovators the limit for the coir products is endless.
As with the advancement of science and technology we can expect more fascinating objects to materialise upon us that would not destroy and clatter our beautiful world but eventually leave just like us one day.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 : Daddy issues
The newfound teams adventures continue as they encounter Peter Quills father, Ego, in the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. On surface despite being a celestial god, Ego seems to be the gentle and fatherly type but Gamora senses that he is keeping some skeletons in his closet.
It does not take long for her to prove her point when it comes to light hat Ego has spent millions of years planting seeds on different planets, which when activated become extensions of himself.
Star-lord is the first of Egos progeny to have his Celestial gene. And Ego plans to basically take over the universe. Now the Guardians have to save the galaxy a second time.
One of the greatest strengths in the movie is its ability to exist on own. It does not depend on the success of its predecessor to bring in the audience. The heroes too seem very human and have their weak points. There are exceptionally funny moments like those between Drax and Mantis. The moment when Mantis spills the beans about Peters feelings towards Gamora is comic especially with Drax guffawing in the background.
The really touching scenes come with Yondus farewell in which he risks his own life to save Peter. Here we realize that fatherly qualities do not come necessarily with blood ties. They emerge from actions which come from the heart.
Another plus for the movie lies in the characters. Writer and director James Gunn has created some unique characters to watch on screen. He uses clever and effective ploys to resonate with fans. For instance Rockets use of humour and insults as a defense mechanism for his own insecurities and Gamoras tumultuous relationship with her sister, Nebula, is some of the features which capture and keep the audience engaged. Even Star-Lords clichd realization that often what we want is right in front of us has been given a new life in the film.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 may not have much depth but it is really entertaining to watch. The greatest plus point is that Vol 2 succeeds on its own merit. Only a few films can boast about this feature.

Heart in the right place
Disabilities take many forms. Some of these disabilities are developed during childhood or at birth and are lifelong. Others may be developed in their teens or early adulthood and these too maybe lifelong. However one thing that is clear is survivingw these disabilities take strength and courage. And the truth is without parental support and parental love the prospects are bleak for these children. The courage and the strength to bear the pain and the strength to hope and to love are all part of the process of healing.
For some it is a permanent battle. Whichever way it is, parents play a vital and invaluable role in the lives of these children. Sunera Foundation is involved in a unique program to bring some relief to these parents through the arts.
When a family has a disabled child and in some families there are more than one, it is the mother who suffers the most. The responsibility is entirely on the mother to bring up that child and look after that child. The mothers give a lot of love and care to the children plus they have to look after the other children. The mother takes the brunt of such a situation. Therefore the mothers are always under stress. They do not know what the future of the child would be when they are no more. They continue to live in that world. We have been for nearly 20 years working to enhance the lives of the disabled young people. That is fine and there have been very good results. But what about the mothers So we came up with this idea fully supported by the mothers  why dont they get together This can be done through theatre  dance items and songs, a drama. Now they get a lot of joy doing that! So that is exactly what we are doing, said Sunera Foundation, Chairperson, Sunethra Bandaranaike.
These parents get together and conceive of a plot for the theatre piece, discuss their movements, dance and music.
Highly productive
Our trainers are very good at helping them. They can shake off their shyness, sadness and anxieties. That gives them a lot of joy. That is basically what we are doing. We want to give joy to the mothers. They are probably very good at certain things, they have never discovered it because they have never had the opportunity. Here it opens the door for them in a very private space to practice, joke and laugh enjoying the company of each other. We hope we can carry this to all the 36 workshops in the country over a period of time. Once this is a success, mothers of other children also will want to do the same thing. The trainers are of course very happy to train them. It is something new we are doing for mothers, stated Bandaranaike
For everyone one involved this endeavor is highly productive and very fruitful. What one takes out of this experience will impact their lives.
This is a very important program and I believe it is a first in Sri Lanka. We are concentrating on the parents of children with disabilities. We want to bring their creative talents onto the stage. So the pressure and the worry that they have been consumed with due to their love for their children is relieved. So that is the main purpose. Because of their children they have been carrying a certain weight in their hearts. So this provides them with the opportunity to release, ease their tension and enjoy themselves in the company of each other. Today we are rehearsing for a show that involves these parents acting and singing. This is basically harnessing their aesthetic talents for a show that will go on boards at S. De .S Jayasinghe Hall Dehiwala. It will commence on June 3 at 3.30pm. Up until now there is a participation of around 25 parents. Personally for me this has been an incredible experience, making a difference in the lives of these people and help release their pressure, said Senior Trainer Sandun Bandara Dissanayake.
Sunera Foundation has workshops throughout Colombo  Maharagama, Dehiwala, Panadura and Horana etc. So the parents of these children will be participating in this show.
Remarkable improvement
This is actually a kind of experiment. It may have its shortcomings but we have gathered all these parents and are attempting to do this show. So this is very much a journey united for these parents. The parents are showing a lot of interest but need more confidence as they have their trepidations. They are of the age range of 40 to 60 years. So they have their doubts concerning if they can perform well. But we assure them and strengthen them giving them confidence and make them positive. The themes of this play touches on parents becoming helpless and forgotten after their children start lives of their own. Some of these themes actually transpire in their lives because these parents are abandoned by their other children and are left alone to fend for the special needs child in the family. In addition to this they experience a lot of problems. So in the end all they have in the world are these special needs children, explained Dissanayake.
Daily News also spoke to Indra Chandrasekera a mother with a child with disability.
There is a remarkable improvement after brining my child to the workshop. My child was not afraid to go out into society after that. Because of the exposure she received from Sunera she has benefited. She cannot walk and is confined to a wheelchair but can speak very well. I feel this show is very useful and good. We are somewhat under pressure because of the constant care we give to our children. That is all gone when we act in this play.
It gives us a sense of normalcy like other people in society. Sunethra Foundation is doing us a great service. My child has come to a level of improvement that we could not even dream possible. Taking part in this show gives us all a sense of freedom as one family. We are one big family  us parents. The pressure is gone and our minds our blissful.
Kumari Perera is another mother who is benefiting from this program. My daughter Dulashi is affected by Autism and that is tough to deal with. Through acting in this program our tangled minds untangle, and we have a sense of detachment from our problems. In many ways we are alone with our problems. In a way as much as our children are disabled we too are in a form of bondage. When doing this show there is a release. Now however my childs status is very positive and she has come a long way. When comparing now and the past there is a remarkable improvement. My child is very beautiful. Sunera Foundation has been indispensable in all of this. I take care of all my childs needs.
We want to give joy to the mothers. They are probably very good at certain things, they have never discovered it because they have never had the opportunity. Here it opens the door for them in a very private space to practice, joke and laugh enjoying the company of each other. We hope we can carry this to all the 36 workshops in the country over a period of time.

How to Commercialise your Innovation: What is Commercialising Innovation
An innovation can be defined in various ways. Most commonly it is known as an intellectual creation new to the world or an edition of a present creation.
Therefore, innovation is not only a discovery, but also a human contribution to increase productivity of an existing asset or a methodology. Hence, innovations are the novel products of human intellectual endeavour.Commercialising innovation can be done by either individuals ororganisations to market and promote their innovations for a commercial benefit.
Presently, mostinnovations are commercialised through new business models. For instance,innovators of widespread games like Minecraft and Second Life in the game industry and Netflix in the entertainment industry, have commercialised their products via new business models through the internet.
Furthermore, commercialising an innovation is adding a value to an intellectual creation by converting it in to a consumable good or a service. When commercialising innovation, although it is important,to examine: political, economic, social, technical, ethical and legal factors, only legal factors are discussed in this article. The control of Intellectual Property (IP) means the rules and regulations provided in the realm of IP law to enforce ones rights when it is infringed or likely to be infringed. In terms of such enforcements which can protect innovations, this article describes mainly the patents and copyrights.
IP law could use to protect the innovation from unauthorised commercial use of others. The rationale behind this control is, it is unfair if there is an open opportunity for third parties to exploit an innovation created by using the inventorsresources and receive a commercial advantage without remitting any royalty to the inventor.
Therefore, the control of IP in commercialising innovation has become a reward for encouraging innovators. IP law supports not only the domestic level of transactions, but also the international trade by protecting innovations when infringed. For instance, if imported products of X is similar to the patented products of Y, then latter is entitled to bring a law suit against former if the import was unauthorised.
The control of IP could exercise not only to protect against the infringements, but also to seek declaration orders from court justifying ongoing commercial exploitation of innovation. This article discusses commercialising innovation in the realm of, patents and copyrights. Patentsconsider the novelty while the copyrightsfocus the originality.Both of these rights are important in commercialising new business models today. The word control in terms of IP law, is referred to the monopoly which can be either absolute or limited.Hence, in considering the issues in commercialising innovations, it is important to investigate whether such monopolies can be maintained efficiently and effectively to support emerging new business models.The control of IP over an innovation can be discussed under two important areas; commercialising patents and copyrights.
Commercialising Patents
Nowadays, commercialising patents has become an integrated trade practice which brings commercial advantages in the world. For example, if a person invents a machine which can count the cash notes and simultaneously remove the dust and bacteria on cash notes to avoid health hazards to cashier, it could become popular because it could improve the health and safety condition of the business. Hence, the owner can commercialise this product domestically and Internationally.
In order to commercialise it, he can create a licensing system through an IP contract which is strengthened by registering a patent for his innovation. In case if a patent is a subject matter of a business contract, even if the contract is terminated, the rights remain until the patent is expired. Sometimes courts have given additional protection even during the patent pending stages considering the status of the patent. In Global Flood Defence Systems Ltd v Van Den Noort Innovations BV,court had given an opportunity to enforce rights of a defendant who acquired the patentduring the court proceedings before the trial date.
Although patents are granted for twenty years, there is a special advantage if the creation is a medical or plant protection product if a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) is obtained. Therefore, the innovators in such production areas are encouraged as they have an extended protection which increases their confidence in commercialising the innovations.
When considering about patents in commercialising innovation, according to the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), not only the products but also the processes can be protected by granting exclusive rights to the owner to avoid unauthorised commercial benefits going to others.Thus,number of modern innovative business models which consists either methods or processes can be protected under the umbrella of this agreement.
Apart from the protection mechanisms, the owner has an exclusive right to gain any commercial benefit by defining licensing system for the creation.When making a mercantile contract, many companies are interested whether the subject matter is patented or not.
Therefore, if the innovation is patented, a substantial confidence is generated between parties to proceed towards further business opportunities. In the modern context, it is visible that most of the innovations are industrial applications where the owner could seek the statutory protection if it is an invention and certain inventive steps were being followed. Ifinnovators fulfil those requirements, they are entitled to commercialise their innovation in more protective mechanism which consequently increase the profit of the business.
Commercialising Copyrights
Although the copyright is not a registered right, it is visible that many court actions are filed to strengthen it. For instance, in the music industry, massive number of cases have been filed for seeking protection. Today, there is a continuous trend of increasing number of computer software, which can be protected in copyright law under literary, dramatic and musical works.Linden Laba company who is the innovator of Second Life and Blocks World have used the control of IP, to deliver non-exclusive rights to the users subject to conditions.
In order to commercialise their products, they have been introducing a revocable license which allow users to receive the facilities provided in a virtual game which is developed by them. The Mojang Minecraft end user license agreement contains provisions to avoid users from commercial benefits.
However, it is an important fact to remember such type of commercialisations are subject to exceptions in terms of educational purposes.
Furthermore, you can use the statutory mechanisms provided in the law of copyrightto protect yourrights. The most important facility provided in IP law is the opportunity to assign copyright by licensing agreement. Such licensing methods can beexecuted even with the permission of sub-licensing as well. In addition, charging a royalty fee is available as an option in commercialising innovations. For example, copyright owner can outsource the publishing work and generate royalty payments from it.
Issues You May Face
When commercialising your innovation, you may face number of issues such as, (1) Poor Utilization of Intellectual Property, (2) Lack of Protection for New Business Models and (3) Impact of Inharmonious Interpretations.
Poor Utilization of Intellectual Property
When considering the contemporary issues in the regime of commercialising innovations, it can be argued that there is an impact of unbalanced control over the innovations. In other words,both less control and too much control over an innovation have become important issues in the industry.When discussing about the poor control of copy righta sound example is databases. Although EuropeanDatabase Directives introduced the database laws there are four main elements to prove when claiming protection as such as, independence of the constituent elements, systematic arrangement of data in a methodical way, opportunity for the individual accessibility and intellectual creation in the selection and the arrangement of the content.
This had excluded the contents of a database. The protection provided at presentonly covers the infringement of the selection and the arrangement of the data. Therefore, most of the existing databases do not deserve the protection.Another issue is the exclusion of the commercially valuable or expensively created software from copyright protection for databases.Moreover,according to compulsory licensing method, the right to charge a payment from the licensee can be deprived on the grounds of unfair terms in the license.
Therefore, the protection can be misused by third parties like Patent Trolls for their financial benefits.The doubt in question is whether the actual objective intended by the legislature is achieved by the patent law.
The disadvantage of these Trolls is,instead of the objective of protecting the innovationthey proceed in the aim of generating income through the law suits against Small and Medium Enterprises (SME).Although the patent is a good method of protecting, sometimes maintaining a patent is considerably strict.
In a hypothetical scenario, if the applicant of a patent had not commercialised the patented product over the last three years, he is prevented from enjoying the exclusive rights on it as the patent could be granted to a third-party applicant.Hence, if the innovator rushed in filing the patent application and if he lost the patent right due to non-exploitation of the innovation within three years, there is an issue because the invention is already in the public domain.
Lack of Protection for New Business Models
Most of modern innovations are backed by software. If a person creates a new business model which itself a software, the available remedy for him is to seek copyright protection instead of patent. Hence, most of the businesses methods are excluded from patentability.
Although copyright is available for the realm of software, the protection given is considerably weaker thanpatents.In order to prove the copyright for a new business model with a web based information system, the domain registration and data uploaded dates are considered for the moment. Practically it is difficult to prove the first published date and the version, because the web sites are frequently updated.
A third party can simply copy your business model and software system, and upload the data to his existing web page under existing domain name. Consequently, even as the originator you may fail in proving the real uploaded date. Hence, the application of copyright to modern business models based on internet have becomemore complex.
Although we can apply and obtain design rights, it is impossible to maintain an absolute monopoly over the innovation compared to the patents. In the case of Aerotel Ltd v Telco Holdings Ltd ,court decided thata business model based on telephone operating software system was not patentable under the European Patent Convention. Furthermore, the line of reasoning was reinforced in AT&Tcase, where the court had applied the same rule with respect to software based business models and decided that a digital media hosting service was not patentable.
Impact of InharmoniousInterpretations
There are number of interpretation issues in domestic and the international level IP disputes. For instance,theIntellectual Property Act 2003 of Sri Lanka and the Patent Act 1977 of UK require an inventor to demonstrate inventive stepsand the invention should not be obvious to a person skilled in the art.
This has become an important issue of interpretation. In the case of Hallen Co. and Anr. v Brabantia (UK) Ltd,court has developed atest to interpret the word obvious to overcome such issues. According to this new test the word obvious in the inventive stepsshould be interpreted depending on the facts of each case. In Aerotel Ltd v Telco Holdings Ltd,court held that it is difficult in interpreting what are excluded from patentability.
When considering the application of IP control, it is visible that substantially different interpretations are given to the terms in statutes. Sometimes the disharmony between different jurisdictionsmaydiscourage the innovators.
Although there are number of international treaties in the realm of IP to allow priority in all signatory states from single application those treaties arelackinga sound international terminologyfor IP.
How to Overcome the Issues
To avoid the above discussed issues, several solutions may besupportive such as (1) Exercise aBalance Control of IP, (2) Apply Strategic Control of IP and(3) Support Development ofIP laws for New Business Models.
Exercising a Balance Control of IP
Having a balancedcontrol is the solution. For instance, a multinational companywhichhasbusiness around the world have to use a balance level of patent protection tostrengthen both international and domestic trade.Otherwise, when such companiespromotetheirproducts worldwide there may be issues of infringements of IPR in domestic markets which they are selling to.
According to Gowers review of IP in 2005, balance control was one key recommendation among other things to avoid issues in commercialising innovation. An absolute or limited monopoly should be balanced properly to provide an efficient and effective foundation for the enforcement of IP in commercialising innovation. In order to enhance the realm of science and technology, the Royal Society of UK has suggested to utilize the IP laws in a balance manner to motivate the innovators.For instance, Samsung Electronics had successfully appropriated IPR, which ordered Apple, to publish a non-infringement notice on their official web site. When considering the enforcement method, sometimes companies trying to protect their innovation by sending threatening letters. Nonetheless, courts have a negative feedback about these type of notices as held inGoldenEye (International) Ltd v Telefonica UK Ltd.
As an innovator, you may be interested aboutfunding and therefore, may disclose the invention and inventive steps to a foreign party through documentation or prototype. Even if the funding is granted or not, such party may copy and reproduce your innovation and subsequently, claim ownership in their country because IPR are only national rights. Such risks could be minimised by preparing a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before disclosing details of your innovation. Therefore, striking a balance control and enforcement is necessary to protect your innovation.
Application of Strategic Control of IP
In order to, avoid losing the patent because of non-exploitation, the innovator should have a strategic IP plan to identify the potential threats during the first few years from the date which the patent was granted. In some cases, innovators could use several IPR as a strategy. For example, although Viagra patent has expired in 2013, the trademark protection is still in place. Hence, if an innovation is absorbing a great amount of commercial revenue in the industry, a strategic IP solution may be applied. Therefore, a demanding product can be protected by both patent and trademark simultaneously to strengthen the protection.
While applying strategic control of IP, it is necessary to obtain advices from trained individuals and organisations which have the expertise and knowledge in commercialising innovation. Such experts can support to improve the effectiveness of commercialising your products or services, by directing and facilitating a tailored approach.
For instance, you may obtain advices from the experts at National Intellectual Property Office and Sri Lanka Inventors Commission (SLIC) before commercialising your innovation. In the UK, Technology Strategy Board (Innovate UK) and IP Office provide expert advices to new innovators about how to commercialise their innovation to gain a competitive advantage. Having more digital copyright exchanges is another solution to avoid issues. In such system, the sharing of licenses can be done considerably much effective.
When considering the strategic control of IP, choice of the dispute resolution method has also become vital. If you think the court proceedings may time consuming and placing your innovation in public domain, you may select either arbitration or negotiation as an Alternative Dispute Resolution method (ADR) to solve disputes arise when commercialising your innovation. Such ADR methods could avoid the above discussed issue of unbalanced control, and ultimately improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a commercialising plan and the Return on Investment (ROI) of the innovation.
Support Development of IP Laws for New Business Models
This requires public, private, and international partnership. Through such cooperation, domestic laws or international treaties may be formulated to protect and commercialise new business models.For instance, there are sui generis laws created for semiconductor topography, plant breeders rights and data base rights. Another sound example issui generis data base law which had contributed enormously to the companies in European Economic Area (EEA) for the protection of their new investments in databases.
An innovator who substantially invests in creating a database is now protected under the said sui generis data base law. However, the sui generis database law does not adequately treat all the circumstances. For example, in the case of British Horseracing Board v William Hill a database was excluded from the protection of the sui generisdatabase law due to lack of independent material.
Furthermore, it is important to introduce sui generis law for computer or web based business models. Although the TRIPS agreement covers the copyright protection for computer programs and compilation of data,it is not sufficient to protect new computer generated business methods and solutions. Why cannot patents be granted to the new business models based on software
The software should be permitted to be patented if they are commercially valuable and expensively created or if they are novel inventions. Taking a photograph or writing a poem is different from creating a new business model. If a new business model is asoftware, it should be granted a patent because it is aninnovation. An information system like Minecraft is not just an expression, it is a functioning complex business model.
Therefore, a new sui generis patent law can be introduced in the realm of technological business models because they are novel and innovative. On top of that, it is necessary to introduce IP laws to cover the embedded software in devices. If the protection has been allocated for semi conductors then why cannot a sui generis law be created for software stored in a system It is possible to expand the scope of IP law by introducing new rights to govern new innovations. There is process known asemulation defined as a creation of a new and distinct right by analogy drawn eclectically from the types already known.Therefore, it is possible to introduce new sui generis law for software based new business models.
Summary
Commercialising innovation is correlated with the realm of IP law. In order to have a better convenience in domestic and international trade, you have to exercise a balanced control of IP. In creating such balance, it is significant to have a positive contribution not only from you as an innovator, but also from the legislators. Having less control or too much control over an innovation by the innovator is harmful for any entity when commercialising innovation.
Thus, an application of a well administered and managed strategic control of IP, could positively support in commercialising innovation considerably much more effective than conventional approaches. Finally, after a careful analysis of above arguments, issues and solutions, you may formulatea better approach to effectively commercialise your innovation.

Indias ex-RBI Governor Rajan says worlds banks are now safer
The world's banks have become safer since the global financial crisis but economic risks have spread elsewhere, Raghuram Rajan, the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, told CNBC, recently.
"Almost certainly lightening doesn't strike twice in the same place, probably because you take precaution," Rajan told CNBC's "Street Signs" in Singapore.
"Banks are in a much safer place than they were. The problem is the overall level of risk in the economy hasn't diminished considerably. If you make the banks safer, it has to go somewhere else," said Rajan, who is currently a professor of finance at the University of Chicagos Booth School of Business.
Rajan said that there were aspects of the shadow financial system that were now "a little more worrying," particularly the high default rate on US student loans.
The number of people who have defaulted on their federal student loans increased 17 percent from 2015 to 2016, according to a Consumer Federation of America analysis of U.S. Department of Education data. Last year, 42.4 million Americans owed $1.3 trillion in federal student loans. More than 4.2 million borrowers were in default as of the end of 2016, up from 3.6 million in 2015. In all, 1.1 million more borrowers went into or re-entered default last year.
Rajan said the risks of student loan defaults were compounded by expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve would continue to increase interest rates.
"This is before interest rate hikes are substantial. And so what happens if some of them are floating rate and interest rates go up more," he said. The interest rate on some private student loans can "float" in line with a benchmark interest rate. In the US, loans from the Federal government are linked using a formula to 10-year Treasurys. So as Treasury yields rise, which they are almost certain to do as the Fed hikes rates and as Congress may borrow increased amounts to finance the Trump administration's policies, payments on new loans will rise as well.

Indian government rejects Pakistan cricket series
New Delhi:India on Monday ruled out any cricket series against Pakistan until "cross-border terrorism" stops.
The Indian and Pakistani cricket boards are scheduled to meet in Dubai on Monday to discuss a possible bilateral series. And the two countries play each other at the Champions Trophy in England on June 4.
But they have not played a bilateral series in India or Pakistan since 2012.
India's sports minister Vijay Goel said: "India, Pakistan cannot play bilateral series till cross-border terror from Pakistan (stops)."
"Terror and sports cannot go hand in hand," Goel told reporters, referring to India's accusations against Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region.
"BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) should first talk to the government before giving any proposal to Pakistan."
While bilateral series remain frozen, their clashes on the international stage, such as at the Champions Trophy, create high anticipation. "We have no control on multi-national games and events," Goel said.
According to a memorandum of understanding signed by the BCCI and its Pakistan counterpart the two sides have to play six series between 2015 and 2023.
However India did not tour Pakistan and even refused a neutral venue in 2015. The possibility of India hosting their neighbours this year also looks bleak with political tensions over Kashmir on the boil.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has threatened to take legal action against the BCCI if the memorandum is not honoured, but it is still ready for dialogue.
BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary has made it clear that India "remains committed to playing", but the "series cannot go ahead without the permission of the Indian government". AFP

Lankan women responsible for 80% microfinance with zero NPLs
Out of the microfinance borrowers over 80% of them are women, said President Lanka Microfinance Practitioners Association (LMFPA), M.M. Attanayake.
He said most of these borrowing are for self employment projects and the pay back is very satisfactory. Vertually there are no NPLs.
Microfinance is open to people who dont have collateral to go into banks and we operate on two guarantors and this system is working very well, he said. However the penetration is still around 80% and there is a lot of scope for the microfinance sector to grow. He said that for a long time they were looking at new legislation form the government to increase investment to this sector and also for some of the companies to accept deposits.
We have asked the new finance minister to look in to this issue and introduce the much needed reforms for the industry to have a boost allowing microfinance operators to introduce some new products such as microfinance insurance.
Now LMFPA is looking to receive mcro insurance regulations, access to CRIB and more which area also fundamental requirements of the industry to serve poor and low income people. We have to introduce some commercial finance activities. We have to make sure capacity building is ensured for the success of the industry, the LMFPA President said adding We also see a demand for micro finance from the North and East.
Secretary Imran Nafeer said that they are now diversifying to offer credit to housing sector as well. He also said that today financial inclusion in Sri Lanka is around 82% and there is a lot of room to expand.
LMFPA has 71 member organisations representing NGOs, Not for Profit Companies,(NPC) Cooperatives, MFI companies, banks, finance and leasing companies, capacity development institutes and individuals dedicated to the industry.
