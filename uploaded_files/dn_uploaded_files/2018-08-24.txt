Access to finance key concern for SMEs
Sri Lanka will need people with good upbringing and education to create a new breed of entrepreneurs, said Rasitha Gunawardana, Senior Deputy General Manager (Business Banking) at Peoples Bank.
We need a new generation of entrepreneurs. For us to create an entrepreneurial culture in Sri Lanka, we also need students who stand up in the class and question the teachers as well as people who question the authority.
In addition, access to finance is the key concern for SMEs. At the same time, lack of access to market information and basic knowledge on financial management have also hurt aspiring local entrepreneurs ability to start their own ventures to a great extent, Gunawardana said in an interview with Daily News Business.
They lack the knowledge of financial management to plan or manage their own finances, maintain balance sheets and to do basic investment analyses. To address these issues, the school curriculum should include financial management as a subject. He said.
He also emphasised that funding is not the only panacea to create an entrepreneurial culture in Sri Lanka. Funding is just one component of it, he said.
Total number of entrepreneurs, as a percentage of overall working population in Sri Lanka remains low or less than 3%. Nonetheless, total entrepreneurs in Thailand and Vietnam are around 18-20% respectively, compared to their overall working population. In Bangladesh and China, it is around 11% and 7.5% respectively. Gunawardana said.
Highlighting other factors that have led to the decline in entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, Gunawardana said the majority of Sri Lankans tend to work under someone else rather than investing money to establish their own ventures.
Even people, who have come to a certain stage as entrepreneurs, find it difficult to access the market. They dont get any kind of support from the authority or to access different markets. Sometimes, they also lack skills in negotiating terms with foreign buyers, he said.
In other countries, pioneers of major social media and e-commerce sites were university dropouts. They started with no financing. When the idea is good; in those countries there is a system where they could go to an investment banker and sell companys shares to him. So he will package it nicely and sell it to other investors. He said.
However, the pioneers of these sites have ended up acquiring 20% -30% of the company. They dont own the entire company. But they have the market clout and the holding power. If they have a good balance sheet, they can go to the bank and raise more funds. Unfortunately, we dont have that sort of avenues in Sri Lanka. So the banks will never want to take all the risks, they want someone to take the equity risk.
He said the Empower SME Board, recently launched by the Colombo Stock Exchange in collaboration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to help SMEs raise money in the capital market, will not address the entire issues facing the industry and also, listing and raising funds via the capital market is considered as a costly affair for SMEs in Sri Lanka.

Garasarapa:  An astonishing summersault
Jayantha Chandrasiris new film Garasarapa (Lurking serpent) slithers into its audience and constricts their minds. Jayantha bundles his spectators and lifts them into an altogether magical space where rhythm, sound, and stirs hiss at their hearts, poisoning them to believe another marvel of a Sinhala film in its seven-decade history.
The film hits the silver screen against a background when the Sinhala film industry lacks fans. Its film directors impotency in producing themes and scripts that rouse families to reach theatres from their living room TVs, is strangling the industry. Only a very few film directors succeeded in the recent past to break the manacles and hit box office with their movies. Jayantha Chandrasiri is, of course, among that few.
His Gharasarapa revolves around happenings. It does not tell a story as such. Jayantha coats this bit of a story with the demonic lore of our country stoning our intelligence and widening our imagination into a land of mysticism.
We meet Sandares Eirisinghe (Kamal Addararachchi) and his wife Frankie Edirisinghe (Ameesha Kavindi) when they were on a trip along with their two children and a group of friends. They unbend at an exquisite waterfall where Frankie is possessed by a legendary demon Kalu Kumaraya (Black Prince, Jackson Anthony). With a series of flashbacks, the story takes us to young Sandares (Devnaka Porage) when he was travelling in a van with a pilgrimage to a church feast. He develops a crush on a Tamil girl, Vidya (Kavindya Adhikari), in the vehicle. In the meantime, Kalu Kumaraya, too attempts to possess Vidya and discerns young Sandares crush towards her and sets his heart to discourage him.
Vidya and her parents were visiting the church to get rid of the demon that she is possessed with. Coincidentally, Sandares is also in the church pilgrimage with his mother and uncle. His strong emotions for her relieve the girl of the demonic possession. During their stay at the church, Sandares and Vidya fall in love. The flashbacks take us to the past and then revert to the present. However, Sandares could not marry Vidya later in their lives since her parents had to migrate to Canada along with her as the LTTE riot (1980) hit Sri Lanka hard. After a prolonged unsuccessful search for Vidya, matured Sandares married Frankie. They now have two young children, a daughter and a son. Frankie visits a psychiatrist, Dr Vidya Doraiappa (Sangeetha Weeraratne), for her psychosis. After returning home, she tells Sandares that Dr. Vidya had asked Sandares to meet her at her clinic to discuss his wife's condition. He meets her and recalls that she is the girl he loved in his boyhood. They both feel that their love towards each other is still in flames even after 35 years.
In fact, Kalu Kumaraya in the past, changing his stance towards young Sandares knowing his true love, vows that he would bring Vidya to Sandares in whatever way he could and Sandares wife is possessed by him to take her to Dr. Vidya. In the final episode, Kalu Kumara tells Sandares that he fulfilled his pledge and fades away keeping Sandares and Dr. Vidya mesmerized in their unfulfilled love but blessed with a true-binding that never goes stale.
This ordinary story, the film director juxtaposes with the legendary Kalu Kumara. By doing so, he twists realism and makes the film topsy-turvy extraordinary. The magicians in Jayantha use Vidya's virginal beauty and handsomeness of inexperienced young Sandares as well as mysticism thereby entwining their crush towards each other to make it a story of true love that we in our heart seek unabated in our whole life.
The director uses surrealism not to clarify what he finds difficult to express, but to cajole as many as fans he can towards his film.
The deceiver in him weaves the story in such a way that his spectators believe its surrealism wholeheartedly and steps into reality, only whenever the director beckons them there just to nail them at the right moment to what he realizes as advanced and unchanged  the true love.
Talented directors use surrealism to say what he cannot express in real terms of life.
What they want to explain is ultra-important and incomprehensible in real terms that they are compelled to use surrealism to lever the meaning off of the underneath. Prassana Jayakodys 28 has surrealistic scenes to explain the unexplainable. Here, Jayantha Chandrasiri grips it to make his film fantastic to filmgoers and multiply their number in thousands.
The music (Chintaka Jayakody) is idealistic. It refines our cultural nuances and beliefs. Drums and other traditional instruments being used at blessing ceremonies and demons-expelling (bali and thovil) are alive in the background music and that rouse our mystic beliefs. The theme song embraces the whole film, caressing its audience. The cinematography (Prabath Roshan) is innovative and imaginative. Some of the aerial, vertical, shots and close-ups are the best of them.
The selected locations are breathtaking. Every scene has been captured against the most suitable background for them. The aerial shots of the expressway, church sceneries and over-the-shoulder shots of the waterfall are amazingly beautiful.
The credit must go to its Director Jayantha Chandrasiri. He possesses skills and talents that Sinhala film industry is yearning for unabated. This time he uses his talents to attract fans in their thousands to theatres for his film. It will be a blockbuster, no doubt.
Actors and actresses in the film possess their roles extremely well. Of them, Kamal Addaraarachchi, Sriyantha Mendis, Ameesha Kavindi, Kusum Renu, Devnaka Porage, Kavindya Adhikari, and in her limited role, Sangeetha Weeraratne, have achieved their best. Jackson Anthony, as usual, possesses them all with his acting and voice.
It is a great summersault. The summersault, Jayantha, are simply astonishing!

## Title: Abusing the right to strike

Abusing the right to strike
The recent wildcat strikes by the railway guards and engine drivers, postal workers, private bus drivers and doctors, bring into sharp focus the moral responsibilities of the unions and the indiscrete resort to strike action to win their demands. These recent strikes have unmistakably manifested the helplessness of the innocent public. They are worst affected because they do not have any union to represent their woes.
The general public now believe it is time to seriously consider the moral obligations of trade unions towards society and the need for effective legislation to regulate public service unions particularly those which belong to essential services.
When it comes to labour negotiations there are real differences between services provided by monopolies and those provided in competitive markets. Suppose unionized workers at one of our Super Market chains decide to exercise their right to strike. First, the strike does little more than inconvenience to consumers because many alternatives exist. Second, market force mechanisms pressure both the employer and the union to settle their differences quickly on terms both can live with.
However, no such mechanism exists when the service is provided by a government monopoly.
One sensible solution to ensure uninterrupted public services is to deny the right to strike in the public sector as a condition of employment. The rationale is simple: If you want to work for the public sector, you must give up your right to strike. Such a proposal would clearly ensure continued access to services but leaves the problem of how salaries and other facilities in the public sector would be determined. If public sector workers are not permitted to strike, how can they be ensured that they will not be taken advantage of by their employer, the government
The solution is to link public sector salaries and perks to their private sector counterparts through a non-political independent authority. The authority will be held responsible for collecting, analysing, and setting salaries and other earnings in the public sector on the basis of salaries and benefits in the private sector.
That would be one straight forward way of looking at the issue. But there are other solutions as practised by the developed nations elsewhere.
Wildcat strikes
Remarkably, in many European countries there are more strike days in the public sector than in the private sector. According to available records, in Europe in recent years about 2/3 of all strike took place in the public sector, whereas in the good old days it used to be only 20 %.
Let us take Germany as an example. The increase of industrial action in the public sector in Germany has made the government rethink about their legal framework. They asked themselves few important questions: Can we ban completely (or partially) the strikes in the public sector Can we enforce the strikers to observe some special requirements or adhere to certain procedures (arbitration or mediation) relate to strike action Can we provoke emergency services as and when needed Above all, how can these restrictions be enforced by law
The German government realised that other than Belgium, Italy and themselves, in most of the other European countries industrial action is regulated by statute law. Those countries that have introduced legislation do not need case law to regulate industrial action.
For example, Italy, Slovenia and Spain guarantee the right to strike, but provide some limitations. Slovenian constitution says: Employees have the right to strike. Where required by the public interest, the right to strike may be restricted by law, with due consideration given to the type and nature of activity involved.
Spanish Constitution says: The right of workers to strike in defence of their interests is recognized. The law governing the exercise of this right shall establish the safeguards necessary to ensure the maintenance of essential public services.
Regulations
Concerning strikes particularly in the public sector there are specific regulations in some European countries. In Germany, civil and public servants are prohibited to strike. Certain other European countries do not have such special rules; however, such rules might not be necessary for them since they have general statutory limitations of the right to strike where essential services are concerned.
Apart from these limitations for essential services many countries provide further restrictions of industrial actions. Among these are: (a) political strikes (Germany, Israel, Norway, Spain) are banned, (b) strikes for reinstatement of dismissed employees are disallowed, (c) strikes during the life of a collective agreement (Germany) are not allowed.
Obligatory arbitration
In some European countries obligatory arbitration or mediation are provided by collective Agreements. The arbitration/ mediation may come in different names like, national conciliation and mediation board or special mediator office etc., In those countries the breach of this obligation will render a strike illegal.
Certain other European countries demand a cooling down period and a period of notice before a strike. The period of notice can be between 5 days to 15 days.
In Italy and Spain strikes may not endanger health care, transport, energy supply, bank and postal services. These countries put up some special rules as well such as sufficient period of notice, obligatory minimal services during strike period. In Italy 50 % of the services must be provided and 30 % of the staff must be at work.

Always on the ball! ANURA DE SILVA was a wonderful soccer play maker
Football undoubtedly is the most followed, watched and read sport of all sports in the world especially when it comes to the prestigious WORLD CUP. This wonderful game puts to a far second best the RUGBY WORLD CUP and the WORLD CUP CRICKET tournaments.
The recently conducted football WORLD CUP held in Russia proved this point. It is said that 209 countries in the world indulge in this sport that can be described as a god given game to sports.
Spotlight on administration  sub head
The interest that the World Cup generated in our own environs will surely inspire those who lead our our Soccer Administration to scale new heights in a game that over the years has lost the glamour the Football had in Ceylon in the good old days.
In ANURA DE SILVA, this weeks SPORTS LEGEND, we can he hopeful as the head of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka, that he will inject a new spirit in to the game and be a play maker in the revival of the game in our country. What is badly required is for the Sports Ministry to give all the support to the Federation.
At the helm of affairs of this prestigious body in the country, DE SILVA hails from the green, white and green school St. Benedicts College in Kotahena stables in which institution football was considered a way of life.
This school had a glorious history in inter-school football producing champion teams regularly and players of brilliance. Those who distinguished themselves include. Eric Perera, the Nicholas brothers Sampoornam and Nithy who were eye catching dribblers, Bana Rajaratnam, Denzil Walles, Rex Sebastian, Rozen Rodrigo, Edward Jayewardene, Lionel Dabera, Bertipala Perera, Errol Anthony, Thilak Pieris, Adrian Vindurampulle, Alfred Dias and Malcom Rodrigo. And there were those terrific goal keepers in Issac Wenaden, Lawrence Fernando, Vijaya Silva and Damoderam Chandrasiri to name a few.
First Ben to head FFSL
The first Benedictine to head the FFSL was Hurley Silveria, nephew of the famed former Benedictine, Josephian, Ratnam Sports Club and Sri Lanka goalkeeper and national coach Lawrence Fernando.
After quitting the game Fernando financed and kept Ratnam SC kicking. His son Navin is now carrying on the good work.
ANURA DE SILVA is the second BEN to adorn this top position and is batting his second innings as President of this sporting body.
He was a fantastic centre half as this position was then known and a player any team, club or country would have loved to have. He was in the mould of that marvelous centre half Mahinda Aluvihare who could have played in any international team and was a wonderful play maker.
DE SILVAS reign has not been a bed of roses. Like in any sports body, the Presidents or Chairmen have their share of critics and however good the work they do for the good of the game there are people who make it their mission to criticize any administration and they delight in playing their own game picking holes.
Weathered the storm
But DE SILVA has weathered the storm. The good he has done for the player, the game and the administration has been appreciated, cheered, encouraged and inspired by his being voted of this high post for a second time.
With his excellence in the game as captain of his school SBC, his club 'Old Bens' and Sri Lanka, he has the right credentials to be the head of the FFSL and he has adorned this position with great aplomb and maintained the lofty traditions that this post requires.
DE SILVA began his career that finally took him to stardom as a kid of 5 years. He began to show exceptional promise and made it through the ranks  under 14 and under 20 - going on to represent the Sri Lanka Schools in 1980 and touring Thailand for the 6th Asian Schools Championships.
Some of his team mates
In school he played under Adrian Vindurampulle and Damoderam Chandrasiri and some of his team mates were the Caldera brothers Lakshman and Sharman, Alfred Dias, Malcom Rodrigo, Jayantha Wanigasuriya, Waldo and Zeno Fernando to name a few.
From there he played for the FA Board Presidents X1 playing in the All India Football Championships in India in 1981. Then continuing to excel in the game national colours were not long in coming representing the country from 1983 to 1992 and being appointed vice captain in 1989 and then realizing the dream of every player when he captained the country in 1991.
He then sported Old Bens colours till 1995, helping the club win many tournaments conducted by FFSL Including the Bristol League in 1988 and the mother of all cups the Football Association Cup in 1995 which honour he cherishes most.
Favourite player was Breitner
DE SILVAS favourite worlds soccer player was West German midfielder Paul Breitner who too played in the position that DE SILVA excelled. He is out to score for football at grass root level and also wants to bring inter-school football which in the good old days was exciting and keenly contested with tremendous spectator support.
Coming from a school that was famous for football as was St.Benedicts College, and having been a follower of that great coach Albert Fernando, I could vouch for the interest that inter-school football evoked and the friendly fights that were more the rule than the exception. I can be proud of the fact that with my friend Patrick Perera we hardly missed watching the action be it at Kotahena, Darley Road, Wattala, Kandana, Kandy or Kurunegala.
Quitting the game
After reluctantly quitting the game he loved, DE SILVA was determined to give something back to the game that made him a brand name and gave him many moments of joy and ecstasy. He threw in his lot with the administration. DE SILVA sought greener pastures abroad for a while and once he returned he showed his excellence like he did on the field. Once in the FFSL administration, he was given responsible posts such as Director, Administration and Operations in 2008. He became the Deputy CEO in 2009 which post he held till 2013. He was promoted CEO in 2014 and then quit to contest FFSL elections in 2015.
DE SILVA at the time of writing is determined and has put into action many scheme to see that the game in the country regains its former glorious days. He is quite confident that he could achieve this goal, because he had put into action a team of talent scouts who have travelled the length and breadth of the country and picked a bunch of talented soccerites.
Safe hands of Packeer Aly
He has put them in the safe and capable hands of national coach Rumy Packeer Aly, a former player who has shone here and abroad and the poolists seem to respect his name and credentials and are working hard to to help the game regain its former glory.
DE SILVA has provided them with every requirement. He has classy training centre at Badegana and Football House for the game's administration which the administrators lacked in the past.
These two essentials were made possible by former strongman of football Manilal Fernando who lived his dreams of providing the imposing Football House and training centre for the game.
In appreciation of the good work he is doing for the game, ANURA DE SILVA was recently elected as a member of the Executive Board of the 'South West Asian Football Federation. 'SWAFF' will assist and bring collaboration between countries in the West and South Asia and it is a new regional association which has been set up to improve the quality of football in the region's countries.

Caring for teachers
The group of students in the years between 60s and 70s of Sri Sumangala College Panadura shows gratitude in abundance. The bond between those students and their teachers is unique.
Teachers, who are in financial difficulties, receive their students attention very often. One such student is Dr. Dharmasiri Silva who is helping three of his former teachers financially.
The yearend lunch for the retired teachers is an event which is eagerly awaited by them. It is an occasion to recall the past memories when the teachers were together. However, this event depends on generous financial contributions by our past students towards this event.
Majority of teachers are in their twilight years. They need medical assistance and they are under medication due to aging. Consultant Physician Dr. Kosala De Silva due to his initiative along with other doctors, who were all Sumangaliyans, had organized several health camps for the retired teachers. The arrangement to purchase drugs at a special discount of 6 per cent from a private pharmacy is a big relief, as a big slice of the pension of the teachers is being spent on drugs. Dr. Kosala can be consulted at any time of the day for medical advice. He hardly charges a fee from retired teachers. This is a rare quality as majority of medical practitioners are equated with rupees and cents.
The retired teachers had the privilege of participating in two outings. The first tour was sponsored and organized by Anuruth Abeyratna, a successful entrepreneur.
It was a three day trip from February 3 to 6, 2011. The destination was Polonnaruwa. A comfortable luxury bus was provided and the journey was not tiring as teachers were singing along recalling the good old days when were together. The teachers were accommodated in a luxury resort. Teachers organized a reception in honour of Anuruth Abeyratna in appreciation for funding the trip and also working tirelessly to making the outing a memorable one.
The second outing was also organized by Anuruth Abeyratna, Tissa Illeperuma, and D. A. Perera. The latter two are also business magnates like Anuruth who spread their business wings to the Asian region.
It was a two day trip to Pasikuda after visiting Maduru Oya in the first leg. At Maduru Oya, the teachers had the opportunity to sighting the wild elephants in their natural habitat. Both outings were meticulously planned by sponsors attending to minute details depriving any omissions to be occurred.
As one of the participants summed up caring is a rare commodity in an era where the goal is always rupees and cents this trip was sponsored. Where by the aged one was in oasis enjoying the streams in the desert.
Another group of students organized a felicitation ceremony on December 27, 2015 for eleven of their former teachers at Laya Beach Hotel, Wadduwa. The amazing thing was that this group was from Australia.
It was a momentous occasion. We as teachers are happy to note that we are blessed with grateful pupils. Although they are thousands of miles away their hearts and minds are still with teachers. What matters is the thought. We had the privilege of enjoying a sumptuous lunch while listening to music. The grand finale of this event was the gift of Rs. 50,000 to each of eleven teachers who were invited to grace the occasion. This became handy for the low pensioners. Majority of teachers are not in the best health.
The second felicitation was held on December 29, 2017 by the same group of students. The venue was White Heaven Hotel, Talpitiya. Jayantha Silva, who had come from Australia in advance worked tirelessly to make this event success. He was aided by Dharmasiri Silva who generously gave one of his vehicles to visit elderly teachers and ensuring their participation for this event by providing transport facilities to them.
We also had the privilege of meeting our past students who had come from New Zealand, France, England, USA and Australia. Teachers were thrilled to see them. Each teacher was given a gift of some utility value. What was noteworthy were two felicitations were organized by a group of students from Australia and the Old Boys Association of Colombo. We as teachers will treasure all this. In the words of William James, the deepest craving of human nature is the need to be appreciated.

Carn Brea Castle   The haunt of ancient spirits
Juliet Coombe discovers Cornwalls tour de force and dines out on the experience
Carn Brea Castle is small and yet majestic, built on top of natural giant grey boulders balancing precariously together with huge gaps between them, 738 feet above sea level. The rock formations give it a magical mysterious unexplained feel and Carn Brea translated means rocky hill.
In many ways, it has a striking resemblance to Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft and I learn, over dinner in the fabulous Carn Brea Castle Middle Eastern restaurant, that it does have a rather amusing connection to The Harry Potter film, The Chamber of Secrets. The film features a flying turquoise Ford Anglia car, which Harry and Ron borrow without permission from Mr. Wesley when they miss the Hogwarts Express. The original car used in the film was stolen from the studios and later, in 2005, found abandoned in the car park outside Carn Brea Castle. Given that it had no engine and would have been extremely difficult to tow to the top of the hill un-noticed, its appearance at Carn Brea Castle seems to back up the theory that there is some sort of magic at work here in this inhospitable place.
Built on a Neolithic settlement as a chapel to St. Michael, in 1379 AD, on the eastern tor of Carn Brea Hill, the building has had many uses. Around 1790, its purpose was changed from a chapel, when it was converted into a castle folly by the Basset Family, who once owned the hill as part of their Tehidy Estate. During the Elizabethan period, it became an extremely popular hunting and feasting lodge and so it is perhaps appropriate and ironic that this non-symmetrical Grade II listed building is now a restaurant serving steaks and lamb skewered cooked by a Jordanian chef who fell in love with the place in the 1880s.
There is nothing symmetrical about the buildings architecture, with its four turrets, quirky central building and decorative battlements, and yet it is a perfect castle shape, with its magnificent roof terrace and warren of small hobbit-like castle rooms inside. The floor just before the roof terrace has been kept as a play area for the kids, and sells eclectic vintage memorabilia, ranging from a Pinocchio statue with a very long nose to a Bavarian Beer mug. I learn from the boards, with black and white historic photos and drawings on the first floor of the restaurant, that around 6,000 years ago the area was a major Early-Neolithic settlement and fortress. Its true origins, however, are still something of an archaeological mystery. The display includes flint arrowheads and replica gold coins with images on, found in the area. Remnants of burnt wooden palisades suggest that the Castle was attacked at least once in its history. The area, with its unusual stone formations, is so unique that it is not only listed, but has also been assigned its own name  a Tor enclosure. There is also a holy well nearby, complete with stone cross and a number of ancient Neolithic tombs and rock formations indicating a settlement for a period of time. Legend has it that there is a smugglers cave  perhaps, a secret escape tunnel through the hilltop to the sea, for if it was ever captured.
The restaurant, situated inside the gothic style castle, overlooks Camborne, Pool, Barncoose and across to Redruth, opening each day for dinner at 6.30pm, just in time to watch the sun setting. Otherwise, you can enjoy a later dinner, as the restaurant does not close until midnight. Although surrounded on all sides by modern civilisation, you feel, as you tuck into mouthwatering steak, lamb kebabs and mezzi platters, as if you are a whole world away from it all, exposed to the elements. If you decide to go on a brisk walk beforehand, and being the highest point in the area you can get a grandiose sense of being on top of the world, looking out towards coastline to the north and lots of amazing historic Cornish tin mine chimneys below. The rocks further along the track have clearly been used for making things, maybe even coins and there are many theories about them both real and mythical.
Around 1898, the castle started being used as a beacon for ships, with a candle permanently lit at night in the north-facing window. Like a lighthouse, it was visible to the boats passing between St Ives and St. Agnes. It sadly fell into disuse during the early 1950s and in 1978 it was restored and then, in 1982, turned into a superb Middle Eastern restaurant.
In old books on the area, there is a legendary claim that the rocks where Carn Brea Castle now stands were once the lookout seat of a mighty giant called John of Gaunt, whose stride was four feet in distance. They say when he died; he lay out on the hillside and turned to stone. Near the castle, there is a rocky formation known locally as the giants head. Also, one of the best examples of a mythical sacrificial stone (table) can be found around 340 metres to the southwest and has an eerie feel about it - as if the unhappy spirits have hung around, looking for vengeance, hiding out in the fallen rocks.
In the winter, I am told it is even more fun than the warm summer months, with roaring fires, and, as there is no electricity in the castle, the beautiful candles, everywhere, give the place a medieval feel. There is an excellent childrens menu, including Jordanian style curry, which my sons loved, and chicken kebabs. The steak in red wine sauce with mushrooms was phenomenal and we ended up with two out of the three delicious deserts to pick from, with the cheesecake taking top billing. Make sure you have cash or be prepared to do the dishes, as this is a place that has yet to move into the modern world of credit and debit cards due to not having electricity.
On leaving the castle, do take a last look back at it - it is even more magical late at night, lit up by the stars, half moon and one twinkling candle in the Carn Brea window, reminding all those that sail past these shores to be super careful of the precarious sea rocks that once made this unpredictable Cornish coastline a pirate wreckers paradise.

COPE rejects service extension request of Peoples Bank GM
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) rejected a request to give a one year service extension to Peoples Bank General Manager Wasantha Kumara, COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament yesterday.
Handunnetti urged Parliaments special attention to implement the COPE recommendation.
He noted that the Finance Ministry and Public Enterprises Ministry have informed the Committee that they accept the COPE recommendation with regard to the service extension.
There was a request to give a years service extension to Wasantha Kumara, who had completed 60 years.
He was recruited on contract basis in 2001 for a salary of Rs.100,000 and earns a salary of Rs 2.1 million as at now. He had also obtained Rs.75 million as salary increment arrears.
The COPE is of the view that this service extension must not be given and the common recruitment procedure adhered by all banks must be followed in appointing a suitable person as the GM, he explained.
MP Handunnetti said the Finance Ministry has written to the Peoples Bank Chairman asking to follow the recommendation of the COPE.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the Government accepts the COPE recommendation.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena agreed with MP Handunnetti that the attempt to give a service extension to the Peoples Bank GM was faulty and harmful.
He asked the Government not to do anything that could upset the stability of the state bank.
National Policies and Economic Affair State Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva however pointed out that the Government should also pay attention to the salaries offered in the private sector to individuals with similar experience and qualifications.
The Government needs to come to a common understanding on the payments to such officials in order to retain them in the public sector, he commented.
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena objected to the State Ministers remarks stating that paying high remunerations to senior management would not help revive those institutions.
Former SriLankan Airlines CEO Suren Ratwatte was paid a monthly salary of Rs. 3.2 million, but that did not help in rebuilding the national carrier, he added.

Crazy for  Madge
Pouting in the mirror, Adam Guerra slips into a pink leotard before putting on his blonde wig - it's the final step to transform him into his idol Madonna. But unlike others who dress up as celebs for kicks, Adam has gone one step further - over the course of 14 years he has spent 150,000 on a staggering 18 cosmetic surgeries, including cheek, bum and jaw implants, a nose job and fillers - in a bid to look just like her.
Adam, who is 33 and lives in LA, California, is now one of the top Madonna impersonators in the US, and even appeared on the third series of hit show Ru Paul's Drag Race.
The Madge super-fan, who performs all her hits under the drag name 'Venus De-Lite', admits he has spent "practically my whole life, my whole wallet, all the money thats been given to me" to look like his idol Madonna.
Ive had my cheeks implanted and my jaw done several times, Ive had my chin done and Ive had brow lifts and fillers," Adam says. But it is so worth it because I look like Madonna.
Adam, who is of Italian descent just like the Hung Up singer, came from humble beginnings.
His profile on a Ru Paul's Drag Race fan page says that he was 'poor' when he started doing drag - but his life is very different now.
The Madonna wannabe has 13,000 Instagram followers and performs in swanky clubs in Hollywood and Palm Springs.
He now makes thousands of pounds a year as a performer - much of which he puts towards buying replica outfits from iconic Madonna moments.These include her 1980's fishnets and mini skirts to her demure outfits from hit film Evita, and of course the famous cone bra from the Blonde Ambition tour. Adam wasn't always confident, however, and as a teen he struggled to come to terms with his sexuality. He credits his idol with helping him through the difficult times, saying he became obsessed with her at the age of 15.
Id found one of her albums that my mom owned and I played it non-stop," recalls Adam.
I became obsessed with everything she was doing and I really felt like she was speaking directly to me. Everything that I was feeling inside was what she was singing and everything I wanted to be was what she was.
When he was 19 he dressed up as Madonna for the first time to perform Vogue at a club near his home - and his drag act spiralled from there. However, Adam's mum Annette Guerra, who inadvertently introduced him to Madonna, now regrets ever purchasing that Madge CD.
When he first became obsessed with her I was in denial - I didnt want to believe it," she says. I really dislike her because he holds in her high esteem  its like a religion to him. Im always worried about him when he has a procedure done. When he first started doing it he was going to some pretty shady places where I didnt think they were capable or qualified to do what they were doing.
Adam also had to justify his love of Madge to his ex-boyfriend of 11 years, Michael. The pair appeared on reality show My Strange Addiction in 2014, and the programme showed friction between the couple.
"I want to date a boy. I don't want to date a 56-year-old woman," his partner frankly admitted at the time. My ex boyfriend was like my mum  he didnt want me to do it but he knew it was a losing battle," says Adam.
They both wished I would spend my money on other things like savings or a nice car - but to me money comes and goes, possessions come and go, jobs come and go but youve only got one life to live. Adam has no plans to tone down his obsession with Madonna, telling a US paper: "why would I give this up All you can do is please yourself, and this makes me happy.
"And when I take off all the makeup, I see this handsome, gorgeous, good-looking guy."
After starting off earning just six pounds a show Adam has gone on to perform over 1,000 times as the Like a Virgin singer.
He also has dreams of pop stardom, releasing a single in the US called "I'm Not Madonna".
However, he's still not met the star, despite getting into her concerts for free, telling a Texan newspaper that he wasn't "ready yet".
"I know she knows about me. I think there's a part of me that's scared. What if she's not what I think she is" says Adam.
"I admire Madonna too much. If the universe reverses it around and she wants to meet me, of course, I'm going to take the opportunity. But for now, he will continue performing as the blonde bombshell, he added, Its an amazing feeling, its a huge rush and I get nervous because I want to look like her and sound like her.
Whether Im on for 30 minutes or three hours I just have to give it my all. I put a lot of pressure on myself so it can be really nerve wracking.
But despite the reservations of his family and friends Adam is proud of his choice to become Madonna, saying: shes such a powerful character, shes such an iconic character and shes a bitch, shes a queen and just the image of perfection.
No one understands my love for Madonna, I dont even know if she would understand it. I want to die and say hey I did this and no-one else did it. I did it and I enjoyed every minute.

Deveotees to celebrate Krishna Jayanthi
The devotees of Kotahena Sri Sri Radhakrishna temple celebrate Krishna Jayanthi vizha on September 2. Jayanthi is the birthday of Lord Krishna which is an incarnation the Lord descended on earth about five thousand years ago.
'Paritranaya sadhunam vinashaya cha dushkritam. Dharma samsthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge yuge' (Bhagavad Gita 4:8) - to protect the righteous, to annihilate the wicked, and to re-establish the principles of dharma I appear on this earth, age after age
These golden words were spoken by Lord Krishna to Arjuna, at the dawn of the first day of the Great Mahabharata War at Kuruksetra, when Arjuna was all disillusioned and had to make a choice between doing the right and fighting his brothers. As said in the Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna appeared to kill demon Kamsa.
Kamsa, the king of Mathura was a very cruel tyrant. His tyranny spared no one, even the sages had to bear the brunt of this. Finally the Gods could tolerate no more and in a dream Kamsa was told that his evil reign would be brought to an end by his sister Devaki's son who would kill him.
The cowardly tyrant immediately threw his sister Devaki and her husband Vasudev in prison so that he could kill all the sons born to Devaki. In captivity Devaki gave birth to six sons, each of whom was promptly killed by Kamsa.
Just before the birth of seventh child, Lord Vishnu summoned Goddess Yogmaya, an eight-handed female demigod holding different weapons in her hands and wearing different coloured garments. Lord Vishnu asked her to transfer the embryo from Devaki to Vasudeva's another wife Rohini in Gokulam. This child was named Balarama, Shri Krishna's elder brother.
That night the prison guards fell into a deep slumber and the doors were unlocked.
When Devaki gave birth to her eighth child, the newly born baby changed himself into the form of Vishnu and commanded Vasudev to carry him to Nandgaon and place him besides Yasodha.
Vasudeva found himself magically freed from prison, and he fled with the infant and reached the Yamuna River. At that time the river Yamuna was high, but when Baby Krishna's feet touched the waters, the waters parted making a channel for Vasudev to pass.
Holding Infant Krishna sheltered by the snake God Adisesha, Vasudev whisked away to the safety a neighbouring kingdom which was ruled by king Nanda. He was also asked to bring back the baby girl whom Yashoda had delivered.
The generous king Nanda gave away his new born daughter to Vasudev knowing full well what fate awaited her at Kamsa's hands. Vasudev brought back the baby girl.
Seeing the baby girl, the enraged King Kamsa smashed her on the wall but she escaped his hands and flew away to heaven announcing "Beware, your killer is alive".
At Gokul, under king Nanda's protection, Krishna got the loving affection of king Nanda's queen Yashoda whom Krishna looked upon as a mother.
Days passed with fun and frolic, while the child-Krishna grew up. His flute-playing enthralled the young girls or "gopis" who danced around him. The cows gathered with his sweet flute playing. But one day rumors reached Kamsa that Devaki's son had somehow escaped his clutches and was living in Gokul. So Kamsa tried to kill Krishna but eventually he was killed by Krishna.
Remembering this pastime of Lord Krishnas incarnation in the earth the devotees worldwide are celebrating god's appearance as Jayanthi (birthday) grandly.
The incarnation day of Lord Krishna, the Krishna Jayanthi day falls on September 2. On this auspicious day in Kotahena Sri Sri Radhakrishna Temple the idol of infant Krishna will be bathed. It is then adorned with flowers and ornaments.
The programmes will commence at 5.30am and continue till midnight and will include Mangala Arathi, Thulasi Arathi, Nagara Sankirtan and Procession of Baby Krishna, Abishekam of Baby Krishna with Valampuri Conch shells, Rajabhoga Arathi, Cultural Programme by the students of the Hare Krishna College of Music and Dance, Bhajan and Kirtan by the Children of Gokulam and Hare Krishna Religious School, Maha Abishekam and Distribution of Prasadam.

Governors Jetty Trincomalee unveiled
The Governors Jetty in Trincomalee was opened recently by Ambassador of Japan Kenichi Suganuma on the invitation of the Governor Eastern Province Rohitha Bogollagama. Akiko Suganuma and Deepthi Bogollagama also participated.
The main objective of opening the jetty is to promote tourism in East. Trincomalee would also be repositioned as the Eastern Tourism Hub, said the Governor Eastern Province Rohitha Bogollagama. He said that a Master Plan for the Development of the Trincomalee District has been prepared by the Western Development and Megapolis Ministry. This is done jointly with Surbana Jurong, a Singaporean company and the plan was presented to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees.
According to the Master Plan, the first step would be the setting up of a special planning and development authority, which will be called the Master Plan Implementation Unit, which would be later upgraded to Trincomalee Metropolitan Planning and Development Authority.
In addition to this Jetty plans are also underway to develop Trincomalee airport to which would be used for tourism and international standards to accommodate charter aircraft as well.
The government has also asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to formulate a project to improve the basic facilities of the Trincomalee City.
Meanwhile Jurong Consultants Managing Director Philip Tan told that the plan would witness the development of an international airport, a new City Centre, multi-story parking centres, a amusement park, an international cricket stadium, several highways, specialized highways such as dedicated freight highways, a cruise terminal, container terminal at China Bay, an oil refinery and an LNG power plant.
He further said that the entire Trincomalee project is to be completed by 2050.

The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) had kept open its 200 paddy purchasing centres in preparation to buy paddy at the existing guaranteed price; Rs. 38 per kilo of Nadu and Rs. 41 for Samba.
PMB Chairman Upali Mohotti said the government had allocated Rs. 4,900 million for Yala paddy purchasing. The PMB is targeting to buy around 120,000 metric tons of paddy island-wide. He added that the paddy harvest expected during 2018 Yala is 1,400,000 metric tons.
Except for the drought prevailing in Anuradhapura, Yala 2018 looks promising as a whole, he said. In some major paddy cultivation zones, harvesting is still pending.
We have decided to keep our purchasing stores open till October to keep the paddy purchasing prices steady. Now the private sector paddy dealers, including millers, are engaged in purchasing paddy, for example, Samba at Rs. 52 per kilo, Keeri Samba at Rs. 65 per kilo and Nadu at Rs. 45 per kilo. When we first commenced Yala 2018 paddy purchasing in Ampara on August 4, private dealers were exploiting paddy farmers by buying Nadu at Rs. 32 and Samba for Rs. 38. After our interference, the prices had gone up beyond the guaranteed price. This is what we want to achieve for the benefit of paddy farmers, Mohotti said.

Huawei nova 3 series enters Lankan market
Huawei nova 3 series entered the market in early August 2018, the Nova 3 series received record-breaking demand from the Sri Lankan youth due to its revolutionary AI features and trendy design.
Huawei nova devices have always been gorgeous. Previously, devices in this series earned a warm welcome among the youth with their attractive design. Not willing to be outdone by those that came before it, Huawei nova 3 Series comes with a range of trendy hues.
As the first gradient colour offered on Huawei nova devices, Iris Purple deserves a proper introduction. Gradient colours are some of the hottest device colour schemes on the market. Huawei has always had great insights into colours and how they affect design.
News of Huawei nova 3 carrying the gradient colour actually leaked prior to its official launch, so consumers had expected it to come, but that did little to dampen its impact and influence that it made at its unveiling.
Looking back at the history of smartphones, manufacturers have always been keen to bolster their product portfolio with differently coloured devices. And that has worked in the favor of consumers, giving them additional choice.
Compared to other devices in the same price range, this series has seen a lot more attention to detail in its design and colour, and the same fact drives the Huawei nova 3 series to lead in the colour and design trends. In the present day the mobile device is considered a fashion expression and addressing this demand is a huge challenge among the handset makers. However the Huawei nova 3 series has accepted the challenge and addressed the demand through the vivid, shifting colours of the Iris Purple.
The Huawei nova3 and nova3i comes with a one year warranty and will be available for consumers at all Huawei Experience Centers with Sri Lankas leading Smartphone marketer, Singer Sri Lanka PLC ensuring the availability of the nova3 series devices island wide. Selected Dialog and Mobitel outlets would also market the new devices with the Huawei nova3.

India U19 captain Prithvi Shaw named in Indian squad for remaining Test
NOTTINGHAM, Wednesday: India have named 18-year-old batsman Prithvi Shaw
in their squad for the remaining two Tests against England. Shaw replaces dropped opener Murali Vijay while batsman Hanuma Vihari, who can also bowl off-spin, comes in for left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav.
The tourists wrapped up a 203-run victory in the third Test at Trent Bridge on Wednesday to cut Englands lead in the five-match series to 2-1. The fourth Test in Southampton starts on 30 August.
Vijay opened in Indias defeats at Edgbaston and Lords, while Kuldeep played in the second Test. Neither featured in Nottingham.

He hit 188 for India A against West Indies A in a four-day game at Beckenham in July, having also scored one-day hundreds against the same opponents and Leicestershire the previous month. He made 62 and a two-ball duck in a 253-run defeat by England Lions.
Both Shaw and Vihari, 24, hit centuries against South Africa A earlier this month. Vihari has made 15 hundreds in 63 first-class matches at an average of 59.79. Seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar is again not included, having missed the first three Tests because of a back injury he aggravated during defeat by England in the third one-day international last month.
Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin appeared to be hampered by a hip injury at Trent Bridge but is expected to be fit for the fourth Test. The fifth Test at the Oval starts on 7 September.
India squad for fourth and fifth Tests: Virat Kohli (capt), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Prithvi Shaw, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Shardul Thakur, Karun Nair, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Hanuma Vihari.

Kabaddi crisis: India miss out on gold for first time
JAKARTA, Thursday: India's men's kabaddi team hit a new low on Thursday when they missed out on Asian Games gold for the first time following their second defeat in a week.
The seven-time champions, who had never lost in the tournament until Monday's defeat to South Korea, slumped 27-18 to Iran in the semi-finals to finish with a bronze medal.
Until this week, India had only ever lost once before in the home-grown, breath-holding sport, after they went down to South Korea at the 2016 World Cup.
India are now relying on their women's team, the two-time reigning champions, to defend national honour in their final against Iran.
Kabaddi, an ancient sport rooted in Indian mythology, made its Asian Games debut at the 1990 edition in Beijing.
The game requires yoga-like breathing skills as two seven-player teams send a raider into enemy territory to tag an opponent before returning to safety, all on one breath. AFP

King Kohli back on top of the world
LONDON, Thursday: India captain Virat Kohli has returned to the top of the International Cricket Council's Test batting rankings following his man-of-the-match effort against England at Trent Bridge.
The 29-year-old scored 97 and 103 and saw India beat England by 203 runs in the third Test at Nottingham's Trent Bridge on Wednesday as they reduced the hosts' lead in a five-match series to 2-1.
Kohli took top spot in the rankings for the first time after scoring a hundred in the series opener at Edgbaston.
But he lost it to the banned Steve Smith after struggling in the second Test at Lord's even though the former Australia captain has not played since March.
Smith was suspended for a year and stripped of the captaincy by Cricket Australia for his part in a ball-tampering scandal against South Africa, but his ranking points have not changed.
Kohli's impressive display at Edgbaston, however, took him to 937 rating points, above Smith's current mark of 929, in the latest edition of the ICC standings published on Thursday.
Meanwhile Australia's David Warner, like Smith given a ban for his role in the ball-tampering scandal, rose a place to fourth despite not playing.
England captain Joe Root dropped down to fifth after managing just 16 and 13 at Trent Bridge.
As well as raw figures, the ICC chart also aims to take into account factors such as the quality of the opposition.
Kohli, who has scored 440 runs so far in the England series, has now achieved the 11th highest all-time rating among Test batsmen and could move further up that list in the remaining two matches of the England series.
The top 10 is headed by Australia's Donald Bradman (961 points), who is widely considered to be the greatest Test batsman cricket has known.
It also includes Smith (947), England's Len Hutton (945) and Jack Hobbs (942), Australia's Ricky Ponting (942) and England's Peter May (941).
Meanwhile West Indies stars Gary Sobers, Clyde Walcott and Vivian Richards, as well as Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, all achieved a rating of 938 points.
England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson remained top of the bowlers' rankings.

Lankan exporters have beaten  global competition - Malik
Sri Lankan exporters should not be worried about the global competition as the islands export community has already made a huge positive impact in the global scene by successfully entering into niche segments and markets.
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama in a recent statement said, anyone who says Sri Lankan manufactures should be careful before opening up because the country may not be able to compete, is doing a huge injustice to the exporters who have successfully captured some of the leading international markets for their products.
Why should Sri Lankans be scared of competing with the world, he asked.
Some of our exporters have done extremely well. Our rubber tyres are used in the worlds top aircraft; our surgical gloves are used by the worlds best surgeons; our electronic sensors are used in the worlds top car brands; our apparels are worn by the worlds top athletes and major brands are produced in Sri Lanka and our IT software is used by the worlds leading stock markets, he said
Minister Samarawickrama added, We can compete. Our industries are already showing how theyve capitalized on the regaining of GSP plus.
In 2017, Sri Lanka had the highest ever export earnings of 15.1billion dollars and this year it may further rise to 17.4 billion dollars. 2017 was also a record year for foreign investment recording US$ 1.9 billion and in 2018 this may rise to around US$ 2.5 billion.
However, these are extremely low figures in comparison to some of the other Asian countries, he said.
Sri Lankan companies are progressively moving towards and practicing sustainable production concepts such as the organic produce, green production, as well as fair trade practices which are highly valued by the consumers world over and in particular in the EU.
The ability to penetrate the EU market as a strong country respecting basic human rights, rule of law and good governance would send a strong signal to the international investor community which will facilitate the attraction of inward FDI, he said.
In addition, to GSP+ we have executed the Singapore FTA earlier this year, we are in the advance stages of negotiating a FTA with China, and expanding our current FTA with India through Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA).
ETCA can increase Sri Lankas competitiveness in industrial exports and also increase the countrys supply capacity, to better utilise the market access to India. In addition, ETCA negotiations are addressing outstanding non-tariff barriers in the Indian market as well as many of the existing procedural barriers and delays in Indian ports of entry, particularly through mutual recognized agreements.
The minister said the Government was aware of the possible trade disruptions that can occur during the transition period and were looking at providing a trade adjustment package for local industrialists to upgrade machinery and introduce new technology. They can then be more competitive and serve the local market as well as export to the regional and global markets. (SS)

LP gas distributors urge price revision
LP Gas Distributors Association of Sri Lanka (LPGDASL) says that they need a revision in prices for transport and other overheads with immediate effect as their service costs have gone up.
President, Sathyendra Wijayapura, LPGDASL told Daily News Business that the last revision was made in 2007 and 2012. The key issue evolving the distribution of Gas is the present Channel Margin ( for distributor and dealer) which is not reviewed since 2007 while the District wise Transport Margin was never addressed similarly except once in 2012 on a small scale.
Sathyendra Wijayapura
Diesel Prices have gone up by Rs 23 since April this year (2018) and it is a 24.21% increase. Furthermore, the Government increased the price of 4 star Diesel again in the end of July by another one rupee. The future vehicle standards being Euro 4, all the trucks that transport gas would have to shift to Euro 4 Standard in time to come and then the distributors will have to incur a further burden on the price.
In addition due to the rupee depreciation inputs needed for distribution process such as tyres, spare parts, lubrication service costs, lubrication oil costs and the financial costs for bank borrowing, leasing, safety gear and fire control equipments, has also increased.
Distributors find it extremely impossible to continue their operations due to the extensive out flow of finances and the most difficult part is the retention of trained staff who would seek alternative employment in the absence of solutions to their grievances, he added.
Wijayapura said that due to this distributors are reluctantly compelled to downsize the deliveries if this issue is not addressed immediately as every day that passes without a sufficient margin and a transport margin (based on the fuel hike/depreciation of the rupee) would push them to a severe financial crisis which would result in an acute shortage of gas to households, industries, tourist hotels and even for crematoriums.
Various representations made to the LITRO Gas Lanka Limited have not helped in finding a lasting solution.
LITRO GAS says that the decision in this regard has to be taken by the CAA and has to be approved by CAA.
The CAA says that they are still studying this issue.
Liquid Petroleum Gas (LP gas) is the most popular, convenient and economical energy source in the domestic and commercial cooking in addition to the industrial, hospitality trade and agricultural (animal husbandry) use on a commercial basis. At present over 5.5 million households use LP gas as the main cooking energy and there are two brands that is Litro Gas and Laugh Gas. Litro Gas enjoys over 73% of the market which is over 4.25 million households. (SS)

Mahendran wants copy of warrant, summary of evidence
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran who is absconding though a warrant had been issued for his arrest over the Central Bank Bond issue has requested through Interpol for several documents including the copy of the warrant, the Attorney Generals Department informed court yesterday.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara appearing for the prosecution made this revelation during the magisterial inquiry into the Central Bank Bond issue taken up for inquiry before Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
It has been revealed that Arjuna Mahendran had requested through Interpol in Singapore for copies of several documents including the copy of the warrant and summary of evidence against him.
Taking into consideration the facts, the Magistrate issued an order directing the prosecution that court be informed regarding the measures taken to implement the warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue.
The court had issued the warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, since he failed to comply with the court orders.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney Generals Department had informed Court that the CID is in the process of initiating necessary legal action for the extradition of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till August 30 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with the criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Defence Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.

MAIN PARTIES TO VOTE AGAINST DELIMITATION REPORT
The United National Front (UNF), Joint Opposition (JO) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) have decided to vote against the report of the Delimitation Committee on Provincial Councils.
The Parliamentary Groups of these Parties met separately in Parliament yesterday and both groups have unanimously decided to vote against the report.
The report has to be passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament in order to hold the PC elections under the new electoral system. The UNF Parliamentary Group chaired by Prime Minsiter Ranil Wickremesinghe met at the Parliament complex yesterday morning.
A UNP member said they prefer to hold the PC elections under the old electoral system.
We prefer to revert to the old system to avoid further delay of PC elections. Moreover, minority parties representing the UNF are of the view that the new system with 50:50 ratio for First-Past-the-Post System and Proportional Representation System does not ensure fair representation to them and they are against it, he added. Meanwhile, Party Leaders who met yesterday were undecided as to whether the vote of the report will be taken up at the end of the debate today.
Another Party Leaders Meeting chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will be held today morning to take a final decision in that regard.
A full-day debate on the Report of the Delimitation Committee for the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils will be held from 11am to 6 pm today.
The minority groups led by Ministers Rauf Hakeem, Mano Ganesan, Rishad Bathiudeen and UPFA MP Douglas Devananda have already stated that they are against holding the PC elections under the new system.
However, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha, who represents the SLFP, strongly advocated for the new electoral system when he spoke in Parliament recently.
The JO also conducted a group meeting chaired by its Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena at the Parliament complex yesterday.
The JO is of the opinion that the new system does not reflect the peoples real mandate. They also complain that the Government was trying to delay the elections by using the new electoral system as an excuse.
However, the two thirds majority is needed even if the House wants to repeal the new electoral system in order to go back to the previous system.
The delimitation committee comprised of Kanagaratnam Thavalingam (Chairman), retired Surveyor General, Dr.Anila Dias Bandaranaike, retired Assistant Governor of the Central Bank, Professor S.H. Hisbullah, Prof. Sangara Wijeyasandiran and retired Assistant Election Commissioner Premathilaka Siriwardena presented the report to the Minister on February 19.
The delimitation report was submitted to the House by Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha on March 6. The elections for the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa PCs are already due, and the term of another three PCs namely the Central, Northern and North Western PCs is due to end by September.
Party Leaders on July 20 agreed to schedule the PC elections on January 5, 2019 if Parliament could arrive at an agreement on the matters relating to the elections before the end of October.

Monumental mount
Although Sri Lanka is a tiny country, the beautiful mountain range located in the central highlands has created history as a landmark. Besides, the central highlands have been legendary in continuing the countrys territorial integrity for many centuries.
During the independence struggle against the colonial administration, the central mountainous region covered by the hills and rocky Mountains of Namunukula, Lunugala, Kodgala, Haputale, Madulsima and Narangala in the Uva province has offered shelter to those involved in the struggle.
Narangala mountain range is a beautiful landscape and environment zone, located within the boundaries of Haliela, Soranatota and Kandaketiya Divisional Secretariats in Badulla District. The 4540-feet peak is formed like a mountainous elevation. In Uva Province, Narangala is the second most attractive hotspot. Namunukula mountain range is the topmost hotspot in the region.
The Narangala mountain range dates back to the Buddhas first visit to Sri Lanka at Mahiyangana nine months following the enlightenment. It was on the Duruthu Full Moon Poya Day in 528 BC.
The Uva inhabitants believe that the Buddha came to Mahiyangana expecting to leave his footprint on the top of Narangala Mountain. However, a group of villagers settled down in the vicinity were farming with wild buffalos. This phenomenon has compelled the Buddha to abandon the idea of leaving a footprint on Narangala. This indicates the agribusiness-based lifestyle that existed 2600 years ago in the small villages around the Narangala mountain range.
King Walagambas reign
Another significant historical incident related to the Narangala mountain range comes from King Walagambas reign. The king found shelter in hill country owing to the Chola invasions between 105 and 89 BC. King Walagamba and his retinue took shelter in the Bogoda Vihara area, situated along the right bank of the Nachangala mountain range. The king called ordered a tunnel to be dug from Bogoda Rajamaha Viharaya (close to Narangala mountain) to Dowa Raja Maha Viharaya in Bandarawela. One area of the tunnel was built on the peak of the Narangala Mountain. The evidence of that entrance is visible in Bogoda and Dowa temples.
One folktale of Uva relates how a Buddhist monk, with a dog, toured through the tunnel near the Bogoda Rajamaha Viharaya, in order to check access to the old road. The dog appeared from the Narangala hill, but without his master. It seems that these tunnels, constructed over 2,000 years ago, pose some danger in the middle. The monk could probably have become the victim of a vicious animal.
Between the 16th and 19th Centuries, Badulla was a sub-capital of the Kandyan Kingdom. The road between Badulla and Kandy was positioned to the southern part of Narangala. The Upper Uva mountain area has been split into three subdivisions: Udu-kinda, Manda-Kinda and Yati-Kinda.
The Narangala mountain range is located in the suburban areas of the Yati-Kinda division.
The famous book of poetry, Maga Salusanka, written in the 18th Century, provides details of the main villages of the old Badulla-Kandy road. It also highlights the villages close to Narangala Mountain. Alugolla, Koholila, Kahatagaharappa, Galpotta, Millagaruppaha Bogota and Uma Oya are also located along the right side of the Narangala hill. In the 1980s, a group of journalists from a Sinhala daily walked through this ancient road from Badulla to Kandy following the Maga Salusanka to prove the heritage to the present generation.
Significant facts regarding the Narangala range reveal that the knoll that had been burning for more than one year from November 1817 to November 1818 indicates the period of the independence struggle in Uva-Wellassa. The Ceylon Gazetteer, published in the British era, elaborated the Narangala range in this manner:
Narangalakanda, a lot of significant size in the province of Weyaloowa, about 8 miles of Horanatota. At the base of this mountain is a remarkably large cavern or dell, which furnished a shelter to the rebels in 1817.
The note has clearly explained that the cavern or dell near the Narangala mountain range had helped in the training and gathering of the Army in the liberation struggle of 1817-18.
In a note on the 1817-18 insurgencies in the British writings of January 1818, Captain Blan Kenengge mentions how from the rebels travelled from Kandy to Wellassa through the Narangala mountain range across the Uma Oya.
Ooma Oya a river which branches off Mahaweli Ganga and intersects the road from Kandy to Badulla 5 miles from Kurundoo Oya. It often rises to a considerable degree; and January 1818 was so high that Captain Blank Kenburgh was obliged to pass his men over a hanging foot bridge, leaving behind all the heavy baggage.
Following October 1818, leaders of the independence movement, including Kappetipola, were sheltered by the local sponsors. They took the government for a ride in anticipation of repression by the British forces as well as the imperialist powers. According to information presented by the spies to the British, many of the surviving local leaders were caught on the Nagaragala mountain range during the Independence struggle.
Independence struggle
The Kandaketiye Raterala who contributed to the independence struggle was arrested on December 28, 1918, in the Viyaluwa area. The Jayakagedara Mohottala detainee was stopped while they were approaching the Narangala mountain range. Tennawatte Raterala, Allokkan Mudiyanse and Thambakumbure Pihinarala were also arrested near the Narangala Mountain.
At the end of the liberation struggle of Uva Wellassa, the British nationals on the spot kept some records of the Narangala region. On March 26, 1819, six months following the war, John Davy passed through the villages of Kalupahana Idalgashinna, Welgahahahena Heimbeliaththewela, Ketawela Alugolla, and arrived in Badulla. He identified the situation of burned villages and the turbulent surroundings in the environment as recorded in his book An Account of the Interior of Ceylon.
In his Eleven Years in Ceylon, Jonathan Forbes records his observation of the Narangala Mountain on his way to Badulla through the Uma Oya. The book, published in 1833, has beautifully captured the many places in Uva Province.
Ten of the top ten sights in Sri Lanka, published in 1893 by Henry Truman, deals with Sri Lankan botanical gardens. This book also contains information about the Narangala mountain range. In a brief description on the ecosystem of the Narangala area in 1860, C W Ondaatje records how the expanse of the hills at Narangala was used for shade cultivation.
From Taldana pass 4 miles from Badulla, we notice a Chain of hills covered with Chena cultivation, the highest of which is Narangala. The lower Badulla can also be seen wandering along the Badulla-Oya. From many other points great and interesting prospects of the nation can be easily commanded.
In 1887, the British Royal Meteorological Societys monthly journal, Francis J Warren, wrote an article about the weather in Sri Lanka and recorded it as the main place in the hill country including weather and sights of the island.
The Southern part of this central dividing ridge with its spurs includes some of the highest peaks in Ceylon, thus starting from Kirigalpota, in the South, Totapola 7,746 feet, Hakgala 7,147 feet, Pedro Talagala 8,296 feet, the highest mountain in the Island, False Pedro 6,782 feet, and finally Hantane near Kandy 4,120 feet, are passed on the main ridge; while the Great Western 7,264 feet, and the Peacock 4,975 feet, are spurs on its western side; and Narangala 5,006 feet, Gommale 5,516 feet, Mahakudagala 6,900 feet, Diyatalawa 5,026 feet, are the culminating points of some of its spurs on the Eastern side.
The average rainfall value in the Narangala area is 2,656 millimetres. As the plantation economy expanded throughout the 19th Century, the coffee plantation was introduced to the Narangala area because of its tropical climate. With the degeneration of the coffee planters, the growers were keen on spreading tea plantation throughout the region. Tea is the primary source of income for the occupants of Narangala area. Cocoa was also introduced to the nearby Kinekale estate. But cocoa could not produce a good harvest.
The nine-kilometre road from Dikwella (Haliela) to Keenakale via Narangala Mountain and the five-kilometre road up to Keenakale from Maditale was constructed in 1891. In 1891, a road across Badulla from Ketawala was constructed across a St. James Plantation. As the new road from Badulla was open for transport, the old road stretched between Badulla and Kandy was deserted.
Following the conquest of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815 and the establishment of the road system and administrative mechanism, the 1817/18 rebellion is the worst tragedy the British encountered. The war-backers were voted down, locked up and captured. None of their descendants was chosen for the government positions thereafter.
On November 20, 1818, a government order issued by Governor Robert Browning approved the appointment of a government agent as a new head to Uva Province. It was mentioned that A government agent will be living in Uva, and he was assigned to Uva, Wellassa, Wiyaluwa, and Madugalle Gabadagama. Accordingly, Major A Martin was appointed as the government agent of Uva region on February 1, 1820.
Ancient temples and antiquities
On November 31, 1818, Godegedara Dissanayake Herath Mudiyanse was appointed to the posts of Disava, Bogoda and Rilpola Korales. Katugaha Bandaranaike Herath Mudiyanse was chosen as the district leader.
In 1851, Rambukpotha Senevirathna Mudiyanse was named as Soranathota, Oya Province, Bogoda and Rilpola Dissaya. In 1861, Hewelawala Rate Mahatthaya was appointed to the Soranathota, Wililuwa Oya palatha which belongs to Narangala area.
The Narangala mountain range in the northwest direction to Badulla town consists of two major mountain ranges. Its eastern section is the main hill forming a stump.
It can be seen at the western end of the mountain, which is similar to that of the Bethalagala Mountain (Bible Rock). These valleys flow through the mountains of Badulu Oya and Uma Oya, with more than 120 waterways and small water lines. The famous Bogoda Wooden Bridge, built on the Golandara Oya, also flows through the Narangala mountain range.
The Narangala Mountain range is surrounded by a host of ancient temples and antiquities. Bogoda cave, Bogoda wooden Bridge and Bogoda Raja Maha Viharaya with ancient paintings are a few highlights. Buduge-kandana ancient Walagamba Viharaya, Kohavila Pattini Devalaya, Soranatota Booliyadda Devalaya, Galuda Ampitiya Archaeological Building, Kandegedara Sri Sudarshanaramaya, Sri Vidyasagara Maha Pirivena Galauda Sri Dharmnicathana Maha Pirivena and Maluwegoda Raja Maha Viharaya Vihara are also located in the vicinity.

Not-so-romantic reason brides stand on the left at the altar
Most girls dream of their wedding day with delight. But back in the 16th century it was a day to perhaps dread for most brides.
In today's world, not many ponder much about where the bride and groom are situated at the altar. However, back in the day in Britain, it was a strategic move.
Grooms would kidnap women from the local community to marry, The Sun reported. The bride would be snatched with no clue and brought to the groom for the ceremony.
During the ceremony, she would always stand on the left while he was on her right. This was so he could draw his sword in case people tried to come rescue her or if other suitors attempted to fight for her.
Which brings to mind the original role of the best man. The most accomplished swordsman was picked for this role to kidnap the bride and stand guard during the ceremony.

OMP to submit interim report to President, PM
After a series of consultations and numerous meetings with family members of those who have disappeared, Chairman of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris said that the Commission is ready to submit its interim report to both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe next week detailing their findings and recommendations. Speaking to the media, Peiris said that the interim report includes recommendations particularly relating to the welfare of families whove lost loved ones in order for them to gain some form of closure.
Sri Lanka has a high rate of disappearances in the world and the purpose of the OMP is to ensure that this issue is brought to the notice of all and that we acknowledge the sufferings of these families. We owe it to them, a means for them to find closure, he said. So far the OMP has met over 2000 families and have agreed to work closely with regional civil society organizations which he said had already done a considerable amount of work.
One needs to bear in mind that there have been many commissions before the OMP and one of the crucial tasks of this commission is to compile a list of those who are missing, he said.
He added that the the civil society groups have received nearly 16 000 applications, the ICRC 5100 who have gone missing in action during the war, the Parnagama Commission has a list of over 20 000 while another entity set up through the National reconciliation ministry has 13 000. We need to collate and compile the list, he said refusing to give a figure adding that there could be many overlappings.
There have been instances where some of these families had not approached any of those older commissions and in some instances they hadnt even lodged a police entry, said Fahim Mirak, a member of the OMP adding at the task ahead for this entity would not only be a collection but collation of these findings.
Referring to the Mannar Mass grave which was unearthed at a site belonging to the Sathosa building, Peiris added that the OMP will ensure that the work of these archeologists continues unhindered and would financially support in ensuring that these excavations are completed and that they are sent overseas for identifications.
It is part of the mandate of the OMP to help with such a process. When we realized that the work at the Mannar Mass grave would stall due to a lack of funds, the OMP channeled its funds to ensure that it does not stop, he said. We will continue to support the researchers who need to submit samples overseas to ascertain the period of this mass grave as well as the identification, which cannot be done here.
The OMP is also commemorating the International Day for the victims of the enforced disappearance with an event on the 30th at the J.R.Jayawardena centre. The theme for this event is no more disappearances and Dr. Deepika Udagama, Chairperson of the HRCSL will deliver the keynote address. There will also be representatives from family members of those whove disappeared who will share their stories.

Own a pet squirrel
Squirrels are quick and charismatic little rodents that are one of the most commonly observed mammals in the North American wild. Their bouncy, bushy tails give them an appeal that evades other rodents like rats and mice. Some people might wonder if squirrels can be kept as pets, especially if they find orphaned wild squirrels that need care.
Grey Squirrel
Everyone is highly familiar with this common sight. Grey squirrels are common arrivals at nature centers and they are found in all the contiguous states. Most people come to own grey squirrels when they adopt them from the wild, but a small number of breeders exist. They can be challenging pets and many states make it illegal to take them from the wild to keep as a pet.
While any animal with teeth can bite, grey squirrels are known to bite at least every once in a while. They are also equipped with sharp claws, so these are not pets for people not willing to tolerate some damage. They also will only bond to one person, and everyone else will not be able to handle them. These are poor pets for most people. The same goes for the native fox squirrel, which is the largest species of tree squirrel in North America.
Chipmunk
Not many people know that these small rodents are also a species of squirrel. As of current, chipmunks are becoming more difficult to find in the United States, but non-native Siberian chipmunks, which look similar to those in our backyards, are the most commonly available and are more likely to be legal since they are exotic. The smaller size of chipmunks give them more reasonable enclosure size requirements, but many owners prefer to house them in large aviaries. Chipmunks are not avid climbers like grey squirrels, but they can still benefit from a cage with ledges and places to climb. Chipmunks can be affectionate and interact with their owners.
Rock Squirrel
Rock squirrels are not common pets, but some people keep them. They are native to parts of the American Southwest and Mexico. They are one of the largest species of squirrel and look similar to prairie dogs. Also like prairie dogs, they have a mostly herbivorous diet, are social rodents, and dig community burrows. As they live in colonies, this animal will have strong social needs in captivity.
Flying Squirrel
Flying squirrels probably make the best pets on this list. These small creatures are highly affectionate, bond with their owner, and can even get along with people who arent their caretakers. In addition, they are cool pets to own, given their unique physical characteristic of having a membrane at their sides that they use to glide from branch to branch. Similarly to the joeys of some marsupials, humans craft this relationship by carrying the rodents around in special pouches a few hours a day for the first few weeks of their lives. Flying squirrels will happily reside in a well-furnished aviary-type enclosure; it doesnt need to be huge. These squirrels are native to parts of the United States so check your native animal laws.

Pandith Amaradeva: Exceptional artiste
Pandith W.D. Amaradeva was not only an exceptional artiste but also a man of an era who was a prominent intellectual, a scholar, a visionary and a humanist, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said.
President Sirisena was addressing the House participating in the second reading of Amaradeva Aesthetic and Research Centre Bill.
President Sirisena said State patronage will be a constant presence to pursue Pandith Amaradevas vision.
The nation is eternally indebted to Pandit Amaradeva for bringing international fame to Sri Lanka, President Sirisena said.
The Amaradeva Aesthetic and Research Centre is set up to preserve the unique music tradition developed by Pandith Amaradeva, blending his extensive understanding in local and Indian music, and handing it over to the future generation, President Sirisena said.
The centre is a request by Pandith Amaradewa and a promise given by President Sirisena at formers funeral ceremony.
Laying of the foundation stone for the center took place on August 28, 2017 at the Battaramulla Ape Gama complex under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. The project will cost Rs. 250 MN. President Sirisena said Pandith Amaradeva is an exemplary figure for all the artistes in the country.
Censorship on art senseless - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said he does not believe in censorship on art and urged Cultural Affairs Minister to reconsider the bans imposed upon certain radio dramas and writings recently.
Minister Samaraweera was participating in the second reading of the Amaradeva Aesthetic and Research Centre Bill yesterday.
The Minister said a proper method and policy need to be adopted with regard to censorship of art, otherwise if bans are imposed according to personal whims and fancies, it would ultimately violate the right to expression.
Art is something that should be done freely. We should ensure the artistes right for expression. he said. Certain anti-government groups are trying to orchestrate a Buddhist wave against the government. These groups trigger such incidents. he said.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking about three radio dramas to be broadcast on Independent Television Network (ITN) Radio. The three radio dramas of Malaka Devapriya, Nihon Sepa Labewa, Tharuwan Saranai, Nirwasthran Paraman Sukhan, were accused by several nationalistic organizations and Omalpe Sobhitha Thera that they insult Buddhism.
We do not want to censor books, programs and dramas. After this incident was reported, I personally asked for scripts and went through them. I did not find anything which insult Buddhism in any way as some people claim. In fact, they reveal the truth in this society.
The drama named Tharuwan Saranai speaks about celebrity culture and consequences of it. Nihon Sepa Labewa is all about Sri Lankans struggle to go Japan and earn money. None of them insult Buddhism. They speak about real problems in this country. I firmly believe media censorship does not resolve any problem in the country, but would make everything much worse, Minister Samaraweera said.
When Minister Samaraweera was speaking about the radio dramas, JO MP Bandula Gunawardena told his attempt to produce a film about the murder to Richard de Zoysa was barred by the authorities.
Minister Samaraweera questioned who barred MP Gunawardenas attempt.
I will never bar anything as such. While we are at it, why dont you also produce a movie about the murder of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge We can do movies on assaulted journalist Keith Noyahr and Prageeth Ekneligoda as well. We can also make a movie about how a family survived a month by spending only Rs. 2,500, Minister Samaraweera said.
Why dont you come with two scripts, one on Richard de Soyza and the other of Lasantha Wickrematunge Lets get the approval for both, he said.
Minister Samaraweera said the government has decided to introduce changes to certain shortcomings pointed out by the artistes. We as a government are always sensitive to artistes requests.
They said certain difficulties they face because of several taxes and we have taken necessary steps, the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said the government has decided to reduce the income tax on artistes and writers whose monthly income is over Rs. 50,000. He said the former government imposed a 10 per cent income tax on artistes and writers if their monthly income exceeded Rs. 50,000.
Excise duty based on alcohol volume: Liquor sale decreased 11 per cent - Mangala
Imposing excise duty on liquor based on alcohol volume has decreased its sale 11 per cent during the last six months, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said.
The Minister was participating in the second reading of the Excise (Amendment) Bill in Parliament.
Minister Samaraweera said the excise duty on liquor based on alcohol volume will also lessen the health cost that people who consume liquor with a high volume of alcohol incur to the government.
Minister Samaraweera said the amendments include a decision to paste a sticker on every bottle of legally produced arrack. He said it will decrease the illegal liquor in the market and will increase the government excise duty revenue. The government will receive an additional revenue of nearly Rs. 20-25 BN if a sticker is pasted on every legally produced bottle of arrack as per the decision.
Tamil speaking persons told to join Police
Tamil speaking persons are strongly encouraged to join with Sri Lanka Police as there is a shortage of Police officers fluent in Tamil Language, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
The Minister was responding to a question by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda under the Standing Order 27 (2) in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister said that only 15 per cent of the police personnel in the Northern and Eastern Provinces are fluent in Tamil language.
He said his ministry together with the National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages Ministry is conducting programmes to improve proficiency in Tamil language for Police personnel.
MP Devananda questioned the actions by the government to control violent and anti-social acts in the Jaffna District. He said the people in the North are living in fear as sword attacks, arson attacks, and attacks on shops and personal property are increasing. He queried whether drug traffickers or political hands were behind those violent incidents in Jaffna.
The Minister said there was no information to claim that drug traffickers or political figures were behind those incidents. He said 38 persons of the Aava group were arrested in the past two to three months for violent acts.
He said that additional Police cadres were deployed in areas where such violent acts were reported and special mobile units were deployed for surveillance.
Amaradeva Centre to open in January
The Amaradeva Aesthetic and Research Centre Bill was brought in under the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena, Finance and Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanne said.
Participating in the reading of the bill, Alagiyawanne said that it is for the first time that such a Bill was presented to Parliament.
He said the Amaradeva Aesthetic and Research Centre will be opened next January.

JVP told to request investigation into two cadres deaths
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara yesterday told the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna to provide fresh documents requesting to investigate the deaths of two JVP political supports during 2009-2010.
The Minister was responding to a query by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who demanded to know why there was a delay in investigations into the killings of two JVP cadres, Chandradasa Naiduwawadu and Nandana Balage.
The Minister said he will look into the possibility of investigating the two deaths.
MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said three years have gone since the government came to power, but it had failed to investigate many political killings took place during the previous regime.
This government was appointed not because of the fame of individual figures such as Maithripala Sirisena or Ranil Wickremesinghe but because of the high demand for democracy and justice. So it is the responsibility of the government to do justice for these victims, JVP leader Dissanayake said.
JVP cadre Nandana Balage was shot dead on April 5, 2009 at Veyangoda while he was participating in JVP propaganda activities for the April 25, 2009 provincial council elections. The suspects were supporters of the then governor of the Western Province. They prevented the arrest and escaped the law with the help of the powers of the office of the Western Province Governor. Law was not implemented against the culprits who are still at large, he said.
On January 25, 2010, another JVP cadre, Chandradasa Naiduwawadu, was attacked while he was attending propaganda activities in Ambalangoda during the presidential polls of January 2010. He succumbed to his injuries on February 2, 2010 at hospital. Two others injured in the attack. Though the assault had been a major one and the injuries the victims received were severe, Ambalangoda police did nothing against the attackers who had been supporters of Sajin Vass Gunawardena.
A complaint was lodged by Chandradasa Naiduwawadu on January 14, 2010 at the Ambalangoda Police under the number EIB 52/37 on the death threats. That complaint too had not been investigated. There was a case heard at Balapaitiya court on the death and eye witnesses gave their evidence. Thereafter the case did not proceed. These two deaths were among many deaths that took place during the previous government and hitherto among unsolved crimes of a dark age. The crimes had been covered by using the political power. It is the duty of this government to investigate them. Dissanayake said.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said that the Department of Attorney General had informed him that there was not enough evidence to proceed legal actions.
JVP leader Dissanayake said that there were evidence and accounts of eye witnesses which had been undermined by the then law enforcement authorities because of the political pressure.
IR Dept will probe MPs wealth, income
Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said he informed the Inland Revenue Department to collect the information of wealth and income sources of Parliamentarians.
The State Minister was replying to a question by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
He said the IR Department has sent forms to collect information on income of persons who owns vehicles. He said an ordinary person asked him whether the same procedure applies to the MPs and ministers.
This person said there are MPs who acquired new houses, lands and vehicles within a short period after their election to Parliament. He asked me whether the IR Department has sent forms to collect information of those properties as well. I informed the IR Department to find out those information of the MPs. We believe that the law should be equal to everybody, he said.State Minister Wickramaratne said the government earned Rs. 50 billion by the Super Gain Tax that the Budget 2016 introduced. He said 538 high income earning companies had paid the Super Gain Tax. He said successive governments in the past 30 years had granted unlimited tax concessions and exemptions to the companies through the BOI. These concessions were restricted to a certain level by the new Inland Revenue Act and concessions are now given to the amount of investment made, he said.
GMOA toils for new Hitler - Mangala
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said GMOA President Anurudhddha Padeniya is an advocate toiling to bring a new Hitler into power in the country. The Minister referred to Padeniya as Paapadeniya for his actions.
The Minister yesterday dressed down GMOA President Anurudhddha Padeniya for intimidating a journalist of the Sunday Observer when the latter has contacted Padeniya over the telephone seeking a comment for a newspaper article.
Minister Samaraweera was participating in the second reading of the Amaradeva Aesthetic and Research Centre Bill yesterday.
Minister Samaraweera said Padeniyas behaviour is Taliban or Hitler-like. Padeniya has told this journalist that they can methodically prove any person to have a mental illness. This was the method followed by Taliban or Hitler rule.
The modern world will not allow no room for such manipulation. This revealed that Padeniya is a supporter in the mission to bring a Hitler into power, he said.
Loans write-off will benefit 75,000 women
About 75,000 women will benefit with the recent government decision to write off the non-consumption loans granted up to Rs. 100,000 by registered microfinance institutions, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was responding to the concerns by JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He said the Central Bank has told those companies to send before the end of this month the personal details and the amount of the loan obtained by each women eligible to receive the relief measure of the government.
He said that even though the government provided this relief to women in 12 drought-affected districts - Trincomalee, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa - it will be extended to women in all other areas under the next stage.
He said the government granted this relief only to those who had obtained loans from registered microfinance companies, while there are many other who borrowed from unregistered companies and unscrupulous lenders.
MP Dissanayake pointed out several loopholes in the governments proposal to provide relief to women who have obtained loans from microfinance companies for a higher interest rate.
Minister Samaraweera accepted MP Dissanayakes fact. To address that loophole, we will amend the legislation relating to finance companies and microfinance companies prior to Budget 2019, he said.

Parliamentary motion for Auditor Generals salary increase withdrawn
The Government withdrew a motion included in the Order Paper of Parliament to increase the salary and allowances paid to Auditor General H.M. Gamini Wijesinghe yesterday.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella at the commencement of the days business said that the Government was withdrawing the Determination under the Constitution pending in the Order Paper to raise the salary and allowances of AG Gamini Wijesinghe.
The JVP members expressed their shock over the sudden decision and demanded a clarification from the Government as to why it is withdrawing the proposal.
The proposal in the Order Paper was to place AG Wijesinghe on the 08th Salary Step of SL- 4 Salary Scale of the Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 with effect from November 27, 2015. From January 1, 2016 the salary would be converted in line with the Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake observed that the proposal to increase AG Wijesinghes salary has already been delayed for three years. The Government should inform the House as to why it decided to withdraw the proposal, he noted. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the matter could be discussed at length at a Party Leaders Meeting. This is a matter relating to Government business. It is upto the Government to decide on Government business, Kiriella replied and refused to elaborate on the reasons for the Governments decision.
JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake raised his doubts as to whether the Government was trying to take revenge on AG Wijesinghe for coming forward to reveal serious financial irregularities in the public sector.
The Government should have discussed this decision prior to the withdrawal. What is the point in discussing after that was done Parliament has approved special salaries for all successive AGs in the country upto now. AG Wijesinghe was actively involved in creating a wide social dialogue on the States financial irregularities. We have a fair doubt that the Government with this move is trying to influence and weaken the AG. The incumbent AG has been making revelations on frauds, corruption and waste involving the public institutions, public officials and ministers. This has resulted in headaches for the Government. Is this an attempt to take revenge from him More than any other Government Official, the AG works closely with Parliament. Therefore, matters pertaining to his salary are not Government business alone. Parliament has a responsibility to give him necessary salary increments and allowances, MP Dissanayake stressed.
Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri said the matter would be directed to the attention of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

Pet positive
A recent competition, the Purina Better With Pets Prize, launched by Purina Petcare, set out to identify enterprises across Europe that harness the positive power of the pet-human bond. A prize fund of 76,000 was shared by the winner and highly-commended finalists, with over a hundred entrants being received from across Europe.
Advantages of having a pet
There were three aspects of humans and animals being together that were used as the underlying theme of the competition. These tie in with the broad concept of One Health that is increasingly being seen internationally as the optimal way of viewing humans and animals living in proximity to one another.
Healthier together
Pets are known to enhance human health in a number of ways. The competition sought out community-focused initiatives and innovations that helped people and their pets to live active and healthy lives together.
Connecting together
Pets can provide an effective way of helping people deal with common issues like loneliness and depression, both by providing company for people living on their own, and also by acting as social enablers. The Purina Better With Pets Prize searched for initiatives that used the human-animal bond to promote better emotional well-being, to help foster and cultivate empathy in a community, and to assist with emotional self-care.
Enjoying spaces together
Increased urbanisation and stricter regulations mean that there are now fewer pet-friendly open spaces than in the past. The competition sought out enterprises that encouraged people and pets to spend time together in the same environment, preferably with a social or economic aspect, such as pets being involved in work environments or social contexts.
Prize winners needed to score on extra aspects of their enterprise
As well as these underlying themes, there were six further criteria that were used to judge entries to the award.
Innovation
New ways of thinking are essential for the world to progress, whether these involve rethinking traditional activities or starting entirely new initiatives
Social impact
Pets can have a significant impact on human social lives, and the Purina Better With Pets Prize sought out initiatives that had a quantifiable social impact, and that had already been proven on a small scale, or using a pilot study.
Potential for scaling up and/or replication
The best new ideas have the capacity to be used in different cultural, geographic and social environments, and this aspect of the enterprises was an important part of judging process.
Financial viability
For long term success, innovative ideas need to have a business model that demonstrates that they are able to be financially sustainable into the future
Organisational leadership
The individuals behind successful enterprises must have leadership capacity, with credibility in their fields, the ability to encourage others, and the skill to leverage their success effectively to take their idea on from strength to strength.
Potential for creating shared value
A key criteria of the competition was that the winning prize should go to a win-win-win enterprise, which created value for society at large, for pets, and for people whether they are working, at leisure, or just living their daily lives.
The competition was judged last month in Barcelona  close to Purinas European digital and advocacy hub. Each of five short-listed finalists gave a Ted-talk like presentation as a pitch to the judges. There were two entries from the United Kingdom, two from the Netherlands, and one from Germany.
All finalists share winnings
The competition was such a close call that in the end, the panel of judges decided to split the prize fund, rather than awarding the full amount to a single enterprise. The winner, receiving approximately 30,000 was the OOPOEH Foundation from the Netherlands, which uses online technology to link elderly people, isolated in their own homes, with dogs living in their neighbourhood whose owners were looking for daytime companions for their pets.
Each of the remaining finalists received highly-commended recognition and approximately 11,500, including entries from the UK (Medical Detection Dogs and Canine Hope), alongside German organisation, K9 Hundekunde which wants to improve the standards for assistance dogs to be used in schools as part of educational programmes, and Dutch Cell Dogs from the Netherlands that works with prison inmates to help them train shelter dogs for rehoming.

Priyanka and I were not happy after Prabhakaran was killed: Rahul Gandhi
Congress President Rahul Gandhi said he and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were not happy after his fathers (Rajiv Gandhi) killer, LTTE chief Prabhakaran was killed.
Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said he and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were not happy after his fathers (Rajiv Gandhi) killer, LTTE chief Prabhakaran was killed, as they felt the violence inflicted upon him had impacted others, including his children.
While addressing a gathering at Bucerius Summer School here, Gandhi said he lost two members of his family due to violence. My grandmother (Indira Gandhi) and my father (Rajiv Gandhi) were both killed. So, I have suffered violence. I am talking actually from experience. The only way you can move forward after violence is forgiveness. There is no other way. And to forgive you have to understand what exactly happened and why it happened.
He said: To deal with it is to actually listen and act non-violently. People think this is weakness. But, in fact this is strength. My father was killed by a terrorist in 1991. In 2009, I saw the person who killed my father lying in a field in Sri Lanka.
He went on to say: I called up my sister Priyanka and said that this is very strange, but I am not happy. I should be celebrating that the person who is dead is the person who killed my father. But somehow I am not happy. She said: you are right, I am not happy either.
The reason I wasnt happy was because I saw myself in his children. So, I realised, him lying there actually means that there are kids like me who are crying, he added. He might have been a bad or an evil person, but the violence that was done against him was impacting others, like it had impacted me. If you go deep, you will find there is something that triggered that violence. Its not just a random event. Some action or violence done against him or her has triggered it, he also added.

Comparison between REPPIA and Office for Reparation:
Remedy for the missing
Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority (REPPIA) was established in 1987, in consequent to the 1983 July riots, by an Act of Parliament No. 29 of 1987. The objective of REPPIA is to assist in the rehabilitation of affected persons through compensation. As provided by law, REPPIA provides financial assistance to affected persons, properties and industries.
REPPIA is mandated to provide compensation to persons affected by conflicts such as wars and/or riots. It has taken a broad range of activities to rehabilitate the persons affected by the conflicts and restore their lives. For instance, REPPIA has implemented various loan schemes for housing, self-employment and cultivation. In addition to the assistance given to the individuals, it has undertaken a few rehabilitation programmes for affected communities.
Though the REPPIA has succeeded in reimbursing conflict affected persons, it is not mandated to provide reparations, which are payments of time, effort and/or money to undo past transgression(s). In addition to a limited mandate vis--vis time, the REPPIA is unable to provide reparations because it provides limited forms of remedies; it is vulnerable to political influence; allocated limited funding; has a conventional compensation scheme; and, only recognizes limited types of harms.
Limited mandate vis--vis time
The REPPIA is not authorised to provide compensation to the persons affected by conflicts prior to the enactment of the REPPIA Act (1987). Therefore, victims from the JVP insurgencies of 1976 and 1981 cannot be provided with compensation.
Limited forms of remedies available
Reparations are more than compensation. It includes five elements such as restitution, rehabilitation, compensation, satisfaction and non-recurrence. The REPPIA Act does not empower the REPPIA to facilitate the all five elements of the reparations. For example, the REPPIA is not mandated to facilitate memorialisation. Moreover, the REPPIA cannot provide collective reparations.
Political influence via appointments
REPPIA members are appointed by the Minister. Since the Minister belongs to a certain political party, this may lead to political influence. In fact, authorities at REPPIA indicated that REPPIA has been politically influenced in the past.
Limited funding
It is reported that the REPPIAs current funding allocation is insufficient to deal with the thousands of pending applications.
Conventional compensation scheme
The REPPIA has a fixed compensation scheme and it does not consider the specific or unique needs of victims. For example, it provides Rs. 100,000 to the next kin of the deceased killed during the war irrespective to the individuals circumstances.
Recognizes limited types of harms
The REPPIA provides compensation for the death, injury and property damage. It does not, however, provide compensation to the victims of sexual abuse, displaced persons or to the next-of-kin to disappeared persons.

## Title: Revisit the open economy
## Supertitle:

Revisit the open economy
It was CBK who first coined it during the 1994 general election campaign. Now, nearly two and half decades later, the term has been brought to the fore by UNP Deputy Leader Minister Sajith Premadasa. Speaking as the Chief Guest at the Awards Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing, Premadasa called for the adaption of the open economy in a way that would ensure social justice and remove the inequities that is a byproduct of the system. "It must be understood that full blown capitalism is not the order of the day. A just and free society can only be established through systems, structures and procedures that are based on benevolent capitalism. To use a more apt phrase a just society could be established through capitalism (read open economy) with a human face.
He said; it was a universal notion that the free market capitalism approach is the best mechanism to create wealth. However we need to be cognizant of extremities and social costs of this system. Therefore, the government and the corporate sector benevolence is of utmost importance in order to address the grievances of society, to correct the imperfections and anomalies which are sad by-products of this system.
Sajith has a ready ally on this score in His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, though, unlike the minister, who was not opposed to the open economy per se but only wanted a reformed system, has expressed his unqualified opposition to the open economy based on the social cost wrought by the system. Speaking at the festive High Mass at the Holy Madhu Shrine, the Cardinal said the open economy has destroyed this country's cultural norms and values. His Eminence noted that in the past, children were given the foremost place in our country. However, the open economy has changed all this. Today, both parents have to work to support the family. Mothers go to work leaving children in the care of others. They have no alternative but go to work because the cost of living is so high.
True, there is an urgent need to take a closer look at the open economic system, as it is practiced in this country. There is no denying the fact that the market economy has wrought a massive transformation of this country both in progress and outlook. The country was in the abyss of economic isolation and zero growth as a result of the inward looking policies pursued by socialist governments. A radical change was called for in the economic front if the shortages and queues that marked the tenure of the United Front Government were to be successfully dealt with. Sri Lanka was the first South Asian country which took the plunge. To JRJ goes the credit of transforming the political and socio-economic landscape of this country by throwing its doors open to the outside world.
A nation that was in deep slumber wallowing in its own miseries suddenly awakened to a new dawn. There was activity all around. Skyscrapers were appearing in the capital city in double quick time precipitated by a construction boom. Free Trade Zones were established and foreign investors were swarming in to set up business. Employment opportunities were aplenty with barriers removed for commercial ventures. It appeared that the country was heading for prosperity and set to achieve the goal set by JRJ of making Sri Lanka another Singapore. The civil war put paid to all such dreams.
However, it must be said that the open economy also brought in its wake many-fold ills that went to negate the pluses. Sri Lanka became a dumping ground of sorts for shoddy imported goods. But what is worse, the liberalization opened the doors for narcotics to enter the country freely. It also created a climate that saw an unequal distribution of wealth, with the rich getting richer and the poor made poorer. The crony capitalism we speak of today, the greed, the unbridled consumerism that is widespread today were all spawned by the open economy.
Like His Eminence said, the open economy also changed the value system, bringing with it alien influences that corrupted and debased all cultural norms that were part and parcel of Sri Lankan life. But what was really starkly evident was the inequity engendered by the crass greed and blind worship of mammon. It was said that 80 percent of the country's wealth was concentrated in the hands of 10 percent of the super-rich.
No doubt, it is this injustice that the UNP Deputy Leader had in mind when he spoke about giving a human face to the open economy. This was doubly confirmed when he appealed to the gathering of leading businessmen on the virtue of corporate social responsibility.When this function is concluded and the curtains drawn and when it is time to leave, please think about the poor and destitute in society, on those who have become permanent members of the abject poverty circle.
Echoes of Premadasa senior no doubt, but words that should inspire the rulers to take a closer look at the whole system and its wide ramifications. It was also an appeal to the conscience of all those who thrived under the open economy.

Sports Minister labels it a national disaster
Rs. 70m worth sports goods gone waste
Over Rs. 70 million in public funds has been squandered by Sports Ministry officials prompting the Minster of Sports Faiszer Mustapha to label it a "national disaster".
Without a proper warehouse the Rs. 70 million wastage has been attributed to a huge heap of sports goods that was lying idle, damaged and spoiled.
Minister Mustapha said he requested the ministry auditor to take stock of the count and distribute the equipment to under privileged schools within the next three weeks.
Most of the equipment meant for cricket, badminton, football and gymnastics are not in a state fit for usage.
"I will conduct a proper investigation into this. I want to set up a system and most of the ministry officials will not like this. These are public funds gone waste and some officials will have to answer for this," the Minister said.
Sports goods lying idle, damaged and spoilt.
According to storekeeper HW Rohitha the sports goods mostly for cricket, basketball, were lying in their unloaded containers for more than two years due to lack of space in the sports development building.
He said he brought the matter to the ministry officials but nothing was done.
Most of the items were at the mercy of the elements with rain water taking a heavy toll.
Minister Mustapha was also displeased to learn that the Torrington sports complex had limited toilet facilities.
Apart from the sports gears there are 405 carrom boards that are almost rotting each with a cost of Rs.35,000 made in India.
Minister of Sports inspected the sports gears along with ministry officials.

SLFP for new mixed electoral system - Minister
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday said that the SLFPs stance is to hold Provincial Council elections under the new mixed electoral system introduced for the Local Government bodies.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday, Minister Samarasinghe said that the mixed electoral system introduced for the previous Local Government election should also be applied to the Provincial Council and Parliamentary elections.
The SLFP also already proposed to the Operations Committee on Constitutional Reforms to apply this mix electoral system to the Parliamentary elections.
The Delimitation Committee Report on Provincial Councils is scheduled to be taken up for special debate in Parliament today and would be put before the House for a vote to be passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
Responding to a question by a journalist regarding the next step which can be taken if the Delimitation Committee Report will not be passed in Parliament by a two-thirds majority, Minister Samarasinghe said there is an alternative way to do that.
If the Delimitation Committee Report will not be passed in Parliament by a two-thirds majority, the Speaker should appoint a five member committee headed by the Prime Minister. The Committee should submit a report to the President within two months. If that report recommended that the Delimitation Report can be accepted there was no need to have a two-thirds majority, the Minister explained.
He further said it is not easy to obtain a two-thirds majority since various MPs hold different opinions based on their personal or party requirements.

Teen pips 43-year-old  gymnast to Asian Games gold
JAKARTA, Thursday: South Korea's Yeo Seo-jeong wept as she vaulted her way to victory at the Asian Games on Thursday in a tense final that saw her snatch gold from 43-year-old Oksana Chusovitina in the dying moments.
The 16-year-old's win was the second of the day for Korea, stopping gymnastics giants China in their tracks after they claimed all four golds on the first three days of the competition.
It came after Kim Han-sol secured gold in the men's floor -- the opening apparatus final -- with a swaggering routine, much to the delight of the vocal pack of South Korean fans madly waving flags and whooping.
Compatriot Yeo said she was happy with her performance in the women's vault but was focused on Tokyo 2020, where she is intent on winning a gold to dedicate to her father Yeo Hong-chul.
The older Yeo won a silver medal on vault at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, but never secured an Olympic gold.
"I want to go there and win gold for him," she said after securing the top spot with 14.387.
Runner-up Chusovitina, from Uzbekistan and the oldest female gymnast in the competition by far, said that "silver was like getting gold".
She stepped on to the podium with a score of 14.287, pushing North Korea's Pyon Rye Yong into the bronze medal position with 13.875.
The men's floor final was also full of drama as Taiwan's Tang Chia-Hung, who had led from the outset, was pipped by the second-last gymnast to perform, 22-year-old Kim.
The Korean's 14.675 pushed Tang into silver medal position with 14.425.
NORTH KOREAN MAKES EPIC LIFT TO WIN GOLD
Choe Jon Wi epic lift
Choe Jon Wi pulled out the greatest lift of his life to edge a titanic battle of the Koreas and secure the fourth weightlifting gold for the North in an epic 77kg men's final Thursday.
Later Taiwan's world champion Kuo Hsing-chun dismantled the Thai Olympic champion Srisurat Sukanya to win her country's first gold in the women's 58kg.
South Korea's Kim Woo-jae had looked as if he had turned the tables on Choe, his rival from across the heavily armed Korean border, when he succeeded with 187kg to give him a massive 347kg total.
Choe was floundering on 340kg, but the 25-year-old student smashed his lifetime best, set in coming eighth at the 2016 Rio Olympics, by 3kg as he somehow hauled 193kg above his head for victory.
In the women's 58kg, Taiwanese national icon Kuo only needed her opening lift of 125kg in the clean and jerk to blow away Srisurat and clinch gold.
She returned but failed by a whisker with a 143kg attempt that would have extended her own clean and jerk world record.
Earlier Thailand's Chinnawong Chatuphum became the only Thai man to win two Asian Games medals after repeating his bronze performance of 2014.
Woo's silver was South Korea's first medal in weightlifting of the 2018 Asiad and their 75th in the history of the Asian Games. Only China (76) and Iran (79) have won more.
It was also only the second North-South one-two in Asian Games weightlifting history after Yang Eui Yong beat Lee Myung-Soo in the men's 56kg event in 1978.

CHINA REACHES GOLDEN HALF-CENTURY MEDALS MARK
China scooped its 50th gold medal Thursday as it asserted its Asian Games dominance with multiple victories in wushu and rowing, where a Unified Korea team finished last.
All six wushu finals in a packed morning session in Jakarta included martial artists from China. Four claimed gold in the sport made famous by Jet Li and Jackie Chan, derived from an ancient Chinese warrior code.
On the rowing lake in co-host city Palembang, China were victorious in six of the eight morning medal races.
But the Olympic heavyweights were pipped by Uzbekistan in the men's double sculls, while Vietnam took its first Games gold in the lightweight women's quadruple sculls.
A joint rowing team consisting of athletes from North and South Korea came in last in the lightweight men's four, finishing more than half-a-minute off the pace.
VIETNAMESE WOMEN ROW TO FIRST ASIAN GAMES GOLD
An overjoyed Vietnamese women's rowing team paddled into first place Thursday to take their country's only gold of the Asian Games so far, as China racked up six wins on the Palembang lake.
Vietnam's lightweight women's quadruple sculls claimed gold in the final race of the penultimate day of rowing events, held in the co-host city of Asia's regional Olympics.
Iran took the silver in the same event -- its best-ever result in women's rowing -- but one of the team, Nazanin Rahmani, could barely stand to receive her medal after coming down sick after the race and was carted off on a stretcher shortly after the ceremony. China rowed to victory in six out of eight medal races on Thursday.
The Asian Games giant won the men's and women's single sculls and pair races, the women's double sculls and the lightweight men's four. Uzbekistan came away with three medals, including a gold in the men's double sculls.  AFP

Virat Kohli dedicates win to Kerala flood victims
NOTTINGHAM, Wednesday: India captain Virat Kohli dedicated his teams win over England at Trent Bridge to the flood victims of Kerala. Nearly 400 people have died, with more than a million people displaced, following the worst flooding in the state for a century.
First and foremost we as a team want to dedicate this victory to the flood victims in Kerala, Kohli said, after Indias 203-run victory. People are going through a lot. This is our bit we can do.
India needed only 17 balls on the final day to take the one remaining England wicket.
It halved Englands lead in the series to 2-1 with two matches remaining, the next of which takes place at Southampton on 30 August. The victory was much needed at this stage of the series and to have a performance like that, which was so clinical in all three departments, is something that was pleasing to me as a captain, said Kohli, who won the man-of-the-match award for his 97 and 103.
The players are really proud of what theyve done in this Test too. Everyone is taking responsibility at the right time. By scoring his 23rd Test century in the second innings at Nottingham, Kohli moved level with Steve Smith, Virender Sehwag, Kevin Pietersen, Justin
Langer and Javed Miandad. He has scored 440 runs in the series, 234 more than the next highest
run-scorer, Englands Jonny Bairstow.
Meanwhile, India coach Ravi Shastri believes the current pace bowling attack is the best the team has ever had. The quartet of Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma and Hardik
Pandya claimed the first 19 England wickets to fall in the third Test and have 35 between them in the series. All four played in Januarys victory against South Africa in Johannesburg, when India won a match for the first time by taking all 20 wickets with seam bowling. Its by a mile the best pace attack India has ever had, Shastri said. By a mile. No team comes even close. Easily the best.
In the four years Ive been doing this job, I think if you look at a clinical performance overseas, I think this has to be the best.
South Africa was gutsy, because that was a nasty track in Joberg. But this was clinical. When you look at all three departments, they stood up. As a batting unit, as a catching unit and as a bowling unit, so you cant ask for more.  BBC

Whither Sri Lanka cricket
Sri Lanka won two Test matches convincingly against Proteas and lost the ODI series. However, they managed to win the last two ODIs and one T20 match. Now, some of our Cricket Board Members are happy and satisfied because we won the Test Series and last three limited over matches. Nonetheless, we need to analyze what happened from a critical point of view.
It was evident that the two Test matches were played on spin friendly wickets and consequently, our spin bowlers bamboozled the South African batsmen and bundled them out for low scores. Can we consider winning these two Test matches an achievement When we prepare slow spin pitches and win matches, where are we heading Can we expect anything from our cricketers when they play on alien soil
Any country that prepares pitches to suit their players so that they can carry all before them, is simply deceiving its players and preparing them to eat humble pie when they go abroad. Sri Lanka has yet to win a Test match in either India or Austrlaia Even in limited over matches we have not performed well in other countries. In 1996 Sri Lanka won the World Cup in the Subcontinent. Then we travelled to England to play in the 1999 World Cup. At that time we had the most experienced team in the tournament. At least seven players from the 1996 winning side were in the team. But as all cricket fans know, Sri Lanka did not even progress to the second round of the tournament! Why Our cricketers had not mastered the technique of playing on different pitches and dealing with unfamiliar conditions that they encountered. If that team could not perform well in England, can we expect anything from the present team
So what should our Cricket Board do They should prepare fast, bouncy and swinging pitches and give our players the opportunity of practising on them. Some might say that if you prepare pitches according to those conditions our players could be injured.
If this is the case, then the same thing could happen when our team goes abroad. Without making any excuses we have to face this reality. If people are not prepared to accept the truth then our players have to face the music when they play abroad.
Some might argue, is it wrong to take home advantage of a situation and win matches It is OK. However, we must at least play one match according to the opponents conditions. Then we can gauge how our players perform/show their class in such circumstances. This will help coaches to train the players perform/show their class in such circumstances. This will help coaches to train the players to face any situation bravely. If not, then Sri Lanka cricket will not have any hope for the future. At present we see how India is performing in England  not very well! India is one of the best teams in the world and if it is struggling then what can we expect for our National Team when it goes to play in next years World Cup
It is high time that our Cricket Board opens its eyes and helps our cricketers to perform well in any part of the world. Our players are talented and they are second to none. Unfortunately, they are not exposed to facing different conditions and situations.
It is the responsibility of the Board to address this issue. If our players are helped they will do well in any part of the world. If the men in authority are not worried about this fact then Sri Lanka Cricket will have a very bleak future. It will be similar to fixing the last nail in the coffin!
Some of my fans may think that Im a critic. Not at all! I love Sri Lanka and I want our team to do well and bring back the World cricket Plum to our country in 2019.
