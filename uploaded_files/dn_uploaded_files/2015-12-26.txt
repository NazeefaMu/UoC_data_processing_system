Iraq 'nets 40 IS operatives' in major swoop
BAGHDAD: Iraq's intelligence service said Thursday it detained 40 members of the Islamic State group as part of a major operation in Baghdad and Diyala provinces.
"The Iraqi national intelligence service, in coordination with Baghdad and Diyala security forces, carried out an operation which resulted in the arrest of 40 members of varying rank," a statement said.
Diyala is a province just northeast of the capital where IS has not had fixed positions in almost a year but has carried out several deadly suicide car bombings. "Many bombs, suicide belts and cars used by the terrorists were seized, as well as large amounts of money they used to fund their criminal activities," the statement said.
The intelligence service said the detained IS members had requested assistance from cells in other parts of the country, suggesting the group is weakened in Baghdad.
The swoop was the continuation of an operation that had already resulted in more than 30 arrests and the dismantling of a car bomb-making cell in Baghdad in March.

Israeli-Palestinian clashes, three attacks rock West Bank
JERUSALEM: New violence erupted in the West Bank Thursday with four Palestinian attackers shot dead by Israeli forces, as Israel recoiled over a video showing Jewish extremists celebrating a Palestinian toddler's death.
The upsurge in violence came after nearly three months of attacks and protests but with the violence having become less frequent in recent weeks.
The ongoing unrest has led to a sharp decrease in pilgrims travelling to the West Bank city of Bethlehem, where the Bible says Jesus was born, for Christmas Eve celebrations and the traditional midnight mass at the Church of the Nativity.
Early on Thursday, a Palestinian stabbed two security guards at an entrance to an industrial zone at the Jewish settlement of Ariel, the largest in the north of the occupied West Bank, before being shot dead.
Both of the victims suffered moderate wounds, police said.
The assailant was identified as Mohammed Zahran, 23, from the nearby village of Kafr Addik.
Later, a Palestinian tried to attack soldiers with a screwdriver at a checkpoint near the West Bank city of Hebron and was shot dead. The Palestinian health ministry identified him as Iyad Idaissat, 25, from the village of Yatta.
A third incident saw a Palestinian shot dead attempting to ram his car into a military post near the Adam junction northeast of Jerusalem, the army said. Bilal Zayd, 23, was from the Qalandiya refugee camp between Jerusalem and Ramallah, where clashes broke out Thursday between Israeli security forces and Palestinians.
Israeli forces were said to have entered the camp to arrest three suspects, local officials said. Seven people were wounded, including two from gunshots to the head, according to camp official Jamal Lafi said.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli army said the forces were "assaulted by a violent mob" of Palestinians shooting at them and throwing rocks, Molotov cocktails and explosive devices.
"The force responded to the immediate danger and fired toward the gunmen. Hits were confirmed," she said.
A wave of violence since the start of October has claimed the lives of 129 on the Palestinian side, 19 Israelis, an American and an Eritrean.
Many of the Palestinians killed have been attackers while others have been shot dead by Israeli security forces during clashes.
A number of them have attempted attacks with kitchen knives in what some analysts have described as virtual suicide missions.
Palestinians have grown frustrated with Israel's occupation, the complete lack of progress in peace efforts and their own fractured leadership.
Meanwhile, Israeli officials vehemently condemned a video showing gun-wielding Jewish extremists at a wedding celebrating the death of a Palestinian toddler in a firebombing, with authorities saying they opened an investigation.
The video, broadcast by an Israeli news programme, has spread online and drawn strong condemnation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the images "shocking" and called participants "a danger to Israeli society."
Representatives of all of Israel's political spectrum, including the far-right Jewish Home, spoke out harshly against the group of so-called hilltop youths depicted in it.
The video shows guests at the wedding of a radical right-wing couple dancing with guns, knives and at least one unlit Molotov cocktail, while also stabbing a picture of the toddler killed in a firebombing blamed on Jewish extremists.
That attack killed 18-month-old Ali Saad Dawabsha, and fatally injured his parents. The toddler's four-year-old brother was the sole survivor from the immediate family.

Pope urges return to simple values at Christmas
VATICAN: Pope Francis ushered in Christmas by urging the faithful to reject the materialism that pervades the gift-giving season, and to embrace "simple, balanced" values, as violence subdued festivities in the Holy Land.
The pontiff, at his annual Christmas Eve Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica, called on Christians everywhere to push back against the excesses of modern society, which he said was "so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism".
Christianity calls on believers "to act soberly -- in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential," said the 79-year old pope, leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.
In many countries across the world, Christians were fearful for their future, and some were even prohibited from celebrating the holy day, a state of affairs that did not go ignored by Francis.
"In a world which all too often is merciless to the sinner and lenient to the sin, we need to cultivate a strong sense of justice, to discern and to do God's will," the Argentine pontiff said.
Condemning a "culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless", the pope asked Catholics to combine prayer with an attitude of "empathy, compassion and mercy" after a year of global unrest that saw one million migrants and refugees, mostly from Syria, reach Europe in search of a better life.
Amid an unusually heavy security presence in Saint Peter's Square, the visibly pale pontiff, who is reportedly suffering from the flu, in a hoarse voice called on believers at risk of persecution to resist fear.
Half a world away in Bethlehem, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in the Holy Land arrived for the traditional midnight mass at the Church of the Nativity -- built over the site where Christians believe Jesus was born.
Travelling from Jerusalem nearby, the Jordanian Latin patriarch Fouad Twal would have had to pass through the Israeli wall that separates the two cities, with Bethlehem located in the occupied West Bank.
A wave of violence has led to a sharp decline in pilgrims visiting Bethlehem and the rest of the Holy Land this year, and only a sparse crowd was on hand to welcome Twal's procession. Violent protests and a series of Palestinian attacks on Israelis since October have killed 129 Palestinians, 19 Israelis, an American and an Eritrean. Many of the Palestinians were attackers, while others were killed in clashes.
The Bethlehem mass commemorating the birth of Jesus will be dedicated to victims of violence and their families, Twal said, with celebrations "moderate" due to violence in the Palestinian territories, Israel and the world.
Twal has also called for parishes to switch off Christmas tree lights for five minutes in solidarity with victims of violence and terrorism. Lights on trees in Manger Square were shut off for a few minutes at 7:00 pm.
The plight of embattled Christians in the Middle East, especially where they have been threatened by the advance of Islamic State group, has been thrown into the spotlight this year, and in Iraq, the mood was also sombre.
"We are praying for the restoration of peace and security and the return of the displaced to their land," said one worshipper, Farida, as she arrived at Our Lady of Salvation church in Baghdad, one member of a dwindling Christian community trickling in to churches.
She said 12 of her relatives lost their homes when IS took over Iraq's second city Mosul in 2014 and ordered Christians to convert to Islam, pay a heavy tax as second-class citizens or face death.
In Somalia, the government has banned celebrations of Christmas and New Year in the Muslim majority country, saying the festivities might attract Islamist attacks.
The same is true in oil-rich Brunei, where the country's authorities have threatened five-year jail sentences for those who violate a ban imposed on "open and excessive" celebrations.
And in the troubled nearby southern Philippines, seven Christian farmers were killed as Muslim guerrillas launched a series of attacks. Meanwhile, the US and British embassies in China issued an unusual warning about possible threats against Westerners in a popular Beijing neighbourhood ahead of the Christmas holiday.
And security was due to be stepped up at churches in France for mass, following last month's jihadist attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead.

Putin, Modi hail 'partnership' as India eyes defence deals
MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Thursday the "partnership" between their two nations as they oversaw the signing of energy and other deals.
However no progress was announced on an anticipated purchase of S-400 missiles, Russia's top-of-the-line anti-aircraft defence systems.
"I see in Russia a prominent partner in India's economic transformation," Modi said after the two leaders agreed to ease the visa requirements between the two nations that are part of the BRICS group of leading emerging market countries.
They also oversaw the signing of several agreements involving Russia's state nuclear corporation Rosatom and railway monopoly Russian Railways, among others.
India wants Moscow to take part in infrastructure projects as the Modi government seeks to overhaul the country's railway network and build nuclear energy plants to meet the growing electricity needs for its fast-growing economy.
The two countries agreed on the location of a new Russian nuclear energy plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, with Moscow already building a nuclear plant in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Modi is seeking to ramp up the country's nuclear energy use to meet the rising energy needs, with a programme for at least 12 new reactors, as well as reduce its heavy dependency on coal, the worst greenhouse gas producing fuel.
Modi said that Moscow and Delhi would also jointly produce Kamov-226 military helicopters as part of the Make in India initiative to have foreign companies manufacture their products in India.
Putin for his part called Russia's ties with India a "privileged strategic partnership", praising the two nations' energy and defence cooperation.
"There are plans to send large-scale supplies of oil and oil products to Indian refineries in the amount of 10 million tonnes annually over the next 10 years," Putin said after the talks.
However the two leaders were silent about the S-400, although India's top acquisition body was reported to have cleared the purchase of the air defence system ahead of Modi's trip.
On Thursday, Indian firm Reliance Defence said it would work with the Russian manufacturer of the S-400 "on the entire range of air defence missile and radar systems" that India needs.
But it was not immediately clear whether the two companies were close to a final deal on the missiles and the two leaders did not take any questions from reporters in Moscow.
Dipankar Banerjee, a defence analyst at Delhi-based think tank Forum for Strategic Initiatives, said India was "vulnerable to Pakistan and China both in terms of missile attacks and air strikes" and that the S-400 systems were "very desirable" despite a hefty price tag.
Russian business daily Kommersant said this week that Putin's one-on-one talks with Modi would decide the fate of the deal as the two still needed to sort out pricing disagreements.
India could be in the market for as many as five systems, the paper said, quoting defence sources, with deals on Russian frigates also on the cards.
The Moscow trip is Modi's first state visit to Russia since he became prime minister in 2014, but he and Putin have met several times at international events and even discussed the merits of yoga at a summit in the Russian city of Ufa last July.

US air strikes hit targets in embattled Afghan district
Afghanistan: "U.S. forces conducted two strikes in Sangin district, Helmand Province, December 23, against threats to the force," U.S. Army Colonel Michael Lawhorn said.
U.S. aircraft carried out two attacks in Sangin, the district in southern Afghanistan overrun by Taliban insurgents this week, officials said on Thursday.
The fierce fighting in Helmand, a traditional Taliban stronghold and one of the world's main centres of opium production, has piled pressure on President Ashraf Ghani, already on the defensive as security worsens across the country.
The Taliban, who already control almost all of Sangin district, said on Wednesday that they had captured police and administrative buildings in the district centre, where small groups of police had been holding out.
However government officials have denied the claim and said they have pushed back Taliban insurgents seeking to re-establish their hard-line Islamist regime after being toppled by U.S.-led military intervention in 2001.
General Abdul Wodud, a senior army commander, said a joint Afghan and NATO operation backed by air support had driven the Taliban back from central areas, killing 60 Taliban fighters and wounding 40.
The Interior Ministry also said that security forces had killed a senior Taliban commander it identified as Mullah Nasir.
NATO headquarters in Kabul confirmed that the air strikes had taken place but gave no details.
"U.S. forces conducted two strikes in Sangin district, Helmand Province, December 23, against threats to the force," U.S. Army Colonel Michael Lawhorn said.
The Taliban already held three Helmand districts as well as large parts of the rest of the province outside the main centres and control strategic roads, making it hard to reinforce and resupply security force units cut off by their advance.
But the loss of Sangin, which British and U.S. forces fought for years to control, would also be a heavy blow for Western powers backing the Kabul government, now fighting alone since international forces ended combat operations last year.
Despite billions of dollars in aid and thousands of deaths among international forces, the capacity of Afghan security forces to stand alone has been called into question by the Helmand fighting as well as by earlier episodes such as the fall of Kunduz, which the Taliban captured briefly in September.
Widespread reports of mass desertions, leadership confusion and bitter complaints from the frontline about units being left for months without reinforcements or adequate supplies have underlined the problems facing Afghan commanders.
NATO military advisers have been sent to Helmand, with an extra British contingent arriving this week, but officials say they have a purely advisory role and they have not confirmed reports that special forces units are present.
The Taliban issued a statement saying that foreign forces were directly involved in the fighting in Sangin and accusing them of carrying out airstrikes on residential areas.
