Abolishing of executive presidency, a UNP election pledge
The United National Party (UNP) is of the view that the executive presidency should be abolished, said Social Empowerment Minister P Harrison.
He said that this was also an election pledge given during the last Presidential Election. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) had moved a motion suggesting the abolishing of the executive presidency. The UNP was also of the view that the executive presidency should be changed. Minister Harrison said that Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena of the Group of 16 has said that the motion for the 20th Amendment to the Constitution moved by the JVP to abolish the executive presidency should be withdrawn.
But the Group of 16 is not a part of any group in the House of Parliament, he said. If what they said is correct, Mahinda Rajapaksa would have won the last Presidential Election. But that did not happen.
The Minister said that he had not accepted a penny from Aloysius. He added that during the 100 day programme, there were only 47 UNPers in the government.
It was questionable as to who the others of the 166 were, who took money from Aloysius as mentioned by Dayasiri Jayasekara.
Arjun Aloysius was associating with Mahinda Rajapaksa and his children while they were in power. Even the night before the day of the election, Aloysius was with them, Minister Harrison said.

cultural  analysis required for SL - China trade deals
Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, aspiring to expand their footprint in the Chinese market need to properly analyse cultural dimensions of China when it comes to striking much -needed trade deals with Chinese counterparts.
This sentiment was expressed by Lasanatha Wickremasooriya, Past President, Trade and Investment Subcommittee, Sri Lanka China Business council at a seminar, held under the theme, Enhancing Exports to China and Attracting Investment.
The seminar was organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in Colombo.
Speaking on how to do business with China, the cultural dimensions Wickremasooriya, pointed out that Sri Lanka has good experience as well as is familiar with negotiating trade deals with the western part of the world rather than striking deals with the Asian region.
Sri Lanka was colonized by the western world in different times; whether we like it or not, we still carry those legacies.We still have a mindset of working with the western part of the world; if any Sri Lankan company wishes to do business with China, they have to learn the hard way and be patient.
Asian part of the world doesnt work exactly the same way like the Western part . Thats where most negotiations with Chinese counterparts fail.
Yasantha Abeykoon, President, Sri Lanka- China Business Council speaking at the event noted that Sri Lanka has managed to create a viable environment for foreign investments in Sri Lanka and intends on attracting USD 2.7 billion FDI by end this year compared to USD 1.9 billion, achieved during last year.
In addition, Sri Lankas exports have increased by 15% to USD 15.4 billion in 2017. Noting that Sri Lanka is committed to exploring business opportunities in the Chinese market, Abeykoon said adding that, it is essential to ascertain strategies to enter the Chinese market and to maintain a higher export growth to ensure steady economic progress and development.

It was so exciting being in a hall full of black women
The rise of black feminist politics was of particular importance in a decade that saw inspiring council leaders ensure a voice for radical feminism and real change in the mainstream.
In the 1980s there was a belief in sisterhood, and we saw real change. Feminist politics took place in the context of what was happening more generally on the left. We had the 1984-85 miners strike, and the Women Against Pit Closures movement which was really important for women in what are now post-industrial areas. They were the wives and daughters of the miners and organised, raised money and built support for the strike. It was important for focusing people on what women were doing.
I vividly remember going to one of the first black feminist conferences. It was so exciting to be in a hall full of black women who shared my beliefs. Black feminist politics was one of the highlights of the decade for me. I did a lot of work on Scrap Sus  a campaign against stop and search and abuses of policing. The mums got involved because of the experiences of their children and their friends children.
Really important female council leaders were emerging. In 1982, Margaret Hodge became leader of Islington council  a forceful and radical leader. In 1985, Linda Bellos, a black radical feminist, became leader of Lambeth council, and Ken Livingstone was leader of the GLC (the now defunct Greater London Council). He promoted a radical approach to the politics of gender with grants, jobs for women, political support, campaigns  it was a hub of activity and affected women outside London also. Lady Amos  who went on to be leader of the House of Lords, UN undersecretary-general and is now director of Soas University of London  once worked at the GLC, and was a womens officer in Hackney. A lot of todays prominent women got their start in that framework.
When I left Cambridge University at the end of the 70s, the careers advice officer  a woman  advised me: Whatever you do, dont learn to type, and if you do, dont let anybody know.
Female university graduates had to be on their guard to not be shunted into secretarial roles. By the end of the 80s, we had moved beyond that. Women were entering professions in much larger numbers. I worked in television news where, at the beginning of the 80s, there were few women and there was an assumption that we had to be overtly flirtatious and sexual to have any hope of getting on. By the end of the decade, we were leaving those assumptions behind.
The feminist narrative was very gradually beginning to affect how people thought. And the paradox is that the issues the left were attacked for at the beginning of the 80s, such as supporting womens and LGBT rights, were seen as mainstream by the close of the decade.
Diane Abbott is the shadow home secretary. She first became an MP in 1987.

Madhawa Ganegoda
He was versatile
June 7 was the sixth death anniversary of our dearest ran putha, Madhawa Ganegoda. When you departed, you left within our hearts, a haunting poignancy. Our eyes and ears are still on you, though we could no longer speak with you; you have wandered into an unknown realm where we could never meet.
We are proud to remember the milestones you achieved during your short time here. Those achievements added value to your parents, colleagues and also to your alma mater; Mahinda College.
At school, you gave the Media Unit your all, becoming the best announcer of the Southern Province at the Thurunu Shakthi Programme. Your favourite subject was Mass Media and Communication. You were the Deputy Head Prefect in 2001 and won the Best Announcer's Award at the All-Island Inter-School Competition held at Ananda College, Colombo. You later obtained a Political Science Degree.
Your first step into the television industry was the professional education you received at the Maharagama Youth Services Council, where you were awarded Best Student of The Year. Even though you began your professional career with the Sirasa television network, the then budding Derana television channel became your home.
With all the commitments and love you had towards your job, you became the first presenter of the Wada Pitiya programme conducted by Derana. You always demonstrated your talents and knowledge during all such programmes.
You yourself selected your career path without any guidance and that was the strength which elevated you to the position of the Derana Dream Star Senior Executive Producer. At the Mahinde thamai Iskole Awards Ceremony in 2012, you received your highest achievement; as one of the top 10 students of Mahinda College from the time of its inception.
Although you heard that you had been nominated for the award, you never received the opportunity to see it yourself, since by that time, your golden heart had lost its beat. According to your superiors, friends and colleagues, you were a simple and humble youth. You were loved by all your friends as you led an unquestionable life.
Madhawa, you faced the harsh reality of life when you fell prey to cancer. As a young man, you never faltered; even at the age of 27, when faced with the fact that your days were numbered. Derana, your mahagedara, knowing the seriousness of the disease, made every effort to change your fate by sending you to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, on several occasions. They identified the creativity you possessed, the ability you had to face challenges and as a result, they went beyond the capacity of an employer in your case.
Finally, you had to accept nature, leaving behind all your loved ones in this world. What you expressed during your final stages was; "Although at present, there is no technology to change this decision taken by nature, in future, man will overcome nature."
You had also left us a note that fateful day, saying: "Cancer can destroy my life, but it cannot defeat me." You helped us understand the minute bond between life and death as an undisputed youth. You proved that English Poet John Donne was correct in his words: Death be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for, thou are not so.
Dearest Madhawa, our ran putha; may you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!
Malini Ganegoda

A true friend
Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory no one can steal - Richard Puz
Darshi passed away last week, without giving us a chance to bid her farewell. We do not still know how to face the reality of Darshi no longer being among us.
She was a true friend to us staff members at Vihara Maha Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Kiribathgoda and to all her other friends. She was a caring, sincere person who would always extend her generous hand to anyone in distress and was also a dedicated teacher.
To her students, she was a close friend and a confidant. She had a way of performing all duties entrusted to her with utmost dedication and care, always with a smile. Darshi was a pillar of strength to everybody during their hours of need. She never hesitated to arise when one of her loved ones needed her.
She lived life to the fullest; with a dynamic and vibrant personality, she was the heart and soul of many a trip organised by the staff.
She enjoyed life and helped others value it as well. She loved what she did and was always happy with what life gifted her with. Simple pleasures made her happy and we never heard her complain about anything.Darshi was a beloved wife, a loving mother and a caring daughter and sister. A product of the Peradeniya University, she was a talented teacher who excelled at Chemistry.
She leaves her dear husband, Pramith and daughter, Sohani. All her friends lost a beautiful person who was dearest to them. Our heartfelt condolences go to her family and her brother, his wife and all the others who stood by her during this difficult time.
Dear Darshi, it is not easy for us; you will always remain in our hearts.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Australias Renshaw in the runs again for Somerset
LONDON, Saturday - Australia opener Matt Renshaw continued his excellent form for English side Somerset with a third County Championship hundred in eight innings on Saturday.
The left-handers 106 was the centrepiece of Somersets 307 for seven on the opening day of their match at home to First Division leaders Nottinghamshire.
Renshaw faced 171 balls, including 12 fours and two sixes. His innings ended when he was bowled by Matthew Carter trying to hit the off-spinner back over his head. Renshaws time with Somerset will be cut short, with the 22-year-old set to leave Taunton in August, before the end of the English season, following an Australia A tour call-up.
The Queensland cricketer, who was born in the Yorkshire town of Middlesbrough, only joined Somerset as an overseas player after the county effectively ripped up the contract of fellow Australian batsman Cameron Bancroft as a result of his role in the ball-tampering scandal during the third Test against South Africa in March. Bancroft, who applied sandpaper to the ball in Cape Town in a clear breach of crickets rulebook, was given a nine-month ban from Australian domestic and international matches by Cricket Australia, but his suspension did not apply to county cricket.
Instead Renshaw, who will hope he can put his county experience to good use during an Ashes tour of England next year, has now become the latest Australian import to star for Somerset, joining an illustrious list that includes Colin McCool, Bill Alley, Greg Chappell, Steve Waugh and, more recently, Justin Langer, the Australia coach.
English cricket scores on Saturday:
COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP (first day of four):
FIRST DIVISION
* At Southampton: Surrey 216-3 (R Burns 109 no, B Foakes 68 no) v Hampshire
* At Old Trafford: Lancashire 297-9 (J Clark 79, S Chanderpaul 58) v Essex
* At Taunton: Somerset 307-7 (M Renshaw 106, S Davies 59 no, T Abell 57; M Carter 4-81) v Nottinghamshire

MPs, ministers, reveal your secrets!
It should be astonishing for everyone to hear former Minister Dayasiri Jayasekaras recent statement that he accepted Rs. one million cheque from Walt & Row, an associated company of Perpetual Treasuries for his election work held in 2015.
It is further sarcastic that he says he did nothing wrong in doing so because a quite a number of politicians in this country is in the practice of accepting such amounts as pleasurable gifts from the elite class such as traders, multimillionaires and other interested groups for their electioneering work, anticipating a reciprocation after they gain power.
Former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara is right and genuine as he admits what he has accepted. I feel happy about Dayasiris stance of accepting the truth and justifying it. There is further speculation that there are other MPs and Ministers who have been given this cash gift by the Perpetual Treasuries or its affiliated group of companies for electioneering work. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka too has admitted that he was given a cheque for one hundred thousand rupees and he had given it to another MP for his election work.
Thus, I request all MPs and Ministers to reveal what they have accepted from M/s Perpetual Treasuries during the election campaign in 2015 by setting a real example as former Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. If it is done it is easy for the public to know and clear the puzzle now before them who the political culprits are.
It is my view that in our country there are no clean politicians now who have not engaged in corruption. Somehow they are involved in whatsoever rackets which is inevitable for them as swindling is absorbed in their blood.
Finding an honest politician to vote will be a herculean task for the people in future.

Combank launches mobile remittance channel between South Korea, Sri Lanka
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has become the first Sri Lankan institution to launch a Mobile to Account Remittance Service between South Korea and Sri Lanka, facilitating real time fund transfers from an estimated 30,000 Sri Lankans employed in the East Asian nation.
The service, launched in collaboration with Global Money Express Co Ltd. (GME), one of the first exchange companies in the Republic to obtain a money transfer licence, paves the way for real time fund transfers between the two countries at lower charges and higher exchange rates, the Bank said.
The formal launch of the new service took place in Seoul recently with the participation of a Commercial Bank team led by the Banks Chief Operating Officer Mr S. Renganathan.
Considered a high potential market for remittances, South Korea had restricted money transfer licences to Commercial Banks and began issuing such licences to non-banking financial institutions only in August 2017.
Prior to the launch of the GME-Commercial Bank Mobile to Account Remittance Service, Commercial Banks own sophisticated real-time on-line money transfer service e-Exchange generated substantial foreign exchange earnings annually in remittances from expatriate Sri Lankans working in South Korea.
Commenting on the ground-breaking collaboration with GME, Commercial Banks Chief Operating Officer Mr S. Renganathan said: The integration of the systems of GME and Commercial Bank is a milestone development in the remittance business between South Korea and Sri Lanka, which has maintained a fruitful employment agreement for several years. This new remittance service will provide much convenience to Sri Lankans working in Korea.
South Korea is an active market for Sri Lankan migrant workers who on average earn US$ 2,500/- per month, which is well above the average earning levels in the Middle East and is also above the average of many other countries of the Far East.
According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), between 3000 and 6000 new visas are expected to be offered to Sri Lanka by South Korea every year.
Commercial Bank is one of the most active players in Sri Lanka in the field of remittances, offering customers a range of options including e-Exchange MoneyGram, Ria and Express Money remittance services.
Commercial Banks overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets, Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon, the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake and Italy, where the Bank operates its own money transfer service.

Conqueror of Earths ultimate peak
Johann Peries became a Conqueror on the morning of May 22, 2018. But he is no conqueror of the sword. He is the conqueror of Mount Everest - a merciless, unforgiving yet beautiful creation of nature, 8,848m in height.
In doing so he has become a conqueror of peoples hearts. Everest is no respecter of person. It can crush the will of anyone who attempts to climb it. It has claimed the lives of many who have aspired to conquer it. Climbing this force of nature requires courage, strength and will power.
Everest can break your spirit, make you despair and it will not allow itself to be conquered easily. This is the glory of all those who have climbed Everest. Yet there is an indescribable beauty to it, which Johann calls the Calling of the Mountain. In climbing Mount Everest he has brought glory to his motherland.
Johann has now returned to Sri Lanka safe and sound and was at Hilton last week to talk about his experience.
This was Johanns second attempt at scaling Mount Everest. The first time was heartbreaking. His partner Jayanthi Kuru Utumpala managed to scale Mount Everest, but Johann was forced to turn back at 8,400 meters, a mere 448 meters short of reaching the summit due to technical difficulties with his equipment, with his oxygen tank failing.
Jayanthi Kuru Utumpala went on to complete the climb, becoming the first Sri Lankan to scale Mount Everest bringing glory to her motherland.
Johann Peries recalled the difficulties that were associated with his remarkable feat.
I must say it is nice to be back, as much as it was nice going up. I would really like to thank everyone who has been a part of this journey since 2016. One of the biggest tasks we had to undertake was making people aware of what we were trying to do. At the beginning there was a lot of doubt and ambiguity. But we did not give up because it was our dream, said Peries.
Peries recalled those days when he and Jayanthi Kuru Utumpala did their research. They were a team and Jayanthi was a great source of strength. It started out with only the two of them and then it just grew. Friends gathered around them to support them.
Initially it was very challenging for us to find sponsors. Getting them to believe in us and our dream and getting them to understand what we were trying to do was indeed a very difficult task. Finally we were able to find people who did believe in us. There were also those who still believed in my second attempt. I remember how devastating it was for me coming so close to my goal during the first climb, explained Peries.
However Peries possessed a fire within himself that burnt bright. Going again was irresistible. You cant understand this passion unless you have it yourself. Why does one go back if it is so dangerous
I had almost forgotten how difficult it was when I attempted a second climb. The excitement of the whole thing was so much. There were some paths I really could not remember! I thought to myself did we ever climb this How did we do it It is so difficult! But this time by Gods grace I managed to do it. It was an amazing journey and I want to thank the media first who have supported us from the very beginning. Again I want to thank the sponsors, for believing in me and doing this for the second time. And I want to thank the public, because it was a public climb, pointed out Peries.
The public gave him the strength and courage joining in. For the second time Peries did not have Jayanthi Kuru Utumpala and was a huge loss to him throughout. There were times when he looked for her and suddenly realized that she was not there! But though she was not there physically, she was there in spirit. They even packed Peries stuff before he left for Everest.
When I got to the 400 meter point, I stopped for a while, spending two minutes there. I looked around and realized where I was. I took it all in very carefully and enjoyed every single step from there onwards. I did not find it hard in that sense. I knew I was going to make it. It was an amazing journey to take those last few steps. Finally when I got to the top, my Sherpa told me  this is it, you are at the summit!. I knew I was there! But someone had to tell me! This is it, there is nothing beyond this! You are at the top of the world! What I saw from up there was unbelievable! There was never a day like that in years. It was such a clear day. I was even able to take off my goggles. It was such a beautiful day! Not a single cloud in the sky! I could see from where I was to eternity! I cannot express it in words!, explained Peries.
Ayubo Life is the Health Wing of Hemas Group. They were Johanns single largest sponsor. AIA insurance were the second largest followed by Wijeya Group and Vision Care.
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to be a part of that. You are such an inspiration to all of us. I use that word with such meaning and deep felt thoughts. For those of you who dont know about our involvement, we actually introduced a virtual challenge and launched it on the day Johann made the trip to Everest. And on the same day he left the country  April 3, 2018 we launched a virtual challenge which was Climbing Everest With Johann. Johann, many thousands of people walked with you. You have changed the lives of many people. There were people who have never walked in their lives. There were people who thought they could never get physically active. There were many people who wrote to us saying  this inspirational man changed my life! said Chief Executive Officer of Ayubo Life, Chamila Ariyananda.
Ariyananda also pointed out that Peries did not merely raise a flag. He changed Sri Lankan lives with his meaningful journey which can be termed as fantastic.
AIA Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advanipointed out that Peries stands for what AIA stands for  achieving dreams.
It is no easy task climbing Everest. Johann your second attempt made it more valuable and special. You did not give up on your dreams.
That is what AIA stands for. We make Sri Lankan dreams and AIA is behind them. Johann we have been behind you every step of the way. It has been a fascinating and a little scary journey judging by your pics and videos. I am sure you must be feeling elated after your climb. Thanks for allowing us to be your sponsors and thanks for never giving up on you dreams, said Advani.
Chief Executive Officer of Seals, Rtd. Major Ruvan Ranatunga,called it an amazing journey with so many people placing their faith and trust in Peries.
It is no simple task climbing Everest twice. If there is one lesson children can learn from this, it is that if you are determined and committed you can pursue and accomplish your dreams.
There is always hope. You are a role model to young people. At your first climb you could have gone on but you would have died because of insufficient oxygen. But you decided to turn back and start from scratch. You are a true inspiration, said Ranatunga.

Copyright law could put end to net memes
Memes, remixes and other user-generated content could disappear online if the EUs proposed rules on copyright become law, warn experts.
Digital rights groups are campaigning against the Copyright Directive, which the European Parliament will vote on later this month.
The legislation aims to protect rights-holders in the internet age.
But critics say it misunderstands the way people engage with web content and risks excessive censorship.
The Copyright Directive is an attempt to reshape copyright for the internet, in particular rebalancing the relationship between copyright holders and online platforms.
Article 13 states that platform providers should take measures to ensure the functioning of agreements concluded with rights-holders for the use of their works.
Critics say this will, in effect, require all internet platforms to filter all content put online by users, which many believe would be an excessive restriction on free speech.
There is also concern that the proposals will rely on algorithms that will be programmed to play safe and delete anything that creates a risk for the platform.
A campaign against Article 13 - Copyright 4 Creativity - said that the proposals could destroy the internet as we know it.
Should Article 13 of the Copyright Directive be adopted, it will impose widespread censorship of all the content you share online, it said. It is urging users to write to their MEP ahead of the vote on 20 June.
Jim Killock, executive director of the UKs Open Rights Group, told the BBC: Article 13 will create a Robo-copyright regime, where machines zap anything they identify as breaking copyright rules, despite legal bans on laws that require general monitoring of users to protect their privacy.
Unfortunately, while machines can spot duplicate uploads of Beyonce songs, they cant spot parodies, understand memes that use copyright images, or make any kind of cultural judgement about what creative people are doing. We see this all too often on YouTube already.
Add to that, the EU wants to apply the Robocop approach to extremism, hate speech, and anything else they think can get away with, once they put it in place for copyright. This would be disastrous. BBC

Crawford stops Horn to seize WBO welterweight world title
LOS ANGELES: Unbeaten Terence Crawford punished Jeff Horn en route to a ninth-round technical knockout on Saturday to seize the Australians World Boxing Organization welterweight world title.
Americas Crawford, the former undisputed super lightweight world title holder, outclassed the Aussie who was defending the title he won in a huge upset of Manny Pacquiao in July of last year in Brisbane.
Horn defended the belt with a technical knockout of Gary Corcoran in December, but he was dominated by Crawford all the way at the Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Crawford, who improved to 33-0 with 24 knockouts, battered Horn for eight rounds, knocking him down in the ninth with a flurry of blows.
Horn beat the count, but Crawford unleashed another barrage and referee Robert Byrd called a halt at 2:33 of the round.
With the win Crawford claimed a world title in a third weight division.
He defeated Julius Indongo last August to become the undisputed super lightweight world champion.
A former WBO lightweight world champ, Crawford made the move up to welterweight in impressive fashion.
He won every round and was never really hurt by Horn, who fell to 18-1 with one draw and 12 knockouts.
A vocal Australian contingent among the crowd of 8,112 lustily backed Horn, but he was in trouble from the start as Crawford caught him with a hard left just seconds in.
Crawford, using his speed and his ability to switch stances to good effect, landed almost at will, Horn absorbing the punishment without finding a way to answer.

Prime Minister challenges Former President
Disclose tax reducing formula
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who established a world record by obtaining massive foreign loans when in power has pledged to reduce taxes by 20 percent if elected to power again. But, he should disclose the ways and means he will devise to bring down taxes by such an amount, if the promise is genuine, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Addressing a meeting after opening the newly built Ranwala Eswatte bridge on June 8, the Prime Minister said Sri Lankas foreign debt ran into Rs.7,391 billion during the Rajapaksa rule.
This was three times more than the debt he inherited when he assumed power. As such, Rajapaksa held a record by increasing Sri Lankas debt burden thrice over. But the irony was that the present government had to pay for the sins of the Rajapaksa regime, the Prime Minister said.
The Premier said Minister Kabir Hashim was attending that opening ceremony after attending the opening of another bridge at Millaniya.
The government planned to set up a new Free Trade Zone in Millaniya in association with a company in Thailand, he said.
This was the manner in which the government had accelerated development work in the country. When the government assumed power in 2015, there were no funds in the Treasury for development work. But today, the government had launched development work while servicing the debts incurred by the previous regime for its development work, the Premier said.
This was made possible due to the prudent economic policies adopted by the government. The government was taking steps to invite foreign investors to the country while increasing the countrys foreign exchange earnings, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said a majority of people were lamenting about an increase in the price of goods. Some people had been forced to pay a tax on house rent.
They had adopted these measures in order to enable the country to repay its debts by 2023. If this was not done, the future of the countrys youth would be lost. However, the government hoped to amend this tax structure shortly and reduce the tax burdens of the people, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said he would pose one question to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The question is how he would set about reducing taxes by 20 percent.
Would he go in for more foreign loans to cover government expenditure or cry halt to all development work to cut down government expenditure
Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim, Parliamentarians Harshana Rajakaruana, Avissawella UNP organiser Leonard Karunaratne and Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Suriyaarachchi were also present on the occasion.

Falling in love makes you fat
A new study now finds that people who are in a serious committed relationship tend to pile on the pounds.
Scientists have confirmed being in a settled relationship really does increase the likelihood of weight gain and explained why.
According to the study conducted by the Central Queensland University, it showed couples weigh more than single people - despite having healthier lifestyles and eating more fruit and vegetables.
According to lead author Stephanie Schoeppe, who spoke to NewScientist, the reason could be that they no longer needing to impress potential suitors.
And she warned that children can only add worsen weight problems, as parents tend to munch on their 'leftovers and snacks'. Speaking about it she said that when couples dont need to look attractive and slim to attract a partner, they may feel more comfortable in eating more, or eating more foods high in fat and sugar.
While cosy evenings spent binge-watching TV and munching popcorn on the sofa have taken the brunt of the blame, the new study, published in the medical journal PLoS ONE, suggests the weight gain isn't from an unhealthy lifestyle. It showed that couples consumed more fruit and vegetables and steered clear of fast food, alcohol and cigarettes.
However, experts believe the reason behind comfort weight could be that 'couples are eating more of all food types together'.

Fruity Fusion!
Its nice to have jewellery that you wont see on anyone else. So perhaps its even more special to have bling so exclusive that it can only be worn for less than a week.
Thats exactly the kind of creative expression artist Pamela is into. She makes jewellery out of peppers, beetroots, lemons, berries, tomatoes and whatever other fruits and veggies she can get her hands on, and creates lavish photoshoots with them for her fans on Instagram.
She spoke about her extraordinary designs which she works on in addition to running her non-fruit-based jewellery business, Lola Ade.
Q: How did you get into this type of jewellery making
Ive been making jewellery for over seven years now, but I didnt really tell anyone outside of my immediate family or best friends until two years ago when I finally launched my ready-to-wear jewellery line, Lola Ade.
Im a lawyer by day, so I felt pretty vulnerable showcasing this other creative side of myself that I didnt talk about for years.
After running my jewellery brand for about a year, I kept getting inspired by literally anything and everything I saw in both my travels and day-to-day life.
My current photo series Raw represents not only the raw fruits and vegetables I use to make jewellery, but also how vulnerable and raw creatives feel putting their art out there.
Q: How long does it take to make a piece of fruit jewellery
It depends on the piece, but anywhere from an hour to a few hours. Fruits and veggies are usually very soft, or delicate materials, so you learn to be patient to execute your vision.
Q: Whats been your favourite design
They are all my favourite! Its hard to choose because there is something euphoric about having an idea and turning it into a tangible form.
If I had to choose, the green beans choker is my favourite because it was the first one I posted. I was so nervous that people would think I was crazy, but the love and support was unreal.
Several people asked me how to purchase the necklace which was cool. I also love the blackberry one, and the lemons one was inspired by my love of Beyonce.
Q: How do you make your fruit jewellery Does the fruit or vegetable not rot
It always starts with an idea about a piece of jewellery I would actually wear, or I fall in love with a texture and then I try to design something based on that.
I have my regular jewellery tools like pliers and wire cutters, but then I also use kitchen utensils like knives and wood skewers to turn the raw food into edible beads.
I usually store the item in my fridge, but everything is 100 percent raw and fresh so I have to make them and shoot them within a week or they do spoil.
If I know I wont have time to post about it before it spoils, I usually cook it or eat it and then buy it again when I have time. I only wear them one time, because they are usually pretty heavy, or they start to go limp or soft after an hour or two.
Q: Could you sell these creations
At the present moment, no, because Im busy with Lola Ade, but who knows what will happen in the future
Q: Any last thoughts to share with people seeing your work
If you have an idea for something, stop worrying about what people will think. Have faith and just put it out there. Sometimes it doesnt take a lot to get started on your passion (I use fruits and vegetables!). Look for the beauty and art in everything around you.

Global automotive industry undergoing massive changes - CMTA

The Global Automotive Industry is undergoing massive changes from Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) to electric and Sri Lanka too is falling in line with this trend, said Chairman Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) Sheran Fernando addressing their 98th AGM.
Fernando also said it may take another 10 to 15 more years for some of these technological changes to become a reality in Sri Lanka. However CMTA has already seen signs of changes happening such as the banning on both petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040.
He said air pollution is pushing not only European countries but also China and India to actively pursue electric vehicle manufacturing with a view to eradicating combustion engines by 2040.
Fernando further said most of the large vehicle manufacturers such as Volvo, GM, VW, BMW, Jaguar, Toyota, Nissan, Ford and Fiat have already announced that their change over to electric models. Companies like Volvo announced that all models introduced in 2019 and after would be hybrid or electric.
He said in addition the CMTA needs to focus on Pollution, congestion, regulation and safety and work with the government to ensure that the necessary regulations which are brought will benefit Sri Lanka and its people.
The CMTA will also use its collaboration with international manufacturers, international trade associations, business chambers, universities, academics and the government to float a sustainable industry master plan.
The objective of establishing the CMTA in 1920 is to ensure sustainable growth of the automotive industry in Sri Lanka and also to promote, foster and protect the countrys new vehicle motor trade, the new motor vehicle franchise holders and authorized vehicle distributors.
The Chairman also said the countrys motor industry has faced numerous challenges in the past and many of the drivers of the industry such as duty, exchange rates, interest rates and leasing regulations were not controlled by the industry.
He also expressed concern over the countrys current taxation system on all types of automobiles and highlighted that authorities should look into this in a more simplified manner by introducing a more common tax system for all types of motor vehicles.

Global Economy to Expand by 3.1% in 2018   WB
Despite recent softening, global economic growth will remain robust at 3.1 percent in 2018 before slowing gradually over the next two years, as advanced-economy growth decelerates and the recovery in major commodity-exporting emerging market and developing economies levels off, the World Bank said.
If it can be sustained, the robust economic growth that we have seen this year could help lift millions out of poverty, particularly in the fast-growing economies of South Asia, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. But growth alone wont be enough to address pockets of extreme poverty in other parts of the world. Policymakers need to focus on ways to support growth over the longer runby boosting productivity and labor force participationin order to accelerate progress toward ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
Activity in advanced economies is expected to grow 2.2 percent in 2018 before easing to a 2 percent rate of expansion next year, as central banks gradually remove monetary stimulus, the June 2018 Global Economic Prospects says. Growth in emerging market and developing economies overall is projected to strengthen to 4.5 percent in 2018, before reaching 4.7 percent in 2019 as the recovery in commodity exporters matures and commodity prices level off following this years increase.
This outlook is subject to considerable downside risks. The possibility of disorderly financial market volatility has increased, and the vulnerability of some emerging market and developing economies to such disruption has risen. Trade protectionist sentiment has also mounted, while policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks remain elevated.
The projected decline in commodities consumption growth over the long run could create challenges for the two-thirds of developing countries that depend on commodity exports for revenues, said World Bank Senior Director for Development Economics, Shantayanan Devarajan. This reinforces the need for economic diversification and for strengthening fiscal and monetary frameworks.
South Asia:
Growth in the region is projected to strengthen to 6.9 percent in 2018 and to 7.1 percent in 2019, mainly as factors holding back growth in India fade. Growth in India is projected to advance 7.3 percent in Fiscal Year 2018/19 (April 1, 2018-March 31, 2019) and 7.5 percent in FY 2019/20, reflecting robust private consumption and strengthening investment. Pakistan is anticipated to expand by 5 percent in FY 2018/19 (July 1, 2018-June 30, 2019), reflecting tighter policies to improve macroeconomic stability. Bangladesh is expected to accelerate to 6.7 percent in FY 2018/19 (July 1, 2018-June 30, 2019).

Golden Man Booker prize shortlist announced
The English Patient and Wolf Hall are among the five books shortlisted for the Golden Man Booker prize, the special one-off award that will see a novel crowned the best work of fiction released over the last 50 years. In a Free State, Moon Tiger, and last years Man Booker Prize for Fiction winner Lincoln in the Bardo complete the shortlist, which was announced at Hay Festival.
All 51 of the former Booker Prize winners were considered by a panel of five judges, each tasked with reading the winning novels from one decade of the awards history. The Golden five will now be put to a public vote to decide the ultimate winner, which will then be announced on 8 July at the Southbank Centre, London.
In a Free State by VS Naipaul marks the earliest release on the shortlist, having reached bookstores back in 1971. Writer Robert McCrum selected the work  a collection of three short stories linked by common themes  describing it as outstandingly the best novel to win the Booker Prize in the 1970s, a disturbing book about displaced people at the dangerous edge of a disrupted world that could have been written yesterday, a classic for all seasons. Naipaul, who has also won the Nobel Prize for Literature, is the oldest living Booker Prize winner.
Poet Lemn Sissay chose the winner from the 1980s, selecting Penelope Livelys Moon Tiger, a novel that sees a dying woman tell of her former struggles with love and loss. Facing stiff competition from Salman Rushdies Midnights Children, the favourite to win having already won the Best of Booker award 10 years ago, Sissay called Moon Tiger a unique book about a fascinating unpredictable woman way ahead of her time and yet absolutely of her time.
Novelist Kamila Shamsie selected The English Patient as best work of the 1990s. Michael Ondaatjes war drama  famously adapted into an Oscar-winning film  is a rare novel which gets under your skin and insists you return to it time and again, always yielding a new surprise or delight. Few novels really deserve the praise: transformative. This one really does. The book originally tied with Barry Unsworths Sacred Hunger in 1992, hence why there were 51 books in contention on the prizes 50th anniversary,
Wolf Hall, written by Hilary Mantel, was selected by Simon Mayo as the best novel of the 2000s. The broadcaster said the fictionalised Thomas Cromwell biography may be set hundreds of years ago but seemed to me to be the most contemporary, in its questioning of what England is and how it can disengage from Rome, of who should rule and where power should be held.
Mayo added that the book was as anguished as any essay about Brexit youll read in the papers.
Finishing the shortlist is Lincoln in the Bardo, by George Saunders, as chosen by Hollie McNish. The most recent winner of the Booker Prize focuses on Abraham Lincoln and the former presidents grief over his dead son. Saunders, who was known for short stories, had never published a full novel beforehand, with McNish saying: I have never read a book like Lincoln in the Bardo it was so funny, imaginative and tragic, but also a piece of genius in its originality of form and structure.

Government completed Moragahakanda project in record time: PM
The previous government could not initiate the Moragahakanda reservoir project since they could not meet the cost. When the good governance government came into power in 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena laid the foundation stone for that project and completed it within a short period because we had foreign funds to achieve it, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was speaking at a ceremony held after opening the Galewela new Divisional Secretariat building complex on Saturday (9).
The Prime Minister said the government has planned many development activities. Our rivals are making allegations. None could mislead the majority and within the next two years, a cold store will be constructed near the Dambulla Economic Centre with the financial assistance of a Indian company, he said.
After its completion, around 5,000 kg of vegetables and fruits could be preserved.The Indian company will handle its management, he said. The Prime Minister said the other infra-structure facilities in the area would be developed to improve other industries. Many self-employment ventures will be created to resolve the unemployment issue in the area, the Prime Minister said.
The Premier said that during the last period, the government could renovate many rural tanks island-wide to strengthen the rural economy. Other tanks will be renovated soon and the farmer population could improve their living condition then, the Prime Minister said. The number of Samurdhi beneficiaries would be increased, the Prime Minister said.
Many unfair things had occurred during the previous regime when Samurdhi recipients were selected. Such unfair acts do not happen now. The Samurdhi banks would be strengthened and the loan benefits will be increased for the beneficiaries, the Prime Minister said.
In addition, 15,000 acres in the Northern Province would be used for coconut cultivation while cultivation of other crops will be developed in the Matale, Kurunegala districts and Southern Province. The problems of unemployed graduates will be resolved since July, he said.
The government have to pay debts that the previous government had obtained. The income is insufficient to repay loans. We have enough strength to continue the government, the Prime Minister said.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardhana said that during the last 30 years, the entire administrative activities were declined. The government have to develop it to provide a satisfactory service for the public. The building complexes for the district secretariats and divisional secretariats are constructed now to achieve the purpose, he said.
Another group of service centres are constructed in rural areas called Seva Piyasa so that public officers can carry out their services properly,: he said.
Ven. Dewahuwe Chandananda Thera, Home Affairs Deputy Minister J.C.Alawathuwela, Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare, Dambulla UNP Chief Organizer Priyan Wijerarthna, Provincial Councillor W.M.Yasamana and Matale District Secretary S.M.J.K. Perera spoke.

Haleps French Open title inspired by Ruzici
PARIS, Saturday: Newly-crowned French Open champion Simon Halep said she was inspired to win her first Grand Slam title by her manager Virginia Ruzicis feats 40 years ago at Roland Garros.
Until Saturday, Ruzicis 1978 Paris triumph over Mima Jausovec was the last time a Romanian, man or woman, had won a Grand Slam but Halep ended that long wait as she hit back to beat American Sloane Stephens 3-6, 6-4, 6-1.
In doing so, Halep equalled the feat of American seven-times French Open champion Chris Evert who also suffered three Grand Slam final losses before capturing the 1974 French title.
Its a motivation and inspiration, the 26-year-old Halep, who lifted the junior title 10 years ago, told reporters with Ruzici sitting alongside her.
Forty years ago she won here. Its a special moment. The fact that its happened here, its pretty special. So yeah, shes an inspiration.
Ruzici, who also lost the 1980 final and was the inspiration for Richard Williams to teach his daughters Venus and Serena to play tennis, said her charges win was well-deserved.
There is of course a lot of emotion, she told reporters. She was very close last season. She was favourite for this final but it was not simple. It was a physical and mental fight.
Simona gave her heart on the court.
Halep climbed to the top of the rankings last October and has been there more or less ever since.
The elephant in the room remained her lack of a Grand Slam trophy having twice lost the title match in Paris, to Maria Sharapova in 2014 and Jelena Ostapenko last year, and at this years Australian Open to Caroline Wozniacki.
By beating Spains former French Open champion Garbine Muguruza in the semi-finals she guaranteed that she extended her stay as the worlds number one player  a position she has held now for 32 weeks in total.
But it was the Suzanne Lenglen trophy she really desired and the tears flowed as she raised it skywards on Saturday after showing huge character to battle back to victory.
Im really happy that I won this Grand Slam. Because being number one without a Grand Slam, I always said, is not like everything, not 100 percent, she said.
Its my favourite Grand Slam. I always said that if Im going to win one, I want it to be here. Halep said the memory of last years defeat by Ostapenko when she led by a set and 3-0 actually helped her on Saturday when she trailed by a set and 2-0 to an inspired Stephens.
When I started to win games, I said that last year it happened to me, the same thing, she said. I was a set and a break up and I lost the match. So I said there is a chance to come back and win it.
Haleps French title arrived in the 32nd Grand Slam of her career. Only seven players have taken more attempts to land one.
Her patience finally paid off as she used all her experience to weather the Stephens storm.
I said that I have to calm down, just to try to open the court, try to put more balls in, she said. And at one point I felt that she started to feel a little bit tired and to miss more. So I was patient. - Agencies

Halt these killings
The killing of yet another local government politician within two weeks of each other is indeed a matter for grave concern to which the government ought to pay serious attention to. The latest to fall prey to the roaming gunmen is Karandeniya Pradeshiya Sabha Vice Chairman Donald Sampath, a father of three. He was mowed down by a hail of bullets fired from two T56 weapons by twin assassins riding a motor cycle. The victim was killed on the spot and the driver of the vehicle in which he was travelling was injured. The motive for the murder is yet to be revealed. One of the assailants has been arrested by the police while he lay in hospital after been knocked down by the vehicle in a bold move by the driver to harm the assailants. Police believe this to be yet another underworld killing, masterminded by a well known underworld leader who is at large.
Two weeks ago the father of national cricketer Dananjaya De Silva, Dehiwela Mt.Lavinia Municipal Councillor Ranjan De Silva was similarly gunned down outside his residence in yet another underworld contract killing. Police say this killing too was ordered by a well known underworld leader who is presently in Dubai, believed to have fled the country during a STF crackdown on the underworld.
The Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera very often, following similar killings carried out by the underworld, identifies well known underworld leaders by name, to the media, who, according to him, were responsible for carrying out the slayings. This indicates the police to have sound knowledge of the perpetrators and/or well aware of their whereabouts and modus operandi.
Why pray then allow these underworld leaders to remain at large Why not hunt them down and spare the valuable lives of innocent people if, as SP Gunasekera says, the killings were carried out on the orders of so and so Why allow these killers, who pose a danger to society, remain on the loose instead of rounding them up Are we going to hear the name of yet another underworld leader from SP Gunasekera after the next killing and repeated again after another killing
This government can take ample credit for creating a peaceful climate for citizens to live without fear of being abducted and made to disappear, unlike in the past. But this would come to naught if the people are forced to live in dread not of government sponsored violence but the other forces of evil in society. Hardly a day passes today without a killing committed by the underworld. This is a dangerous trend and if not dealt with promptly could cause a serious erosion of faith by the public in the ability of the law enforcement to afford protection to the citizenry.
It is no exaggeration to say that we are today close to the situation that existed during the bloodletting of the late 80s when the JVP hit squads targeted politicians. The then government of President Premadasa took drastic measures to halt the slide to anarchy by meeting the challenge head on. No doubt, unpleasant things took place in those dark days and innocents fell victim. But the situation was brought under control and the fear psychosis eliminated. The government too should take some drastic measures in this respect. It cannot afford to be playing by the rule book if life and limb of citizens are being threatened by dangerous killers on the prowl. As mentioned, most of the underworld figures are known by their identity to the police. The familiarity by which the Police Media Spokesman rattles out the aliases of these dangerous killers suggests that the whereabouts of the latter are very much in knowledge of the police. Nothing short of an all out war against the underworld would suffice if this dangerous trend is to be arrested.
Today, it is common knowledge that these underworld leaders receive the protection of politicians of all hues. The recent local government elections saw a generous sprinkling of underworld names in the nomination lists of all parties. As we have been saying in these spaces all that the party leaders care is the outcome and towards this end if they have to employ underworld characters to muscle their way to victory, so be it. The police, hence, have been acting coy in dealing with the underworld, due to this factor. The end result is today we have a green eyed monster stalking in our midst engaged in killing sprees.
IGP Pujith Jayasundera should order his men to ignore the orders of politicians when dealing with the underworld. Today, the innocent people are being forced to suffer the consequences of this nexus between the politicians and criminals. There were brave police officers in the past, such as Inspector Rahula Silva and Olympian boxer Sumith Liyanage who stood up to government politicians who tried to interfere in their duties. We need officers of such calibre in the police service today if eliminating the underworld is to be successfully accomplished.

Have we forgotten how to die
Definitions of death have grown more complicated  does it lie in brain function or in the heart and lungs  and are openly contested. And despite what Warraich calls medicines obsession with preventing or delaying death, there is no clear provision for bereaved families. That task waits to be taken up. Kathryn Mannix agrees in With the End in Mind: Dying, death and wisdom in an age of denial, suggesting that it has become taboo to mention dying. Through a gradual transition, Mannix says, we have lost the vocabulary for talking about death and depend instead on euphemism, lies and ambiguity; she wants us to reclaim a language of death.
James Turner was twenty-five when his four-year-old daughter Annice died from a lung condition. She died at home with her parents and grandmother; her sleeping siblings were told of her death the next morning.
James did everything to soothe Annices last days but, never having encountered death before, he didnt immediately recognize it. He didnt know what to do or expect and found it hard to discuss things with his wife Martha. The family received many condolences but kept the funeral private. Losing a child, often described as the hardest bereavement to bear, changed James Turner forever.
Death in the twenty-first century is typified by the paradox contained in this story. Although we greedily consume death at a distance through fiction, drama and the media, we are hamstrung by it up close and personal. In 1955 the commentator Geoffrey Gorer declared that death had become more pornographic than sex. It was, he said, the new taboo and mourning had become indecent. Since then, matters have arguably got worse.
The decline in institutional Christianity left a spiritual and existential vacuum, while the rise in individual materialism has fragmented family networks and communities. Shared rites of passage that publicly validated grief have receded, and the space of death has moved increasingly from the home to the hospital.
[SUBHEAD] Grown complicated
Focusing on the US and, to a lesser extent, Northern Europe, Haider Warraichs Modern Death: How medicine changed the end of life identifies how far-reaching these changes are. A physician and clinical researcher, Warraich is well placed to observe the dubious implications of an expanded medicalization of death. Most people want to die at home, but the majority continue to die in hospital, surrounded by medical equipment. In general, life expectancy in the past century has increased, but so has the use of medicine to prolong it artificially.
Definitions of death have grown more complicated  does it lie in brain function or in the heart and lungs  and are openly contested. And despite what Warraich calls medicines obsession with preventing or delaying death, there is no clear provision for bereaved families. That task waits to be taken up. Kathryn Mannix agrees in With the End in Mind: Dying, death and wisdom in an age of denial, suggesting that it has become taboo to mention dying. Through a gradual transition, Mannix says, we have lost the vocabulary for talking about death and depend instead on euphemism, lies and ambiguity; she wants us to reclaim a language of death.
This is a recurring theme among these seven books. For some, our inability to talk straight about death and dying is partly about the mystery of the end. Andrew Stark, in The Consolations of Mortality: Making sense of death, identifies the decline in religion in the West and the idea of the afterlife as pivotal to our lack of confidence in confronting death. Robert McCrum, in Every Third Thought: On life, death and the endgame, speculates that ageing and death present a particular conundrum to self-assured baby boomers, who try to give death the slip (lets talk about it another time . . .).
In From Here to Eternity: Travelling the world to find the good death, Caitlin Doughty expands the problem into a generic Western culture of death avoidance  we duck awkward conversations with the dying, hand our corpses to corporate professionals and, worst of all, treat grief with embarrassment and shame. Kevin Toolis, in My Fathers Wake: How the Irish teach us to live, love and die, describes a veritable Western Death Machine, in which public services, health professionals, the media and corporate bodies all conspire towards the removal of death and dying from the purview of ordinary people. A former war correspondent, Toolis has seen more than his fair share of death and is here to shake us out of our complacency.
The measure for our current climate of denial is typically set against an assumed past where we were collectively better at death.
The pinnacle of this Golden Age, the so-called Celebration of Death, was the nineteenth century, when religions helped to explain death and provide a set of shared practices for marking our passage into it. Consumer culture provided a public medium for expressing loss and offering condolence, from the burgeoning trade in mourning  exemplified by the rise of the mid-Victorian death superstore Jays Mourning Warehouse, on Regent Street  to the birth of the With Sympathy condolence card where ready-made sentiment overcomes the awkwardness of finding something meaningful to say. Most important of all, high death rates and low expectations of medicine (beyond palliation) meant that families commonly experienced death within their home.
It is the loss of this familiarity with death that is most lamented by Toolis, who relates the story of his elderly fathers peaceful death at home in rural Ireland, contrasting a disappearing world of traditional community-based rites of passage  keening, the help of a death (or soul) midwife, washing the corpse, and the steady stream of visitors who arrive with simple words of condolence (Sorry for your loss)  with our modern culture of hygiene, individualism and emotional reticence.
The author isnt subtle about which culture he prefers. Over in Anglo-Saxon land, we whisper about death, putting our hands over our ears, blinding ourselves with the Western Death Machine, but it doesnt change anything: it just leaves you naked and exposed.
[SUBHEAD] Community affair
Doughty finds something similar to the Irish way in nineteenth-century America, where death was a family and community affair, while Mannix identifies a pre-1950s culture in the West of accumulated rich wisdom garnered from observing death and dying at close quarters. Stark, however, draws on a more generic wisdom of ages to outline four propositions that might provide solace in a secular age (again, the assumption is that religion once provided the consolation that we postmodern bundles of ego and anxiety now lack): death is benign; mortality can imitate the good things about immortality (notably, technology facilitates the preservation of treasured memories granting us virtual immortality, at least); immortality would be grim; and life, suffused with repeated loss and suffering, might not be terribly different to death anyway.
Stark concludes that none of the propositions really provides much consolation after all, and suggests that perhaps the only real consolation comes with the knowledge that we are continually moving towards death. But is it even true that, as all these authors suggest, people in times past did not face the same difficulties

Italy's Matteo Salvini shuts ports to migrant rescue ship

A rescue vessel carrying 629 migrants is stranded in the Mediterranean after Italy's new Interior Minister refused permission for it to dock.
Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing League, said Malta should accept the Aquarius but he was rejected.
Malta says the German charity SOS Mditerrane picked up the migrants in Libyan waters, which means they fall under Italy's jurisdiction.
Italy is the main entry for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe.
The League promised voters during Italy's recent general election that it would take a tough stance on immigration.
SOS Mditerrane, which runs the Aquarius, said the ship had been instructed by the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre to stand by in its current position, 35 nautical miles from Italy and 27 nautical miles from Malta.
It reports that the migrants were picked up in six different rescue operations off Libya's coast.
The UN refugee agency in Italy has called on "states and actors involved" to "rapidly find solutions to allow migrants and refugees on board the Aquarius to disembark safely and quickly".
Who is on the ship
Many of the migrants were rescued in waters controlled by Libya, a common route for undocumented migrants attempting to enter Europe from sub-Saharan Africa.
Some 400 were rescued by the Italian Navy, the Italian coastguard and merchant vessels before being transferred to the Aquarius.
Among those saved and brought on board the Aquarius are 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children and seven pregnant women, SOS Mditerrane says.
The minors are aged between 13 and 17 and come from Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria and Sudan, according to a journalist on the ship, Anelise Borges.
Tweeting during the night, she added that the situation on board was calm and most of the people rescued were asleep.
One Aquarius crew member, Alessandro Porro, told Italian news channel Sky TG24 that they desperately needed to know which port to go to.
"The people we saved yesterday were in a difficult condition, at least 50 were at risk of drowning," he added.
What is Salvini's position
He said on Sunday that Italy was saying "no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration".
"Malta takes in nobody," he said. "France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons."
"It is not possible for Malta to say 'no' to every request for help. The Good Lord put Malta closer than Sicily to Africa."
Last week, Salvini said Rome should increase its deportations of migrants and the Italian government also wants to relocate asylum seekers EU-wide - a scheme already rejected by some member states.
Salvini says he is considering action against organisations rescuing migrants at sea. He has previously accused them of being in cahoots with people-smugglers.

Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) funded a study programme recently for Sri Lankan government officials to gain more knowledge on Good Agriculture Practices (GAP) in Thailand.
The objective of the tour was to promote and strengthen Sri Lankas own GAP programme (SL-GAP). Held from May 20 to 26, the study visit was jointly organised by the National Planning Department, the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry and Shinga Kimura, the JICA advisor working with the Department.
The training was coordinated by Thailands National Agricultural Extension Training Centre at the Kasetsart University, a world-class training institute recognised as a key provider of agricultural knowledge.
It was established through grant assistance from the government of Japan to Thailand.
GAPs are principles and codes of practice for farm management that can contribute to achieving sustainable agriculture and rural development by improving food safety and quality, environmental sustainability and social welfare, as defined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). As a result of increasing international demands on high quality and food safety, GAP certifications are vital documentation often required by food importers.
Ten staff from the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry and the Sri Lanka Standards Institution participated in the training.
The participants gained knowledge about the experiences of GAP policies and strategies, farm-level GAP management for fruits, vegetables and rice, and GAP marketing with a focus on the spice sector in Thailand.
The programme included lectures by Thailands top researchers and field visits to the farmers organisations and companies that are leading the countrys agro-industry.
Commenting on the learning achieved, National Planning Department Additional Director General J.M.S.D. Rathnayake said that having learned from the hard work that had been put together by the government, private sector and academia of Thailand, they will be able to plan ahead to take advantage of GAP to increase food security and agriculture exports in Sri Lanka.
Post training, all the participants of the programme are deeply committed to further accelerate their efforts towards the development of SL-GAP, he said.

Joes beat fancied Isipathana 34-29 in Cup final
St. Joseph's College Maradana wing three quarter Keshan Kavinda touched down for a try in the dying stages of the game where they came from behind (27-29) to beat the fancied Isipathana College outfit by 34 points (4 tries, 4 conversions, 2 penalties) to 29 (4 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) in their Singer 'A' Division inter-schools league rugby second round Cup Championship final match played at Havelock Park in Colombo yesterday. At half time the score read 20-17 in favour of S. Joseph College Maradana. With this win Joes were crowned the 2018 Cup Champion runners up on points, pushing St. Peter's to the third place.
Both teams dished out a superb game displaying running rugby through out the game but the small-made Isipathana College outfit was the pick of the lot and had an outstanding game with both in attack and defence.
Pathana staged a spirited performance in the second half scoring two back to back tries. But it was too late for them to turn tables on the Josephians who sealed their victory.
Victorious S.Joseph's College scored their four tries through winger K.D.Kavinda (two), Gamunu Chethiya (one), co-winger cum last years Dharmaraja College player Dulanjana Piyatissa (one) while fly half Santhush Algama put over all four conversions as well as the two penalties for the winners.
For the losing Isipathana College team their centre Manula Rathnayake (two), K.Kaushalya and flanker Janith Serasinghe scored the three tries, while captain Manelka Ruberu slotted in the three conversions and the solitary penalty.
Referee - Dinka Peiris had a very poor game with the whistle

The award-winning writer on prophecy, political pessimism and her love of London
Kamila Shamsie: 'We have to find reasons for optimism'
When Kamila Shamsie began her novel Home Fire in 2015, Sadiq Khan had yet to launch his campaign to become Londons mayor and the idea of a Muslim home secretary would have been dismissed as a futuristic fantasy. As she stepped up to receive the Womens prize for fiction this week, both had come to pass, along with several more chilling scenarios in her updating of the classical tragedy Antigone to multicultural Britain today.
After the banker-turned-Conservative MP Sajid Javid was promoted to the Home Office, a supporter went so far as to create a twitter hashtag, #nostrashamsie. But to those who tell her that the resonance of the novel has grown exponentially since it was published last year, Shamsie briskly responds: Im not a soothsayer  these things were in the water.
The Pakistani-born daughter of a businessman and a leading critic and literary historian, Shamsie has lived in London since the mid-noughties. Two years before starting work on the novel, she became a British citizen, so I was very aware of what was going on around citizenship and how easy it was to fall between the cracks. Until then, each time I signed a form for residency renewal I was incredibly tense: what would have happened if I had ticked one box wrongly
The ancient Greek play on which Home Fire is based tells the story of a princess who is forced to choose between obeying the king, who is her uncle, or burying her brother, whose body has been left to rot as punishment for waging war on the kingdom of Thebes.
Shamsies Antigone is Aneeka, one of three Muslim siblings, whose twin brother has travelled secretly to Syria to film Islamic State fighters in Raqqa. While their older sister tries to protect the family by reporting him to the police, Aneeka embarks on a cloak-and-dagger campaign to force the Muslim home secretary to allow her disaffected and frightened brother back into the UK, against government policy.
The idea came about through one of those funny confluences of events, Shamsie explains. Her previous two novels, Burnt Shadows and A God in Every Stone, had been sweeping historical investigations, and she was keen to write something set in the present day that did not require a lot of research. I was ready to write but not sure what.
In this creative hiatus, she met a theatre director who pointed out that there was a revival of interest in Greek tragedy and suggested she take a look at Sophocles Antigone. My thought at that point was, lets do something to fill the time, she says, but she was struck by how pertinent the story seemed. Mohammed Emwazi, the British-born Isis executioner also known as Jihadi John, had hit the the headlines, along with a succession of stories about young British runaways who had dedicated their lives to religious war.

Kerosene to be reduced by Rs.31
The price of kerosene will be reduced by Rs. 31 per litre from Tuesday midnight. The new price from Wednesday will be Rs. 70 per litre, Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economy State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
Wedararachchi said the proposal to reduce the price of kerosene will be tabled after Cabinet approval on Tuesday (June 12) morning and once it was approved the price reduction will take effect from Tuesday midnight. The Finance Ministry has agreed to carry out this proposal.
The government has taken this decision considering the difficulties encountered by the poor and the fisheries community as a result of the price, he said.
However, the Consumer Affairs Authority, Police and the STF would be deployed to track down people engaged in various rackets misusing the price reduction and legal action taken against them. He said the government would also look for the possibility of further reducing the price of kerosene in the near future.

Kim has one shot at peace: Trump
CANADA : US President Donald Trump predicted Saturday that he would know within a minute of meeting Kim Jong Un whether his one-time shot at peace with the North Korean leader had a chance of succeeding.
Speaking just before embarking on his marathon journey to Singapore for the pairs historic summit, Trump bristled with confidence as he boasted that contacts between their respective negotiating teams had been positive.
Its unknown territory in the truest sense but I really feel confident, Trump said.
I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people and he has that opportunity... Its a one-time shot, he said at a press conference, adding that the North Koreans had been working very well with us. After his remarks, Trump headed to the Canadian air base at Bagotville by helicopter before boarding Air Force One and setting off for Singapore, where he was scheduled to arrive late Sunday.
The US President was the first of the G7 leaders to leave the summit in Canada where he briefed his peers on the meeting.
I am on a mission of peace and were going to be carrying the hearts of millions of people from all over the world, he said. We have to get denuclearization, we have to get something going. Asked how long it would take for him to work out if Kim was serious about striking some kind of peace deal, Trump replied: I think within the first minute Ill know.
Its just my touch, my feel. Thats what I do. I think Ill know pretty quickly whether or not, in my opinion, something positive will happen. And if I think it wont happen, Im not going to waste my time. I dont want to waste his time.
The summit between Kim and Trump will cap a remarkable turnaround in relations between two men who were trading furious insults less than six months ago.
After North Korea carried out a series of long-range missile tests that potentially put the US mainland in range of a nuclear strike, Trump promised to respond with fire and fury.
He also ridiculed Kim in a speech at the UN General Assembly as Little Rocket Man who in turn called Trump a dotard.
But after a cooling of the rhetoric, both sides began forging tentative contacts that eventually saw Mike Pompeo -- the former head of the CIA who is now Secretary of State -- meet Kim in Pyongyang.
Some critics have said the summit is being rushed through, with Trump keen to chalk up his first major foreign policy achievement.
But the President insisted the US was leaving no stone unturned in its preparations, while warning that patience was needed. - AFP

Lahiru aims for  USD 100 mn with  tech-savvy Lankans
Meeting Point
Lahiru Pathmalal is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder of Takas.lk. A past student of Colombo International School (CIS) he obtained his Bachelors degree in political science from University of Maryland USA, and masters degree in International Relations from University of Queensland, Australia. Lahiru takes pride in being a Sri Lankan, and is the only CEO, we have met thus far- who has his business card printed in English, Tamil and Sinhala.
Extracts;
1. Your education and family background
I schooled at CIS. My parents are engaged in the manufacture and retail of shoes. So I had a good understanding of what it is to please a customer from an early age. I have done my bachelors and masters degree.
2. How did you come up with the idea to start Takas.lk
As you can see I have lived and travelled overseas for 8 years. In these countries lots of people purchase their requirements online. I was working at the Neelan Thiruchelvam ICES dealing with democracy and policy. It was during this time, in 2012 that two of my friends Dilendra Wimalasekera and Murtaza Moosajee came up with the idea of an online shopping portal. With regard to our name it was my friend Ravi Wijesinghe, who is very creative, who gave us the name takas- to show the rapid access consumers can have on our website.
3. What drove you to start your own business rather than join the already established family business
As you know Gigi shoes is our family business, built over the years by my father Sarath Pathmalal. One day I was looking online and wanted to buy a TV, but I could not find one. It was then that I realized that there could be thousands of others searching for various products online- and I realized the potential in this dormant market for online shopping. There were not many online shopping options in Sri Lanka.
4. Can you walk us through the process of starting Takas.lk
In any business it takes planning. It also takes investment. We began takas.lk with what we call an angel investment. We had to convince them that this is a viable market that would yield profits. This entire operation is very high- tech, an almost automated process. At the start it was hard to get and maintain suppliers, but today 5 years later we are ahead of our game and have a product range of between 8000- 13,000 items.
We dont have to maintain stores, as we liaise well with all our suppliers. E- Commerce is a daily evolving field and we strive to stay ahead and are always updating. We did face challenges- as in any business but we moved forward. I value every member of my team and we reward out exceptional performers with shares, to inspire them and give them a sense of ownership.
5. In a day where many similar websites and services exist how do you keep up or out do the competition
Yes we have to always satisfy our customers and understand their purchasing trends. The customers drive us to stay ahead in the game. Some refer to us as the amazon.com of Sri Lanka. Access to information of all the products we sell is also vital. Our fast moving area is electronics- especially mobile phones and computer accessories.
6. What is the future of the industry
There is great potential for this industry. Today we have also tied up with companies that provide the digital wallet service. There are approximately 1.4 million credit card users in Sri Lanka. We will penetrate this market. We have improved our delivery service (which is outsourced to courier companies). Sri Lankans are becoming more tech-savvy and the world is one large digital domain. We hope to increase ourrevenueto 80- 100 million dollars over the next five years.
7. What can be done to improve and enable youth who are interested in starting their own businesses
Sri Lankan youth have great talent. They must be empowered to succeed, in any chosen field. We must break the culture of dependency. Over the last few years many young people have gone overseas, in search of greener pastures, and established themselves, in various fields of work. We must not give into any racism and segregation- we are all Sri Lankans. I am disappointed to see so many young men driving 3 wheelers (tuk-tuk). They have no other skill and they will remain stagnant for life. We must make way for creativity. People are often skeptical when you want to start something new- but you must take a risk. We also have to welcome skilled foreigners- example in America that is the strength and diversity of that nations sustained progress. We must allow foreigners will good skills to legally work here and not be insecure and petty minded. We can learn from their experience.
8. What advice would you like to give youngsters aiming to start their own business
Success, in any field takes time. There is a period of challenges and waiting. You must not give up, persistence pays off. You must understand your customers. Success is built over months or years. If there is no risk- there is no reward. It takes time to create true value.

LAUGFS Nana Maga Math Camps conclude
The LAUGFS Nana Maga Math Camps conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Education marked another milestone of assisting over 1500 students to strengthen their mathematics knowledge through skill enhancement. The 10th program was recently conducted in Matara with over 150 G.C.E. (Ordinary Level) students participating.
The LAUGFS Nana Maga Math Camps project was launched last year together with the Mathematics Branch of the Ministry of Education,as a special educational program to augment the mathematics knowledge of G.C.E (Ordinary Level) students.
Our aim is to continuously enhance the aptitude and skills of our students. Mathematics is a core subject that helps develop analytical skills, which is applicable in any profession and is therefore essential for career progression, remarked Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education. Through the first phase, we facilitated programmes in 29 schools in the Southern Province. The sessions helped the students to delve deeper into the subject and broaden their knowledge by learning new mathematic application techniques. Providing a quality education is vital  our intention is to instil a solid foundation for young talent, which will shape our countrys future.
Following an Accelerated Teaching Methodology and activity-based learning techniques, the three-day programs incorporated comprehensive and interactive learning sessions in a conducive learning environment.
Mathematics has always been a subject area of difficulty for me. But, the different sessions conducted by the teachers during the camp has helped us to learn simple ways to comprehend certain subject areas which we have been struggling with. I never thought that studying mathematics can be so interesting and enjoyable, commented Jeewantha Sandharuwan, one of the students who took part in the Math camps.
Susantha Vithanage, Principal of Beralapananthara College Matara remarked, We see a significant improvement in the interest levels of students in the mathematics subject following the camps. This initiative is a great value addition for students to elevate and enrich their knowledge, and the teachers are able to incorporate advanced teaching techniques and spend additional time assisting students.
During the first phase of the project, 3000 supplementary modules were handed over to the Ministry of Education by LAUGFS, which were distributed among students during the math camps conducted in Elpitiya, Ahangama, Ambalangoda, Dikkubura, Balapitiya, Tangalle, Kotapola, Matara, Akurassa, Kamburugamuwa and other schools in the area.
Our partnership with the Ministry of Education stemmed with the aim of empowering and nurturing our countrys future leaders, stated LAUGFS Holdings Managing Director, Thilak De Silva.

MCC unveil new designs for Compton, Edrich Stands at Lords
The MCC have released the new designs for the latest phase in their redevelopment of Lords.
The new three-tier Compton and Edrich Stands will boost capacity at the home of cricket by 2,500 seats, taking the ground to an overall 32,500-seater.
The proposals will accommodate 11,500 at the Nursery End and will take place over a two-year period between 2019 and 2021, with a walkway linking both stands underneath the Media Centre.
Work will commence after next years Test match against Australia, following the Cricket World Cup, with Lords hosting the final on July 15.
MCC members will be asked to approve the plan at next years AGM.
Seats in the new stands will be in place by the 2020 season, with completion due on the reconstruction work the following summer. The total cost is expected to be in the region of 50m.
The proposals form the next part of the phased Masterplan for Lords. Last year, the new 25 million Warner Stand was opened, the first stand to be rebuilt at Lords since 1997.
MCC Chief Executive and Secretary Guy Lavender said: MCC is committed to ensuring Lords remains the best place in the world at which to watch and play cricket.
These new stands will transform the Nursery End, providing world-class facilities, opening up views both to the Pavilion and back towards the Nursery Ground, and adding another architectural enhancement to Lords.
We are very aware of the responsibility we have to protect everything that makes Lords so special, and we are delighted with the positive feedback weve already received from our membership.
As well as providing a significant improvement to capacity and facilities, the plans for the new Compton and Edrich stands complement beautifully the J.P. Morgan Media Centre, which was designed by Future Systems and is itself an award-winning building, well known to anyone who has watched cricket at Lords.

Moragahakanda residents demand relief
The All Ceylon Agrarian Federation charges that people who returned to their lands near the Moragahakanda reservoir did not receive relief and they are undergoing severe difficulties now.
Federation National Organiser Namal Karunarathna at a special media briefing said on June 7 that unless relief is not provided for the people who sacrificed their homes, lands and property for the welfare of the country, they are ready to begin a struggle along with the people.
Karunarathna was addressing the gathering after establishing an Agrarian Organisation for Laggala, Ma Oya residents who gave away their lands for the Moragahakanda Reservoir.
The residents said they were given land for farming but water. They complained that a few water bowsers are provided to manage all their needs.
Lack of facilities for transport, and higher education have put them in immense difficulties, and they have not received compensation, they alleged. They said the dry rations, rice and sprats being provided to them are not fit for consumption.
The villagers charged that the Mahaweli Authority does not permit them to go near the Moragahakanda reservoir area to sell their products to the people who come to view the reservoir.
Karunarathna said the people who sacrificed their homes, lands and property to develop the country must be treated well.
He said the people were managing very well before they gave up their properties for the Moragahakanda reservoir.

My Life is Like a Movie Starring Librarians!
A couple years ago I went out with a friend to a bar in downtown Orlando. I will not name this place because its truly embarrassing and also closed now, but I will tell you that we chose it because ladies drank free on Thursday nights and Im all about free drinks. While waiting for my beer at the ice bar (a BAR! Made of ICE!) my friend and I were approached by the owner and asked if wed like a tour. We dutifully followed him around as he pointed out all the new features hed implemented (did you see the ICE BAR) and after getting a couple more free drinks, he finally asked what we did for a living.
Im a librarian, I said.
Oh cool, he replied. I saw a library in a movie once.
Dewey decimal-themed
While this sentence became a long running joke for me and my friend (we developed a drinking game based on it; any time we could work saw it in a movie into a conversation the other person took a shot), I had to wonder if it was honestly the only time this man had experienced a library in his life. Had he never been inside one
And then I asked myself the bigger question: how many people only understand libraries from what theyve seen in pop culture
In the past, librarianship has been portrayed in television and books as something thats either very sexy or completely geeky. But now! Weve got slogans on t-shirts. Dewey decimal-themed socks. Bars and restaurants filled with barcoded books. Entire hotels where you can stay in a room themed after a place where we have to sometimes kick people out for sleeping (I never do this; please sleep wherever you like). Adding to the confusion of what exactly librarians do comes this new thing: a lot of people now think librarianship sounds kinda cool. Were smart and funny and we keep all the books. We can tell you how to fix your Netflix account and find the right tax forms. We know shit.
Were not superheroes, but we get the job done.
I mean, I get it. I drink my daily coffee out of a bright yellow KISS THE LIBRARIAN muga tribute to exceptional librarian Rupert Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There are a plethora of shows and movies that contribute to this powerful image. Librarians who time travel. Librarians who fight mummies. Librarians who utilize weaponry. Librarians with unlimited budgets (thats seriously the wildest concept of them all). On Parks and Recreation, the most fearsome foe of the parks department is the library division run by Tammy Swanson, a woman magnificently described as a manipulative, psychotic, library book-pedaling, sex-crazed she-demon. Tammy knows what she wants and she gets it. Also her library closes at 3pm, which is wild as hell considering lots of librarians end up working 40-plus hours a week.
A lot of people now think librarianship sounds kinda cool. Were smart and funny and we keep all the books. We can tell you how to fix your Netflix account and find the right tax forms. We know shit.
Unlimited access
Growing up, TV and movies certainly formed my opinion of libraries. I watched Matilda just like everybody else. Pervasive quiet Unlimited access to information Being left alone Hell yeah! I liked the idea of librarianship in terms of what it would bring meI related as the patron, not the librarian. Actually working in the field has meant reassessing what it means to work in a public profession. Its meant looking at libraries as bastions of community service, discovering what help I can bring to other people. I love these contemporary models of librarianship because they press the trope of active-versus-passive. Were not quiet, shushing, demure. Librarians are ready to fight for accessibility. To get you the information you need to succeed in every area of life. In a time when things in our country seem especially grim, librarianship makes me feel like I can contribute in a helpful, necessary way. It gives my life meaning.
Honestly, I need that kind of optimism right now, too. Its rough out there.

Nadal wins 11th French Open
Paris, Sunday: Rafael Nadal claimed an 11th French Open title on Sunday with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 demolition of Dominic Thiem despite a worrying injury scare in the closing stages of the final.
The 32-year-old world number one now has 17 Grand Slam titles, just three behind great rival Roger Federer.
Nadal endured a nervy conclusion to the final, however, when he needed treatment in the fourth game of the third set for a finger injury before sealing victory on a fifth match point when Thiem fired a backhand long.
"It's really incredible. I played a great match against a great player," said Nadal.
"I had tough moment in the third set with cramps in my hand. I was very scared but that's sport -- it was very humid.
"To win 11 times here -- it's fantastic and not something I ever dreamed of."
Nadal joins Australia's Margaret Court as the only player to win 11 titles at the same major.
Victory also took Nadal's record at Roland Garros to 86 wins and just two losses. For Thiem, playing in his first Slam final, it was a tremendous letdown for a player who is the only man to have beaten the Spaniard on clay in the last two years.
With a celebrity audience -- including actors Hugh Grant and Tim Roth as well as French stars Marion Cotillard and Jean Dujardin -- watching, Nadal flew out of the blocks.
He reeled off the first six points for a 2-0 lead before Thiem settled and repaired the damage for 2-2.
The Austrian speared a 222 km/h ace just for good measure in the fourth game to save a break point. He saved another two in the 11-minute sixth game, a performance cheered by the crowd who briefly became more animated when glum-looking French football icon Zinedine Zidane was spotted in the stadium.
Despite matching Nadal forehand for forehand, Thiem was undone in the 10th game when three errors handed Nadal the opening set after 52 minutes on court. A wild, misguided forehand sealed his fate, one of 18 unforced errors to Nadal's 12 in the set.
In their previous nine meetings, all on clay, the man who took the opening set went on to win the match. That scenario loomed again with Nadal going to 2-0 in the second set on a fifth break point as Thiem fired another backhand wide. Thiem wasted a break point in the seventh game as Nadal collected a time violation for taking too long to serve.
The world number one saved it and went on to secure a two sets lead when yet another backhand from the Austrian drifted wide. Thiem was under the cosh, saving four break points in the first game of the third set before Nadal inevitably broke for 2-1. Bizarrely, Nadal then halted playing in the fourth game complaining of pain in his left hand and stretching his middle finger.
He still won the game anyway before summoning the doctor and trainer courtside.
Whatever the problem, his dominance remained and a love game took him to 4-2 before he eventially sealed victory on a fifth match point when the Austrian fired another backhand long. AFP

New non-invasive ultrasound test to detect Prostrate cancer
As cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue, shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour and show up on a scan.
The Dundee University-based team says it has used a kind of ultrasound called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours accurately. The method is non-invasive and cheaper than current diagnostic techniques.
The new method aims to get round present problems by mapping the prostate with ultrasound. As cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue, shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour and show up on a scan.
We have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as MRI, said the Dundee teams leader Professor Ghulam Nabi.
The technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal.
We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. This is a significant step.
The pilot study involved around 200 patients. Prof Nabi added: Now we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer.
SWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases. However, to convert it to examine prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed.
The technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers, while also ruling out those who do not have cancer, said Simon Grieveson, head of research funding at Prostate Cancer UK, which funded the Dundee project with support from the Movember Foundation.
He added: With an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the UK, the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever.
In the past few years a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease.
They include Sir Michael Parkinson, Sir Ian McKellen and most recently Stephen Fry , the comedian who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour. Fry said: This breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence.
It is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging.

Oldest cat in the world celebrates 30th birthday
Meet Rubble, a cat from Exeter, England, that is now being called the oldest cat in the world after recently celebrating his 30th birthday.
Rubble and his owner, Michele Foster, have been the very best of friends since she got him as a kitten on her 20th birthday, back in May 1988.
Michele believes that the secret to Rubbles longevity is the fact that she pampers him as if he were a child, she never had children of her own so Rubble is positively showered with attention and care. Hes a lovely cat, although he has got a little grumpy in his old age, she said.
He has plenty of life left in him yet, but I dont think we will go down the Guinness World Record route as I am not sure he would like lots of people coming to see him or a fuss being made out of him.He is old now and would not like too much attention or be hassled. We would prefer if he was just left to live out his old age in peace.
The oldest cat who ever lived, according to the record books, is Creme Puff, who was born on August 3, 1967, and lived until August 6, 2005, an incredible 38 years and three days!
Rubble has some way to go before breaking that particular record, but Michele is very proud of his achievement. She remembers her 20th birthday, the day they first met, quite clearly. He was part of a litter of cats that my sisters friend had, and I had just left home, she explained. I was lonely living on my own so got him in as a kitten. He is very loyal. We used to live in London and moved around a lot. If you care about something and someone and really love them, that goes a long way. I have always treated him like a child  I dont have any children and had another cat called Meg  who passed at the age of 25. If you care about something, no matter what it is, it does last.
Understandably, due to his advanced age, Rubble suffers from high blood pressure. He needs regular medication, which he gets from Shaun Moore of City Vets. We recently had this amazing cat in for a check up and to celebrate his 30th birthday, he said. Rubble is quite likely to be the oldest cat in the UK and is still going strong. He is on medication for his blood pressure but apart from that, he is in remarkably good health. He enjoyed a free check up, some Whiskas Catmilk and Felix pouches, and less appreciated a free supply of medication for the next month as his birthday present from City Vets.
While we are sure Rubble appreciated the treats, if not the medication, we can only salute his achievement and wish him continuing good health.

Pocock stars in winning Wallabies return over Irish
BRISBANE June10 : Flanker David Pocock said Sunday he never doubted he would be off the pace in his return to international rugby after his dominant performance in the Wallabies win over Ireland in Brisbane.
Pocock, playing in his first Test in 18 months, scored the match-clinching try in Australias 18-9 win to end the Six Nations champions unbeaten 12-Test run on Saturday.
The Wallabies flanker seamlessly picked up where he left off in the wake of his 12-month sabbatical spent mainly in the country of his birth Zimbabwe.
Pocock, 30, was a part of a dynamic back-row performance with skipper Michael Hooper and Caleb Timu that laid the platform for the Wallabies 11th consecutive home Test win over the Irish stretching back to 1979.
He never doubted his ability to bounce back to his best in the Test arena, despite spending so long away from the Wallabies.
Its one of those things you dont think too much about, Pocock told reporters.
You just back yourself and know that if you are doing all your prep, the physical and mental stuff, youll get back to your best.
As a rugby player you always want to be chasing that improvement and pushing the boundaries of what youre capable of as a player.
Most guys certainly dont feel theyre at their best -- theres always that little bit more youre trying to get out of yourself.
Pocock was granted temporary leave from Wallabies and Super Rugby duties last year to pursue interests outside of rugby, only returning for the ACT Brumbies this season. He spent much of his time in Africa focusing on animal conservation, agriculture and embracing his Zimbabwean roots.
There was a fair bit going on over there; it was certainly a break but you thought about it (rugby) from time to time, he said.
You think about what an incredible opportunity it is to represent Australia; as an immigrant Im so grateful of the opportunities Ive had.

Power of a speech
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has intervened to bring sense to the debate created by the recent speech of the President. One Maha Nayaka Thera has said it is very sensible the way Prime Minister advised his followers. The best possible response under the circumstances. Apparently he had told the partys ministers and MPs not to respond to the President but should resolve the problems faced by the people.
As a liberal he is governed by empirical and pragmatic vision. One analyst said Thats the wisdom of a man who understands the gravity of the situation faced by the Government and by his party. It is an acknowledgment of failure; hes essentially saying we havent solved the problems of the party and exchanging barbs with the President is not going to boost our chances at the next election.
The problem is that Yahapalanaya has not satisfied the expectation of the people who put them to power. For that neither President nor Prime Minister can pass the buck to the other. In all this Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has more to lose than President Sirisena.
Sinhala Only agitation
Actually President Maithripala Sirisena made a fine speech. It was a surprise to many though it is not. I would say it is well prepared and it is well grinded populist speech. Sarcasm created is well in the tradition of Bandaranaike. SWRD also made such speeches suitable to the occasion. In that period, first he roused the crowd with ardent Sinhala Only agitation, then truly to balance by defending devolution with sober thinking. That was after Bandaranaike-Chelva Pact.
100-Day Programme
Finally it was a failure; because his rule was discredited by the 57 riots followed then by state repression. Thereafter, with the elapse of some tense period, Bandaranaike senior was knocked down by a monk who complained about Bandaranaike for his betrayal of Sinhala Only promises. In his speech made recently the President said that he didnt know who drafted the 100-Day Programme. He, with a pleasant smile hinted that Ranil Wickremesinghe had without his knowledge, asked the Air Force Commander to release helicopters to transport Mahinda Rajapaksa (who had lost the presidential election the previous day) to Hambantota.
In that delivery President also made a stern comment on media responsibility, of course with a knowing humble smile. Again he surprised everybody a few days later by proclaiming that he would not hesitate to ban social media if theres no self-regulation.
These statements raise interesting questions. He is in fact claiming that he was a presidential candidate, who participated in all discussions that took place with all Yahapalanaya -common front leaders, has no clue who drafted the key programmatic content of his manifesto. I can remember well, President Sirisena participating seriously in all discussions that concluded before elections.
Clearly it shows like SWRD, President Sirisena too wants to play a Bonapartist role by balancing above contending forces. Can this smaller actor compared to either Napoleon or Bismarck achieve more than Bandaranaike, to bypass both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe and resolve the Tamil national problem with the principal of equality alone
On the other hand the statement regarding social media is not just a joke. The warning is directed at social media but it demonstrates scant regard for the freedom of expression and a willingness to throw babies along with the bathwater among other things. Of course it does not make him a sinister President, following the example of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Yahapalanaya political campaign
In the midst of all this, President Sirisena, speaking at same speech commemorating the late Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, said that the Venerable Thera had not wanted the Central Bank robbed, a clear reference to the Bond scam issue and another hint at the complicity of his Yahapalanaya partner, Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is very interesting. When they made accusations against Wickremesinghe in the first place, I said that if he has raised a fund by this means it should be for a valid political reason, hence he should be absolved as end justifies the means. Many contested this moral principle. Today it is exposed 118 politicians have been given money for the political campaign of Yahapalanaya against fascistic politics of the combine opposition. Unfortunately the setback of Yahapalanaya in the last local government shows that money has not been used properly, or money did not come in time.

Rat fever on the rise
HPB Director Dr. Palihawadana informs the public that all information about Leptospirosis, about the drug used to prevent it (Doxycycline) and other details can be obtained by dialing the hot line 0710107107. The service is free of charge and available during 24 hours. Well qualified doctors and Consultants will reply all inquiries.
Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) warns the public on possible outbreak of Rat Fever (Letospirosis) in the flood affected areas. The public should be vigilant on any type of fever. Around 1400 Leptospirosis patients have already been reported from all over the country since January this year.
According to the Epidemiologists, vulnerable people such as farmers, persons who clean drains, persons who work in mines, marsh lands, canals and persons who swim or play in contaminated water should contact the nearest PHI or MOH office and obtain Doxycycline tablets free of charge and they should take two tablets before they start their work. They should drink plenty of water while working. The tablets give around 90 percent protection for a period
of one week. Then they should take two tablets again after they finish their work.
The public should avoid contaminated water such as flood water. Paddy fields and places with still water should be kept clean without garbage. The persons who have cuts and wounds (open injuries) in their legs should cover them properly before stepping into paddy fields. The persons engaged in paddy cultivation are advised to keep the area around the paddy fields clean, ensure the existing water is flushed prior to cultivation and the Niyara is kept narrow and free of rat burrows.
The main symptoms of rat fever are abrupt onset of high fever, mild flu, chills, conjunctival suffusion, muscle tenderness (notable in calf and lumber areas), intense headache, jaundice area and decrease of passing urine. The symptoms arise after 5 to 14 days of infection.
It is very important to seek medical treatment as early as possible from a Government hospital without applying home remedies.
The disease can be completely cured if medical treatment given on time but it is difficult to save the life of a patient who seeks medical treatment when the disease comes to later stages where renal failure, heart failure and other symptoms appear.
Wild rats who live in open environment are more dangerous than the domestic rats. Rat Fever is an infectious disease caused by pathogenic bacteria and lives in the kidneys of animals such as rats, pigs, cattle, rodents, canines and wild mammals. It comes to soil, water or food through their urine and enters into human body through cuts, wounds, nasal, oral, eye or mucous membranes. The bacteria live in the environment over a period of one month.

Rights, Justice and Development
The UN Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted on December 4, 1986, defines development as an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were born at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The 2030 Agenda is explicitly grounded in international human rights treaties. The commitment to human rights is further reflected in the general principle of non-discrimination and the aim to leave no one behind.
Human rights are further reflected throughout the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets. Human rights offer guidance for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, while the SDGs can contribute substantially to the realization of human rights. This call for justice to promote safe and peaceful societies and strong institutions is now embodied in Goal 16: Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies. Goal 16 is the key to ensuring that progress and prosperity are widely shared, and that those most in need can claim and exercise their rights as global citizens. Taken together, justice, rule of law and accountable and inclusive institutions are the linchpin of shared social progress and our ability to realize human flourishing.
The challenge
The challenge is to link human rights concerns of citizens, Justice and Development as Rights to be claimed. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda along with the SDGs provide an excellent platform for elevating the right to development (RTD) to a higher threshold in policy making and research, and thereby enhancing its impact in development practice. It also presents a significant impetus in terms of operationalizing this right in the implementation of the SDGs, with a view to realizing both the RTD and the SDGs in a mutually reinforcing manner.
Imagine
In every province every unaccompanied senior is cared at home, every person with special needs is assisted, every single parenting person has access to cheap credit and means to earn a living, the homeless poor are supported, we monitor air quality and proactively act, water security is a national priority, all classified as poor have access to Samurdhi Bank Loans, we ensure any and every person in need is never left behind. This is hardly difficult. It only requires a commitment to care.

Why and how in Sri Lanka
* Sri Lanka consists of varying types of communities, religions, cultural and traditional systems; and survivors of conflict, disaster, and the longer disparities generated from persistent poverty and vulnerability. There are calls for more concerted and broader efforts to reach those whom are vulnerable and may not be able to express themselves because of this vulnerability.
* Survivors of violence due to civil strife in the past, vulnerable and single parent families, differently abled persons, persons disposed of lands, persons whose narratives are recorded in Reports of Commissions of Inquiry requiring further action, women and children, senior citizens persons in poverty and those acutely suffering indebtedness and areas and persons at risk due to natural disasters are all in need of assistance.
* Concepts of development as notions of Rights and Justice are not necessarily fully understood by very many duty bearers. There is a surfeit of human resources within Government including several categories of development officers serving in the Districts. They need to be aligned and alive to the need to deliver services which foster development as a right of citizens.
* Encouraging dialogue on the Right to Development at National reviews undertaken at regional level in order to promote dialogue between civic groups, Governments and other interested parties on the Right to Development and identify issues.
* Utilizing the SDGs and RTD framework localized and contextualized issues relevant to the regions with structured platforms whilst collecting local examples of solutions are helpful.
* Equipping advocates and claimants with the knowledge on how to claim these rights through regional networks and supporting stakeholder groups and responding direct to on behalf of citizens in need is the delivery mechanism.

Senanayakes death marks the passing of an era
The death of veteran author and teledrama scriptwriter Somaweera Senanayake at the age of 74, on Saturday, marked the passing of an era in the genre of the local teledrama, for which the master scriptwriter was best known.
After the introduction of television in Sri Lanka in the late 1970s, Senanayakes name was immortalised with such classics as Kandegedara, Doo Daruwo, Palingu Menike, Asal Wesiyo, and Yasho Raawaya. For the generations who were introduced to Sinhala television with these popular teledramas, his death marks the passing of an era.
Senanayake also wrote the scripts for classic films such as Mihidum Sihina and Ammawarune.
He was born in 1944 and had his primary education at a mixed junior school in Kudagama.
He received his secondary education at Seethawaka Central Colledge in Awissawella and Rajasinghe College in Ruwanwella.
Senanayake began contributing articles to newspapers and magazines while at secondary school.
He entered the Sri Jayewardenepura University, then called Vidyodaya University, in the beginning of the 1960s. After obtaining an Arts degree, he joined the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lake House) as a journalist. His maiden novel Yasho Raawaya, later transformed into a popular teledrama, won the State Awards in 1978.
Senanayake died at a private hospital in Colombo, while being treated for a heart ailment.

SLASSCOM to organise  IT/BPM week in Galle
As part of SLASSCOMs initiative to advocate the creation of regional cities and bring about inclusive growth to Sri Lanka, it is organising Galle IT/BPM Week on 22 June, 6th and 7th of July 2018 to build human capacity in the regional cities. Galle IT Week is the third of the SLASSCOM IT Week series where previous events were held in cities of Jaffna in year 2014 and Kandy in year 2016.
Together with SLASSCOM, Ministry of Education and ICTA has put forward a two-day Information Technology (IT) and Business Process Management (BPM) education mission to Galle. The program of this year will revolve around the theme of Inspiring the Next Generation of Creative Global Leaders and focuses on inspiring creativity through technology.
Primary objectives of 2018 IT/BPM Week in Galle are to encourage students to select ICT as a career for their future, to build awareness on the latest trends of ICT among educators and broaden the thinking of education ecosystem by inspiring innovations.
Galle IT/BPM Week is expected to help SLASSCOMs vision for 2022 and beyond which is aiming to increase revenue from the IT/BPM industry to US$5 billion and creating 200,000 strong direct employment workforce in the sector.
It is identified that 80 per cent of the workforce in IT/BPM comes from the regions but growth so far has been concentrated within the Western Province. The industry can operate from any location when the environment is conducive. SLASSCOM looked at certain key factors when identifying locations such as Kandy, Jaffna and Galle. There were access to resources such as universities, infrastructure and entrepreneurship.
Galle IT/BPM week is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Education (MoE). The initiative will consist of five programmes, each focusing on target audiences varying from principals, ICT teachers, school children, parents, and girl students.
A training program for 200 principals and ICT teachers will be held on 22nd of June. This half a day interactive workshop by the IT/BPM industry professionals is to raise awareness on latest trends on technology and innovation.
The workshop will also cover topics such as how entrepreneurship and startups may contribute to change the dynamics of the economy and the methodical ways to inspire and guide students to think creatively to come up with such new innovations.
On 6th July, there will be a student awareness program to inspire 2500+ young minds to select their future career path in IT/BPM field. Alongside the awareness session, students will visit an exhibition.

SLITHM offers 175 scholarships worth Rs. 5.5 mn
In a move to popularize careers in the hospitality industry among youth, the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management announced it would offer 175 full scholarships to deserving students across the country. Children of low income earners especially in rural areas stand to benefit from this pioneering initiative.
A ceremony was held at the SLITHM Auditorium in Colombo to present the first batch of scholarships to students from the Southern Province.
Director General of SLITHM, Buddhika Hewawasam said the total value of the scholarships is over Rs. 5.5 million and funds for this purpose would be channeled from the Tourism Development Levy and Embarkation Tax.
This is the first time since the institution was established in 1966 that scholarships are being offered to students for hospitality courses.
The scholarship will cover the cost of course fee, uniforms, accommodation and transport.
It is primarily targeted at children of families with an income of less than Rs. 10,000 who will qualify for a full scholarship while children of families earning over Rs. 10,000 and less than Rs. 25,000 will qualify for a half scholarship.
One of the main drawbacks faced by candidates aspiring for a career in hospitality is the inability to communicate in English. Having identified the problem we are in the process of setting up language training centers in various parts of the country. The first one has been already set up in Kuliyapitiya, Hewawasam said.
This is an effort to breakdown the barriers that prevent our youth from embarking on a career in hospitality, he said.
Tourism Minister John Amaratunga who presented the first scholarship to a student from Koggala noted that there was huge demand for well-trained hospitality personnel.
At present SLITHM trains over 6000 individuals in different aspects of the hospitality industry each year. However nearly 17,000 star class rooms are currently under construction and will be completed in the next three years. It has been estimated that 400,000 trained personnel will be required to work in Sri Lankas hospitality industry by year 2020, noted Minister Amaratunga.
Although there is a steady stream of applicants for the courses on offer, many of the youth especially in the rural areas where most hotels are located, shy away from it due to financial constraints. Having identified this issue SLITHM has stepped in to offer scholarships to capable students to enroll in various courses, he said.
With Sri Lanka Tourism committing to achieve 5 million tourists by 2025, a long-term strategic plan has identified measures for the implementation of best practices to ensure that the industry continues to grow in a sustainable manner, Amaratunga added.
Meanwhile SLITHM will conduct its 39th Graduation Ceremony today (11) at the Main Conference Hall of the BMICH in Colombo.

South Africa hold on for narrow come-from-behind test win
JOHANNESBURG, Saturday: South Africa began a new era for their rugby with a dramatic 42-39 victory over England in the first test at Ellis Park on Saturday, coming back after conceding three tries in a horrific opening 17-minute spell to go 1-0 ahead in the three-match series.
The Springboks, with their first-ever black captain in Siya Kolisi and a new coach in Rassie Erasmus, powered their way back with five tries of their own after falling 24-3 behind in the early exchanges of a high-scoring and action-packed encounter but had to hold on grimly at the end for their narrow victory.
Debutant winger Sbusiso Nkosi and Aphiwe Dyantyi scored three tries between them but it was the return to the side of English-based scrumhalf Faf de Klerk and fullback Willie le Roux that propelled the home side to victory while condemning England to a fourth successive test defeat after they lost their Six Nations crown earlier this year.
England got off to a dream start as they eased through a leaky home defence and saw Mike Brown, Elliott Daly and George Farrell all score in a blistering start.
Late tries from Maro Itoje and Jonny May allowed them to come close to snatching a win at the end.
Brown powered through two tackles for the opening score after just four minutes and then Daly and Farrell added two more tries as England leapt into a 21-point lead to stun the 55,000-strong crowd.
George Fords shuttle ball put Daly in untouched in the 13th minute and then a skip pass to Farrell allowed the England captain to ease his way through a porous backline four minutes later.
But England suddenly lost momentum as South Africa found their straps with De Klerk dictating the pace of play in a triumphant return to his former home ground.
Nkosis strong run at the England defence took the ball towards the line and De Klerk picked up the loose ball to stretch his arm over the line for a first reply in the 20th minute.
Nkosi then scored himself on the half-hour mark with a kick and chase as Daly missed the ball and the new Springbok wing touched down, with a large dollop of good fortune.
Four minutes afterwards, De Klerk kept front-foot ball going for the Boks and Nkosi went over on the other wing after a sharp inside pass from fellow debutant Dyantyi.
A rolling maul on the stroke of halftime provided the hosts with their first chance to take the lead, as De Klerk cleverly switched direction to space outside to see Le Roux to power over at speed.
A 29-27 lead at half-time was extended when Dyantyi went over, albeit almost fumbling the ball, in the 64th minute.
England finished the stronger of the sides as Itoje stretched over the ruck to reduce South Africas lead to 39-32 and then May ran though the home defence to leave the Boks three points ahead with one minute left.
But South Africa held on for a narrow win as they go into the next test in Bloemfontein next Saturday and the final game of the series at Newlands in Cape Town on June 23.

Sri Lanka targets to reach mine-free status by 2020

Sri Lanka is making steady progress towards the goal of mine free status and remains hopeful of completing mine action by 2020, Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez said.
Addressing the forum on individualized approach on the sidelines of the Inter-sessional Meeting of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention on Friday in Geneva, Ambassador Azeez recounted how Sri Lanka achieved success in what was considered a perilous task in 2009.
Ambassador Azeez highlighted Sri Lankas engagement in demining activity as one which had its own complexity and uniqueness. The National Policy on Reconciliation and Co-existence, in place in Sri Lanka since 2017, both underpinned and nourished the ongoing programs of peace building and development in the country, he stressed. The Ambassador said the tremendous amount of demining work that was done on the ground, paving the way for the release of lands and resettlement of affected persons, makes the case of Sri Lanka distinct from other situations that experienced similar challenges.
He said the Government of Sri Lanka committed substantial funds to sustain the program throughout the years, with adequate provision of human resources as well, leading to the capacity building, predictability and sustainability of operation, and consolidation of the gains made. Ambassador Azeez said while Sri Lanka makes steady progress towards the goal of mine free status by 2020, the country would also be able to share its knowledge and expertise with others who are engaged in mine action program in different regions.

Sri Lanka will be paradise of entrepreneurs by 2020: Mangala
The government launches a programme to create 100,000 entrepreneurs by 2020 to make the country a paradise of the entrepreneurs, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He was addressing a meeting held for State bank representatives for them to understand the Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme to be launched as envisaged with the budget proposals for 2018.
He said the government would introduce 16 loan schemes to provide the capital for the needy entrepreneurs. The loan schemes would be with easy terms unlike other loan schemes granted by State banks, he said. Over 100 State bank loan schemes would be reformed to achieve this end, the Minister said.
Rs. 5,250 million was allocated to propel the programme to be initiated on June 21. The Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme would be initiated under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH), Minister Samaraweera said.
The Minister said the programme will attract school leavers to make the country the paradise of the entrepreneurs. Those youths are deprived of tertiary education without their fault but due to the non-allocation of 6 per cent of GDP for education, Minister Samaraweera said.
The government will increase the allocation of 3 per cent up to 6 per cent by 2020, the Minister said. He said the government would create these 100,000 entrepreneurs especially from suburb and rural areas.
The women were granted sewing machines to initiate a self employment, Minister Samaraweera said.
The government has identified capabilities in women to be good entrepreneurs. We would grant a 10 per cent interest subsidy for the loan provided and 50 percent of those will be women, he said.
Minister Samaraweera said the 10 percent subsidy would be granted to the differently-able persons as well and requested the state bank representatives not to turn the people who come seeking the opportunity to become entrepreneurs empty-handed.

A tall tale
The activities surrounding the Al Aman Group and its subsidiary, the Al Aman World Capital Centre (WCC)the proposed tallest building in Asia, to be built in Colomboare rife with suspicion.
Al Aman signed a USD $2 billion agreement with Sri Lankas Board of Investment (BOI) on June 30, 2017 to build the super-skyscraper in Colombo.
The alarm bells sounded early. Al Aman bills itself a globally renowned chain with its operations spread across the world. However, investigations by the Daily News found that there are no records of Al Aman offices outside of Sri Lanka except for one in the United Arab Emirates, with a phone number that is out of service. The investment into Sri Lanka is billed as a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). However, the groups head office is located in Sri Lanka.
Repeated attempts found no projects that have been completed by the group. All future projects of the subsidiary, Al Aman WCC, are listed within Sri Lanka, despite the company boasting of an international portfolio. These projects include Aman 101-Royal Empire and Aman Royal Island, both to be built in the north of Sri Lanka, in addition to the proposed World Capital Centre.
The Group boasts ownership of seven other companies in addition to the Al Aman WCC, including a consultancy and a media corporation. However, none of these companies exist with any sort of paper or digital trail except on a single website, www.alamangroups.com, which is seemingly a hurried construct.
On that website, Al Aman presents contradictory claims: that its business has been around for five generations, and that it was founded in 2001. Already confounding, a search of the history of Al Aman World Capital Centre (WCC) Ltd. reveals that it was not incorporated until 6 October 2015. And these same records reveal the company was dissolved earlier this year, on 14 March 2017.
When the Daily News revealed this to Board of Investment Chairman Upul Jayasuriya, he said this was the first time he was hearing of the discrepancy with the dates. The Daily News is yet to confirm if the holding company or any other of it subsidiaries are registered in Sri Lanka, the location of its head office.
The inconsistencies continue. The Al Aman Group earlier claimed the architect for the WCC project to be the Kuala Lumpur branch of international firm RSP. However, speaking to the Daily News, Emily Cheng, Manager of Public Relations and Communications for RSP-KL, said, As far as Im aware, we are not and have never been the architects for this project, contradicting claims by the Al Aman Group. When asked about this, Mr. Jayasuriya said he was unaware that RSP-KL was never involved
The proposed location of the WCC is also questionable. Al Aman has repeatedly, in responses from its verified accounts to inquiries on social media, claimed that WCC will be based in Colombo 2; in its press releases, however, Al Aman has stated that a location for the super-skyscraper is yet to be determined. But when the Daily News contacted the Colombo office of Al Aman, a spokeswoman who would not reveal her name said the location has already been identified, and gave a precise address in Colombo 4: No. 60 Davidson Road. This space is currently occupied by a UAE-based technology company, which told the Daily News in a phone interview that it has no plans to evacaute the premises. Asked when construction would begin, the same Al Aman spokeswoman responded, Next month, even though Al Aman has only brought in US $2 million of the US $200 million required for the BOI not to terminate the project, according to the Board of Investment (BoI) of Sri Lanka.
Then there are the forged photos Al Aman has been using to publicize and promote the construction of the WCC. All over its social media accounts and website are graphics with text overlays containing promises of amenities and features the WCC will have. But investigations by the Daily News revealed that the photographs in the graphics have all been plagiarized or borrowed from elsewhere. The photo of its individual indoor car park is from The Landseer, a residential development in London. Its spa is that of the Pangkor Laut Resort in Malaysia. Its pool is from an underground doomsday-themed bunker hotel in Germany.
Even the photos it uses to forecast what the city's skyline will look like once the WCC is built are plagiarizednot images of Colombo but of Bangkok and Dubai. A real estate expert in Colombo emphasized that any real project close to the proposed scale of the WCC would be creating its own mockups to attract investors rather than forging them.
The claims made by the company regarding the proposed construction are also suspect. At various instances, Al Aman has insisted that the WCC will be the ninth, seventh, fifth, and third tallest building in the world upon completion. No building that the Daily News is aware of can occupy all those titles at once. Al Aman representatives also boast that the WCC will possess a ten-star hotel, a classification which currently does not exist, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant, a classification which cannot be guaranteed.
Perhaps most concerning is a letter the Daily News discovered during the course of our investigations, a photograph of which is attached in full: purportedly signed by the former Maldivian Minister of Finance and Treasury and current Vice President, Abdulla Jihad, to the Al Aman Group, it grants the company permission to import and export money from the Maldives without any explicit restriction. In the letter, addressed to WCC's Managing Director Mohamed Imran Saleem and signed 8 December 2015 (just two months after the Al Aman Capital Group Ltd. was incorporated), then Minister Jihad wrote:
There are no restrictions of any kind whatsoever on either the inward shipment of monies or the outward remittance of foreign currency... We further confirm the guarantee that monies shipped to Republic of Maldives will be under strict secrecy and the Maldives National Defense Fund will provide all necessary security; no information will be disclosed to any foreign governments or agencies.
The Daily News could find no projects under the Al Aman Group or its holding companies in the Maldives. Foreign governments and agencies include Sri Lanka's and its BOI.
In an interview, the Daily News asked BOI Chairman Jayasuriya if he was concerned about the letter, which ostensibly allows the Al Aman Group to export to the Maldives any money it brings into Sri Lanka for investment in the WCC projectwhich is currently BOI-certifiedand shelter it, indefinitely, in secret. He responded, as he did repeatedly throughout the interview, that the BOI had to give Al Aman the benefit of the doubt.
When the Daily News asked Jayasuriya if he was concerned that a fraudulent project endorsed by the BOI via a USD $2.4 billion signing agreement could jeopardize the country's ability to attract future FDI, he responded, The best that we can do it just to wait and see."
And when asked if any action would be taken against Al Aman for the fraudulent and shady claims it has made thus far, Jayasuriya responded, Not now. We have to wait to see if they can bring in the money.

limited over final played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday. Winning the toss and batting first Galle posted a challenging score of 320-7 in 50 overs with another Sri Lankan batsman Sadeera Samarawickrama contributing an attractive 62 off 71 balls and sharing a second wicket stand of 125 with Tharanga. Spinner Lakshan Sandakan was the pick of the Colombo bowlers ending up with four wickets although being on the expensive side conceding 66 runs off his 10 overs.
Colombo began on a positive note with opener Shehan Jayasuriya contributing an aggressive half century off 40 balls (9 fours) but could not sustain the required run rate as wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals. They were finally dismissed for 245 in the 45th over with left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara and off-spinner Nishan Peiris finishing with three wickets apiece.

Think positive, enjoy your profession
None would like a leader, who runs around like a headless chicken when panic and unease spread like a wild fire in their working environment, making it tough for anyone to focus. Best leaders stay calm and refrain from showing any cracks that appear. This is exactly how Varuni Amunugama Fernando appears  serene on the surface and wrapped in simplicity.
The Creative Head of Triad (Pvt) Ltd, Fernando is also its Co-Founder and serves as the Joint Managing Director. She is an Attorney-at-Law and LLB graduate from the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo and has countless years of experience in the field of advertising. Together with Dilith Jayaweera who is also a lawyer by profession, Fernando set up Triad Advertising in 1993 with a team of just three people and steered it to be the most awarded indigenous advertising agency in Sri Lanka.
I always believed in that ethos that Sri Lankan can be successful. We can create value for the country. At the beginning I had team of inspirational people who worked together as partners. We took the leadership and redefined the landscape completely in local communication industry, Fernando said.
Over the years Triad has evolved from just creative advertising to providing its clients with creative solutions to overcome their business issues. Over two decades, Team Triad has grown to over 100 and the agency has transformed into a fully integrated total communications solutions provider through the strength of its subsidiaries. We are a unique company who have not taken a single dividend but have pursued a backward integration strategy, establishing many subsidiaries, she added.
The agency has since then enjoyed local and global recognition. In Sri Lanka, Triad rose to supremacy when it bagged six awards, including three Golds, at the industry acclaimed Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing Awards (SLIM Awards) in 2004 followed by 21 awards at SLIM 2005, including Best TV Commercial of the Year. 2006 saw the advent of the Chillies, the newly launched industry ad awards. Triad shot itself to the highest echelons of the industry and cemented its position as the local agency that best understood the local consumer by emerging the first at three consecutive award shows. The focus on real strategies that solve real problems has seen the agency become one of the most awarded at the Sri Lankan Effies for effectiveness is advertising. Triads foremost international recognition came in 2008, when it was awarded a Bronze at the Asia Pacific advertising awards  AdFest 2008. In 2009, Triad was nominated for a Cannes award while also netting three USA-based Hermes Awards. Sometimes it is hard to think how a woman can be behind all this success.
Ambition fueled by right ethics and financial discipline can pave way to such success. Today we see more and more women are establishing their own careers. Our economy is now independent. Women have emerged as decision makers of the country and have created equally strong partnerships. Women at present have a say in their life. Parents understand that the society has evolved and that their girl child no longer belongs in the kitchen but they can conquer their dreams, Fernando explained.
She says that a woman by nature is more artistic and scientific. Women possess soft skills. They are passionate about what they do. They can express creativity be it fashion, interior designing, teaching, nursing care, banking or engineering.
Commenting on women entering politics Fernando pronounced that it is a good opportunity for younger politicians to have view of what they say. The young set both men and women have to come into the framework. I see only a very few politicians who have made a statement but the majority is unpatriotic and have improved themselves instead of the country. Little by little this layer has to move out. The dynamic young politicians should be exposed. They have new ideas and a new thinking. They are digitally savvy and I believe is the only hope for the country. Change in politics is a good thing, she commented.
Fernando says to women of all ages that it is fortunate to be born a woman. Being born a woman is a blessing and an advantage. We should switch our mindset and not underestimate a woman. Unlike in Western countries where women has to fight for equal rights, here in Sri Lanka a mother is the center of the family. She is the most respected. She is superior in certain aspects and is benevolent manipulator. She has the ability to use these skills for the betterment of the family and the country.
However a woman should always respect her spouse. If you are a career woman you should plan your day and never neglect the needs of the family. Family comes before the career, she explained.
She advised women to think positive and enjoy doing whatever the profession they are involved in. At present there is an opportunity for every woman to be an entrepreneur. Even the stay at home mother can create her own brand of jewellery and market your product online around the world. While you do something that you enjoy, you will be financially rewarded, she said.
Finally addressing young career girls she said never delay to enter motherhood because of the career. All women are created to be mothers, creating another human life is something someone can be proud of. I strongly believe work life and family life should be well balanced. The smart girl knows how to do it with self-discipline and self-regulation, Fernando concluded.

China, Russia, India in SCO summit
Trump sneaks out of G7 summit
The start of two major geo-political summits this past weekend, at the opposite ends of the Earth, dramatically demonstrates how much the global power balance has changed from that of a world dominated by a bloc of Western-led capitalist powers to a world of several power blocs of varying geo-political punch. The Group of 7 (G7) top capitalist countries of the old Western-led power bloc met in La Malbaie, Canada, while the newer 8-member Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), the worlds largest regional bloc in terms of population, held its summit in the Chinese port city of Qingdao.
At one time the G7  briefly G8 before Russia was booted out for annexing the Crimean Peninsula from neighbour Ukraine  represented the bloc of richest and most powerful economies. Not so any more. When the Shanghai Security Organisation (SCO) was initiated by rising China over a decade ago, the six Asian and Eurasian powers it brought together were relatively small fry. But the SCOs 18th summit under way in Qingdao now groups eight emerging capitalist powers notable for their huge population, global economic punch and growing military-strategic consensus.
The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They are seven of the largest advanced economies in the world, representing 62% of the global net wealth (US$ 280 trillion) but just 32% of the global GDP based.
The SCO bloc may not group the worlds richest societies, but, today, is potentially, the single largest, geographically unified, market. It brings together China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, comprising the worlds biggest population concentration, some of biggest armed forces and nuclear military capability and, is led by the worlds second largest economy, China.
US and the other G7 countries
Still, world news media focussed on the gathering of the old Western-led power bloc in Canada expecting fireworks between the US and the other G7 countries. The other G7 leaders are known to be incensed over the US recent unilateralist undermining of trade among these same countries (sudden and massive trade tariff hikes on steel and aluminium) and, withdrawal from crucial Western-initiated pacts on climate change and Irans nuclear weaponisation.
But Donald Trump, president of the United States of America, the country that, till recently, was regarded as the leader of the G7, left the meeting venue on Saturday, mid-way in the summit, further driving home these changes in global power dynamics. So the US leader missed most of the summit talks on key world issues such as climate change, world economy, security issues. Apparently he had briefly attended a session on Friday on gender equality issues before returning to Washington. Trump interested in gender equality!!
The White House officially claims that Trump had to leave early ostensibly to prepare for tomorrows up-coming US-North Korea summit. But most commentators the world over, including American ones, acknowledge that the American president is isolated among the G7 leaders for his confrontational foreign policies much of it subverting close ties with these same G7 partners.
The perception across the world is that Trump cannot face the other G7 leaders due to his shock moves undermining trade within that power bloc itself and leaving key pacts on climate change and Iranian nuclear armaments control. In fact, European news media reported that some of the European leaders attending the G7 summit were already privately discussion a possible G6 grouping minus the maverick US.
While the old Western power bloc is in disarray, the gathering of forces in the East, in Qingdao, heralds new geo-political power configurations which, in terms of world peace and stability, are most welcome. After all, the G7, at one time, represented the kind of unipolar dominance that has enabled chaotic geo-political management with numerous wars currently under way in various parts of the world largely arising from forceful interventions by this power bloc. Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, are all highly unstable and war torn states today due to such interventions.
The rise of other power blocs, wielding diverse leverage  combining geo-strategic location with military capability, multilateral collaboration, and sheer economic punch  is now clearly modulating the behaviour of the old Western bloc and will do so much more in the future.
Iran nuclear pact
As it is, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Qingdao ahead of the SCO summit for talks with Chinese President Xi Jin-ping, as did Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Irans leader, will certainly discuss possibilities of China (and other SCO partners) helping Iran out of a possible new economic quagmire if Americas latest economic and political sanctions offensive against Tehran does result in the collapse of the Iran nuclear pact. Rouhani will also use the SCO summit to negotiate similar support from the other SCO partners.
Hence, the once dominant US attempt to bully Iran into geo-political submission may not fully work out the way hoped for by Donald Trump and the Washington hawks such as National Security Adviser John Bolton.
In Qingdao, Russia and China will certainly discuss the disarray in the G7 and the geo-political space opened up for other countries and blocs to strategise to survive and manage global dynamics free of Western bullying. They will also assess the potentials  or, likely, lack of potential  of this weeks expected summit between North Koreas Kim Jong-Un and the US Donald Trump.
Some of the Western news media likes to portray next Tuesdays Kim-Trump summit in Singapore as a kind of game changer vis--vis North Koreas nuclear arsenal. But most analysts across the world do not expect much more than some photo opportunities and flamboyant words between these two leaders both of whom are known for bombast.
The impending summit (unless Trump or Kim chooses a dramatic withdrawal at the last minute  to hide potential talks failure) is not seen by most analysts as one that will genuinely lead the way to the de-nuclearisation of North Korea as the West wishes. Even in the US, the more rational commentators have long given up such a possibility.
It is already recognised by most commentators that Pyongyang moved toward negotiations only after it had achieved its goal of nuclear weaponisation as well as long range warhead delivery capability. It is NOT the result of US or Western sanctions pressure as claimed by Trump and his admirers. As the North Korean leader himself has publicly stated, their offer for talks has been made AFTER Pyongyang had concretely demonstrated its nuclear weaponisation progress with successful atomic tests and rocket test launches.
Even if the Singapore summit does not deliver any firm commitment towards nuclear disarmament, Kim will have achieved much more than what Trump stands to achieve. Trump will make history with a first ever meeting between a North Korean and US leader. But Kim will have achieved considerably political legitimacy by this exercise.
Big deal
The Americans, many of whom want to see this summit as an US success are missing the point: why should it be a big deal for the worlds most powerful state to hold a meeting with the leader of a minor state, which, in real terms, is hardly a military or economic threat to the US By making such a big deal over the Kim-Trump summit, America is actually stooping low to please a very independent-minded country which continues to thumb its nose at the worlds sole superpower. It is a further dilution of the sway that America holds over the world.
The truth of Trumps trip to Singapore is entirely to do with his personal vanity and showmanship as well as his Republican Partys hopes to sustain its core vote banks with a strong dose of American pseudo-triumphalism.
Meanwhile, other ugly truths about the Trump presidency continue to emerge. Trumps former election campaign chairman Paul Manafort now faces loss of bail and the prospect of FBI detention in the on-going FBI investigation into Russian subversion of the 2016 presidential elections and the possible collusion between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow. And, yet another Russian is being charged in this massive special probe, biggest ever such investigation in the FBIs history.
Trumps histrionics over the G7 summit and the Kim summit are partly to overcome the shame and distract from possible criminality of the Russia scandal, as well as his past sexual intrigues with multiple illicit consorts.

Tummy trouble Have a mango
Mangoes are better at relieving digestive problems than many high-fibre foods, a study has found. The fruit, which contains both fibre and nutrients called polyphenols, is said to treat constipation and gut inflammation more effectively than an equivalent amount of fibre powder.
One in five adults is thought to suffer from a long-term digestive condition.
For the four-week study, 36 men and women with chronic constipation were divided into two groups: one given a daily dose of 300 grams of mango, or roughly one fruit, the other an equivalent amount of fibre supplement.
Aside from this, their diet was kept constant for calories, carbohydrates, fibre, protein and fat. At the end of the month, both groups showed reduced constipation but mangoes were found to be more effective at easing symptoms than fibre alone.
The fruit also helped improve the make-up of bacteria in the gut and reduced inflammation.
Co-author Professor Susanne Mertens-Talcott, of Texas A&M University, said fibre supplements and laxatives could effectively treat constipation but do not address other symptoms such as inflammation.
She added: Our findings suggest mango offers an advantage over fibre supplement. The study appears in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research.

Two underworld figures killed in shootout with STF
Two underworld gang members were killed in a shootout with the Police Special Task Force (STF) in Madawala, Katugastota in Kandy on Saturday.
According to the Police, they were close associates of two wanted underworld gang leaders, Madush and Angoda Lokka, who are said to be residing abroad.
The two gang members are said to have carried out many criminal acts acting on the instructions of Madush and Angoda Lokka.
The suspects who were killed during the shootout have been identified as 30-year old Rumalsha Iresh Madushanka alias Baila and Polwattage Upali alias Jana according to the Police.
The Police were on the alert about the suspects after coming to know that the duo were coordinating criminal activities from a hideout in the Kandy area.
The Police Special Task Force had placed road blocks in the Madawala area after coming to know that the duo were travelling in a vehicle from Katugastota towards Madawala.
When the Police stopped a vehicle for inspection, the duo who were inside had opened fire at the Police officers and a shootout had ensued with the Police retaliating.
According to the Police, the gang members who were killed during the shootout are suspects in several ongoing court cases related to murder, ransom, drug trafficking and assault.
The Police had seized two firearms which were in the possession of the suspects.

UNP, SLFP to resolve issues and take Govt. forward - Duminda
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) are attempting to resolve the issues within the Unity Government via discussions, SLFP National Organiser, Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The Minister said discussions are being headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to resolve issues and take the National Government forward.
Both parties were discussing on how to build and maintain trust in going forward, the Minister added.
Speaking to journalists following an event in Rajanganaya, Anuradhapura, Minister Dissanayake stated contrary to views expressed by some SLFP members, there were no discussions during the recent SLFP Central Committee(CC) meeting about the party trying to quit the Unity Government.
Dissanayake said during the first CC meeting following the appointment of a set of temporary office bearers, the SLFP had mainly discussed about party reforms.
The Minister also said the party had discussed about the JVPs 20th Amendment to the Constitution and a decision was made to appoint a committee to study it.
Dissanayake further said that he believed President Maithripala Sirisena should be the SLFPs candidate at the next Presidential election.
The President has said he would contest only once, but I think he can once again galvanise all forces which supported him. We should end hate politics and the President can do it, Minister Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake said some within the party are criticizing him for the role he is playing and added that he had come out with the President to defeat the Rajapaksa regime at the last Presidential polls, and would continue to support the President and the Unity Government in the future as well.

West Indies crush Sri Lanka by 226-runs in first Test
Port of Spain, Sunday: West Indies completed a crushing 226-run victory over Sri Lanka just after lunch on the final day of the first Test on Sunday as the tourists surrendered meekly following the demise of century-maker Kusal Mendis and captain Dinesh Chandimal.
Set a daunting target of 453, the Sri Lankans crashed from 189 for three in mid-morning to be dismissed for 226 just after lunch, suffering their first Test match defeat at the hands of the Caribbean side for ten years, when they were also beaten at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad.
Off-spinning all-rounder Roston Chase triggered the final capitulation in which five wickets fell for just eight runs.
His dismissal of Chandimal in the last over before the lunch interval broke the back of the tourists resistance and he claimed three of the remaining four wickets to fall to finish with the impressive figures of four for 15 off 8.2 overs.
It looked so much better for Sri Lanka when Mendis, 94 not out overnight with Sri Lanka on 176 for three, reached his fifth Test century shortly after the start of the days play.
However any hope of the visitors seriously challenging a world record target effectively evaporated with his dismissal, caught behind for 102 off fast bowler Shannon Gabriel.
Even the prospects of saving the match or at the very least taking the game into the final session disappeared with the loss of three more wickets before the break, including two off the final over bowled by Chase. Stubborn nightwatchman Lahiru Gamage had fallen LBW to leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo for just three after more than an hours resistance but the death knell was really sounded for the Sri Lankans when Chase accounted for both Chandimal and Niroshan Dickwella in the space of five deliveries.
Chandimal was forced to curtail his innings on Saturday afternoon when on 15 because he was feeling unwell. He resumed after the fall of Mendis and showed no signs of further discomfort in getting to 27 until a flighted delivery from Chase tempted him into attempting to heave over midwicket only for the miscue to offer a simple catch to Kraigg Brathwaite running around to short mid-on. It was hardly the sort of example he would have wanted to set as Sri Lankas captain.
Within minutes he was joined by Dickwella in the dressing room as the wicketkeeper-batsman was trapped palpably leg-before by a quicker delivery from Chase.
"I think our fielding was below par in the first innings when we dropped some important catches, said Chandimal in reflecting on his teams disappointing overall performance.
We need to learn from our mistakes and regroup quickly for the next match. Sri Lanka expect to welcome back middle-order batsman Dhananjaya de Silva for the second Test starting Thursday in St Lucia. His arrival in the region was delayed by the shooting death of his father.
West Indies were in no mood to slacken their grip on the match on the resumption after lunch as Bishoo had Rangana Herath taken at short-leg before Chase sealed victory with the wickets of Suranga Lakmal and Lahiru Kumara off successive balls, both adjudged caught behind by 'man of the match' Shane Dowrich.
I just wanted to stick to the basics and make the most of all my preparation coming into this series, and it worked out for me, said the wicketkeeper-batsman, whose unbeaten 125 was the cornerstone of the West Indies first innings recovery and final total of 414 for eight declared.
Consistency is something I have been striving for because I want to score runs in every game.
Earlier, Mendis had wasted no time in getting to three figures. He flicked a delivery from West Indies captain Jason Holder to backward square-leg for his tenth boundary. He also hoisted two sixes in a determined innings that occupied 110 deliveries. Yet for all that time at the crease, there was nothing he could do to avoid an unplayable delivery from Gabriel which kicked off a good length to brush the batsmans gloves on the way through to Dowrich.
Everyone in this team deserves enormous credit for the way we battled through on a pitch that wasnt the easiest, said Holder. AFP

Is this the worlds biggest cornflake
A student was shocked to find the worlds biggest ever cornflake in his cereal, measuring a gigantic six inches long.
Hinay Lad, 22, initially thought a piece of ceiling had fallen into his bowl of Crunchy Nut when he first saw the giant flake.
After contacting Kelloggs to report the freak flake he was given 4 worth of vouchers to buy himself a new box of cereal.
Hinay, a healthcare student at Queen Mary University of London, had just started eating breakfast when his dad noticed the monster flake.
He said: It just looked like a bit of ceiling had fallen into the box. We were like whats going on here I thought it was a bit dangerous because it could have been a choking hazard. It even looks like it could be something from outer space, a bit of meteorite or something.
Hinay had bought the box of cereal from his local Morrisons for 2.68 and was pouring out a bowl for himself when the giant flake appeared.
He added, It felt like a rock, if you tried bending it, it wouldnt break. Thats why we thought it was a bit of ceiling. I wrote to Kelloggs and their explanation was that it occurred in their plant. Ive never seen anything like it before. They are supposed to have quality controls!
Kelloggs wanted Hinay, from Bradford, to send them the flake so they can study it and find out how it ended up in the packet.
A spokeswoman for the company said the lump was coating and cereal particles which have collected during processing.
She added, Although we work hard to prevent this, it sounds like an accumulation passed the screening process and unintentionally entered the package.

World fights for childrens rights
Tomorrow, Tuesday June 12 is World Day Against Child Labour, (WDACL). It is observed worldwide to raise awareness of the plight of child labourers world-wide. Hundreds of millions of girls and boys around the world are affected. This year, the WDACL and the World Day for Safety and Health at Work (SafeDay) shine a spotlight on the global need to improve the safety and health of young workers and end child labour.
In many developed countries, children have never had it so good, with access to education, health care, the internet and much more. But millions more are facing unprecedented upheaval. More than 50 million children have been uprooted from their homes due to conflict, poverty and climate change while millions more face violence in their communities. According to the UN, around 263 million children do not attend school and last year nearly six million children under five died from mostly preventable diseases.
Today, throughout the world, around 215 million children work, many full-time. They do not go to school and have little or no time to play. Many do not receive proper nutrition or care. They are denied the chance to be children. More than half of them are exposed to the worst forms of child labour such as work in hazardous environments, slavery or other forms of forced labour, illicit activities including drug trafficking and prostitution, as well as involvement in armed conflict.
Many of these children are forced to work in plantations, mines, factories, as domestic slaves and as prostitutes. They perform exhausting work for many hours in a row, often in unhealthy and hazardous conditions. The work is physically, psychologically and morally harmful for children.
Poverty often leads to child labour. Parents regard their children as additional sources of income. War, migration and discrimination against minorities also results in child labour. The common belief is that child labour is normal. True, not all of us can look back on our childhood as the most joyous time of our lives. The more privileged among us are perhaps unaware that millions of children in our own nation as well as in many undeveloped countries elsewhere are subjected to untold hardships from the time they come squealing into the world. Their parents too in many parts of the universe struggle with their own problems such as lack of health care, financial insecurity and abuse.
Globally over 1.5 billion people live in countries that are affected by conflict and violence. At the same time, around 200 million people are affected by disasters every year. A third of them are children. A significant proportion of the 168 million children engaged in child labour live in areas affected by conflict and disaster. The World Day Against Child Labour this year will focus on the impact of conflicts and disasters on child labour.
As the world strives to achieve the elimination of child labour by 2025, on this World Day Against Child Labour, lets join forces to end child labour in areas affected by conflict and disaster! Child labour and forced labour in conflicts and humanitarian settings will be discussed at the IV Global Conference on Child Labour in Buenos Aires, November 14 to16 2017.
Considerable differences exist between the many kinds of work children do. Some are difficult and demanding, others are more hazardous and even morally reprehensible. Children carry out a very wide range of tasks and activities when they work. Not all work done by children should be classified as child labour that is to be targeted for elimination. Childrens or adolescents participation in work that does not affect their health and personal development or interfere with their schooling, is generally regarded as being something positive.
This includes activities such as helping their parents around the home, assisting in a family business or earning pocket money outside school hours and during school holidays. These kinds of activities contribute to childrens development and to the welfare of their families. They provide them with skills and experience and help to prepare them to be productive members of society during their adult life.
The term child labour is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.
It refers to work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children. Or work interferes with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school while obliging them to leave school prematurely. It also includes requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work.
In its most extreme forms, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses or left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities  often at a very early age. Whether or not particular forms of work can be called child labour depends on the childs age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed and the objectives pursued by individual countries. The answer varies from country to country, as well as among sectors within countries.
There are almost 100,000 child workers in Sri Lanka, with girls working mostly as domestic helpers in towns and boys doing agricultural work in the villages. Schooling is a distant dream for many children, a survey by the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry shows, with 13.9 per cent of the child labour population being aged five to 14 years  the period when school attendance is compulsory.
Anything you do to support kids and parents can help reduce the stress that often leads to abuse and neglect. By educating yourself  and others  you can help your community prevent child abuse and neglect from happening in the first place. The behaviour of children may signal abuse or neglect long before any change in physical appearance. Get involved. Advocate for services to families. Help to establish parenting groups in your community. Ask your community leaders, clergy, library and schools to develop services to meet the needs of healthy children and families. If you suspect or are aware of abuse or neglect may be occurring, report it. UNICEF estimates that over half of the 35,000 child sex workers in Sri Lanka are boys. Does this not sound the alarm that we are increasingly on the way to earning the shameful reputation of becoming a nation of perverts, pederasts and paedophiles It is because of our silence that these depravities will continue. All Sri Lankan voices should be heard to boom with outrage against such abuse of our children. Remember that our children should be considered more precious resources than the nations gold reserves.

Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 38.56% (or LKR 1.09Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Richards Pieris & CT Holdings which accounted for 90.67% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector meanwhile accounted for 38.43% (or LKR 1.09Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Sampath Bank, HNB, Commercial Bank, HNB[NV] & DFCC Bank which accounted for 73.34% of the sector turnover.
The Manufacturing Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 8.95% (or LKR 0.25Bn) to the market driven by Chevron which accounted for 29.39% of the sector turnover.

In terms of volume Serendib engineering & JKH led foreign purchases while Piramal Glass & Dialog led foreign sales.
In terms of value JKH & Cargills led foreign purchases while CT Holdings & HNB[X] led foreign sales.
Point of view
Negative investor sentiment continued to drag domestic equities, with markets losing ground for the 3rd consecutive week to close at an YTD low 6,354.92.
The benchmark ASPI lost 46 points (0.72%) over the week (cf. 67 points loss in the previous week) to close the week below the key 6400-mark for the 1st time in 5 months.
Continued losses in local markets were driven mainly by lackadaisical buying interest by investors, with investors showing higher selling interest than buying interest which was reflected in the activity levels on the bourse.
Activity levels on the CSE consequently hit a 3-week low as turnover declined 46% W-o-W to Rs.2.8Bn (cf. 5.2Bn).
Daily average turnover subsequently declined to Rs.0.57Bn (cf. 0.97Bn YTD daily average) with JKH accounting for 29% of the weekly turnover and Sampath Bank accounted for 16% of the weeks turnover.
The low activity levels were primarily due to poor participation levels by Local Institutional and HNI investors who remained on the sidelines this week.
Crossings for the week accounted for just 31% of the weeks turnover with blue-chip JKH accounting for the majority (67%) of the weeks crossings.
The continuous drop in Index value meanwhile converted the YTD return on the ASPI to negative (-0.2%), while the YTD loss on the more liquid S&P20 SL index widened further to 3.6%.
Foreign investors however, indicated interest towards Sri Lankas relatively undervalued equities, and net foreign inflows for the week amounted to Rs.0.6Bn, reversing last weeks net outflows of Rs.1.4Bn.
Foreign investors have poured in Rs.0.8Bn into the CSE so far in Jun18 (reversing the net outflow of Rs.0.6Bn in May), and this has helped support Q218 net foreign inflows to the Bourse which have improved to Rs.1.9Bn (cf. outflow of Rs.2.6Bn in Q118).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from further economic and political developments.
IMF approves the 5th disbursement under EFF
The IMF this week approved the 5th tranche ($252Mn) under its Extended Fund Facility with Sri Lanka, adding that the country continues to make important progress under the program, with major achievements including the initiation of the new Inland Revenue Act and energy-pricing reforms.
The IMF added that the authorities efforts to improve the policy mix through fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policy, and landmark structural reforms are supporting the economic recovery, despite recent shocks.
The Group noted, that sustaining this reform momentum remains critical if the country is to strengthen its resilience to shocks, particularly given the still sizable public debt and low external buffers.
The IMF also welcomed the Sri Lankan authoritys recent approval of an automatic fuel pricing formula, adding that this was a major achievement towards reducing fiscal risks from loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
The Group added however, that an automatic pricing formula for electricity along with a restructuring plan for Sri Lankan Airlines, and further strengthening SOE governance and transparency remains vital for a continued fiscal reform process.
The Group also encouraged the CBSL to continue to manage the monetary policy prudently despite the price shocks and market volatility while continuing the efforts to improve international reserves with exchange rate flexibility as first line of defense in response to volatile global capital flow.
The IMF estimates Sri Lankas GDP growth in 2018 at 4.0% while inflation to stabilize around mid-single digit.
