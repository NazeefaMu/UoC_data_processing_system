Joint Opposition to stage street protests over LG polls
Unhappy over the situation hanging over holding of Local Government elections, yet to be announced by the President, the members of the Joint Opposition yesterday insisted that the Local poll be held soon or they will take to streets urging the government to hold the election on time.
Rebutting statements by the governments main ally, the United National Party (UNP) alluding that the election is being held up pending ongoing work on the demarcation of electoral boundaries in local government wards, the Joint Opposition members said the members of Commission working on the delimitation process had said they can complete the task of demarcation within three months - that was when they undertook it several months back.
Joint Opposition member Prasanna Ranatunga told the Daily News that there is still time to announce upcoming local poll.
Meanwhile. The Joint Opposition planning to form a new political party, had yet to decide who will lead their campaign in the poll, as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not yet accepted their offer of taking the leadership of the party.
The next in line for the post is Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena. Ranatunga said they expect the government to hold the upcoming election as they have promised earlier. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said that the local poll would be held before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
Cabinet spokesman Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna had announced that the election would be held in June.
Asked if their group is planning to hit the streets to pressure the government to hold the poll, Ranatunga said, We have not reached a decision with respect to taking any such action yet. Our member Dullas Alahapperuma is looking into it, he said.
Meanwhile, Joint Opposition member and Mahajana Eksatha Peramuna Leader Dinesh Gunawardena had reportedly said at a public meeting in Kotigahawatta on Saturday that they will hold public proteststs if the government did not hold the local government poll before March 31.

Successors to take on party leadership should be groomed - PM
A political party needs to groom a line of successors to take on the leadership and I was the third tier or spare wheel to the UNP leadership when President J R Jayewardenae was the party leader, admitted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the United National Party's Ministers, Members of Parliament, Provincial Councillors, past and present members of Local Government Institutions and organizers of the Matara District at the SANASA auditorium in Nupe last Friday (19). The meeting was convened by the UNP leader to enlighten the districts' UNPers of the newly formed national government's development plans for the Southern Province.
Earlier, the Prime Minister together with Ministers and Members of Parliament representing the Galle, Matara, Hambantota and Moneragala districts, met with government officials at the District Secretariat in Matara to enlighten them on the intended development in the south. The PM also met members of the Matara Bar Association at the Nildiya Hotel.
"President J R Jayewardene who became the leader of the United National Party in 1973 and then Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in 1977, groomed a successor, a second tier and even a third tier to take on the leadership of the party. At that time it was former Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa who was to succeed him as the party leader and ministers Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake were next in line, while I was the third tier. It was like a three wheeler of which former Prime Minister Premadasa was the front wheel while Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayaka were the rear wheels and I was the spare wheel! With the unfortunate demise of the two side wheels and the front wheel, I who was the spare wheel had led the party for the past twenty years. It is important to have a successor, a second, third and even a fourth tier to lead the party and hold it together at times of crisis."
"We have entered a new era by forming a national government with the leader of the SLFP as the president and me as prime minister of the nation. The people are disgusted of the never ending political tug of war between political parties in the past and expect this national government comprising of the two main political parties to develop the nation and I wish to assure you that this government will take all steps to fulfill the aspirations of the people within the next five years as promised."
"It is after eleven years that we have come back to power and during that time which was a most trying period, we have been able to safeguard the unity of the party and not let it splinter. We have to help those who stood by us when we were in the opposition and helped us regain power. We have to help those youth that have been politically victimized. We have to provide employment for the youth and we expect to create employment opportunities for one million youth within the next five years."
"As a national government is formed by parties that hold conflicting views and hence we together with opposition party have agreed to work within a framework of principles. Although we cannot change things overnight, we will fulfill the aspirations of the people," Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pledged.

US airstrikes reportedly destroy over $500m IS cash reserves
US: U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have reportedly destroyed more than $500 million cash reserves and 20 kilograms of gold stored by the terror group, a U.S. media outlet reported on Friday.
The estimate comes amid reports that the terror group is facing a cash shortage in its so-called caliphate, slashing the perks and salaries of its fighters across the region.
Recent reports have stated that the extremist group has started accepting only dollars for "tax" payments, water and electric bills.
But the $500m figure is probably a low estimate, a U.S. official was quoted as saying. The official said the figure is in "the high hundreds of millions of dollars."
An additional 20 kilograms of gold is also believed to have been destroyed by the airstrikes, the report said.
As part of the effort to weaken the Islamic State, the U.S. military has struck at the terror group's finances, particularly its lucrative oil smuggling enterprise in Syria that provides revenue for its operations.
The U.S. has also been targeting IS' "cash distribution centres" in Syria where it stored hard cash used for its operations.
Ten strikes have been conducted so far with the most high profile being two airstrikes in Mosul, in northern Iraq, targeting facilities that American officials characterised as IS banks.
As proof of their successful targeting, the US-led coalition released a video of one of the Mosul airstrikes that showed what appeared to be large amounts of bills fluttering in the air after the airstrike.
American officials believe the strikes have had an impact on IS operations often citing anecdotal reports that IS fighters are now being paid half what they had been receiving prior to the airstrikes. "It's a significant amount of cash that we believe was in those various collection points before we struck them," Colonel Steve Warren, the U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, told reporters this week at a Pentagon briefing. According to Warren, the U.S. now estimates that "hundreds of millions of dollars" in cash has been destroyed by airstrikes targeting IS financial centres.
