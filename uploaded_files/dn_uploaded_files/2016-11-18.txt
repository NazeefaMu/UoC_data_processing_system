Dog day afternoon for England in India
VISAKHAPATNAM: stray dog spared England some punishment when it halted play shortly before tea as India piled on the runs to reach 210 for two on day one of the second Test on Thursday.
The brown dog forced the umpires to call tea four balls early when it appeared from behind the sightscreen and evaded attempts to chase it from the field.
Laughter and applause broke out as two groundsmen gave pursuit -- only to meet dogged resistance from the pitch-invader.
Cheteshwar Pujara was three runs from his century and facing Stuart Broad when the early tea was taken, with Virat Kohli on 91 at the other end.
The two had put on 188 runs for the third wicket to thwart the England bowling attack after their seamers struck early.
Kohli recorded his 13th Test half-century with a single off Ben Stokes in the 37th over of the innings.
But the star batsman was lucky to earn a life on 56 when a diving Adil Rashid failed to hold onto his catch off Ben Stokes at long leg.
Pujara also registered his fifty at India's newest Test venue as he hit 11 fours and a six during his 177-ball stay so far.
England managed to do some damage in the morning session, sending the Indian openers swiftly back to the pavilion.
Fast bowler Broad got Lokesh Rahul for nought in the second over, while fit-again paceman James Anderson accounted for Murali Vijay (20).
But the visitors, who had given India a run for their money in the drawn Test in Rajkot, went wicketless in the afternoon session.
There are thousands of stray dogs on India's streets, and this was not the first time one has interrupted a sporting event.
In 2011, India was forced to halt its first ever Formula One practice session when a stray dog ran onto the Buddh International Circuit.

Australias Voges concussed after blow to helmet
SYDNEY: Struggling Australia batsman Adam Voges suffered concussion after he was struck on the helmet by a bouncer on Thursday, ruling him out of a domestic game and dealing a blow to his Test chances.
The 37-year-old needed runs in Western Australias Sheffield Shield clash with Tasmania in Perth to salvage his Test spot after a highest score of 47 in his last 10 innings.
But the sickening impact from a Cameron Stevenson bouncer saw him sink to the ground before gingerly walking off minutes later, with each arm wrapped around the shoulder of medical staff.
Voges has been diagnosed with concussion. He is ok, naturally a bit groggy. Being monitored by medicos. Ruled out of rest of game, the Western Australian Cricket Association tweeted.
The scare came just weeks after an inquest into the death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes, who died from bleeding on the brain in November 2014 after being hit on the neck by a rising ball during a domestic match in Sydney.
A coroner ruled Hughes made a minuscule misjudgement before he was fatally struck, attaching no blame to the bowler or the tactic of sending down short-pitched deliveries.
It was the second serious concussion Voges has suffered this year after being struck on the head by an errant throw while fielding for Middlesex in England.
Australias Test team has been thrown into crisis after five straight defeats, with chairman of selectors Rod Marsh quitting on Wednesday.

England Women recover from 58/6 to total 240/9: Take series 3-0 as rain ends final contest
England Women staged a fine rearguard action to get out of jail from being reduced to 58-6 to total an impressive 240-9 in the fourth and final ODI against Sri Lanka Women at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
However the contest ended in a damp squib when rain prevented Sri Lanka Women from commencing their innings and the match eventually ended in a no-result.
England Women won the series 3-0 having won the first three ODIs.
Choosing to bat first on winning the toss England Women were soon deep in trouble against the right-arm and left-arm spin of Inoshi Priyadarshani and skipper Inoka Ranaweera losing their first six wickets for 58 before the tail staged a superb fight back to wrest back the initiative.
Natalie Sciver led the recovery with a fluent knock of 77 off 74 balls (10 fours, 2 sixes). She shared a seventh wicket stand of 104 with Danielle Hazell (45).
Following Scivers dismissal at 162, Hazell continued the fightback with Laura Marsh (36 n.o.) and Beth Langston (21) to ensure England Women posted a decent total.
Pick of the Lankan Women bowlers were Priyadarshani and Ranaweera who shared six wickets.

Steve Smith has big say in team selection: Mark Waugh
Mark Waugh, Australian national selector, has revealed that captain Steven Smith is having an input into the selection of the team to rebuff pointed criticism from prominent former cricketers.
Australian cricket is in disarray after they suffered a fifth consecutive Test defeat during a humiliating innings and 80 runs loss against South Africa in Hobart. Recriminations have ensued with Rod Marsh, chairman of selectors, resigning from his post with Trevor Hohns being elevated into the position. Greg Chappell, Cricket Australias national talent manager, has become an interim national selector after an extraordinary meeting of CAs board on Wednesday night (November 16).
Michael Clarke and Ian Chappell, former Australia captains, have questioned the amount of influence Smith is having and believe he should be entrusted with more responsibility. Rejecting the criticisms, Waugh insisted Smith was allowed input despite not officially being part of the selection panel.
I have only been a selector for a couple of years but I assure you the captain has a big say in the team, Waugh told foxsports.com.au on Wednesday. Hes not a selector but you respect what he says. Hes got to deal with the players on the field so you need to give him the players he wants.
Waugh said Australias setup had remained unchanged since Smith took over from Clarke after the Ashes last year. When Michael Clarke was captain and when Steve Smith took over, the captain has had a very big say in his team so I am not quite sure what Michael is talking about there, he said.
With an apparent lack of batting depth in domestic cricket, Waugh said selectors would use their gut instinct in selecting the third Test squad, which will be announced on Sunday (November 20). At the moment the next level of players underneath the Test team, the runs just arent there, he said. The younger guys in state cricket havent got the volume of runs to knock the door down. As selectors I think we will be guessing a little bit and using our gut instinct, (asking) This guy hasnt quite made the runs, is he going to be better at the next level
After consecutive embarrassing losses, Waugh said changes would be made. Obviously there will be changes at Adelaide. I cant say how many or who at this present point in time, he said. But I can assure you we are looking at a lot of batsmen.
And if someone sticks their hands up and gets a 150 or a 100 in this round then it is really important.
But I think now were at a stage where were going to be sitting down and (acknowledge) its not working, he added. The team were picking at the moment - the batting, were having too many batting collapses.

Trevor Hohns replaces Rod Marsh as chairman of selectors
Trevor Hohns has replaced Rod Marsh as chairman of selectors for Cricket Australia (CA) on an interim basis after the former wicket-keeper quit on Wednesday.
Former Australia captain Greg Chappell, who was the national talent manager, has also been added to the panel in a temporary position, CA said on Thursday.
It is vital that Australian cricket finds the best candidate for this role, CA chairman David Peever said in a statement.
Trevor is highly experienced as a selector, and will ensure we place our best players on the field this summer while we seek a permanent replacement for Rod.
Marsh, who had already said he would stand down from the role next year, quit after Australia crumbled to an innings and 80-run loss in the second test against South Africa in Hobart.
Australias fifth successive test loss gave the Proteas an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Marsh and the selection panel, which included Hohns, former Australia batsman Mark Waugh and head coach Darren Lehmann have been criticised over a number of issues this year.
Naturally, the board and our senior executive are disappointed with the recent test performances, Peever said. But we have every confidence that all those involved, including our coaching staff and team management, will do their utmost to turn that around.

ICC reviewing du Plessis footage for possible code breach
Faf du Plessis will find out by Sunday if he will face a charge for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct after South Africas stand-in captain was shown on camera shining the ball with what appeared to be a sweet in his mouth.
ICC CEO David Richardson is expected to take a call over the incident, which took place during the recent Hobart Test.
The footage emerged on Wednesday, the day after the conclusion of the match, which South Africa won by an innings and 80 runs to take the series. It was not reported by match officials within the stipulated 18 hours after the game.
Instead, the ICC was alerted of the incident through media queries and is now reviewing it of its own volition. It has until Sunday, a stipulated five days after it began reviewing the footage, to make its decision.
The ICC has been alerted to the footage and is currently reviewing the incident from the perspective of it being a possible breach of the ICC Code of Conduct, an ICC spokesperson said.
Although Cricket South Africa has not made an official comment on the matter, it is understood the board is confident du Plessis was acting within the laws of the game. Cricket Australia has also not commented, neither has it registered an official complaint.
This is not the first time du Plessis has come under scrutiny. In 2013, five penalty runs were awarded to Pakistan, the ball changed and du Plessis fined 50% of his match fee for rubbing the ball close to the zipper of his trouser pocket during a Test in Dubai.

Marilyn Monroe 'Happy Birthday' dress fetches $4.8m

The dress worn by Marilyn Monroe as she sang "Happy Birthday Mr President" to John F Kennedy has been sold at auction for $4.8m (3.9m).
The figure-hugging Jean Louis gown, with 2,500 crystals, was bought by the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum chain, exceeding the $3m guide price.
The company's vice president said it was "most iconic piece of pop culture that there is".
Monroe died from a drug overdose just three months after the performance.
The sultry rendition for President Kennedy's 45th birthday at a 1962 Democratic fundraiser at New York's Madison Square was one of her last public appearances.
President Kennedy was shot dead a year later.
The dress, which the auction house said was so tight she had to be sewn into it, had previously been bought at auction for $1.3m in 1999 by the late business mogul and collector Martin Zweig.
