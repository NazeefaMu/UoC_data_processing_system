Cabinet nod for Karapitiya expansion
The Health Ministry is expanding the facilities at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital. The Cabinet has approved to build the new theatre complex and CCD has estimated the project.
The project has already received the approval of the Planning Department, Health Services Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala said.
He said the ministry has taken measures to solve the issue at Karapitiya Teaching Hospitals heart surgery waiting list. There are 2,200 patients in the waiting list to undergo heart surgeries at the hospital and their surgeries will be expedited.
But without the cooperation of the public to control NCDs, expanding health facilities will be similar to filling water to a bottle with a hole in the bottom, Dr. Mahipala said.
He said that patients with various germs will be operated at Welisara Chest Hospital and relevant instructions were given to the Karapitiya hospital Director to transfer such patients to Welisara Hospital. This will be done to keep the theatre complex at Karapitiya hospital free of germs and ensure the safety of patients undergoing heart surgeries.
Heart surgeries will commence soon at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Hospital and Polonnaruwa Hospital. Cath labs has already been provided for those two hospitals. Four more Thoracic surgeons will be assigned to Welisara Chest Hospital. So far Thoracic surgeries were conducted only at Welisara Chest Hospital and later the surgeries were commenced at Karapitiya Hospital, he said.

Ever-green voice
Indeed, he won the hearts of all musical lovers. Annesley Malawane hails from the gem-studded city, Ratnapura. The very eyes, opened a few decades back, felt and heard, above the lullaby of his mom, the scenic beauty and twittering of birds, which cuddled Ratnapura.
Nobody in Ratnapura ever thought that this child will glitter more than a valuable gem and would embrace hearts of the nation.
Q: Where were you educated
A: I studied at St. Joseph's, Colombo
Q: Who inspired you to sing and did you ever imagine that this would be your career
A: At school, I was awarded many times. During free times even teachers wanted me to sing. My father was a Chorister at the Peter and Paul Church, Ratnapura. He knew this will take me somewhere someday. I hit his jackpot.
I am proud of it.
My box guitar accompanied me to maintain the beat. With the Beacons in 1960s I first sang to the music of electric guitars. Now I have my own Troup 'Annesley and Super Chimes.
Q: Who introduced you to music troupes
A: First, I was introduced to late Sri Sangabo Corea . Later I joined the 'Moonstones' which cleared the way to me.
As a shadow, Clarance Wijewardhana was there with me. Both of us were the vocalists for 'Moonstones'.
Q: What was your first song
A: 'Dilhani'. I sang it with my heart repression. But since it is a lullaby my male voice did not creep into the hearts of anyone.
Then, through Indrani Perera's voice, it touched the hearts of all. I am happy about it. During 1960s, many requested this song on SLBC.
Q: What happened to Moonstones The younger generation is hardly aware of such a troupe.
A: Not only Moonstones, but many other famous troupes fell off the track. In 1974 I formed Super Golden Chimes with Clarance, Dickson, Conrad and Sri Kantha.
Q: Then there was a period of silence. Probably ten years
A: Naturally I got married in 1977. I was busy with my family life. During this period, I had to see my good friend Clarence dying. That was a huge shock.
Q: What is it that you would never forget in your lifetime
A: When I sang 'Rosa Male Natuwe Katu' in Ratnapura with Moonstones, the audience hooted at us. Probably they thought we are singing a nursery rhyme. When we sang the same song in Moratuwa, there was a thundering applause. I felt the difference. Hats off to the Moratuwites. They love music and rhythm. They must have tolerated the lyrics.
Q: Most of your songs have a soft spot for nature. Any comments
A: 'Mango', 'Kalumame', 'Ruwanpura', 'Udarata Niliya', 'Kageda Gon Vassa', 'Dunihinda Manamali' and there are many more which I feel would be ever green. I love nature, vegetation and rural folks. Though I live in Colombo, I am from that beautiful wilderness of the mountain ranges. My songs also portray Sinhala culture and traditions apart from nature.
Q: What do you think of the future of music
A: Of course, the modern techniques have evolved. We never thought music will be like this today. Our times at the SLBC, whatever the costume we wear, we had to stay long hours in studios at the SLBC to tape a song. Now, the present singers are born with a silver spoon. They just follow the techniques and attend the rest. But I do not say that all are blessed to be good vocalists. Only few will be ever green. Now the computers and television are supportive factors.
Q: Anything to disclose to your fans
A: I celebrated my 40 years of singing at BMICH in 2006. I will be celebrating my 50 years of singing at BMICH on August 6. My troupe 'Annesley and Super Chimes' will be on stage on March 19 evening at Sri Lanka Export Development Board Auditorium (Nawam Mawatha, Colombo 2).

FR against Mega Cabinet re-fixed for support
A fundamental rights petition filed by a lawyer challenging President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to increase the number of Cabinet ministers from 30 to 48 was yesterday fixed for support on May 3 by the Supreme Court. This petition had been filed by
Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri and he has cited President Sirisena and the Attorney General as respondents. The Supreme Court Nench comprised Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Buvaneka Aluvihare and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
Deputy Solicitor General Indika Demunika de Silva with Dr. Avanthi Perera appearing for the respondents told Court that the respondents would raise preliminary objections against this petition.
The petitioner has stated that, according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a National Government should comprise the party that has obtained the highest number of seats and the other parties and independent groups in Parliament.
The petitioner maintains that the present government could not be described as a National Government merely because a couple of parties have entered into an agreement to form a government, and, therefore, it is a gross violation of the Article 46.1 (a) of the Constitution.
The petitioner is seeking interim relief preventing the President from appointing more than 30 ministers.

A new Bill holding engineers and related officials responsible for any power failure in the country will be introduced to Parliament soon. The decision comes in the wake of the continued power cuts experienced across the island.
The absence of any one person to take responsibility for the failure led to the move to introduce a Bill that will hold engineers and officials responsible for power supply responsibly or for any power outage.

## Title: The other side of Lasith Malinga

The other side of Lasith Malinga
Cricket is a game that produces all kinds of characters in different shapes and sizes and moods. In this instance we refer to Lasith Malinga, a classic bowler of his own making and quite effective at that with his unusual square arm bowling action. His toe crushing yorkers and deceptive slow balls has made him a world class bowler especially in the shorter format - fifty over and twenty20 cricket. Add to this his extraordinary talent, the shocking gold locks and pierced eyebrows - you have a cult figure that every Malinga fan would want to emulate.
Fast bowlers are known to be temperamental and Malinga is no exception. He has his own way of doing things. He came up the hard way and if he has lost his temper at times trying to answer questions thrown at him by the media it's no fault of his because there has been times where he has been provoked to react in the manner he has.
To very few who understands very little of Malinga's character he is very much disliked and criticized (not that he is averse to it). But there are others who know the inside of him and have high praise for his captaincy. "Lasith thinks different to other captains and very few understand him," quipped one former selector.
The way Malinga spoke about T20 captaincy was quite amazing especially the amount of knowledge he has in this field.
Delayed by a technical fault in the plane that was to take him from Colombo to Kolkata, Malinga spent some time with the media men in Lotus lounge of the BIA freely airing his thoughts and views on the game.
Malinga was of the opinion that in Sri Lanka when a player is identified for a specific role and selected he should be given to fulfill that task. "If you pick a player for his batting in a certain position for his club or province then when he is picked for the national team he should bat in that position not elsewhere because it is in that batting position that he has made his mark. It is similar with a bowler if he is a new ball bowler and has taken early wickets he should be given the new ball when playing for the national team not brought on later. This is how I look at selections. Sadly it does not happen that way.
"There are specific roles for each individual in the team to play and it must be utilised to the maximum otherwise there is no point in selecting him."
Malinga said that T20 is a format where the game can change from over to over and the captain has to be very mindful of not letting things slip out of hand. He is in fact writing a book in Sinhala and in English largely based on T20 cricket and how best a player can maximise his talent.
Being the legend he is Malinga admitted that the expectations on him was very high and that every time he took the ball into his hands his fans and critics expected him to take wickets which he said was virtually impossible. "They expect me to bowl at 140 plus all the time and if for some my speed drops they say that I am not putting 100 percent effort or that I have lost my speed and should quit the game. I have now got used to such criticism and do what is best for the team and my country," he said.
Malinga has also been accused at times of reserving his best for the IPL tournament (where he represents Mumbai Indians) than for his country whenever he fails to produce a match winning spell for Sri Lanka.
Malinga, 32 who has been playing international cricket for the past 12 years is clearly counting the number of days on his fingers before he finally calls it quits. "I am not getting any younger and with this troubled knee of mine I don't know how far I can go. Playing in the 2016 IPL will largely depend on my fitness. If I can get through the World T20 I will be happy," Malinga said.
Players like Malinga don't come by the day. They are unique in their own ways and that's what makes them so exceptional and special so that any captain would love to have in their team. Sri Lanka are at present struggling to bridge the gap left following the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. The day Malinga quits the game will be another body blow to the team. A player's value is sometimes realized only after he leaves the game and Malinga is no exception to it.

Planned rally an attempt to divide SLFP - SB
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said the planned rally by the Joint Opposition on Thursday, is an attempt to divide the SLFP and it would also be beneficial to the UNP, JVP and LTTE terrorists.
We urge the SLFP members not to participate in this act of betrayal, but to join hands to take the party forward, he said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, the minister said it had proved that if a particular MP is found guilty of violating party disciplines, he or she would have to fore-go the Parliamentary seat. But we do not want to unnecessarily take disciplinary action to create unwanted problems in the party. But it is our responsibility to protect the party.
Therefore, I urge all SLFP members not to participate in acts that could divide the party. We have all strength to go forward as a single party, despite various internal issues. It is our duty to work together to win the the SLFP and help make President Maithripalas dream of coming into power by 2020 a reality.
Although the Joint Opposition said around 1,600 SLFP members attended the previous rally in Negombo, only around 600 people participated.
This shows that the SLPErs are not with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Even during the previous Presidential election, most SLPErs felt helpless and it was a blessing that a Presidential candidate was our then General Secretary President Maithripala Sirisena. At all other times when the SLFP was defeated in elections, our supporters were subjected to violence. But on this occasion nothing happened. It was a great strength to our party.

UNP will defeat any conspiracy - Sajith
Deputy UNP Leader and Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa yesterday said that the UNP is ready to defeat any conspiracy being hatched against the governments development drive.
He said many investors who have identified the able administrative skills of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are coming to Sri Lanka for investment purposes. Those who see the proposed free trade agreement as a betrayal of the country should not oppose the governments programme to provide one million employment opportunities to youth.
Premadasa was addressing a mammoth rally organised against opposition conspiracies in Colombo yesterday.
The march started at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre and ended with a rally at Hyde Park. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe listened to the speeches of senior party leaders at the rally. Minister Sarath Fonseka addressing the rally said the people are living freely without fear. Thousands of youth have flocked here in protest of the oppositions move to stifle the countrys development drive, he said. He said those who plundered the Treasury and public assets for their own well being are trying to deter the countrys development march The people made us vicotorious twice with an objective of taking the country forward, he said.
He said that he intends to complete 200 villages under Udagama concept by end of this year and housing schemes would also be initiated for the benefit of city dwellers.
The countrys War Heroes did not face any problems due to the able leadership and foreign policy of President Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said.
He said that those in the Common Opposition have been conspiring against the government by trying to mislead the public.
Those who were plundered the Treasury will be brought to book. We do not protect wrongdoers. Legal action would be taken against those involved in corruption and financial irregularities irrespective of their status, he said.
