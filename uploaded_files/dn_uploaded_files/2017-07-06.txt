Kandy SC gets a good rugby leader
Most sports, like rugby, involve more than a single player. Several players combine to form a single group and are considered a team. When you hear the word team, there has to be someone who will lead it.
Kandy Sports Club side will be led by one who learnt his rugby at Kingswood College where he excelled in the 7s and 15-a-side and started his club rugby with Kandy SC and went on to play for Sri Lanka sevens and fifteens - Gayan Weeraratne in the next season.
The newly married Gayan is a team man like his brother Roshan who led the side to win the league and knockouts last season.
He played for Kingswood College from 2005 to 2007. He had the privilege of leading the Sri Lanka Under-19 at the junior Rugby Asiad.
A lot should be heard of Gayan as he tries to emulate the feats of his brother this coming season.

Lanka Property wins Best Website at SLT Zero One Awards
Sri Lankas leading property website LankaPropertyWeb.com, was awarded the Best Website under its relevant category at the inaugural SLT Zero-One awards, which recognises achievements within the countrys digital sector.
This being the first awards programme the company has participated in, its win is a particularly significant achievement.
Launched in 2007, LankaPropertyWeb.com was initiated with the intention of assisting Sri Lankan property owners and agents reach a wider local and global audience, allowing them to sell and rent their properties much more efficiently. Additionally, it was also setup to serve as a platform for property seekers worldwide, to locate properties for purchase and rent in Sri Lanka.
Over the past decade, the company has done exactly that, proving to be instrumental in the field of real estate, assisting scores of real estate agents, sellers, renters and buyers secure their ideal property and amassing the highest number of property ads and visitors to the site, making it the No.1 property site in the country.
Their resounding success has a great deal to do with their expansive and fully-functional website, which needless to say, also saw them as the clear winners for this award.
Commenting on the award, Daham Gunaratna, the founder and Managing Director of Lanka Property Web said, Whilst the user-friendly setup of the website is undoubtedly one of the key reasons for the win, there are plenty of additional traits that helped contribute to this accolade. For starters, the website was enhanced and developed based on user feedback that was meticulously accumulated and assessed over the past 10 years. Needless to say, this has allowed us to tailor the site according to the needs of customers and make it easier for them to search and post properties. We are greatly honoured that the distinguished judging panel at the Zero-One awards have recognised our achievements, and presented us with this prestigious award.
There are continuous enhancements done to the site, such as expanding search by radius, the ability to search properties near you using GPS, and the ability to directly share pages via Viber and Whatsapp.
Lanka Property Web has taken into account every detail, which has paid off, seeing as how visitors were shown to spend an average of 8 minutes on the site with each visit. They also boast an average of 6 leads per property ad, which is quite above the industry average.

LO AND BEHOLD! HANSARD EVIDENCE
The Status quo of the current political situation compelled me to go through some old Hansard reports just to understand the calamity the country is going through. The unruly and unparliamentary behaviour of some MPS is quite disgusting and posing a direct challenge to democracy. It was veritably despicable in any sense and if it is not reined in the nick of time the repercussions would not be easy to tackle as the frustrations of the rotten cohorts seem grave.
The Parliament is a popular destination for the educational excursions of the students and utmost care has to be taken by both educational authorities and the parliamentary staff not to let the school children enter the premises at such times. The young children would think that Parliament is a place like Mariyakade for any Jack, Jill and Harry could go and create any pandemonium as they wish. The dignity of the House has to be protected at any cost.
Immediately after the recent commotion in Parliament, I went through some copies of the Hansard from 1960 to 1980 to have a workable solution for this unfortunate situation. When I put the current parliamentary situation and the then situation the evidence I found drove me the idea that political frustration, lack of proper education coupled with pedigree might have created the ugly chaos.
Present legislators
Once Sir John Kotalawala diagnosed that it was the consequence when coconut pluckers and the likes come to the august assembly such things happen. The election is a necessary evil. The intelligentsia deserved to be given an opportunity to devise a strategic plan to block such hooligans coming to Parliament. The sanctity of the House should be the guiding light.
One important aspect of the past evidence I found was the level of English education of the then MPs and ministers. Their speeches have been always literary. The great sayings, proverbs, very quotable quotes, extracts from Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Sir Thomas Grey, Hardy, Milton, Mark Twain, Victor Hugo, Anthon Chekhov, Karl Marx, Lenin. Engels, Castro, Mao, Ho Chi Minh, Macbeth, Hamlet, Tempest, the list would go to pages, have always been included in their speeches. I admired Ronnie's budget speeches. NM, Colvin, SA, and JR often delivered great parliamentary speeches.
When I was perusing all these speeches for this purpose I really felt sorry about the gradual decline of the standard of our present legislators. This is a national catastrophe. We should go at least to the period of allegorical poetry in English literature. Once a minister had referred to this period in his speech. I find uneasy for not being able to make an array of some Hansard extracts for the readers to ponder on.
Public figures
John Dryden and Alexander Pope vehemently pointed out that a ruler of a country should essentially be rational. He should be guided by reasons. Public figures should be guided by reasons, they categorically said.
The present parliament could derive much from the past performances of their predecessors. The unruly elements would have to eat their very words if they simply step into their library and read some of the copies of the Hansard. It is a goldmine untouched. The Hansard of that bygone era is a storehouse of unimagined treasures for the amateur parliamentarians. The recent parliamentary debacle of these disgruntled politicians does not augur well for them because the present generation is more politically mature than them. Their hidden agenda is an open secret to the general public.
Least said soonest mended.

North Korea missile: US says it will use military force 'if we must'
(US ambassador Nikki Haley)
The US has said it will use its "considerable military forces" on North Korea "if we must", following Tuesday's long-range missile test.
US ambassador Nikki Haley said a new resolution will also be tabled against Pyongyang at the United Nations.
She described the test as a sharp military escalation and also threatened to use trade restrictions.
The missile launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council.
Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and his Japanese counterpart Tomomi Inada said the test was an "unacceptable provocation".
A statement released by the US defence departmentsaid the two spoke on the phone, where Gen Mattis said the US was committed to defend Japan and provide deterrence.
Haley said on Wednesday that North Korea's test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was "quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution".
"The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves, and our allies," she told the UN Security Council, which met for an emergency session to discuss the test.
"One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them, if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction," she said.
Haley, who said she discussed the issue with the president, said the US could cut off trade with countries which continued to trade with North Korea in violation of UN resolutions.
"We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime," she says.
Earlier, US President Donald Trumpcriticised China for its trade with North Korea.
Trump has arrived in Warsaw where he is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for the second time. He will later travel to Hamburg for the G20 summit, where world leaders are expected to discuss the missile test.
What have other countries said
The French ambassador told the UN Security Council that France also favours a new resolution on North Korea, which would tighten sanctions.
Russia, which condemned the test, said the possibility of using military measures "should be excluded".
China's representative said North Korea's actions were unacceptable, but also repeated China and Russia's call for all involved to stand down.
They have proposed that while North Korea halts its missile and nuclear programmes, the US and South Korea freezes their joint military exercises and also reverse plans to deploy a controversial anti-missile system in the South.
Both Russia and China are permanent members of the UN Security Council and could veto any new resolution.
What has North Korea said
Tuesday's launch was North Korea's first-ever test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
State news agency KCNA quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a "gift" to the Americans on their independence day.
The report warned of the possibility of more tests, saying he had ordered officials to "frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees".
Pyongyang said earlier the Hwasong-14 ICBM had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea.
North Korea, it said, was now "a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world".
But while experts agree that the test shows Pyongyang has a long-range projectile, many are sceptical that its missiles can successfully deliver warheads.
What is an ICBM
A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead
The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more
Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14

Oceanfront Condos:  A Launchpad for an  East Coast Adventure
Nilaveli, just as its name suggests, is a beautiful stretch of moonlit beach. Its inviting shallow waters, diversity in marine life and the ample solitude it offers, makes it one of the most sought after locations in the country. Unlike the frolicking of the Western or even South coast beaches of Sri Lanka that are popular for their kitschy ambiance and crowd beset shores, the East coast flaunts its own quaint charm; one that is undisturbed by the cacophony. This is where Oceanfront Condos, Sri Lankas very first beach-front, serviced, luxury, leisure apartments of its kind is located.
"Enjoying long vacations at the Oceanfront Condos gives ample time to guests to discover the lesser trodden adventures of the East coast. Nilavelis Pigeon Island is perhaps one of the best hubs in Sri Lanka to enjoy snorkeling with the Black Tip Reef Shark and other colorful coral fish and turtles. With its own designated diving centres and international PADI instructors, Nilaveli offers plentiful opportunities to divers too," states oceanfrontnilaveli in a press release.
Having the space of ones own, facing the dazzling sea is perhaps one of the unparalleled advantages owners of Oceanfront Condos enjoy.
With its private sea-facing balconies, bedrooms and kitchenette enabling guests to stay indoors if they so please, the Condos offer much needed respite from the rest of the world; a luxury afforded not even by hotels and resorts.

Addressing the media at the China Harbour Engineering Company LTD premises in Beijing yesterday, he said that reclamation work is in progress with three dredgers depositing sand to build up the land mass.
We expect to complete reclamation work and marine structures by 2019. Initial infrastructure work and the construction of channel will be completed by 2020, Ming said.
Meanwhile, the construction of beach, marina and the central park will be completed by 2021, while work on the International Financial Centre will be completed by 2023. According to the schedule, other construction work will be completed by 2026.
He said the port city project which was suspended for 16 months recommenced in October last year with the signing of a new tripartite agreement between Sri Lanka and China incorporating amendments emphasising the protection of the natural environment.
There were misconceptions of the environmental damage. We had to produce an additional report to clear up the misunderstanding. We are concerned about the rules and regulations on the environment imposed by the government, Ming said.
He said the new version of the Port City would be part of the Governments Megapolis project and also of Chinas development strategy of one belt-one road. The master plan has been approved by the UDA. Parks and open spaces have been accorded priority to promote a clean and green identity under the strategy of green and blue, he said.
The project will focus on making Colombo the best livable city in South Asia and fostering growth in the country, he said.
Ming said the revamped Port City project has been extended from the initial 233 hectares to 269 hectares. The project will be South Asias premiere residential, retail and business destination, offering unmatched planned city along the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, he said.
It will also create more than 83,000 jobs, he said.
The development will have two road connections creating an internal loop serving the master plan. These will link to a new underground tunnel for access to the South and a new flyover expressway, cutting the drive time from the airport to 30 minutes and connecting the expressway network to major cities in the country, Ming said.

Pan Asia Banking Corporation DGM surprised how EPF losses went unnoticed
Treasury bond issue:
The Deputy General Manager of Pan Asia Banking Corporation (PABC) Richard Dias yesterday said he is surprised as to how the Employees Provident Fund(EPF) which incurred continuous losses while dealing in the bond market, went unnoticed by its investment committee.
The DGM of Pan Asia Bank Richard Dias (Head of Treasury) was testifying before the Presidential Commission investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday.
Had our institution incurred such losses,we would have called for an explanation from the responsible officers, DGM Dias said.
Asked about the secondary market transactions regarding the questioned February 27,2015
Treasury bonds, DGM Richard Dias said it was former Pan Asia Banking Corporation Chairman Nimal Perera who continued dealings with the Perpetual Treasuries Limited. Dias further said Pan Asia mediated between the EPF and the PTL under the instructions of former PABC Chairman Nimal Perera.
Dias, speaking on the secondary bond market transaction regarding the questioned bond Iissue said PTL decided on the volume and the price of the bonds traded.
He also said if direct placements were available, the EPF could have discussed with the Central Bank to reach a negotiation for lower prices when trading in the bond market.
Meanwhile, former Dealer Indika Mendis of Capital Alliance, also gave evidence before the
Commission yesterday (4). It was observed that mark-to-market losses incurred by Capital Alliance in the year 2015 were due to bad trading policies and wrong decisions taken regarding the bond market. It was suggested that the losses were incurred due to the dummy bids of the Capital Alliance being accepted at the February 27, 2015 auction.
Mendis answered in the affirmative when asked losses were incurred by Capital Alliance due to
holding on to their portfolio when the rates have gone high.Counsel Chanaka de Silva, referring to the affidavit Mendis had given to the Commission, suggested that it is simplistic. Both profit making and loss making analysis included in the affidavit is simplistic, Mahendrans lawyer pointed out. It was also pointed out that Capital Alliance gained a profit of Rs. 6 million, by trading the Treasury bonds they bought at the February 27,2015 auction.
Mahendrans lawyer pointed out that if Mendis had looked more into the market, he could have sold it to a higher profit.
Mendis explained that Capital Alliance was not taking 30-year Treasury bonds at that time and
they were in a hurry to get rid of a bond that they were not authorised to have.The Commission will sit again on Friday (07).

Tense situation at question time
A heated argument erupted yesterday between the government side members and JVP Parliamentarians during the round of questions for oral answers on the appointment of persons other than public representatives to the Chairmen and Co-chairmen to the District and Divisional Coordinating Committees in Parliament yesterday.
The tense situation erupted while the Policy Planning and Economic Development Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Nalinda Jayathissa from the Prime Minister and the National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister. The JVP MP inquired the names and designations of persons who are holding positions of Chairmen and Co chairmen in the district and divisional coordinating committees that are functioning throughout the country.
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said that there were 25 District Committees and 331 Divisional Coordinating Committees and tabled the list of names of the Chairmen. He added that there were 82 chairmen and co chairmen who were not public representatives.
Nalinda Jayathissa said that SLFP and UNP organizers who were not members have been appointed as chairmen. There is no such law that prevents those persons other than public representatives being appointed as chairmen, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said.
At this stage Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that there was no issue if they were party committees. But these are committees to oversee the implementation of the development projects of the government in the respective areas, JVP MP Dissanayake said. So public representatives should be appointed to chair those committees.
At this stage, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said the previous circular had said that public representatives should chair those committees. But it was amended by including the representatives of the President and Prime Minister could be appointed as the Chairmen and the Co-chairmen, Minister Abeywardena said. It was done as the Constitution was decided to be amended and many other reasons. On the other hand if the JVP needs, they could nominate their representatives and we can appoint them as co-chairmen.
Those who were defeated at the elections have been appointed as chairmen of those committees, Anura Dissanayake said. Some Parliamentarians sit as members of those District and Divisional Coordinating Committees, while those who lost the elections and persons who did not at least contest, chair the committees.
At this stage Sydney Jayaratne raising a point of order, said the JVP had no right to talk of the scenario as it had appointed persons to Parliament who did not contest at the election leaving aside those who contested at the election.
It cannot be allowed, It is not a point of order, observed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
We have asked the question from the Ministers, said Anura Kumara Dissanayake. We know as to how naked women were in the double cab when it collided. How does an MP answer a question.
I stopped the point of order, observed the Speaker.

Pathfinder Foundation to develop work programme with Sichuan University of China

Following a fact-finding tour undertaken by a team of academics representing the prestigious Sichuan University (SCU) in April at the invitation of the Pathfinder Foundation (PF), a three-member PF delegation visited SCU recently with a view to exploring avenues for cooperation with that university.
The PF delegation comprised Bernard Goonetilleke (Chairman), Luxman Siriwardena (Executive Director) and Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives (CILI) of the Pathfinder Foundation. 

Sichuan University is recognized as one of the 10 top universities in China. The university located in Chengdu, capital of the Sichuan Province, is home to approximately 16 million people. 

SCU maintains a strong partnership and exchanges with universities in Europe and the US. As such, steps taken by the Pathfinder Foundation to establish relations with SCU and Sri Lankan higher education institutions are bound to bring good dividends to Sri Lankan students. 
During the visit of SCU academic team headed by Prof. Ming Hong to Sri Lanka last April, the Pathfinder Foundation engaged in discussions to determine how the university could forge close relations with Sri Lankan universities.

Following the discussions with the Pathfinder delegation, SCU and PF are negotiating to enter in to a MoU for joint academic programmes in association with SCU. One of the highlights of the visit was the conferment of Guest Professorship of SCU to Adm. Dr. Colombage by the President of SCU, handed over to him by Prof. Yan Shijin, Vice President of SCU. Following the award, Prof. Colombage delivered a lecture on Changing Dynamics in the Indian Ocean: Geo-Strategic Competition and Dilemma of Sri Lanka.

PM concerned of injunctions against garbage disposal
KESBEWA MC CASE DRAGGING FOR TOO LONG:
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe raised concerns as to how courts can issue interim injunction orders on garbage dumping when it has been declared an essential service.
The Prime Minister, replying to a question posed to him by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake, said the problem in metropolitan Colombo and adjoining cities is not the garbage collection, but disposal.
The Premier also urged the Kesbewa Magistrates Court to give its verdict soon on a case pertaining to garbage dumping at Karadiyana.
I learnt that an interim order has been issued prohibiting garbage dumping at Muthurajawela till July 20. When the courts start issuing restraining orders like this, waste disposal in cities become problematic.The spread of dengue and other health issues will aggravate.This is a serious issue and I direct the attention of the House to it. The Municipal Council, Police and Army are ready to intervene.The courts should also act responsibly during this crisis situation, he said.
The case at the Kesbewa Magistrates Court has dragged on for three weeks now. I urge to expedite it and give the ruling. If we were not satisfied we can appeal to the High Court then. If we can use the Karadiyana dump site, then we can temporarily solve the matter without harming the environment in Muthurajawela, he noted.
The Prime Minister also said the courts have a responsibility to summon the relevant public officials and groups and inquire their positions too, before making the ruling.
Wickremesinghe said garbage disposal has become a problem in Colombo, Kolonnawa, Kaduwela, Biyagama and Kelaniya areas. We asked Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to shoulder the task of garbage disposal and Minister Faiszer Musthapha to make sure LG bodies collect the garbage properly. We want to come up with a durable solution to waste management without creating another garbage mount like Meethotamulla, he said.
He added the Government has allocated Rs 2 billion for the Aruwakkalu Sanitary Landfill Project in Puttalam in 2017 and another Rs 4 billion in 2018. Once constructed, we can use it for 20 years.The World Bank too agreed to support this project, he said.
The Premier observed that the Kandy Gohagoda dump site has also reached the maximum capacity.He said a new sanitary landfill will be constructed in Kandy.

Presidents ire justified
President Maithripala Sirisena is clearly unhappy at the snails pace in which investigations into mega corruption under the Rajapaksa government is continuing and made his displeasure known in no uncertain terms at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. An angry President, it is reported, had lashed out at the absence of results in the ongoing investigations carried out by the different investigative arms during the last two and half years, with special reference made to the Special Anti- Corruption Unit, whose term of office lapsed on June 30.
President Sirisena also observed that it was only those SLFPers who supported him who were being investigated. The President also went onto enumerate the instances of massive corruption that had taken place under the Rajapaksas, investigations into which lay in abeyance.
The Presidents ire is understandable. The absence of results in any of the significant cases now under probe, involving the Rajapaksas and their cohorts, have not only been a matter of embarrassment to the government and the President personally but had made the latter being viewed in poor light by the public, given that the main election platform of the Common Candidate rested on hunting down the thieves who ransacked the countrys coffers and bringing them to justice. The President is also mindful that lack of progress in the investigations is going to provide ammunition to the Rajapaksa camp to be used against the government and make MR and the rest cast as victims of a diabolic plot to oust them from office.
He is also aware that, had any significant breakthrough being made in the ongoing investigations, Rajapaksa would have lost the political momentum he has acquired to muster crowds and hold political rallies countrywide to undermine the authority of the government. As a spin off, the government would also have been spared the ongoing rash of protest agitations which are obviously being bankrolled by defeated politicians yearning to regain lost power. We say this because it would have been awkward indeed for protest leaders to be seen to be leading agitations which has the backing of such political elements.
It is a fact, indeed, that the initial enthusiasm shown by the FCID and other investigating arms have waned considerably and the determined thrust to go after the rogues have lost its steam. True, investigations should be painstaking with no room left for the offenders to wriggle out of the law. Investigators are also wanting in the necessary technical knowledge to unearth details of white collar crime. There are also other restrictions placed on the investigations. According to Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne he has positive proof that money has been stashed away in a Dubai bank to the credit of a former VVIP, as reported in a Sunday newspaper political column. However, Lankan investigators are being barred from moving in the matter due to the constraints imposed in respect of overseas banking.
The process, hence, is time consuming and sometimes unwinding making patience wear thin of those genuinely desirous of seeing the wrongdoers prosecuted. However, it is equally true that local cases that do not confront such restrictions are getting dragged on for some mysterious reasons that have evoked the concerns of President Sirisena. In addition, the frequent challenges thrown by members of the Joint Opposition that they are open to any probe and that the government had used the corruption allegation as an election slogan has no doubt put the government on the back foot.
Be that as it may, the Presidents observations should encourage the investigating officers to pursue their task with a single minded purpose. To begin with, investigating bodies such as the FCID are maintained at public cost. It will amount to cheating of the ordinary public if these organs are left to wither in the vine while thieves are left to enjoy the booty. Government politician who interfere with the investigations should be identified and shamed. The President, at the same Cabinet meeting, revealed that certain members of the government were with the Rajapaksas. If so, this amounts to a betrayal of not just the President but all those who helped install the Yahapalanaya government. This is because the main focus of the civil society organisations, social groups and the various Fronts including artistes, literary figures et al. was to get rid of Rajapaksa family rule and elect a government committed to good governance.
Crucial elections are round the corner and an administration that include members with fickle loyalties can only undermine the whole Yahapalanaya project.

'Roadmap a milestone in SL's commitment to change business environment'
Following is the text of the speech by World Bank Country Director, Sri Lanka and Maldives, Idah Z. Pswarayi-Riddihough, at the recent launch of the Roadmap to Improve the Investment Climate in Sri Lanka, held in Colombo:
Honorable Prime Minister, Minister Malik Samarawickrema, Secretary Ministry of Development Strategies, Honorable Ministers, members of the head table, distinguished invitees and colleagues. Its my honor to be invited to speak at this important event.
Today marks a milestone achievement in Sri Lankas commitment to change its business environment, to create more and better jobs, which in turn will end poverty and increase shared prosperity. Reforms are difficult and challenging, even for those who stand to gain the most from them.
The agenda that will be tackled today underscores Sri Lankas commitment and drive to accelerate its reform agenda. I believe that the package of reforms is sound and overall will be beneficial; but to get better than satisfactory impact the reform process will need commitment and perseverance. Sri Lanka needs to assert its position firmly in the region and in the world.
The Doing Business Report is one of the most cited reports of the World Bank globally. The assessment that goes into the report covers 190 economies. The difference between this report and that which a student gets from school is that the results are in the public domain. The intention is not to shame but to encourage and to review opportunities for corrective measures.
Another difference is that not only the assessed will use the information to determine next steps; but investors use the results to make decision on whether they invest or not. They will be looking at the actual result but also at the trend of progress over a number of years. They may even use these results to make a prediction on the following years results. This is what they call in the International Baccalaureate courses  the predicted score. Key for applying to Universities.
So its very important to not only do well in a single year, but it may actually be more important to show progress. Its a proven fact that unless the investment climate is favorable, investors will look elsewhere for options.
Sri Lanka has potential to show that its predicted score is a positive one. To do this it must stay on the reform path. Consistency and determination to deliver high quality reforms will earn credibility. The Doing Business team put out a set of criteria at the beginning of every year against which performance is assessed. It is possible that at times a countrys rating will fall even though they have carried out many reforms; but other countries may have done more and deeper ones. So, it is wise to review what the target reforms are and ensure that they too are included in the priorities. A steady pace of creating a robust regulatory and institutional foundation will help Sri Lanka raise its ranking.
You may all be aware that Georgia has been making international news, as one of the most attractive destinations for doing business. It has a business friendly approach to governance and within a short time, the country was able to cut unnecessary red tape, become increasingly transparent and design robust accountability mechanisms which in turn built the confidence of investors.
I understand that Georgia is not Sri Lanka. But I am asserting that it is possible to achieve a good ranking. Recently, Sri Lanka regained access to GSP+, an incredible opportunity to give Sri Lanka a renewed chance to attract investors  but it must be seen as business friendly. The roadmap to improve the investment climate is in place as is the Task Force to lead the work. But as with all windows of opportunity they are unfortunately time bound. Inaction over a period of time; and more importantly lack of results will hasten the windows closure. Finally, there is a need to build more buy-in from the citizens in this process. This is because when a country opens up its not only government that has a role to play, but the private sector, media, NGOs and citizens do too.
I would like to end by congratulating the Government of Sri Lanka for marking this event with the commitment that Sri Lanka Means Business. We look forward to continuing to partner with you along with DFAT and other development partners in Sri Lankas journey to rise up the ranks of the doing business index.

Sangakkara & Co decide: Test cricket should remain five days
LONDON, Tuesday: Former Pakistan batsman Ramiz Raja has urged the International Cricket Council to set aside a two-month window solely for Test matches in a bid to preserve the longest form of the game.
While crowds for Tests in countries such as England remain strong, Raja, a member of the influential MCC world cricket committee, fears interest in Asia is "dwindling" thanks partly to the rise of lucrative domestic Twenty20 competitions such as the Indian Premier League.
"I feel that the ICC has a decent plan in the shape of the World Test Championship," said Raja after a committee meeting at Lord's on Tuesday.
"There should be a window for that and everything else should stop for a period of two months so the best players are available to play Test cricket."
He added: "It's got to get better. In Asia, for example, because of poor Test match scheduling, the interest is dwindling.
"When you go back home you are never sure if you are going to have a one-Test series, a two-Test series or whether you are going to have a Test series at all."
Raja said national governing bodies such as the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the Pakistan Cricket Board had to play their part as well.
"You have to acknowledge and respect the status of Test match cricket and it has to come from the cricket boards, in Asia specifically.
"For example, MS Dhoni retired from Test cricket yet got the A-grade contract from the BCCI, Shahid Afridi retired from Test cricket yet got the A-grade contract from PCB.
"It is under a lot of stress in Asia but if we have a properly planned Test match championship, that's the way out of this, otherwise we will be struggling to put aside as much money as is available for the T20 leagues," Raja insisted.
Meanwhile the committee, whose members also include such illustrious names as Ricky Ponting, Brendon McCullum, Sourav Ganguly and Kumar Sangakkara, has come down against reducing Tests from five days to four days after it was suggested a shorter game might be more fan-friendly.
"Last time we met, the committee was split, with some believing we should trial four-day Test matches, said outgoing chairman Mike Brearley, the former England captain.
"This time, most of us thought, looking at the fact that over half the matches that got results last year got results in the fifth day, that we didnt want Test cricket to become more boring. So from a cricket point of view, we believe they should stay five days."
The committee also urged the ICC to move quickly to try to get cricket included for the 2024 Olympics, which will be staged in either Los Angeles or Paris.
"It is crucial to have cricket in the Olympics because the game will be introduced to many new parts of the world," said Raja.
"But for that to happen we have to present a unified front from cricket that we want to be included in the Games.
"Los Angeles would be perfect -- I played cricket there and youd get massive crowds."
Brearley added it also be a huge boost to cricket in China as the Chinese government would inject huge funds if they had an Olympic team. - AFP

Schools actively involved in national reconciliation
Hindu College Bambalapitya with over 700 students was involved in national integration under the Reconciliation friendly Schools Programme initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena as the Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation. The reconciliation friendly school programme was held on June 30, and Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchession, participated as Chief Guest.
State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, A.H.M. Fowze, Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Dr. Harsha De Silva, and Representative of Unicef, Tim Sutton, Secretary, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation V. Sivagnanasothy, Principal, Hindu College T.P. Parameswaran, and other dignitaries participated.
The objective of this event is to promote national integration and reconciliation among school teachers and children and empower school children as peace messengers and peace advocates in society. In a pluralistic society it is important to recognize the multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural and multi-regional diversities as a source of strength and richness while inculcating the concept of mother-land as a theme for stronger integration and reconciliation, said the Secretary Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, Sivagnanasothy.
The school children and participants expressed the need for healing, reparation, transitional justice and arrangements for non-recurrence as important elements in the reconciliation process. Religious fanatism, ethnic extremism, regional extremism and racism and economic imbalances have affected national unity, co-existence, peace and reconciliation in the past. Lack of trust and mutual understanding have created divisions and segregation among societies in specific pockets. Shortsighted political and vested groups have been instrumental in creating disturbances through hate speeches and religious and ethnic clashes in such places.
The integration friendly school programme aims to create a change in the attitude , mindsets and behavioral patterns which calls for respect of other religions and ethnicities as a way forward, said Sivagnanasothy. The Government policy on official languages and singing the National Anthem in both languages has strengthened the integration process. The reconciliation declaration was read in all three languages and the students and school administration committed to continue the discussions as an on-going activity in the school assembly. The Australian High Commissioner explained the experiences of the Australian indigenous community reconciliation initiatives as a success story.

Sesame Street introduces new Muppet to promote education, gender equity in Afghanistan

Sesame Street introduces new Muppet to promote education, gender equity in Afghanistan.
There's a new Muppet in town on "Sesame Street," and he's promoting gender equity.
His name is Zeerak, he's 4, and he is the younger brother of Zari, Sesame Street's first Afghan Muppet. Both characters are featured on "Baghch-e-Simsim" ("Sesame Garden"), the Afghan co-production of the long-running children TV show.
Zeerak is described as an "adorable orange Muppet" who wears glasses and regional Afghan clothing. His name means "smart" and "talented" in both of Afghanistan's official languages, Pashto and Dari.
Both he and Zari, introduced in 2016, are intended to show young people in Afghanistan, where women's rights have deteriorated under the Taliban, that girls can be as heroic as boys.
Zari is an eager and curious 6-year-old who does well in school. Last season she was featured in segments that focused on girls' empowerment, national identity, physical health and social and emotional well-being,according to the Sesame Workshop, which produces the show.
And kids loved her. According to a 2017 "Baghch-e-Simsim" survey, there was little difference between boys and girls in their positive feelings about Zari and she had the highest likability among kids' TV characters. The survey also found that "Baghch-e-Simsim" reaches 3.1 million kids aged 3 to 7 in Afghanistan.
In the current season, which premiered last week, Zeerak's segments will cover such topics as respect, tolerance and gender equality. He looks up to his educated big sister as a role model. She assures him he will soon have the opportunity to attend school and "that working hard in school will help him achieve his dreams," according to a Sesame Workshop press release.
Promoting education is important in a country like Afghanistan, which has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world -- about 31% of the adult population. Its female literacy rate is even lower, at 17%.
"We're thrilled to welcome Zeerak into the 'Baghch-e-Simsim' family and continue our work to model the importance of girls' education and bring critical early learning to millions of Afghan children," said Sherrie Westin, an executive vice president for Sesame Workshop. "We know children learn best when they can identify with characters, and research shows that Zari has been a powerful role model for boys and girls alike."

SL has to increase exports, attract more FDIs to repay debts - PM
The government will not allow the huge tax burden to fall on to the next generation, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He was addressing the opening ceremony of Institute of Bankers Sri Lanka (IBSL) Towers in Narahenpita yesterday.
He said that Sri Lanka still have to borrow for debt servicing but emphasized that credit was been taken on favorable terms. Sri Lanka has to increase exports and attract more FDI and increase GDP and then the country would be in a position to repay debts in six to seven years.
Wickremesinghe said that the regaining of GSP Plus concession too would help to expand.
The country must now expand the export basket and take advantage of the 6,000 off items that will enjoy the GSP Plus. We have been able to reduce the debt to GDP from 79% to 70% and our aim is to bring it down to 60% soon, he said.
The Premier said they estimates that the government would have to pay at least US$ one billion from 2019 to 2022 as debt servicing.
Wickremesinghe said that the total assets held in the financial institutional market was estimated to be around Rs 23 trillion. This does not count the money that is in the black market and this was nearly two times of the countrys annual GDP. These assets are nearly 38 times the total value of the currency printed by CBSL, he said.

Sri Lanka opt to bowl first

Angelo Mathews won the toss and chose to bowl first expecting early assistance from the Hambantota surface, but Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer was pleased his team would be defending a score, as he felt the pitch would deteriorate as the day went on.
A ferocious crosswind that has been blowing across the ground since the morning will test both sides.
Zimbabwe made two changes to their XI. They changed one seam bowler, replacing Donald Tiripano with Carl Mumba, who was a late addition to the squad - flying in after Wellington Masakadza was ruled out of the series with an ankle injury. They also made a change in their batting order, bringing in Tarisai Musakanda for Ryan Burl.
Sri Lanka were unchanged, with Lakshan Sandakan and Wanidu Hasaranga making up the frontline spin-bowling contingent, and Dushmantha Chameera, Lasith Malinga, and Nuwan Pradeep playing as the frontline quicks.
There is no rain forecast for the duration of the match.

## Title: Striking a deal with private practice
## Supertitle:

Striking a deal with private practice
As this article is being penned, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), the trade union of the government service doctors, have given notice of their decision to launch an indefinite strike from 5th July 2017 onwards, until their demand that the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) be taken over by the state.
Following calls by religious and society leaders, the GMOA claims that it has postponed it strike by one week.
The GMOAs ostensible reason for striking, is because they believe, based on a report of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, that the SAITM, falls short in some areas for a medical educational institution. So, the ostensible reason is all about ensuring quality standards in medical services for the Sri Lankan public. To provide the Sri Lankan public with quality medical care the GMOA intend to deny the public medical care, all in the name of ensuring that subsequent care they receive after the strike would be of an assured standard, we presume. Surely a simpler solution would be for the SAITM to engage in a supervised process of remedying its deficiencies. Given the crucial role that medical services play in the life of the community, literally and the wellbeing of the public, the conduct of the GMOA, requires some public scrutiny.
Hippocratic Oath
The high hurdle of course with a doctors strike is should doctors strike at all. Unlike any other profession, doctors are engaged in an essential humanitarian service in which human life is at stake. The preservation of human life is the highest and most basic of societal and hence the states interest. Further, for thousands of years going back to ancient Greek civilisation, doctors have taken or are believed to have subscribed to the Hippocratic Oath.
The Hippocratic Oath among other things has doctors pledging to preserve life and to always act in the interest of the patient. Clearly, the action of striking or refusing to perform their medical service flies in the face of and is in violation of the medical oath and ethics.
Why not strike private practice
Sri Lankan doctors are a privileged lot, receiving as they do, free education from primary school through medical college. As beneficiaries of this public funded largess, their only responsibility is to serve the public as government doctors, entitled to privileges such as duty-free vehicle permits and the right to lucrative private practice after hours. The public or government health service is accessed by Sri Lankas lower income section of society. All those who can afford private health care or have medical insurance opt for private hospitals. Accordingly, the GMOA action of striking only and exclusively their public service just comes across as knavish.
After all, the better option for doctors, who have qualified through the public purse would be to strike their private practice and do their public service of serving poorer sections of society or at least strike both public as well as private practice so that their action is principled and not cynical and opportunistic. Now the GMOA will argue that their employer is the government or rather the state, with whom they have a dispute. However, the standards at SAITM are not directly or even indirectly related to the Government doctors pay, work conditions or any other direct impact on their terms or conditions of work. It is only in relation to a single institutions training standard, which matter is before the Courts, a matter of higher education policy on which several governments past and present have progressively and systematically taken decisions, going back to the early days of the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC).
Dengue epidemic
Sri Lanka is currently in the midst of a dengue and viral fever epidemic with hospitals and health care institutions overloaded and unable to cope with the situation. In such a situation to persist with a strike is to sentence many patients to a certain death, all in the name of ensuring standards of medical higher education. Really!!! There are certain categories of public servants who are not entitled to strike and the security services are the best example. There are internal grievance redress mechanisms but it is not possible to refuse to work. It is clear that at the grassroots level, that doctors are losing the publics respect. Already social media is awash with messages to boycott the private practice of the GMOA executive committee members. The GMOA understands this and hence their regular press conferences and other attempts at winning over the public regarding their demands. But it is impossible to defend a really bad brief and the GMOA is not making any headway in their public relations campaign to secure public support for their strikes. Now the GMOA may argue that they continue essential services and it is primarily nonlife-threatening treatment and services which they strike. But failure to treat at early stages would only aggravate illnesses.
Private higher education
The Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) has long argued for a significant higher budgetary allocation for higher education, contending correctly that Sri Lankas higher education is under-resourced. Accordingly insisting on Sri Lankas medical higher education being a state monopoly is ridiculous. Due to Sri Lankas district quota system of university admissions, very well qualified candidates say from the Colombo, Gampaha and Jaffna districts will fail to get into medical school, although those with lesser qualifications from other less privileged districts will get admission. Now, this affirmative action has merit for equitability. However, we must have a method to enable these students to then even pay and get their desired and required medical education. Sri Lanka has a low ratio of doctors on a per capita basis, so there is a need to increase our number of doctors. All the doctors, GMOA members included going abroad for their specialisation or higher studies.
The way forward for Sri Lanka is to have private higher education, which we already do in fields such as computer science, law and management and business studies. Nationalising and kicking around the first private medical college is not the way to attract new investment into private higher education in Sri Lanka. The GMOA opposed the Indian ambulance service, the ETCA with India and now the SAITM. Where will they end

Sumanthiran calls on the government to keep its initial pledge to the people

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A Sumanthiran today called on the Government to keep its initial pledge to the people and complete the task of Constitutional reforms circumventing the snags it has come across.
Speaking at the debate in Parliament, the MP urged the Government to put the draft Bill on Constitution before people and seek their opinion at a referendum.
I am confident, the majority of people, if they are well informed and advised, will endorse the legislation. The Government has to have the courage to do the right thing, the MP stressed.
If the religious leaders are deciding the laws of the country, why do we sit in this Parliament in the first place he questioned.
Sumanthiran, insisting that the country needs a new Constitution, cautioned the Government not to lose the golden opportunity before the country to bring in meaningful Constitutional reforms acceptable to all communities.
The sub-committees sat for many months and completed their reports and the Steering Committee has already conducted over 60 meetings. We should not concede defeat at this level. People gave their mandate to this Government to bring in a new Constitution and this mandate must be respected. The very purpose of forming a Unity Government was to bring in a new Constitution. Both the JVP and TNA, though in the Opposition, support the Government in this endeavor, said Sumanthiran.

Surge in Diplomacy, Action in Mediation
The fourth edition of the Istanbul conference on Mediation took place on June 30, 2017 with the theme of Surge in Diplomacy, Action in Mediation. Experts, diplomats, practitioners and scholars from around the world explored ways and means to promote mediation as a prominent conflict prevention and resolution method.
The profile of mediation has been rising globally since Turkey and Finland led the way at the United Nations through the Mediation for Peace initiative.
The initiative culminated in the establishment of the Group of Friends of Mediation. The Group now has 53 members, including 48 states and 5 international organizations. There has also been substantial improvement in international capacity for preventive diplomacy and mediation within the UN, regional and sub-regional organizations and civil society.
The group has become the leading platform at the UN to promote mediation. It has initiated the adoption of four UN General Assembly Resolutions, which lay the ground for the development of the normative and conceptual framework of mediation.
The Group has also contributed to the 2012 United Nations Guidance for Effective Mediation, a fundamental document for those who practice and study mediation worldwide.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has expressed his willingness to further develop UNs mediation support capacity. His efforts are most commendable. We all on all UN member states to support UNSG Guterres broad vision and efforts to prevent and solve todays conflicts. Turkey has been doing her part. Turkey is situated next to a vast region where acute active and frozen conflicts persist. Prevention and peaceful resolution of conflicts is a central feature of Turkeys enterprising and humanitarian foreign policy.
"Turkey undertakes various efforts in a wide geography from Africa to the Middle East, the Balkans and the Caucasus. She sees peacemaking in a humanitarian-development nexus. This year, Turkey has again become the most generous nation in the world in terms of per capita humanitarian assistance, Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs Mevlt Cavusoglu said in a statement.
"Turkey, has been hosting the Istanbul Conferences on Mediation since 2012. These landmark conferences are designed to bring together numerous practitioners and scholars in the field of conflict prevention and mediation activities. The aim of these conferences is to promote synergies between theory and practice and help increase scope, reach and effectiveness of the international communitys mediation efforts. I must pay tribute to the efforts of mediators engaging daily in conflicts worldwide.
"This year the Conference explored how mediation methodology and practice can take better account of the needs of the day. In this regard, two questions in particular would be scrutinized. One is the potential of mediation in all stages of a conflict continuum, namely from prevention to resolution and all the way to peace agreement implementation. The second key question would be the models for greater employment of mediation as a preventive tool in contexts where political, ethnic, religious biases create an environment of hostility.
"The latter is especially pertinent since we have come to sadly witness extreme tendencies in various forms of political, social and religious animosities. The rise in attacks in Europe against Muslims and migrants is a case in point. Prevention is key. However, prevention would be possible only when societies recognize and learn to respect differences and engage in genuine dialogue and interaction. I believe that mediators who are well-equipped with the cultural codes of conduct in a given conflict situation can reach remarkable success. For that, we need to train more mediators including at youth while encouraging more women mediators and equip the with the right tools.
"Our challenges to make peace the overwhelming reality on a global level are immense. However, we should be able to see the opportunities within those challenges. The readiness and willingness of the international community to build capacity in peaceful resolution of conflicts including mediation must be a priority. As we prepare to welcome participants of the Fourth Istanbul Mediation Conference, I call on the international community to take action in mediation".

Ton-up Bailey leads Hampshire to huge total
LONDON, Tuesday: Australia's George Bailey led from the front on Tuesday, with the Hampshire captain's century the centerpiece of a huge total against Surrey in the First Division of the English County Championship.
Bailey's 161 was the third and largest hundred in the visitors' imposing first-innings score of 648 for seven declared on the second day of four at The Oval.
Title-chasers Hampshire also saw former Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Ervine make 83 and Ian Holland an unbeaten 58. Surrey closed on 113 for one, with the in-form Mark Stoneman out for 57.
There was an even bigger total in the Second Division as Sean Dickson's triple century took Kent to 701 for seven declared against Northamptonshire at Beckenham.
The 25-year-old South Africa-born opener became the first Kent batsman since the Second World War to pass 300 while his partnership of 382 with former England batsman Joe Denly, who scored 182, was a club record for any wicket.
Having started the day on 210, Dickson was eventually out for 318 - having hit 31 fours and three sixes in nearly eight-and-a half hours at the crease.
Meanwhile South Africa leg-spinner Imran Tahir ensured batsmen were not the only ones enjoying themselves on Tuesday by taking five for 98 as Durham were reduced to 274 for eight in reply to Derbyshire's 368 in a Second Division clash at Chesterfield.

TREADING ON UNCOMMON GROUNDS
Her resume reads like it belongs to three or four different people. The reason behind this is that she has shown skills in many diverse directions. 26-year-old Buddhima Subasinghe continues to make waves in many sectors.
The multitalented youth completed her PhD in the field of Cyber Crime Investigation and Conflict Resolution in Social Media using Web Artificial Intelligence in 2016. She is the only Sri Lankan researcher who presented her PhD research at the first global IEEE International Women In Engineering Conference On Electrical And Computer Engineering WIECON-ECE 2015 in December 2015. She has completed the ITIL Professional Foundation Examination for IT Service Management (ITSM) scoring 100 percent marks in 2014. Buddhima has won the Best Research Paper Gold Award at the National Conference on Technology and Management 2014 for a publication of the PhD Research. She has also been appointed to represent Sri Lanka at the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), Technical Committee TC14 from June 2016 as an academic and a scholar researching in the field of Information Communication Technology.
Buddhima was the first English Buddhist news bulletin producer and presenter at the Buddhist Channel Sri Lanka. She is working in Sri Lanka Rupavahini Cooperation as a presenter from 2011.
It all comes down to your focus. If you are fully focused on something at a time, you can give your 100 percent to it. I also sleep less than four hours per day. This habit came about when I got heavily involved in the media during my university days. Media was my passion and I even wrote to several newspapers during that era, she said.
She notes that another reason for her focus is the spiritual development that she has gained. She has been mindful of thoughts that run through her mind for several years.
It has always been so as I have studied in the Sri Sambodhi Vihara English Dhamma School ever since I was five years. I have been brought up in a very religious background. It has been over a decade that I am teaching Abidhamma in my Dhamma School. I finished the diploma in Dhamma and Abhi Dhamma in 2007. I have been practicing meditation and training my mind to be mindful about all the tasks I do, be it lecturing, speaking at a conference, driving, studying etc. The right focus has always been the key to my success, she added.
She stepped into the media field through the Buddhist Channel. Her first task was to present the Sinhala news bulletin there. She was 18 years old then. This too was a challenge since she has always done her studies in English.
However I did not let the opportunity go. I decided to byheart the content and got the opportunity to do the news for a few months before starting the first English news bulletin in the channel as the producer and the presenter, she said.
She moved onto discussion based programs later. She got an invitation from SLRC and hosted Rise and Shine morning show and Business Today on a rostered basis.
Buddhima was the head prefect of Willesden College International for two years. She did bio chemistry, physics and maths originally but wanted to shift to applied ITC during her second year.
Gateway College gave me that opportunity so I went to there and studied the content of the two year Advanced Level syllabus in one year. I was basically a student of both schools during my final year, Buddhima explained with a smile.
She completed her London GCE Advanced Level Examination in 2008 before joining SLIIT where she took up a double degree. She became the youngest graduate at the institute and joined the staff there. She completed her PhD at Peradeniya University in 2016. She will be taking up studies at the Engineering Faculty at Moratuwa University next month.
Buddhima has been invited to be a speaker at several renowned programs like IEEE Young Professionals and Women in Engineering Congress 2016, APNIC 42 International Conference, and IEEE Young Professionals and Women in Engineering Congress 2015. She was the MC and Moderator for the 13th AGM of the Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable Development and the International Summit on Climatic Change, Adaptation and Mitigation, the Moderator and Discussion Facilitator at the World Conference on Youth, and a Young Ambassador at the Commonwealth heads of the Government meeting. She has won accolades from Toastmasters International. She has been invited to speak at the IEEE Global Women in Engineering Leadership Summit 2017 that will be held from July 13 to 15 in Goa, India.
Queried on what she found challenging in all the tasks that she has handled so far Buddhima said that she has gotten double promotions ever since her school days.
I was always the youngest in the class. Therefore every single moment in my life was filled with difficulties. I had to put on a lot of effort to reach my goals in life, she said dubbing her life as a rollercoaster journey.
Buddhimas father, K D K Subasinghe, is a customs officer. Her mother, Chandralatha Subasinghe, had been employed at the Higher Education Ministry. Her brother, Umesh Ravindu, is in grade seven.
The day that she completed the defense examination of her PhD was the most memorable moment for her because that was the last stage of examination.
That was my happiest moment in life because I have been working really hard for it. There have been a lot of professors who have offered many encouraging words throughout my life. I am forever grateful to them. I am also thankful to my Toastmasters family from which I have achieved great heights in leadership. This year I have assumed duties as the Toastmasters International Training and Leadership Institute Chair for District 82, she noted.

Buddhima has a few words of wisdom to offer to the youth.
If you can practice living in the present moment, you can certainly make most out of what you do in life and achieve great heights and reach the pinnacle of success. As an Abi dhamma teacher for a decade or so, I have been practicing what I teach my students, the beauty of the practice of right concentration and mindfulness, which has immensely supported me and has been a blessing in my life, she expressed.

I always love to do something different and inspire people as over the years it has given me a great satisfaction in seeing people taking me as an example in their lives. When people come up to you and say, Buddhima, you are a role model, I want to be like you - that means a lot to me. I feel I have achieved myself.
In all of the discoveries in life she believes that discovering oneself is very important. Once this is done, one needs to live his or her passion with courage, determination and the right focus.
You can accomplish your dreams if the right action is taken towards its attainment. Do what you love and love what you do. I am who I am today all because I am passionate about what I do every single moment in my life. I adore, love, and enjoy all that I do. And I do it all with a smile, she concluded.

Unilever, Plan International to uplift Padaviya hygienic conditions
Unilever Sri Lanka and Plan International partnered a one year project aimed at improving the poor hygiene issues in the Padaviya division, by ensuring school children inculcate the lifesaving habit of washing hands with soap.
World Health Organization states Handwashing with soap at key points is the simplest and most effective way to save lives. In 2008, the Global handwashing day was announced, which Unilever through its flagship brand Lifebuoy has celebrated every year since the commencement.
Creating a healthy and child friendly learning environment for children at early ages is critical for their better growth. Hygienic habits that children learn in their formative years help them practice this behavior in their families and pass on the knowledge to society. When children are equipped with the right skills, they are the best change agents. said, Sian Platt, Plan International Sri Lanka, Acting Country Director. Our water, sanitation and hygiene programme is both school and community-led, which aligns with our child-centred community development approach.
We work to ensure children and community members have a voice and choice in the decisions that affect their lives, and that enable them to act as agents of change.
Furthermore, teaching appropriate skills and practices to promote good hygiene practices among school children is considered an essential part of our water, sanitation and hygiene promotion programmes, which is why we are pleased to partner with Unilever in supporting the school children of Padaviya, Platt added.
Identifying the need for improved health in the region for a better tomorrow, Unilever Sri Lanka and Plan International worked together in the planning and implementing of the joint project to advocate for better hygiene through sustainable handwashing practices. Through the endeavor, 11 schools in Padaviya will receive a facility for handwashing , children between the ages of 5-12 will be educated on the habit of handwashing, positive re-enforcements will be carried out throughout the year to ensure the habit is created and adequate soap will be provided for all schools.

The unparalleled  Fernando Bros
They were the talk in sports circles in the country in the 1960s. Three brothers who made waves with their stick artistry and three coaches the likes of which will never ever be seen again.Sad that the rare achievement of the FERNANDO brothers went unheralded, unrecognized and unsung.
They hailed from the green, white and green school St.Benedicts College, Kotahena from which proud school hails the writer too. The three brothers were SPORTS LEGENDS unparalleled.
I am referring to firstly to the three brothers who were a rare breed the likes of which will never or be seen again  the FERNANDOS  STANLEY, HOMER and SUBASH. They were magicians with the curved wand on the hockey field, not only locally but internationally too. And their natural stick work was watched and soaked in awe. They were to Sri Lanka what the great Dhyan Chand was to India when India ruled the hockey world.
Rewrote the record books
In fact the three FERNANDO brothers rewrote the hockey and all sports record books by being the only three brothers to represent the country, a record never before achieved in any world sport when they proudly sported the Sri Lankan jerseys dribbled for the country at the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1966. This is an achievement that should have found a spot in the GUINNESS BOOK of records.
Before going on to dwell and sing hosannas firstly on the FERNANDO BROTHERS, I would like to nudge Old Benedictines and sports fans and reminisce on the excellence of three coaches who were second to none  ALBERT FERNANDO (SOCCER), RAM SUNTHERALINGAM (BASKETBALL) and BRIAN ASSEY (HOCKEY). They made the school and the country proud. Oh for the likes of them now. (About the three coaches in the SPORTS LEGENDS columns to follow).
The FERNANDO brothers were a connoisseurs delights to watch. From a very early age STANLEY showed captaincy material in him and it came as no surprise when he captained the school, the Old Bens and then achieving the dream of every sportsman, that of captaining the country.
Generalissimo on the field
Paying in the arduous position of centre half, he was the generalissimo on the field. He led by example. He dished out some canny passes to his strikers and would be back in flash when having to defend. He was always pushing his team mates to give that extra bit, even when the chips were down and his mates would oblige ungrudgingly because they respected and admired his leadership.
STANLEY was a stickler for discipline. Be it his two brothers or other team mates he would lay down the rules and that was it. Be it practice or match, punctuality he steadfastly enforced. No excuses were tolerated be it when he led the school, the club or the country. They respected him because he earned it by example.
HOMER was a stunning left extreme. He was born with a speedy pair of legs, that would have been the envy of the best pf sprinters.
He had amazing stick work. With ball glued to his wand he would dash down the wing dribbling past the defenders and send in some superb passes for his strikers and he even earned the plaudits from the world champions of hockey, the Indians, when they played here in the early 1960s.
SUBASH the third of the four brothers  the last being SARATH who did not have the hockey blood of his brothers in him  was a centre par excellence. He was blessed with the rare flair from the time he held the stick and he would breach any defence with magical dribbling and what a treat and joy he gave those watching and heartbreak to his opponents and the many winning goals he scored were stunning and still vivid in the writers mind.
The three brothers lived a stones throw away from the school ground at Bloemendhal Road, Kotahena are sadly no more. It would be an admirable gesture of gratitude and goodwill if the school authorities even at this late stage get the authorities to name that lane FERNANDO LANE.
Fame and honour
This is being urged considering the world record and the fame and honour they brought to the game, the school, the club and the country by being the first set of siblings of brothers to play for the country  something never before or ever likely to be equaled or surpassed. St.Benedicts College and the Sri Lanka Hockey Federation please take note.
That was also the era when the St. Benedicts College gave to the game six players who represented the country at the same time. To name them  Stanley Fernando, Homer Fernando, Subash Fernando, Anthony McIntyre, AssissiNattar and BatchoSelvaraj. No school or club can lay claims to this achievement.
The FERNANJDO brothers were fortunate in having a hockey crazy uncle in WALTER who also formed the United Youngsters Hockey Club and showed and taught his three nephews all about the game, which they took to like ducks to water and made them rewrite the record books. They were later coached by BRIAN ASSEY.
Father shed tears of joy
The FERNANDO brothers were the siblings of Joseph Agapit father and mother Soosai Therese who were their guiding lights and father would always be present be it a school, club or international match unobtrusively watching his proud sons perform. Living in the neighbourhoodAgapit met me the day his sons created the record, shed tears of joy and thanked me for the publicity given them which made them go places.
I can vouch for these facts because during that golden and glorious Benedictine era of sport I covered sports for both the Times and the Daily Mirror.
It is not late for the Benedictine family which last year celebrated the schools 150th anniversary to go down memory lane and recognize, appreciate and honour their outstanding sportsmen. The Old Bens Sports Club which had a surfeit of trophies won by these sportsmen par excellence must take the lead in this aspect.
The FERNANDO brothers will remain monuments in Sri Lankan sport. Their guru was the famous Bro. Mathias assisted by Leslie Figurado.

Waiting to Vote
In a few months, some Sri Lankans could be going to the polls again in what would the first electoral test of strength for the National Unity government which assumed office nearly two years ago.
This is because the tenure of the North Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils end on October 1 and elections will be due for those councils. The Elections Commission is to call for nominations in a gazette notification that is expected shortly.
Local government elections to over three hundred local government bodies throughout the country were due to be held in 2016 but have been delayed. The government maintains that issues related to the delimitation of electoral divisions are the reasons for the delay but the opposition accuses the government of postponing the election because it claims the governments popularity has been dented in recent months.
Provincial polls though are a different prospect. That is because the polls will be held in three different regions in the country, each with its own demographic and socio-political quirks. It is also relevant to note that, at present, all provincial councils in the country barring the Northern Provincial Council are controlled by the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), an advantage that party secured at the height of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas powers.
Provincial Council polls
The other factor on which there has already been some discussion even before the provincial elections could be called is that, unlike with the local government polls, there appears to be no provision for the postponement of these elections.
This has been noted by Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya. He is of the view that Provincial Council polls could be postponed only with the Amendment of Article 154 E of the Constitution. This article states that A Provincial Council shall, unless sooner dissolved, continue for a period of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and the expiration of the said period of five years shall operate as dissolution of the Council.
This, seemingly, allows no discretionary clauses. The Commission believes that this could not be amended with only a two-thirds majority in Parliament. This is a matter linked with the peoples franchise. Therefore, the Commission believes that it would require approval by the people at a referendum Commission Chairman Deshapriya explained this week. The Commission has communicated its views to all political parties.
While the government is unlikely to pursue a referendum, Article 154E could still be contested. If that happens, the Supreme Court could be called upon to adjudicate on the issue as it is a matter of interpretation of the Constitution. This is in accordance with Article 125(1) of the Constitution.
The same Provincial Councils which are slated to go to the polls after their term expires on October 1, chose their representatives last in September 2012. At that election, the UPFA swept the board in all three provinces, although it could not obtain an absolute majority in the Eastern Province, where it set up an administration in partnership with the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC).
Among the three provinces, perhaps the most interesting tussle will be in the North Central Provincial Council (NCPC). At the 2012 election, the UPFA was a runaway winner, garnering 61% of the popular vote and 21 seats in the 33-member Council. Much has changed since then.
Sirisena and Rajapaksa camps
At the presidential election in January 2015, the Anuradhapura district voted for Mahinda Rajapaksa but the Polonnaruwa district voted for their hometown candidate, Maithripala Sirisena. At the August 2015 general election that followed, the UPFA-which had candidates from both the Rajapaksa and Sirisena camps of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) - again emerged victorious in the Anuradhapura district while the United National Party (UNP) emerged winners in Polonnaruwa. However, it is worthwhile noting that the Anuradhapura district has more than twice as many voters as the Polonnaruwa district, so whoever wins this district will almost certainly win the province.
The tussle for power between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa camps in the SLFP has also been played out at the NCPC. Shortly after President Maithripala Sirisenas victory at the presidential election, Chief Minister S.M. Ranjith, a close loyalist of Rajapaksa was removed and Peshala Jayaratne, a Sirisena loyalist was appointed for the top job in the province. Recently too there have been simmering tensions between the two SLFP factions in the NCPC.
What also makes elections to the NCPC interesting is that both the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts are home to two SLFP heavyweights: Polonnaruwa is the political base of President Sirisena and Anuradhapura is where the SLFPs General Secretary Duminda Dissanayakes father Berty Premalal Dissanayake held sway as Chief Minister for 13 years. Thus the Sirisena camp of the SLFP will be keen to ensure that it prevails in the province.
In the Sabaragamuwa province too, the UPFA recorded an impressive victory at the last provincial polls in 2012, securing nearly 60% of the vote and 28 seats in the 44-member Council. At the last presidential election, both the Ratnapura and Kegalle districts voted in favour of Rajapaksa. At the general elections, however, the UNP secured the Kegalle district, while Ratnapura remained with the UPFA.
Ratnapura has often been a battleground for two prominent SLFP politicians, Minister John Seneviratne and former Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi. The former is now with President Sirisena and the latter is an avowed loyalist of Rajapaksa. When polls are held in the province, another proxy war between the two of them is likely.
Although the UPFA retained control of the Eastern Province at its last poll in 2012, that was in coalition with the SLMC. The UPFA won 14 seats while the SLMC won 7 seats, thus securing a working majority in the 37-member Council. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) secured 11 seats while the UNP secured only 4 seats.
At the presidential election, however, all three districts- Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Ampara (Digamadulla) - voted overwhelmingly for President Sirisena. At the general elections that followed, the UNP recorded convincing majorities in the Ampara and Trincomalee districts. In the Batticaloa district, the TNA secured more than half of the votes cast. Thus the overall outcome in this province could yet be anybodys guess.
The major issue underpinning this election will be the division with the SLFP, between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa camps. Until now there has been in-fighting but, even at the August 2015 general election, the UPFA presented combined lists of nominees with both camps represented in them. That is unlikely in the forthcoming polls.
The Rajapaksa camp and the Joint Opposition (JO) are gearing to contest as a separate entity. This is likely to be as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) of which G.L. Peiris is the nominal leader.
The Rajapaksa camp has been toying with the idea of breaking away from the SLFP for some time now and the provincial polls may well force their hand. They will feel that, in the first round of elections, they have two provinces- in the North Central Province and Sabaragamuwa- where they can count on substantial grassroots level support.
It goes without saying that the performances of the two factions of the SLFP will be closely watched. Whoever emerges victorious can lay claim to having the endorsement of the large SLFP vote base. The reality though is that any split in the SLFP vote between the Sirisena led mainstream SLFP and Rajapaksas JO will only benefit the UNP which may well stand a chance of regaining power in the North Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces after a lapse of many years.
When Mahinda Rajapaksa was President he chose to stagger provincial council elections, possibly because he could then concentrate his party machinery on a few provinces at any given time.
Therefore, the polls in the North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provinces, if and when they are held, will only be the beginning of another round of elections. Polls will be due next year in the Northern, Central and North Western (Wayamba) provinces, followed by the remaining provinces (Uva, Western and Southern provinces) in 2019.
Thus, the provincial polls could provide an absorbing lead-up to the national elections which are due by 2020. More importantly, they will provide the voter with an opportunity to register their approval or dissatisfaction of the different political parties- and will also be the first test of popularity for the government, which has now been in office for almost two years.

ZPMC uses electricity to power gantry cranes at Colombo South Port
ZPMC Lanka Company (Private) Limited, the joint venture between Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company Limited of China and Access Engineering PLC, is engaged in a contract for the conversion of 40 numbers of diesel engine driven rubber tired gantry cranes (RTG) into electricity driven gantries (ERTG) at Colombo South Port operated by Colombo International Container Terminals Limited.
The design, manufacture and supply of the electricity driven gantry system was awarded to Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company Ltd while construction, installation and commissioning was subcontracted to ZMPC Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
The project was initiated by Colombo International Container Terminals Ltd (CICT) with the objective of establishing a Green Port concept with a significant reduction of GHG emissions approximately by 45% and the reduction of cost per tons of equivalent units (Cost/TEU).
The scope of the work entrusted to ZPMC Lanka includes the construction of four numbers of convertor stations, a DC conductor bus bar system, modification of RTGs inclusive of installation of power trolleys, high voltage and low voltage cable laying with termination work and commissioning and handing over of the project.
Meeting the tight time schedule in the execution of the project is extremely challenging while the CICT terminal is in full operation and the daily requirements of the RTGs should be provided while only few RTGs are allocated for modification.
A qualified and well experienced set of Chinese technical experts are currently engaged in the construction and commissioning work along with the ZPMC Lanka engineering team to complete the project, scheduled for October 2017.

New Constitution will fulfill peoples mandate
It is the responsibility of the government to fulfil the peoples mandate and even the Mahanayake Theras are a part of it, Cabinet Spokesperson and Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senarathne said.
He made this observation yesterday at the cabinet press conference when asked about the Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas decision that there is no need to bring in a new Constitution as it will create more conflicts in the country.
The final decision has to be made by Parliament. Six committees have been appointed in which some secretaries are from the Opposition.The Parliament now sits in as a Constitution Assembly like in 1972. The reports formulated by these six committees will be submitted to Parliament. If it is passed by a two thirds majority and if the Supreme Court orders to go for a referendum, people can come up with their opinions, he said.
Minister Senaratne said that before objecting to the drafting of the new constitution, they should understand the real objectives and questioned for how long the country can run without a new constitution. We are formulating the new constitution to implement it and not just to keep watching. People can express their views and opinions when it is completed. We cannot come to a final decision based on opinions forwarded by some organisations. It has been clearly stated that the new constitution would be implemented only if the Sinhala majority agrees to it, he said. Minister Senaratne pointed out that even in the past important decisions like making the Tamil language one of the national languages and devolving the power were opposed initially but later they were introduced.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said still the final draft of the constitution has not been made and it is being discussed.
Many have expressed their opinions individually as well as a party. Some agree to the proposals made at the committee meeting but will go out and object it, he said. He said the people need to understand the real objectives behind the need for a new constitution for the betterment of the country.

Vidyaratnes irresponsible act lost opportunity to provide solutions
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he regretted the high handed and irresponsible action taken by Provincial Council Member Samantha Vidyaratne on July 3 by issuing a veiled threat to him when he went on an inspection tour of the Uma Oya project to look into the grievances and problems of affected people in the Bandarawela area.
Amaraweera said this action taken by Vidyaratne prevented a fine opportunity to find solutions to the problems caused by the Uma project to the people in Bandarawela.
Amaraweera toured the villages in the entire affected area accompanied by Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne. Later Minister Vijayamuni Zoysa also joined them and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had intimated his inability to join them due to another urgent official matter.
Amaraweera said while they were looking into the problems of residents in Uda Peruwa where a large number of houses had been damaged, Samantha Vidyaratne arrived on the spot.
After talking in an amicable and friendly manner Vidyaratne took him to a nearby house and threatened to hold him prisoner until a categorical statement was made to halt the project completely.
Amaraweera said when he told Vidyaratne that they had come to gather ideas and views of the people to be submitted to the cabinet and thereafter a decision would be taken on the basis of expert views rather than political grounds.
Even through officers of the building research organization repeatedly told him to move out of the house as it would collapse at any moment Vidyaratne pressed his hands to his (Amaraweeras) chest and insisted that he would not be allowed to go until a firm decision was announced. At this point, security personnel intervened and allowed him and his team to move out of the house. Amaraweera said he considered Vidyaratnes behaviour with total contempt as he (Amaraweera) was a peaceful person who did not want to get involved in any controversy.
A fine opportunity to find solutions to the problems of people in Bandarawela was lost due to the irresponsible actions of Vidyaratne.
The impression he had about Vidyaratne as an exceptional and clever politician was completely lost and tarnished due to his latest action. Amaraweera said people in the area represented their problems and issues in a peaceful manner. The Uma Oya problem required both short term and long term solutions.
According to the external and internal situation in the affected area, it was dangerous to keep the people there any longer. As such they should be evacuated urgently.
To resolve this it was decided to acquire a 50 acre plot from a plantation company and re-settle them in it.
As a solution to the drinking water problem it was decided to distribute 3000 water tanks with 500 litre capacity each among the villages and ensure filling of water to them on a continuous basis until a pipe borne water scheme was launched. It was decided to implement a mass scale water supply project to cater to 15,000 families later.
During the discussions he also said that a programme should be implemented to pay compensation towards damaged houses and cultivable land in a fair manner.
The government had provided relief to people affected by the Uma Oya project during the last few months. A sum of Rs 197.6 million had already been paid in respect of 1968 damaged houses. Another Rs. 370.4 million had been paid in respect of damaged crops.
Almost 440,000 litres of water were being distributed among 2600 families daily utilizing 45 bowsers.
A large number of doctors, professors and intellectuals participated in the inspection tour and the final meeting. But an opportunity to obtain their valuable observations, ideas and views at the final meeting was lost due to the high handed actions of Vidyaratne.
The public was not invited for the meeting scheduled to be held at the Bandarawela Divisional Secretariat, because it was intended to obtain expert views for a final solution. But it was cancelled at the last minute as intelligence sources reported that Vidyaratne was planning to disrupt it with a group of people by hooting and jeering.
As such the meeting was later held at the Irrigation office instead.

Is biodegradable bag the solution for biodegradable waste
Authorities should encourage polythene paper manufacturers to produce environmentally friendly biodegradable bags and paper rather than producing non- biodegradable polythene which pollutes the environment,leading compostable and biodegradable paper manufacturer, Plastic Packaging (Pte) Ltd, Chairman Mervyn Dias said.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Chairman Dias said many countries are using compostable and biodegradable bags as they are the only solution to reduce environmental pollution.
Over 500 billion people worldwide use non degradable polythene every year and they are deposited in the environment for more than 500 years as they are not biodegradable," he said. Referring to a recent media briefing, Chairman Dias said even the proposed 40 micron polythene pollutes the environment.
Chairman Dias said although people all over the world produce organic waste, plastic waste and many other types of waste, there is no permanent solution for waste management.
As a leading biodegradable paper manufacturer Chairman Dias said these bags are exported to UK and few other countries and also started supplying to the Sri Lankan market.
Many European countries use compostable and biodegradable bags to collect their biodegradable kitchen food waste.
Chairman Dias also proposed that the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) encourages local manufacturers to produce biodegradable bags while encouraging householders to use the method of recycling of food waste by composting.
He said the CEA should also encourage people on home composting as it will help to reduce biodegradable waste being sent to dumping grounds.
Dias said his company manufactures waste collection bags for bio-waste generated in the kitchen and leaf collection bags to collect garden waste.
He said householders use these bags to collect only bio-waste and thereafter dispose it into the home compostable bin or hands it over to the bio-waste collectors for composting.
We manufacture compostable and biodegradable bags with aglobally certified compostable and biodegradable bio-resin which is imported. He said the compostable bags that he manufactures under the trade name`Naturplus
has no polythene.
He said the advantage of using these waste collection bags is that there is no smell of bad food when this bag is used, no worms grow in the bag and there is no health hazard to householders as well as to garbage collectors.
The compostable and biodegradable products do not have any polythene and conforms to European standard EN13432.
These compostable and biodegradable bags gets composted within 180 days in an industrial composting plant and should have the correct temperature, moisture and correct oxygen content. Dias said that certification is a must to export these bags and they will not import any compostable bags without the certification. The certification also guarantee that the products would gets composted.
He further said chemical composition, biodegradation, quality of final compost and eco-toxicity are key requirements needed to obtain certification from these certification bodies. `Naturplus bags have got necessary approvals for compost and home compost certification and therefore Naturplus products gives a guarantee that the bags will get composted.

The final decision as to whether the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat would continue its functions is to be taken up at the next Cabinet meeting, said Cabinet Spokesperson and Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
The minister made this observation at the Cabinet press conference when asked whether any decisions had been taken at the last cabinet meeting to close the Anti-Corruption Committee secretariat, yesterday. He further said that even the Prime Minister was not satisfied with the secretariats current method of dealing with the anti-corruption cases and added that many ministers also pointed out the need for not having such a secretariat as it does not serve any purpose.
President also pointed out at the meeting that there were many scandals that need to be revealed but the secretariat had been investigating on petty issues so far, he said. The Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat was established in 2015 to observe the complaints received from the public on Corruption and fraud and to refer the true complaints to the Bribery Commission or to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) of Police.
There are six investigators, one adviser to the investigators, five advisers and another five Director Generals working at the Secretariat. The government spends around 12 million to run it, he said.
Minister Senaratne further said that a special report on the functions of the secretariat will be submitted to the cabinet next week and the final decisions would be taken afterwards.
When asked whether the President at the meeting said if all the investigation bodies such as police, CID and FCID comes under him, he could submit all reports regarding scandals in three months, Minister Senaratne said even he likes the decision, if they can make it happen.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist whether the government is deliberately delaying local government elections as alleged by the Joint Opposition, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said, all parties have agreed to make amendments and to immediately take necessary measures to conduct the elections.

Challenging conditions in Htota for series decider
HAMBANTOTA: Zimbabwe has never played at Hambantota and hosts Sri Lanka last played there two years ago on July 25 so both teams have not had a feel of the conditions or the pitch deep in the heart of South in recent times.
Sri Lanka at least having played 16 ODIs there know what to expect especially the strong winds that blow across the ground that poses a challenge to both bowlers and out fielders.
Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer having assessed the conditions at Hambantota said: The wind is huge out here. Thats going to be a factor. We spoke about it. Its going to be tough to hit against the wind and when bowling too. Thats one factor that we are looking at.
Zimbabwe who excelled on a flat Galle track in the first ODI chasing down a score of 317 struggled to compete in the next match when the Galle pitch offered some assistance to the bowlers and were bundled out for 155.
When the wicket is flatter like in the first game, you can play all your shots freely and chase down a huge score like that. The second game was probably not a wicket where you can go for your shots regularly. We need to do bit of work on that. Assess conditions and stick to our plans, said Cremer.
If the wicket is not conducive for sweep you have to come up with other options. Definitely the sweep shot is an option for us this side of the world. We will continue to do that, but if we see the wicket is turning a bit and bounce is variable then we will have to play down the ground a lot more.
Having leveled the series one-all with a win in the second ODI at Galle, Sri Lanka are likely to go with an unchanged side for todays third ODI unless someone falls ill as has been the case with Suranga Lakmal who was drafted into the squad for the remaining three ODIs but has been sent to Galle for tests having caught the bug which is spreading around in the Lankan team. Veteran fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara has been named as cover up.
Sri Lanka has also brought in batsman Chamara Kapugedera which means that Dinesh Chandimal who didnt get a nod in the first two ODIs will miss out on the Zimbabwe ODI series.
They are different types of players. Chandi bats in the top order while Kapu bats in the middle order. Depending on the requirements of the team only we decide who the replacements are. The replacement we have for a middle order batsman is Kapugedera, explained Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.
Upul (Tharanga) has done well at four. The selectors thought they didnt want a change in that spot.
Chandimal is ideally suited for four. Upul if you see we didnt give him a permanent place. It can go both ways. You either give a player a bit of a break or you go forward with him for as long as possible until he scores runs, he said.
The selectors were looking at most recent performance and the balance of the unit. The six batsmen included in the squad have scored runs. Before getting injured Kapu was batting well. It can go either way.
SRI LANKA SQUAD (for 3rd, 4th & 5th ODIs): Angelo Mathews (captain), Upul Tharanga (vice-captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Asela Gunaratna, Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamara Kapugedera, Lakshan Sandakan, Akila Dananjaya, Nuwan Pradeep, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Kumara.

Champion swimmer, SLIIT student understands importance of balance
SLIIT Student Shehan Kaushalya understands the importance in finding the proper balance between pursuing swimming at the highest level and studying Information Technology.
Swimming, like any sport, consumes an enormous amount of time. When one reaches a certain level balancing swimming activities with academics and a social life can be even harder to manage.
Participating in the sport since he was young, Shehan represented his alma mater Royal College bringing home many accolades and medals. He was adjudged the Champion swimmer at the Inter-house Aquatic Championships 2013 at Royal College and his school swimming tenure culminated in being elected as the school Swimming Captain in 2014.
Shehan has performed exceptionally well at many local and international meets including the 9th Asian Swimming Championships 2012, Dubai (UAE), the 4th Asian Schools Swimming Championships 2013, Macau (China), he was the Runner-up Champion at the National Swimming Championships 2013, placed 3rd in the 100m and 200m backstroke at the Tri-Nation swimming championships in Karnataka, India 2011 and broke records in 100m and 200m backstroke events at the Sri Lanka Schools Aquatic Championships, 2013.
Winning and participating in local and international swimming events helps he says to, Inculcate a disciplined routine that is manageable helping me compete at the highest levels.
However, for a young, aspiring swimmer/university student Shehan has also learnt that using strong time-management skills help him excel both in the classroom and in the pool.
Despite walking a tightrope of balancing athletics and undergraduate academics, Shehan continues to showcase his prowess in the pool.
Participating in the Short-Course National Aquatic Championships 2016, Shehan was placed second in the 50m Backstroke and third in the 100m and 200m Backstroke andhis team emerged first in4x100m Relay.
When it comes to balancing studies and sports, Shehan gives credit to his lecturers and coaches. They understand what drives me and that I came to SLIIT to get an education, he said.
SLIIT recognised his achievements by awarding him the Most Outstanding Sportsman for Year 2016 at the recent SLIIT Colours Awards Ceremony.
However, he notes, Juggling the classroom and the pool can have its benefits. One activity can relieve the stress from the other.

Chaos in the calm
The particular is a convenient alternative connection to Malabe from Talahena Junction (cemetery point). It is a 30 ft wide road but in a very bad state of repair for the past several years.
This road is only 1.5 km and the damages are due to unauthorised pipe water connections carried out by residents through private contractors. The private contractors dig up the road and after completion of the work the earth is just pushed back in a heap without any levelling and motorists and other road users find it extremely difficult to use the road and the situation is chaotic during rainy days.
Also, these unauthorised connections are carried out during the night without any warning boards displayed and the contractors are said to be ex-Water Board workers. To make matters worse, the unauthorised structures have encroached on to the road blocking the storm water drains and privately owned three-wheelers are parked at crazy angles adding to this inconvenience. Young motorcyclists without helmets are frequently speeding on this road and illicit hooch is freely available in this area. Complaints so far have fallen on deaf ears. If authorities are concerned they should pay a visit to this place and check for proof of this exposure.
Also, road widening plans are in place but influential affected parties are preventing this from happening.

Close to nature
The ability to interpret what he/she detects from the mind of the client, the spoken and unspoken thoughts, and, his/her talent when it comes to transforming that home into a reality is one of the major talents of an architect. ArchWorld features Archt. Damith De Silva share his thoughts on interpretation.
If two people have a separate set of anxieties and fears then obviously the house design will be very different. Even with the same set of anxieties or fears the design will depend on the degree or severity of the anxiety or fear, said De Silva
Certain clients want family ties within the family. So you are talking about an introverted house- All the activities are within the house.
Most of the Colombo houses we do are introverted houses. We normally have extroverted houses where the environment and building are merged together. To have a reasonably well-functioning and extroverted house you need a good 30 odd perches - The internal and external activities are working as a whole. In an introverted house, all the activities are concentrated inside. You may have a center courtyard and you may have a center pantry area where the family ties are developed. Extroverted house is a house that entertains lots of people. In introverted it is only the family as a unit.
Depending on the attitude the designs will vary lines, colors and textures matter. If you want the space to be more introverted we will go for darker shades, darker materials, solid materials, smaller courtyards. For extroverted you use white colors, less lines, glittery sort of finishes. If you are getting a sort of concentrated sunlight I would say it is introverted. If you take ample sunlight it is extroverted. When it comes introverted and extroverted the relevance of wind is less, explained De Silva
Being an architect you also need to be tactful because some clients want prestige and power while ignoring their human needs  rest, relaxation, belonging, identity and security.
They want their house to reflect power, prestige and wealth. Then we are talking about a house and not a home. House and home to me, are two different sort of buildings. Home is a place where you have relaxation and family ties. Good ties are developed within a home. Some people have the mindset to reflect prestige and recognition in their houses. Prestige and wealth can be there, but up to a certain limit. Because to me security, privacy and family ties are important. Once you have those there is satisfaction, added De Silva.
Where architecture education is concerned, one particular subject area is psychology. That is one of the major areas that they need to learn. Though a full understanding of the psychology of the person may not be possible for an architect, through maturity he/she can design a home for the client that he/she wants.
When a client meets me, he or she may not tell me about an insecurity, fear or certain complexity that he or she is facing. As a good architect once you have a one to one dialogue you will definitely understand that particular client. During the house designs we become intimate friends.
Relative
So if you understand the thinking, behavior and the pluses and minuses you gain insight. If you feel they have a fear or a difficulty in some sort of an area you tend to tune into that. In Architecture there are no cut and dry solutions. They are very relative, stated De Silva.
A persons personality and the creation of spaces are interlinked. There may be a person who does not like the wind or sunlight coming in the same way, but there may be someone else who does. When it comes to a project you will have to privatize the requirement
So you have to identify the main requirement, the secondary and the tertiary and how you start with the design. Once you study the client, if you feel the client is very much involved with the environment, if the person is more conscious regarding those areas, we will be giving the primary consideration for those areas. At the end of the day that particular client will utilize that home for a good 30 to 50 years. The architects responsibility is to fulfill the clients requirement
But if some person does not like the volume of sunlight coming in, we may not be able to cut off the sunlight to the required volume, explained De Silva.
In architecture it is nothing but spaces that we are talking about. Various other elements could be added to get the maximum ambience of that particular space.
When it comes to Architecture my personal perception is, if you are doing a reasonably good house for a client you need to understand that particular client properly- his personality, his occupation and the family ties. All these areas are linked to each other. When you compare one particular house with another house, they are quite different to each other. They are from the same architect. There may be an element repeated but the total house will be quite different each other, pointed out De Silva
When it comes to design, in a tropical country like Sri Lanka light, wind and ventilation are very important in design. Personality is reflected in the form and shape of the house.
With the lines we create walls, and in Architecture what we are talking about is spaces and volumes. To create the proper volume, those lines should be initially there with the designing. Then it will be developed into three dimensional shapes. So when it comes to a personality, for example a lawyer or a doctor, those two people will have their own types of niches, to relax and enhance themselves, informed De Silva
Communication and confidence Communication and Confidence in the architect are really important.
Sometimes I feel that some of the cleints pretends that he/she understands the design. At the end of the day once the building is constructed then they have problems and are not satisfied. Architect may have visualized the house by designing, but as a layman the client may have not.
But now the technology is developed  we talk about 3D images and sketch up images. So once we do the designs, we do the three dimensional views of the house- each and every room.
Still until the client is occupied and living in that particular place for a couple of months or years he may not understand whether the features are appropriate. From the inception if the client believes in the architect, his input and his suggestions, then there will be very less room for dissatisfaction in the long run, explained De Silva
In architecture, maturity matters. As a seasoned architect in the field for many years he knows what is on the clients mind.
I am in a position to understand what sort of requirement that person wants of me. That is the maturity. The client may say- I need a massive living area. My master bedroom must be on the ground floor. But I have three kids and they will be on the upper floor. So first I will be listening to them. I devote a lot of time to my client for his requirements.
At the end of the day the client will be spending a good 25  50 million on a house and if they are clueless as to what they are going to get at the end of the day then what. The architect may enjoy doing that house but if the client is not happy with the house then what, questioned De Silva
These days clients are very knowledgeable. The way the architect answers will determine whether he/she is selected by the client to build his/her dream home. They are very well informed. They have enough and more information. If you are true to each other, then the project will go without a hitch.
De Silva feels that living in a tropical country, if we need to use the fan or the light in the daytime we have failed in our design.
The sunlight and the wind is something very unique to our country. As architects we work with the nature. Light, ventilation and wind are the primary areas. I also feel that maintenance is important. There is no point hiring the best architect in the world if the client is not going to maintain the building. I also love incorporating water bodies in my designs. They are soothing to the mind as well as the eye. Birds chirping amongst the fruit trees in the courtyard is also a nice element. said De Silva.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been ranked among the Top 1000 Banks of the World for a seventh consecutive year in 2017, and moved up 19 places in this prestigious global list compiled by The Banker magazine of the UK.
Commercial Bank is the only Sri Lankan bank to be in the Top 1000 ranking for seven years running and is the only bank to record a double digit upward movement in the 2017 rankings. Consistency in performance is a paramount virtue in banking, and our ability to not only be ranked seven years in a row, but to move up 19 places during a period of challenge, speaks volumes for our mettle, Commercial Banks Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said. Being included in this list is an affirmation of the Banks strength and stability as well as an endorsement of the quality of its people, at
all levels.
The Top 1000 Banks of the World are ranked on the basis of Tier I capital, assets, capital assets ratio, pre-tax profits, return on capital, return on assets, BIS (Basel) Capital ratio, NPL to total loans, loans to assets ratio, risk weighted assets (RWA) to total assets (TA) ratio and cost income ratio.

Country to experience massive development drive: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday assured that a massive development drive which ensures rapid economic growth mainly based on exports, more job opportunities and the increase of income will take place in the country within the next three years.
He made this observation addressing the opening ceremony of the Institute of Bankers Sri Lanka at the IBSL Towers in Narahenpita.
The Premier further said that the country is now in a position of pay back the loan installments obtained by the previous regime.
He further charged that in 2015, the country experienced a crisis situation where we could not even pay the loan installments.
We had to take some hard decisions such as the increase of tax to achieve economic stability. We should appreciate the support extended by the IMF in this regard to help spur local income. Measures have already been taken to attract more investments to the country to strengthen the economy.This would enables us to payback these loans,the Prime Minister said.
Measures have been taken to establish a school for policy studies with the financial assistance of the government of Japan,the Prime Minister said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said the government is undertaking the restructuring of the Institute of Policy Studies.
The Premier said that the IBSL Towers will take the IBSL to the forefront of banking and finance education of the country. The IBSL must become the specialised national academy of banking and finance. The IBSL Governing Board has to have wider representation of professionals and academia for coordinating both theory and practice its operational model has to be accredited by globally recognised finance schools for quality while maintaining its local favour.
The overriding theme and the focus of the IBSL training and qualification modules should be
prudent business and not profit maximization. The IBSL should be in a position to produce finance managers for the hub of the Indian Ocean, the Prime Minister said.
My legal team will be happy to review that some analysis facilitate introduction of necessary legal action that need necessary amendments to empower the IBSL with a new market base education mandate. The restructuring of the IBSL will enable it to have a major responsibility in creating the financial framework of the proposed economy,he said.
Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajith Coomaraswamy said the government is trying to build a new role model for the economy which is private sector driven with exports and financial institutions.
If we look around the world today, we can observe different mixtures of the state and private sector delivering good development outcomes. But for us in Sri Lanka, our fiscal deficit and debt dynamics, we dont have space to do that, the Central Bank Governor said.
IBSL Chairman P.Somasiri also spoke.

Design tips for building a new home
Building a new home is an exciting and sometimes stressful time. Stress can be reduced by knowing what you want ahead of time and making sure those building plans reflect your choices. Dont rush the process but enjoy it to ensure you get a home that will suit your budget and lifestyle.
Here are 8 tips to consider when building a new home.
* Consider an open floor plan. It is easier to heat or cool and it allows the family to come together more easily. And supervision of children is easier while you are working in the kitchen. It also helps your home to look and feel more spacious.
* Clutter not only looks ugly, it makes the home feel smaller. Design additional storage areas in the garage, laundry and bathroom and incorporate more storage in small areas of the house such as under the stairs. You can even have built-in storage on the back veranda.
* To avoid dating your home, include a mix of classic and contemporary designs. Then go ahead and add your own design style and touches to make your home one that is unique.
* Forget the narrow doorways and tiny windows of yesteryear. Today its all about large windows and areas of glass that let in lots of natural light. Doors need to be wide enough to make lugging prams, toys, shopping, furniture and kids in and out easy.
* A luxurious look doesnt have to cost a lot. Adding quality but classic fixtures, finishes and flooring will give your home an expensive look without blowing the budget.
*Street appeal is important because you may need to sell and that is one thing that brings buyers in. But in any case you dont want to be known as the person with the ugly house. Make sure the colours and design on the front of the home complement each other and are kept maintained.
* Tiny bathrooms should never be seen in a modern home. The bathroom gets a lot of use and a larger one is far nicer to be in than a little one. Larger windows and light colours will help create natural light to ensure your bathroom looks even more spacious. It should also have plenty of storage.
* Incorporate environmentally friendly features into your home to reduce the running costs. These can be as simple as larger windows opposite each other to let through the prevailing breeze, orienting the house so the living areas are on the sunny side in cooler climates or the shady side in hot areas, having wider eaves that keep the summer sun off the walls and lighting that is eco friendly. It can also mean using paint and other finishes that are free of toxic fumes.

England look to positive Root against South Africa
London: A new England era will start when Joe Root captains the Test side against South Africa at Lords on Thursday.
Root was appointed in February after Alastair Cook, still in the team purely as an opening batsman, stood down but this weeks match will be Englands first Test since the change of skipper.
England will hope the captaincy drives the 26-year-old Yorkshireman on to even greater heights as it has done for two fellow star batsmen -- Australias Steve Smith and Indias Virat Kohli.
The way Rooty goes about his cricket, hes nice and positive the way he bats, I suspect the way he will captain the team will be similar, said Englands Australian coach Trevor Bayliss last week.
South Africa ended the Test captaincy of several England skippers in Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss.
A similar fate, however, is unlikely to befall Root, whatever the outcome of a four-match series, ahead of this years Ashes campaign in Australia.
The immediate task for Root is to return England to winning ways in Tests after eight defeats in a 2016 that ended with a 4-0 series loss in India.
Roots county colleague Gary Ballance has forced his way back into the side after piling on the runs for Yorkshire even though his last six Test innings have yielded just 49 runs in total.
Meanwhile Keaton Jennings, who attended the same Johannesburg school as South Africa wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock, is set to open alongside Cook -- who has been scoring heavily for Essex this season -- against the country of his birth.
With veteran new ball duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad fit to lead an attack featuring Durham quick Mark Wood, England must decide whether to hand a debut to another paceman in Toby Roland-Jones, who would be playing on his Middlesex home ground, or give Liam Dawson a first Test on home soil following the Hampshire left-arm spinners promising start in Chennai in December.
South Africa boast a remarkable record of having lost only one away Test series in 10 years.
They have been without AB de Villiers in Test cricket for more than 12 months and the talented batsman will miss the whole of this series as he considers his international future.
South Africa too will have a new captain in Dean Elgar but regular skipper Faf du Plessis is expected back for the second Test at Nottingham following the birth of his first child.
He is a gutsy player, South Africa coach Russell Domingo said of opening batsman Elgar.
He epitomises South African cricket to the tee.
The Proteas had a difficult start to this tour, losing to England in both one-day and Twenty20 series either side of a first-round exit at the Champions Trophy.
Meanwhile Domingo, who has confirmed he will re-apply for his job as required by South Africa officials, had to return home briefly after his mother was involved in a traffic accident.
But despite the absence of injured fast bowler Dale Steyn, South Africa - 2-0 winners in England five years ago -- boast an impressive pace attack.
Morne Morkel is renowned for how well he bowls to left-handers (England will have several in their top order) and Vernon Philander is a proven performer in English conditions while Kagiso Rababa is a rising star.
Hes a phenomenal talent, said Philander of Rabada, whose 17 Tests have already yielded 71 wickets.
South Africa are set to give a debut to Heino Kuhn, the latest opener trying to fill the void left by retired former captain Graeme Smith.
Top-order batting is set to be a key area, with Hashim Amla -- who made South Africas record Test score of 311 not out at The Oval in 2012 -- a central figure.
Now there are fears the 34-year-old may not be the player he was, with South Africa batting great Barry Richards saying last week: One of the key parts of the series is Hashim Amla versus the fast bowlers and Hashim Amla versus himself.
Probable teams for the first Test between England and South Africa at Lords on Thursday:
England: Alastair Cook, Keaton Jennings, Joe Root (capt), Gary Ballance, Jonny Bairstow (wkt), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Liam Dawson, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Mark Wood
South Africa: Dean Elgar (capt), Heino Kuhn, Hashim Amla, JP Duminy, Temba Bavuma, Theunis de Bruyn, Quinton de Kock (wkt), Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel

Foreign medical education costs Rs. 132 b annually: Rajitha
Sri Lankan medical students spend Rs. 132 billion to obtain medical education from foreign universities annually, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, all Sri Lankan students who qualify to enter state medical faculties cannot be given an opportunity to do so and only 17 percent of them can be taken into state medical faculties. The rest of the 83 percent do not get the opportunity to enter into a state medical faculty and become a doctor.
He was addressing a ceremony held in Colombo recently to hand over appointment letters to health sector employees. Dr. Senaratne said, out of this 83 percent, three percent can be taken a by a private medical faculty.
It should not be stopped. It should be assisted with aid. The Government is in the process of developing state medical faculties. Hostel facilities will be given to all medical students by 2018. Some are trying to change the attitude of the new employees who joined the health service recently.
They try to preach socialism to them, but that socialism is not preached by late Karl Marx. The ethnic conflict irrupted in 1956 could have been solved easily, but it turned into a war. Patriotism preached today is a disease, he added.

Former Ceylon cricketer Dr. Cyril Ernest chief guest
At Benedictine Prize Giving on Friday:
At the invitation of Rev. Bro. Henry Dissanayake, Director of St. Benedict's College, top all-round sportsman and former Ceylon cricketer Dr. Cyril Ernest, now domiciled in the USA will be the chief guest of the St. Benedict's College Prize Giving 2017 on Friday July 7 at the College premises.
Dr. Ernest represented St. Benedict's College with distinction in cricket, hockey, athletics and tennis in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was an excellent all-rounder in cricket opening batting with Ranjit Fernando, always giving a good start to the Benedictines. He was a brilliant fielder at close leg position, at a time when helmets and other safety gear were unheard of. He was also a very useful off spin bowler. He represented the College in Combined Schools' cricket teams of that time. He also took part in Public Schools Athletic Meets and Public Schools Tennis Championships.
Dr. Ernest entered Medical College from St. Benedict's in 1961 and had a dream sporting career at the University of Ceylon. He represented the University in Sara Trophy cricket as an all-rounder from 1961-67 and captained the team in his final year. He captained the University cricket team on tour to the All-India Inter-University cricket tournament, 1966, Bangalore, India. He represented the University hockey team in the Pioneer and Andriesz Shield tournaments.
After joining Royal Ceylon Air Force as a medical doctor, he captained the Air Force cricket team, the Adastrians and also played hockey. He was a regular member of the Ceylon Government Services cricket team in the Robert Senanayake Pentangular tournament, which became the national champions in 1969. He also toured India with the Government Services side. He played for the Government Services cricket team in their fixture against Joe Lister's International team in 1969. He first played for the Ceylon national team against the MCC in 1969. He also represented the Ceylon Cricket Association team in the annual Gopalan Trophy encounter versus Madras. He was selected for the Ceylon team to tour Pakistan in 1971, which was unfortunately cancelled due to the Bangladesh problem.
In the USA, he played for the USA cricket team in the Associate Members World Cup in Birmingham, England 1982. He was manager of the USA cricket team 1995-96 and was chairman of the selection committee 1995-96. Dr. Ernest therefore has the rare distinction of playing for the national cricket teams of two countries, his homeland Sri Lanka, then Ceylon and USA.
Dr.Ernest was a keen long distance runner, running four marathons (Honolulu twice 1985-1986, Los Angeles 1987 and Beijing 1995) and numerous 5k and 10k races. He is also a Black Belt in Taekwondo/Karate.
He achieved all these sporting accomplishments, while being a top consultant physician and cardiologist and a medical administrator. He specialised in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Disease. He is a Fellow American College of Cardiology (FACC)-1985, Fellow American College of Chest Physicians (FCCP)-1985 and Fellow American College of Physicians (FCAP)-1990. He held the position of president Los Angeles County Medical Association 1984 and from 1982 to 1986, served in the Los Angeles County Medical Association Board of Governors.
The Annual Prize Giving at St. Benedicts College is the most important event in the school calendar and Bro. Director Henry Dissanayake has rightly invited a person of rare calibre Dr.Cyril Ernest and his wife Indrani as chief guests for this event. Dr Ernests daughters Cheryl and Melanie will also join their parents at this memorable occasion.
Bro. Henry Dissanayake will definitely hold Dr. Ernest as a role model for young Benedictines to follow and Dr. Ernest would most likely share his experiences, some words of wisdom and plenty of advice to the young hopefuls. He has been a great benefactor of the College and has supported many infrastructure development projects and helped SBC at cricket and athletics. In fact, the Bowling Machine presently used by the Benedictine cricketers was donated by him.
