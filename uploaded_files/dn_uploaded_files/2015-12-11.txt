The Asia Pacific ICT Alliance (APICTA) Awards 2015 held in Colombo was a resounding success, says the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) and BCS the Chartered Institute for IT Sri Lanka (BCSSL), the joint organizers of this landmark international event in the country.
The Business Forum, Students Forum and related events, which coincided with APICTA - 2015, were also concluded on a very successful note so much so that the grand ceremony earned plaudits and was acclaimed locally and internationally.
The national partner for this year's event was the Information and Communication Technology Agency Sri Lanka (ICTA). It was a rare honour that among all the South Asian nations, Sri Lanka was selected as the first country to host APICTA - 2015. Over the years, this International Contest and Awards ceremony had been held earlier in Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand, Macao etc.
Around 700 ICT Innovators, Experts, Investors, Traders and Entrepreneurs from 16 member countries attended the 5 days long APICTA - 2015 events in Colombo.
Speaking at the inaugural sessions, Dr. Dileepa De Silva, Chairman, Asia Pacific ICT Alliance (APICTA), said that hosting this global ICT event in Colombo has gone a long way to build a positive image of Sri Lanka amongst
countries of the Asia Pacific region. Prof. Gihan Wikramanayake, Head of the Panel of Judges of APICTA - 2015 and Chairman of BCS Sri Lanka Section described the hosting of this globally recognized event in Colombo as a "milestone" in the history of ICT in Sri Lanka and would bring many benefits to the industry by way of business opportunities.
At the APICTA - 2015 International Contest and Awards ceremony, 197 aspirants from 16 countries formed into 17 groups to present their innovations.
Representing the business sector, Sri Lanka clinched two gold awards, two merit awards. In addition, two merit awards were won representing the university students' segment and another merit award emerged from the school children sector. Minister Harin Fernando distributed awards among winners at the glittering event held at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre in Colombo.
Parallel to APICTA, 2015, the Business Forum was held over two days with the participation of around 150 local and foreign entrepreneurs. The event was held with the active support of the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) and the Sri Lanka Board of Investment (BOI).

Ban mechanised bottom trawling in Sri Lankan waters: TNA MP
A Bill prohibiting mechanised bottom trawling was filed in Parliament last week by TNA MP M. A Sumanthiran.
He said: "We have taken several remedial measures, one of which was a discussion with the President. One such measure is to bring in a legislative measure towards which a Bill has been presented to Parliament. If this act is implemented deep sea trawling will be banned and will be considered an offence. The offender will be sentenced to a two year prison term and will have to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000."
The Bill calls for the amendment of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, No 2 of 1996. The Bill was first presented by Sumanthiran on April 21, 2015. Following this, however Parliament was dissolved.
The Bill proposes to prohibit trawling operations in Sri Lankan waters. The Bill seeks to amend legislation which allows for licenses to be granted for trawling operations; prohibit the use, possession, import, transport, purchase and sale of trawl nets for trawling operations in Sri Lankan waters; and specify action to be taken in the event of persons engaging in trawling operations in contravention of these provisions.
"Bottom trawling is an extremely destructive form of fishing and can result in long term damage to marine resources," he said.
"Over the past few years we have witnessed the extent to which Indian trawlers have continued to enter Sri Lankan waters, and exploit our resources. Foreign fishermen fishing in our water has caused great distress to our fishermen specially those living in the north," Sumanthiran said.

Brandix HQ receives Green Mark - Platinum award
The headquarters building of the Brandix Group has been awarded the Green Mark - Platinum certification by the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), making it the first commercial building in Sri Lanka to receive this rating, developed by the Building Construction Authority (BCA) of Singapore to assess Green buildings.
The milestone award presented to Brandix by Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, is the second won by the building within a month. In November, the Brandix head office received the Gold at the National Energy Efficiency Awards.
The Green Mark recognises achievements in four key environment related indicators and a general category. In the assessment for the Green Mark - Platinum conferred on Brandix, the building was rated on Energy Efficiency, Water Efficiency, Sustainable Operations & Maintenance, Indoor Environment Quality and Other Green Features&Innovations.
The building received an overall score well above the 90 required to qualify for Platinum - the highest Green rating possible under the scheme.
"Our new headquarters building is a perfect representation of the Group's deep-rooted commitment to sustainability," Brandix Director Feroz Omar said. "The latest in technology was utilised to minimise its environmental footprint, and the two awards won in the space of a month are a fitting recognition of its status as a new benchmark for a Green office buildings in Sri Lanka."
Commissioned on 1st March 2015, the eight-storey, 37,800 square foot Brandix HQ building has 29,783 square feet of air conditioned office space.
Purpose-designed by Architect Murad Ismail,the edifice accommodates approximately 200 people. The extensive use of double-glazed, Argon-filled, black tinted self-cleaning glass walls gives the structure improved thermal insulation and a high solar reflectance index, keeping its interiors cool. Daylight harvesting facilitated by a high window to wall ratio, the use of Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting controlled by a smart system that switches on and adjusts lux levels based on ambient light and occupancy, and a highly energy-efficient water-cooled,oil free magnetic bearing air conditioning system, all integrated into a series of sophisticated intelligent building management systems, enable significant savings in energy consumption.
One of the largest suppliers of apparel to top retail brands in the US and Europe, Brandix is an international award winner for eco-friendly manufacture and commitment to environmental best practice.
The Group was recognised as Sri Lanka's 'Organisation Committed to Green' by the Green Building Council of Sri Lanka (GBCSL) in 2014.

British politicians take Trump to task
UK: Donald Trump has sparked a transatlantic row with Britain's most senior politicians as he said parts of London were so radicalised that police feared for their lives.
In the strongest criticism ever of an American presidential candidate by a Prime Minister, David Cameron said it was "wrong" to question the courage of Britain's policemen and then attacked his call for a ban on Muslims travelling to the United States as "divisive".
Boris Johnson, the London Mayor, mocked the idea police would stay away from some neighbourhoods as "ill-informed" and "complete and utter nonsense" and said the comments were an insult to London's "proud history of tolerance and diversity".
He mocked the US politician, claiming that "the only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump".
The row means that if Mr Trump wins the presidential election in less than a year diplomatic relations between Britain and the United States could become close to untenable.
There were calls from Labour and the SNP for Mr. Trump to be banned from entering Britain under rules designed to bar hate preachers. However, government sources indicated that this course was not being considered.
The White House, fellow Republican candidates, British political figures from all parties were united in condemnation of the remarks.
Scotland Yard also broke with convention to issue a statement, with a spokesman saying: "We would not normally dignify such comments with a response, however on this occasion we think it's important to state to Londoners that Mr Trump could not be more wrong."
Trump was speaking after the first Isil-inspired attack in the United States last week which saw 14 people killed in a shooting in San Bernardino, California.
There is growing concern among Americans over Barack Obama's failure to tackle Isil amid increasing support for deploying ground troops.
In the wake of the Paris terror there has been much debate in the US about restricting the number of Syrian migrants and tightening the borders to counter the threat from jihadists.
However, Mr Trump's comments were even condemned by his own rivals for the Republican nomination and the Pentagon which warned the proposals could make America more vulnerable to attack.
Trump also said that cities like London and Paris have effectively become no-go areas for the police.
He added: "We have places in London and other places that are so radicalised that the police are afraid for their own lives. We have to be very smart and very vigilant."

The Budget for 2016 evoked the biggest howl of public protest in recent history, UPFA Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunge said.
The Budget laid the ground work to destroy the public service, privatisation of state sector institutions and exploitation of the country's resources by foreigners. He said the Budget caused injustice to the state administrative sector and doctors. The Budget could be described as an anti-people Budget, he said. Ranatunge said even though the government blamed restrictions imposed by the Budget on the alleged corruption and fraud committed by the Rajapaksa regime, he believed that this was a Budget framed to recover the loses concurred due to the Central Bank Bond issue. Any vote in favour of the Budget would amount to a betrayal of the people.
They would vote against the Budget even if disciplinary action is taken against them by the party, he said.

## Title: Challenges of reconstruction in 2016
## Supertitle: Economic crisis in the North and East
## Section: Features

Economic crisis in the North and East
Challenges of reconstruction in 2016
The devastation of the war and the subsequent failure of reconstruction in the North and East under the Rajapaksa regime during the post-war years have led to a deep crisis characterised by falling incomes, rising unemployment and crippling indebtedness. The Government is clearly aware of this crisis, but there is little commitment on the part of the Government to address this crisis with state finances. Given the absence of an economic vision including related demands towards reconstruction by both the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) and the TNA leadership, they are also partly to blame. Reconstruction is as much about the capital necessary for rebuilding as it is about a credible economic development plan, both of which are lacking even as the war-torn regions are mired in an economic crisis.
Budget 2016 and housing construction
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake delivering Budget 2016.
Despite the massive needs for reconstruction and resettlement, the commitments in Budget 2016 are limited to a mere three items, with only one proposal with any financial commitment, which is for resettlement totalling only Rs.14 billion. This resettlement budget proposal is to address continuing resettlement needs, livelihoods, the building of 20,000 houses especially in the Districts of Mannar and Mulativu, improvement of the Delft Jetty, renovation of roads from Velanai to Kayts and establishment of a clinical waste management system. In the context of the need for small industries for employment creation and value addition in the North and East, there is merely one proposal, and that too a public private partnership, for a red clay factory in Oddusuddan.
Development funds channelled through Provincial Councils continues to be marginal. Undermining the idea of financial devolution is the major decline of allocations for all nine Provincial Councils by 17% this year. In this context, the allocation to the NPC has increased from Rs.20 billion in 2015 to Rs.29 billion in 2016. However, with much of the Provincial Council budget going towards recurrent expenditure such as paying salaries and capital expenditure characterised by the Central Government's development projects implemented by the Provinces, this increase in allocation for the NPC will not make a dent on reconstruction in the North.
The major development not mentioned in the Budget Proposals is the Cabinet Decision to construct 65,000 houses for resettlement in the North and East. The Government has put out a call for proposals from agencies with concessionary financing to construct these houses. While such a major housing project is indeed necessary for the war-torn North and East, the process of building those houses is also going to be important.
There are many lessons from the various other housing schemes by the World Bank, India and the Swiss Development Cooperation. Such housing schemes, when implemented as owner driven houses, have led to the high indebtedness of many who got the housing grant. On the other hand, these housing schemes became a major local economic stimulus for households; local labour that could not find adequate incomes in agriculture and fisheries found some relief in incomes through mason work.
The question remains as to whether the proposed project for 65,000 houses will address both concerns of ensuring house-building without indebtedness and avoiding contractor run house-building that may not contribute to much needed local incomes. This major longer-term investment by the state in a post-war housing scheme of 65,000 houses - calculated in terms of the existing schemes worth Rs.550,000 per house amounts to Rs.36 billion - should be designed so it also provides a much needed near term boost to the war affected regional economies.
NPC and economic neglect
There has been little serious engagement on the part of the TNA and the NPC with respect to Budget 2016 and the new economic policies of the Wickremesinghe Government. One would at least expect a debate from them on the economic challenges in the North and East, but that is also absent, as Tamil politics continues to neglect economic issues.
Here a quick look at the NPC and its use of allocated funds would be instructive. For example in 2014, only 63% of the Rs. 6 billion in capital expenditure allocated to the NPC was spent. (Finance Ministry Annual Report 2014, page 323) Indeed, in 2014, the year for which the latest data is available, the NPC is one of the lowest spenders of its capital allocation, when compared to other Provincial Councils.
This is a rather shameful situation for a Provincial Council that continues to claim it does not have enough finances and puts forward devolution as its primary political demand.
It is a known fact that much of the budgetary allocation of Provincial Councils are for recurrent spending, what are called Block Grants, which are mainly the salaries of provincial employees such as teachers. Furthermore, even the capital allocation for Provinces are often determined by national policy for development projects, which are allocated as Province Specific Development Grants. Indeed, this is the shortcoming of devolution as it stands in Sri Lanka; there is little room for participatory development at the regional level.
Provincial Councils only have some discretion in development spending with the much smaller allocations for capital expenditure under what are called Criteria Based Grants. In the case of the NPC, the Criteria Based Grants for 2015 were a meagre Rs. 400 million.
The worrying development, however, is that the latest NPC Financial Progress Report claims that only Rs. 143 million or 36% of the allocated Criteria Based Grants for 2015 have been spend by October 31, 2015. It is for the NPC and its Chief Minister to provide an explanation for this state of affairs.
Donor dependency and employment generation
The emphasis on housing in the Budget and the 65,000 housing scheme mentioned above will be welcomed by those whose houses were destroyed and living without permanent housing after the war. However, the larger economic problem of the war-torn region is the lack of job creation and falling incomes, which are linked to the dearth of investment for value addition in the local economy.
In this context, reconstruction of the North and East now hinges on a proposed Donor Conference in Tokyo. Perhaps the Government is considering the possibility of reviving the large funds that were pledged at the Tokyo Donor Conference in June 2003, which was at the height of the internationalised Norwegian peace process. Donors pledged a total of US$ 4.5 billion (now worth over Rs.600 billion) in development aid for neoliberal economic reforms coupled with progress on the peace process. However, at that time,the LTTE arrogantly boycotted the donor conference as it prepared for war, and those donor commitments could not be taken forward. The reality is that the national situation and geopolitical interests are very different today, and the chances of this donor conference becoming a reality are slim, and even if it did take place, only a fraction of the aid necessary for reconstruction is likely to come from the donors.
Next, the general approach of donors has been that of investing in infrastructure and that mind-set has also become dominant among the bureaucracy. Reconstruction has become reduced to physical infrastructure such as roads and buildings, with a rejection of any role for the state in directing employment creation. Even worse, the donor and state policies, encourage NGO-led and other projects towards self-employment schemes including through micro-finance, which have in fact led to high levels of indebtedness and devastated household assets and finances. Indeed, it reflects a huge gulf between the concerns of the war-torn people and the economic programmes created by the nexus of the state, the donors and the NGOs.
Expecting a people who have lost everything in a war, to suddenly start producing, marketing and creating a livelihoods taking on the entire economic burden as individuals through self-employment reflects the height of economic idiocy. In short, the falling incomes in the rural economy, the lack of credible employment generation and the crippling effects of self-employment schemes, all constituting the failure of reconstruction, reflect the abdication of state responsibility towards reintegrating a war-torn people.
Political will and economic vision
When it comes to the reconstruction of the North and East, what is needed is the political will on the part of the state to commit the resources necessary to rebuild our war torn societies. Furthermore, a credible economic vision is necessary from the Government and the Tamil political leadership to address the root causes of the economic crisis in the war-torn regions. That must begin by looking at the massive indebtedness, the falling incomes and the lack of employment. Investment in the still rural economy, in small industries and the people, the most important resource, is the only way out of the deepening economic crisis tearing apart society.
If 2016 is to be a different year for the long suffering people of the North and East, the political leaders both in the South and the North have to stop passing the buck; not to each other nor to the donors whose interests lie elsewhere. Meaningful reconstruction is going to require our resources and our vision, and we as a country have to take responsibility for the economic crisis in the war-torn regions as much as for the tragic history that led to the devastating war.

Donald Trump stumps the American Dream
On Monday, aboard the USS Yorktown, Mr. Trump said: "We need a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States while we figure out what the hell is going on." Philadelphia Mayor, Michael Nutter has blasted Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, branding him "an a hole" and accused Trump of taking "a page from the playbook of Hitler". "It engenders a level of fear mongering that we have not seen literally since the 1930s and 1940s." Paul Ryan, the republican leader of the US House of Representatives also responding said, "Freedom of religion is a fundamental constitutional principle...This is not conservatism what was proposed yesterday, is not what this party stands for and more importantly it's not what this country stands for".
Harriet Lamb writing in the Independent before the UK Parliament debated and thereafter authorized bombing ISIL said, "Air strikes on Isis-held territory, from thousands of feet up, without the capacity to inform perceptions on the ground are dangerous and will backfire. Airstrikes will further traumatise an already broken population. Seeing family members and friends killed by a faceless enemy, to whom ISIS are free to give whichever 'face' suits them, will no doubt result in more foot soldiers in ISIS battle against the west. Airstrikes will create more refugees, pressing into fragile neighbouring states in a region that already cannot cope. Instead of military action in a vacuum, we need a long-term strategy, one that recognises and addresses the reasons why ISIS has support in the first place, both in Iraq and Syria, and at home in our own backyard.
Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stopover.
"Over three thousand Tunisians are estimated to have travelled to Syria to fight alongside Islamist militants. Through our work in Tunisia we now know that young people in the poor suburbs of Tunis who participated in the Arab Spring because they believed in the possibility of a better life, today feel cheated by the political elites and ignored by the state. We know that this sense of disillusionment and resentment amongst young Tunisians has made them easy targets for violent extremist groups, and that the sense of belonging and purpose and power offered by these groups has caused young Tunisians to travel to Syria in their thousands."
Read together it represents the serious challenges facing the world today in terms of conflicts, bigotry, misery to millions and use or misuse of religion for a variety of reasons. It's said in a world still fighting poverty, natural disasters and the disintegration of some states we knew such as Libya.
At this point I wish to introduce words of wisdom found in a publication titled, "Encounters With the Word: Essay To Honor Aloysius Pieris, S.J".
Vision of "ecumenism"
Sri Lankan Methodist theologian S. Wesley Ariarajah plea to apply the concept and vision of "ecumenism" not only to the search for unity of the churches, but to the wider movements that try to bring humankind together and in which all Christians should play an active role. Would we see mission simply as a message that we bring to, or activities we do in the world, or mission as participation with God and all others in bringing healing and wholeness, justice and peace, and reconciliation and renewal in the world
Suffering can humanize the world
Spanish-born liberation theologian Jon Sobrino, S.J. Based on his 30 years of experiences in El Salvador, develops four points: 1) Mercy-justice (to save the poor from death); 2) Prophecy and word (to save them from indignity); 3) To give a name (to save them from inexistence); and 4) The characteristics of the option (dialectics, partiality, insertion, humility). He concludes with a more radical idea: What can the poor do for society The salvation brought by the poor is humanization: a call to be human, civilization and solidarity. The fact that their suffering can humanize the world is truly a supreme paradox.
Collaboration to reverse global injustice
The late Father Tissa Balasuriya, O.M.I calls forth Christians to help develop a global ethic based on the core values of religions and points to the need for inter-religious collaboration to reverse global injustice.
Love of one's enemies
Social scientist Franois Houtart reflects on the love of one's enemies, implies efforts to bring them to this change of heart. In the same way, reconciliation as a manifestation of love of enemy is not limited to the individual sphere, but should bring about a restructuring of social relationships and lasting social change. In short, the love of and compassion for enemies create a "social environment that enables the recapture of humanity".
World faiths as resources for peace education
In a world full of violence, in which religions are often part of the problem of violence, Ursula King's article "Seeds of Peace: World Faiths as Resources for Peace Education" looks for ways to make religions into resources for peace-making, and to develop an education for peace from a religious and spiritual perspective.
Taking these calls further Paul F. KNITTER in a publication titled, "Toward a Liberation Theology of Religions" looks at the need for dialogue between Theologians of Liberation and Religions. He says, Economic, political, and especially nuclear liberation is too big a job for any one nation, or culture, or religion. In fact, if liberation theology is to take root in Asia, and not just in Latin America, it has no choice but to open itself to dialogue with Eastern religions. As Sri Lankan Aloysius Pieris reminds his Latin colleagues: The irruption of the Third World [with its demands for liberation] is also the irruption of the non-Christian world. The vast majorities of Gods poor perceive their ultimate concern and symbolize their struggle for liberation in the idiom of non-Christians.
Suicide bombers was a Sri Lankans phenomenon early on introduced by the LTTE. Its commonplace in many trouble spots including as we saw Paris recently.
A reflection of extreme radicalization and replication of methods of terror unknown previously. Neither politics nor the UN has been able to quieten, quell and extinguish many of the fires based on class, caste, ethnicity, religion and strategic needs of some states. Injustices faced by people on the other hand are sometimes fuelled by the money, politics and power.
In all of these situations religions working together has the power and potential to bring peace and justice in so many ways, some of which is highlighted in the earlier sections. Hence, the central thesis in this piece today is a call for an "ecumenism" of religions to come together to address the multitude of challenges facing us today. I do not believe the collective power of religions has been adequately harnessed to bring peace and change in so many situations of violence and misery. Each of the sub titles describing in brief the writings of experts resonate with the need for us to embrace the issues at hand and use multi-faiths as a framework bring a measure of sanity to a greatly troubled world.

Fertiliser subsidy not cut - Gayantha
Parliamentary Reforms, Media Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake said the government had not curtailed fertiliser subsidy to farmers.
He was addressing the press during a Cabinet briefing at the Parliamentary complex yesterday. The minister said the government has increased the allocation for fertiliser subsidy by Rs. 2,500 million, when compared to the allocation by the previous government.
"The previous government's allocation was Rs. 35,000 million, we have allocated Rs 37,500 million to provide fertiliser subsidy. The opposition is trying to mislead the public," he said.
"It is the previous regime which distributed substandard chemical fertiliser to farmers leading to the to the spread of kidney disease. Our attempt is to give the money directly to the hands of farmers, so that they could decide whether to buy compost fertiliser or chemical fertiliser of a good standard," the minister said.
He noted that the government had also banned the importation of several harmful agro-chemicals as a measure to control the chronic kidney disease (CKDU).
Meanwhile, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the fertiliser subsidy has been extended to all farmers including those who cultivated paddy, tea, rubber, coconut and vegetables. The minister added that the rapid spread of CKDU was alarming. "Politicians should not be bankrupt to the extent of protesting against progressive proposals. We have to allocate millions from this budget to install dialysis machines and RO plants," he said. "These are heavy burdens for the Government. This is a worse threat than the war," the minister said.
"Therefore we need to encourage farmers to get rid of chemical fertiliser," he concluded.

Kim Jong-Un's pop band to play in Beijing
CHINA: North Korea's premier pop group, the all-girl Moranbong band formed by leader Kim Jong-Un, will electrify audiences in China in shows aimed at harmonising out-of-tune ties between the traditional allies, reports and the venue said Wednesday -- but tickets are not available to the public.
The band have shaken up the reclusive country's generally staid music scene with renditions of patriotic songs, along with Western hits such as My Way and the theme from Rocky performed on electric violins.
Inside North Korea, they have been accorded huge success and students can reportedly sing their repertoire at the drop of a hat.
They will bring their tightly choreographed routines to Beijing for three days of shows, China's official Xinhua news agency said.
The concerts are "friendship performances" North Korea's state-run KCNA agency reported, praising the "worldwide stylish band" as "the first standard-bearer on the ideological and cultural front".
China has traditionally been North Korea's sole regional ally and main provider of trade and aid, but ties have become strained in recent years as Pyongyang has pressed ahead with internationally condemned nuclear tests.
Kim himself has yet to visit Beijing, three years after inheriting power following the death of his father Kim Jong-Il.
The Moranbong band first performed in 2012 and its members are reportedly hand picked by Kim, an authoritarian leader who is often praised in its songs.
The group, set to perform at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing, "opened up a new path in art creation with the spirit of devotedly carrying out the tasks given by the Party", KCNA added. - AFP

Kings of Couture
Haute couture is art for the body  exclusive, customized clothing made from scratch by hand, from expensive, unusual fabrics often tailored specifically to the users own measurements. Its high fashion, a giant leap above what we wear every day, the stuff of fashion show ramps and Lady Gagas wardrobe. A trademark of couture is that there is a lot of craft and creativity that goes into the clothing, and the collections try to be as unique and distinct as possible - Jean Paul Gaultieres crazy sculpture-esque designs of silk ruffles and tulles come to mind. In our roundup however were going to see less of conceptual fashion and stick to actually wearable couture, and only a few out there manage to create clothing that is both bold as true couture should be, and still tasteful. Here are our favourites of the lot.
Giambattista Valli: Born and raised in Rome, this Italian designer has made a name for himself that sticks out in the worlds fashion arena and his name has become synonymous with high fashion. Wide, frothy feminine skirts, symmetrical structures, tastefully combined incongruous colours  this is the stuff of his work. Vallis strength seems to be in his creative sensitivity  he doesnt resort to wild shapes and overly dramatic combos, but plays subtly with structure, whether its in the flair of the skirt or a row of tulle in the collar. He then highlights this with a striking mix of two or three solid colours  a natural range of yellows, creams, whites, reds and black pepper. The result is soft and subdued but bold, unforgettable couture. For a sneak peek into his style check out www.giambattistavalli.com
Louis Vuitton: Louis Vuitton is one of the biggest names in fashion  their clothing and accessories have become so popularized, its a rare example of mass-produced high fashion. Hailing from France, the LV couture line seems to follow the same theme of their mainstream collection  every-day glam, powerful and urban. Theres a heavier look to this brand of couture than the typical line-ups on catwalks, its very modern, city-chic and you get the feel from all the leather, the bold prints and the confident defined shapes and colours, that the clothing makes a very unapologetic, loud statement. Sleek silks, minimal lace and fitting bodices that elongate the wearer define this look.
Valentino: Another classic Italian designer Valentino is responsible for more classic haute couture, trusted by celebrities and big names for his flair. His couture feels more mature, serious and detailed, a clear cut apart from the rest. Silks, sheer materials, light brocade work  a very timeless, classic, sophisticated look defines Valentino couture. The designs are usually long and flowy, playing with colours and textures in a very classy, dignified way, and the result is a very expensive-looking, often regal, slightly vintage finish, perfect to stop the show at the Oscars.
Elie Saab: Elie Saab is an absolute delight for couture lovers. This Lebanese designer has now earned a spot for his collections in couture-capitals far from his own home, in Milan and Paris. His couture designs appear very light, almost airy and the models look almost fairy-like and ethereal in them, so it is no wonder that women considering wedding dresses stop and stare at Elie Saabs collections. The designs are long and flowy, with colours that melt into each other, show-stopper gowns which are still calm and easy on the eyes, with miles of sheer fabric, white stonework and lace to complete that airy, feminine, princess look.
Zuhair Murad: This designer, again from Lebanon is our top favourite from the kingdom of couture. While some of his sheer-fabric designs are vaguely reminiscent of Elie Saab, his overall style is unlike any other. His designs are very feminine, but bold and well defined at the same time  there is a healthy mix of elements that exudes a powerful, confident feminine energy. There is a range of materials and colours used in his collections so although they share a common fun sense of creativity there is no single look. Generally the dresses tend to be long and youthful, in pale colours or dark maroons and blues, with a creative mix of silks, layers of sheer fabric and creatively placed embellishments. For an evening out or a very special occasion, Murads couture is 100% on-point. The designer has a recent interesting crowd-favourite of a wedding dress that features sheer figure-hugging material and subtle floral cutouts, so the bride looks almost nude, but still, somehow, absolutely graceful and regal.

Local Govt polls by March end - Paranavithana
The government aims to hold the Local Government elections by March end as scheduled, Provincial Councils and Local Government Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranavithana said.
However, he said, a large number of complaints had been received to the five member Committee to look into the grievances of delimitation, adding that those must be looked in prior to the elections.
He was responding to a question by a journalist at the Cabinet press briefing at the Parliamentary complex yesterday.
The deputy minister said Minister Faizer Musthapha would analyse the report of the Committee and make a decision pertaining to the matter.
Paranavithana added the government was doing its best not to delay the Local Government Elections. Meanwhile, responding to a question on the clearing of reserved forest land near Wilpattu national park, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne opined the resettlement in this area was not a matter that must be opposed.
"Minister Rishad Bathiudeen earned stiff opposition to this activity because he was a Muslim. However, these people who were chased away by the LTTE had been residing in Puttalam for a long time and now they are returning to their original lands," he said.
"There is a similar problem in Kolonnawa. About 30,000 families have settled in the marshy lands in Kolonnawa which is a reserved area. The Cabinet yesterday discussed how these families could be relocated under the Megapolis project of the government," the minister said.
"While releasing land for human settlements, the government is also taking measures to increase the forest cover," he concluded.

More avenues left for government to collect taxes - Verit Research
A professional assessment of the opportunities for taxation in the country should reveal that there are other areas of taxation which the government could sustainably and reasonably collect money.
Verit Research Executive Director and Head of Research Dr. Nishan de Mel said the failure of Sri Lankan bureaucracy to professionally asses, calculate and calibrate taxes on cigarettes on an ongoing basis has caused a huge amount of financial losses.
Addressing a forum titled "Business Climate Outlook of 2016" organized by LBO-LBR he said there is a serious issue about how the public sector bureaucracy is functioning. "This is not only about politics, it is also about capacity and competence of Sri Lankan public sector. Issues relating to bureaucracy could be dealt with professional inputs, abilities required for a middle income economy.
Taking the case of cigarettes he pointed out that the collectible tax can increase by about Rs.50 billion as consumption of cigarettes continues to increase in all three quarters of 2015, despite the increase in excise tax.
He pointed out that the during the period 1981 to 2000, taxes on cigarettes have been adjusted in keeping with increasing per capita GDP.
Over the past 20 years, the government effectively maintained the habit of coming back, ensuring the total increasing excise taxes match the affordability or income growth in the country. According to him, from 2000 onwards, the bureaucratic system has failed to do the same. Dr. de Mel claimed that for 20 years what was affordable on per capita income was 9,542 cigarettes where as today per capita income can afford 15,831 cigarettes and this indicates there is more room to tax and increase the prices of cigarettes.

Moving beyond traditions
In any field for one to shine, it is extremely important to build an image, have inborn talents and also dedication and experience to ones profession. Especially for a beautician, it is important to carve out a unique style and builds ones own identity to go on a long journey in the beauty culture profession, well known beautician and Make-up Artist at the Independent Television Networks Ltd (ITN) Shammi Dharshana Perera stated.
He has already built his own identity by making use of his experience, innovations and ability to move beyond traditions and combining all such qualities to bring out his talents in different fields at his salon the Bridal Saloon which is at No-40/2A, Veediya Bandara Mawath, Ethul Kotte. Today he has mastered the art of beauty culture, bridal dressing, make-up & hair styles to win a name locally and internationally. He has become a distinctive artist in his field thanks to his ability to mix innovation to produce exclusive bridal dressing, make-up and hair styles which attract a range of clientele. He is popular in the field with his thirst to do something a new after making use of latest trends in the field.
Despite his skills, his other attributes such as delivering on time, charming personality and helpful attitude has enabled him to secure a top most place for him in his respective field.
Each and every single bride who comes to him is special. He has no problem with their outlook. All he needs is to make each one a star on the best day of their lives. When a client comes seeking his services, the way he should adorn her comes to mind naturally. He has a 10-year-experience in this field and is keeping on improving in it. He explains to a bride what is suitable according to her outer appearance and the skin tone and designs them in accordance with their age, ideas, opinions and choice. It is very easy to work with the younger generation. They have knowledge of modern day trends.
Shammi came to this field almost by accident. He was involved in the drama & theater field until he got a chance to join the ITN as a trainee Make-up Artist. He obtained his basic theory and practical knowledge in proper manner during the two years of his probation period. He feels this talent flows in his veins and learnt it properly. Now he has established and created his own image in the field. He applies make-up to around 10-15 persons daily including presenters, models, actors on ITN instead of bridal dressing. He believes that the more you do it the better you get. Today he has a clientele covering international and local markets and has his own Salon in Ethul Kotte. Certain beauticians do not accept brides who are not beautiful but this should not be a quality of a good beautician. All brides are beautiful but what we have to do is beautifying them according to their skin tone.
When he meets a bride to be, he first congratulates her and asks the date fixed for the wedding. Generally it is easy if a bride contacts the beautician at least five months early. Then they have time to go for an exclusive design.
Thereafter, he starts the course of changing the outlook. If she is overweight they start by helping her to reduce weight and treating her skin. He usually has brides bring photos of any hair or make-up ideas they have so he gets a general idea of their interests. They talk about the dress style, flowers, general colors throughout the wedding and environment (indoors or outdoors). This gives a chance to evaluate what hes working with and then start designing the dress with their opinions.
Later they start with light make-up application and build to the intensity that the bride wants. Main focuses are on eyes, skin and hair color for natural guidelines for makeup choice. He tries to harmonize the dress, flower, eye, skin, and hair color together for an overall completed look. After that they begin styling the hair and try to compliment the face shape and style it appropriately with the headpiece.
A bride should always be concerned about maintaining her body. Develop a skincare regiment and be faithful about it - cleanse, tone and moisturise. Drink lots of water. Get plenty of rest. Get a trim on the ends of their hair 2 weeks prior to the big day. Plan the wedding as early as possible without leaving it to another day so that there would be no final hour rush. Distribute the responsibilities among near and dear ones and stay free of stress and be happy. If the brides can stay without stress she does not need a facial.
The atmosphere of the salon he works at is very casual. Hes faithful to his work, came far owing to the sacrifices he made. This is not only about money as he enjoys what he does. He also accrues lot of merit by helping others to be happy in their most important day of lives by making them beautiful.

Muhammad Ali hits out at Trump over Muslim ban: reports
Washington, Thursday: Muhammad Ali rebuked Donald Trump over his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, news reports said Wednesday, as the boxing icon became just the latest high-profile name to lay into the presidential hopeful.
Muhammad Ali
Ali, a Muslim, did not mention the Republican frontrunner by name, but a statement by the former heavyweight champ -- reported by NBC and ABC -- appeared directed squarely at Trump.
"Speaking as someone who has never been accused of political correctness, I believe that our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is," said the statement, referring also to recent terror attacks.
Ali, 73, was somewhat thrust into the debate when President Barack Obama mentioned Muslims were US soldiers and citizens and sports heroes, and Trump challenged people to think of a Muslim sports hero.
"I am a Muslim and there is nothing Islamic about killing innocent people in Paris, San Bernardino, or anywhere else in the world," the statement attributed to Ali said.
"True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion."
An outspoken champion in his youth, Ali won the world heavyweight crown only to be banned from boxing for nearly four years in his prime for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War on religious grounds. He was found guilty of draft evasion but the Supreme Court overturned his conviction in 1971 and his fight made him an iconic figure well beyond the sports world. AFP

Demonstrations by a few politically motivated TUs won't scare Govt - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said in Parliament that a government of the people would not be afraid by the demonstrations of a few politically motivated trade unions.
He questioned whether this is a political struggle or a trade union struggle Only the people can change this government. Do not make the people destitute even though you are in the political wilderness
The Prime Minister was joining the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2016 for the seventh allotted day under the financial heads of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping, Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine.
"We have drafted laws to pave the way for a private sector salary hike. This will be presented to Parliament in January. The process has been delayed and we express regrets over it. We have provided a number of relief measures through this budget.
He said that the government increased the salaries of the public sector, and private sector salaries would also be increased in January. "We are increasing the salaries of estate workers. We increased the pension payments by Rs 1,000, Samurdhi allowance, brought down the prices of gas, milk powder, flour, sugar, kerosene and other essential items. We increased the Mahapola Bursary by Rs 1,000, wrote off 50 percent of loans taken by farmers, gave Rs 20,000 allowance to pregnant mothers, gave a fixed price of Rs.50 a kilo for paddy, Rs. 80 per kilo of potato, provided a fertilizer subsidy to tea and rubber, pruned down the expenditure heads of presidency, introduced a special baking system for war heroes and an insurance scheme for fishermen. We brought down the fuel prices. We did all these within a year. People enjoyed these relief measures and they would not launch struggles against the government. Are these strikes staged against bringing down the fuel prices or against increasing the pensions or Samurdhi allowances
"Various Bank unions met me today and held several rounds of discussions. They have a reasonable fear that their revenue will go down with the reduction of leasing business. I have promised not to do so".
"What are these trade union leaders are shouting against What are their demands Do they need to increase the prices of essential goods of which the prices we brought down They reject this budget and call us to go back to the previous situation. We cannot do so just because the unionists call for that. People have given a mandate to us. They gave a mandate to President Maithripala Sirisena.
"Now the unionists talk of a Rs 10,000 allowance and demand it be included in the basic salary. We gave an allowance of Rs 10,000. If we add this to the basic salaries there would be another wave of strikes and union actions demanding rectification of salary scales.
"We are ready for talks. There is no means of strikes. Where were these strikers when Roshan Chanaka was shot dead Where were they when people were shot dead at Rathupaswala Where were they when
journalists were assaulted What is your problem Do not you like the presidency of President Sirisena
"It is our objective to bring about a minimum salary on the basis of cost of living. The current minimum salary is not sufficient for the cost of living. People have lot of expenses. They have to send their children to tuitions and medical expenses are high. All these are needed. Ask for them, they are reasonable demands. Some shout that no CEPA. There is no CEPA. How could we abolish something non existing.
"Now we are moving fast to develop this country. Do these trade unions against developing the country. Are you against building 500,000 new houses Are you against creating one million new jobs Are you against building a megapolis
"Doctors said that chronic kidney disease was a result of using some fertilizers and pointed out that they be controlled. Their opinion was that by controlling the chemical fertilizer we could control the spread of disease. So we took actions needed. Now these agitators demand for chemical fertilizers again. Am I a doctor to go against other doctors' opinion
"If you are dreaming of changing the government by staging protests, you are mistaken. You take the time and space of media to show off and get publicity for non-existing dissent. These agitators have no public support. Your actions would only cause inconvenience to people. The government would not suffer anything. Only people could change the government not few unions of bankrupt opposition could do so," he said.
Programme to provide pension to entire working community
Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said in Parliament yesterday that the government will formulate a programme to provide a pension to the entire working community in Sri Lanka. He was joining the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2016 for the seventh allotted day under the financial heads of the Ministry of Labour and Trade Unions Relations. Today, only 44percent of the working population receive a pension which leaves out 56 percent of the working population with a pension.
"We want to ensure that all of the working people receive pension. The previous regime tried take 10 percent of the profits of the EPF by forcefully to them. We will systematic the EPF enabling contributors receive more benefits. The Opposition is trying to deceive people propagating false facts on the CEPA agreement with India. "Our government will never sign the CEPA agreement under any circumstance".
"We appreciate the Health Ministry's move of launching an ambulance service with a doctor as a result of donations from India".
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara:- said this government has not done anything concrete to ensure the welfare of the working class. It is enacting laws which are inimical to the working class day by day and we condemn that. It is almost one year since the government pledged to give Rs.2,500 to the private sector workers. "We wonder why this has been delayed. All the working people have rejected this budget and accordingly, we will be organizing a massive protest on December 19 to express our objections to the budget. The government could not formulate a Labour Act for years.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe:- former Minister G.L Peiris once said that they would not permit us to pass any new labour laws in this Parliament. That is why it was delayed. But, it is in the process now.
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara:-The Prime Minister should not speak untruths in this chamber. The government has failed to stop the man power crisis. This budget has taken the side of employers instead of protecting employees.
'Govt. ready to face drugs mafia'
The government is ready to face the drugs mafia and reduce the prices of drugs by 5 percent, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
He said that the government passed the Drug Act and also the Drug Authority was set up.
The minister was speaking in Parliament yesterday joining the Committee Stage debate on the budget under the financial heads of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry.

He added although the people say there is a shortage of drugs, Rs 40 billion is allocated for drugs. He added that he learnt that drugs worth of Rs 300 million is destroyed after the expiry date".
Each hospital lab to get auto analysis machine - Rajitha
Each hospital which has a lab will be given an auto analysis machine worth of Rs 15 million each, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The blood analysis prescribed from the Colombo National Hospital is not permitted to be conducted by the private sector by now as an auto analysis machine has already been set up there.
He made these observation in Parliament yesterday joining the Committee Stage debate on the budget under the financial heads of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry.
"Earlier, the private sector was outside the Colombo National Hospital collecting blood samples for analysis like collecting liquid milk," Minister Senaratne said. "So we set up an auto analysis machine. But, even some are still going for private sector." He added that facilities will be provided to hospitals to do blood tests and other tests in 2016 it self.
He also said that Rs 321 billion has been allocated for Health Sector while the allocation for the same last year was Rs 206 billion. "The World Health Organization recommends that Sri Lanka Health sector is a model for the Developed Countries" Minister Senaratne.

Port city construction to recommence, with slight changes to initial agreements
The waiting game is almost over for the Chinese funded Colombo Port City as the new government slowly warms up to the idea. The Chinese government is also confident that that the project has successfully navigated troubled waters.
Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry Counselor and South Asian Division Director Chen Feng speaking to a group of media personnel visiting China said the new government of Sri Lanka has communicated that the port city project would be continued.
Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry Counsellor and South Asian Division Director Chen Feng.
"We welcome this decision. After the recent mutual visits by the leaders of the two countries, we felt that the new government has a very keen and positive attitude to China-Sri Lanka cooperation,"he said.
Last week Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, while addressing an event held to mark the 30th anniversary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), spoke of the "unique financial and business district" the Colombo Port City project would create. He expressed keenness for the project to recommence.
The project which begun under the last regime ran into stormy weather as the then opposition and activists questioned its viability and its possible adverse impact. After widespread opposition and pressure from activist groups in the aftermath of Presidential elections on January 8 the project was put on hold until additional assessments were conducted and the approvals given by the previous government were re-evaluated.
The Supplementary Environment Impact Assessment has now been concluded, and the report was submitted to the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department. The report is accessible to the public in 11 different government institutions. A final decision on the environment impact will be made by the department after considering public responses.
Referring to the issues the project faced from the beginning of the year Feng said that difficulties were not unique to this project only.
"We saw that there were some difficulties in bilateral projects because of the political changes in Sri Lanka. However, most of these projects have now returned to normalcy," he said.
China's interest on the Colombo port city and Hambantota harbour is no doubt linked to its geo-political strategy in South Asia. Sri Lanka has been a strategic partner of the programme ever since the 'One Belt-One Road' concept was announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013.
The 'One Belt-One Road' concept is a twofold strategy that focuses on connectivity and cooperation among countries in Eurasia. It envisages developing a 'Silk Road Economic Belt' connecting cities in Europe and Asia by land and a '21st century Maritime Silk Route' connecting ports via contiguous water bodies.
This will allow China to play a bigger role in international economic affairs and realize its geo-political ambitions.
A model of an international port city in Northern China.
The Colombo Port city is designed to be built on an artificially created island of about 575 acres (233 hectares) on reclaimed land near to the Colombo port. This 1.4 billion USD project is undertaken by the China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), which is a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Ltd. (CCCC).
The port city, comprising high-rise buildings including hotels, apartment residencies and high-end shopping malls will continue with slight changes to the initial agreements signed by the previous regime in 2014.
The Colombo port city and Hambantota harbour link Sri Lanka to the '21st century Maritime Silk Road' that extends from China's coasts through the South China sea, Indian Ocean, Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea with a stop in North Africa.
TheSilk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road
China has been a close ally in development initiatives over the past years in Sri Lanka and has been a friend for all seasons. However, when giving the nod to go ahead with the port city, Sri Lanka may have to find its own manoeuvres to balance its relations with India and the US. It is no secret that both these countries have been sceptical over the China funded port city because of its strategic location.
Chen Feng, during his meeting with Sri Lankan media personnel in Beijing, was also cautious to give the impression that the China's growing presence in the region was to accomplish common prosperity.
"We are developing friendly relations with all the neighbouring countries including India. In the recent years China-India relations are developing very fast. China and India now have a better mutual understanding. China's developing relations with Sri Lanka is not to compete with other countries," he said."
"Our only purpose is to improve further bilateral relations. As our President proposed the idea of 'One Belt-One Road', it covers all the neighbouring countries, especially the South and Central Asia. The purpose is to realize common prosperity. Sri Lanka is one of the most important partners of China in the 21st Maritime Silk Road," he said.
Chen Feng also expressed China's willingness to help Sri Lanka to improve infrastructure and create more employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the well-being of ordinary people.
"As friendly neighbours, the two countries have very good cooperation in economic development. China is developing very fast. We also want to see that our development can benefit neighbouring countries. The new government of Sri Lanka hopes to expedite the construction of industry parks and attract more foreign investments. China has the ability and strong desire to extend cooperation in areas of infrastructure and industry. There is smooth progress in the construction of China funded kidney hospital and water treatment centres in the areas affected by chronic kidney disease.
There are more opportunities in Sri Lanka for investment and the Chinese government has encouraged Chinese companies to invest in Sri Lanka," he said.
Despite repeated assertions from the Chinese and Sri Lankan governments lately that the port city project will go ahead, certain environmental issues are still unanswered. The responsible parties are yet to announce a final decision on the supplementary environment impact assessment that was submitted last week.

Ransilu brings honour to SL
Iron man and powerlifting prodigy Ransilu Jayatillake brought honour and glory to Sri Lanka when he won six gold medals in two separate competitions in powerlifting at the Commonwealth Games organized by the World Powerlifting Federation and held in Vancouver, Canada.
Twenty nine year old Ransilu Jayatillake a product of Kingswood College and has had his training in borth powerlifting and weightlifting at the Kandy YMCA and also under his father D U Mohotilal Jayatillake who has represented the country in four sports and is the holder of a large haul of records. Ransilu Jayatillake is now employed at Commercial Credit Company Limited who gives him all the encouragement.
Ransilu Jayatillakes first championship event was the Row Championship where no equipment is used and in short the competitor has to display bull strength in raw and he was pitted against competitors from China, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Phillipines, Canada and many other countries.
Bulky Ransilu Jayatillake was not at all concerned of the muscle and strength of the fellow competitors and he maintained his cool. Competing in the under 105 kilogramme category his performance is as follows:
Squat 255 kilogramme  gold medal Bench Press 120 kilogramme  no medal Dead Lift 305 kilogramme  gold medal Total 680 kilogramme  Silver medal
The next competition was the Equipped Powerlifting in which equipment could be used and the wearing of safety equipment like knee guards, ankle guard, thigh guard etc could be used. Competing in the 120 kilogramme category his performance is as follows:
Squat 220 kilogramme  Gold medal Bench Press 140 kilogramme  Gold Medal Dead Lift 300 kilogramme Gold medal Total 760 kilogramme  Gold medal
When you analyze his performance in the two different competitions, he has set up a few records and one of them is a possible Asian record which has to be clarified by the relevant authorities. His lift of 305 kilogramme in the Dead Lift in the Row competition is the best by a Sri Lanka and will go into the Sri Lankan record books and possibly into the Asian record books.
The total 740 kilogramme is the best over by a Sri Lankan in any competition and becomes the first Sri Lankan to pass the 700 kilogramme mark. This was in the Equipped competition. His winning four gold medals is itself a record which is unsurpassed any powerlifter in this country.
Ransilu Jayatillake was one time an essentially a weightlifter who switched on powerlifting a few years back as he had the brute strength to work on both iron games where you utilize your strength and muscles to lift the iron and the bar bells.
Ransilu Jayatillake is a high performer in the iron and at the Commonwealth Games Weightlifting championship held in Samoa in 2012 he won two gold medals in the Junior Category the first Sri Lankan to win a medal in weightlifting in this competition.
In 2011 when he lifted 300 kilogrammes in weightlifting he became the first Sri Lankan to reach the triple century mark. He started weighting at the age of 10 has set up over 100 records when he graduated from the teens to the National and International in weightlifting.
In powerlifting he has set up over 30 records and is presently the powerlifter with the highest lift.
He is also a physical trainer and has trained many rugby clubs and rugby playing schools to success.

## Title: Riddle of development

[Cross Currents]
Riddle of development
Sri Lanka has graduated into a middle income country, says the World Bank. The same tale is repeated loudly by our leaders with a certain degree of pride. Yet how much the man in the street feels it is a moot question for with all this graduation or promotion the gap between the haves and the have nots has widened. There are hundreds of thousands on the list of Samurdhi beneficiaries.
The criteria for such elevation is the Gross Domestic Product per capita, a tangible material absolute quantity. Now absolute figures are clever at concealing reality or painting things in a rosier hue than the natural. For example look at the following figures: More than fifty years ago in 1963 Sri Lanka's GDP was US $ 117.31 whereas it stood at US $ 3,279.89 in 2013. However, the income gap between the rich and the poor remained almost unchanged or worsened slightly during this half a century. In 1963 the richest 20 percent of the households received 52.3 percent of the national income while in 2013 the figure had increased to 53.5 percent. In the same time the poorest 20 percent had their share of the national income marginally reduced to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent. Thus the growth of the GDP had not made any change in the lives of the poor.
The GDP is thus not a reliable index of development if one consider human development in toto. Former Indian President Abdul Kalam understood the concept of development more broadly. He wrote: "... it does not make sense to achieve a 'developed' status without a major and continuing uplift of all Indians who exist today and of the many more millions who would be added in the years to come'. What he said of India is also true of Sri Lanka.
Development of health and education
From the foregoing it is clear that one should have a holistic approach to development instead of a mere economic or political economic one. The ultimate benefactor of development should be 'man' and it is this human aspect that should be at the centre of attraction. Hence social development, particularly development of health and education plays a vital role in such an approach. It should not be forgotten that access to basic health and education constitute a fundamental human right.
Man does not live by bread alone, it is said. Hence questions of people's happiness, democracy and freedom too matter in development. Of particular importance is the enhancement of the cultural level of the population. Though we boast of a high literacy rate, in today's context functional and emotional literacy occupies a greater weight. These areas requiring urgent development.
Cultural development also includes among others the development of wholesome ethical and moral standards among the population. In view of the degenerating discipline and the proliferation of crime the importance of this factor cannot be exaggerated. Considering our history of communal strife and war development should have as a concomitant the development of national unity and cohesion in a spirit of fraternal relations among diverse ethnic and religious communities.
Social development under capitalism has been plagued with the wanton destruction and depletion of natural resources, the destruction of the ozone layer protecting the earth from ultra-violet rays, adverse climatic changes, the interference with the ecological balance of our planet thus causing the extinction of many species of flora and fauna and endangering the very existence of the species man too. We have already seen how much damage has been done in our own country due to environmental destruction and degradation caused by human folly.
Modern globalization
Holistic approach to development, nevertheless does not undermine the pivotal role of economic development. Nor should it ignore the macro-economic and micro-economic realities faced by the country in the context of the historic transformations brought about by modern globalization.
In this context the need to rely on advanced technology including bio-technology and nano-technology cannot be over-emphasized. The latter technologies offers us the possibility of overcoming the technology gap that separates us from the developed world. Unless we attain a higher technological level at least in a few key areas of production, our goods will not be able to compete in the international market. It is the only way of overcoming the unequal exchange we developing countries are faced with in the global market.
This requires a commitment to an independent development of our economy. Though foreign capital is welcome its entry into strategic areas should not undermine national security or interests of the local population. It should also be underlined that Sri Lanka should pursue a development model of its own instead of trying to imitate Singapore or Korea or any other country. In this context one should be wary of one-size-fits-all prescriptions handed out by international financial agencies and institutions. Experience of East Asia and other regions of the world has already demonstrated that it is those countries that did not blindly follow those prescriptions that succeeded in attaining development faster and earlier than those that faithfully offered their independence as a tribute at the altars of the Gods of international capital.

The Singing Christmas Tree comes alive once again
The Singing Christmas Tree at Mount Lavinia Hotel will come alive this year from December 16 to the 23, adding to the line-up of events at the colonial heritage hotel. Featuring a host of angelic voices of choirs from several leading schools in Colombo, the Singing Christmas Tree has become an iconic event at MLH, looked forward to by many.
Emerging from the tradition of singing around the Christmas Tree, the first Singing Christmas Tree also known as the Living Christmas Tree was created in 1933 in Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi.
The tree which was initially outdoors was subsequently incorporated indoors as part of Nativity plays.
The idea of the Singing Christmas Tree was introduced at Mount Lavinia Hotel three years ago, and has since become an emblematic event of the hotel. It has evolved into a platform where such choirs as the Jesus College Choir from Cambridge, UK have performed in the past.
We at Mount Lavinia Hotel take pride in initiating unique and exciting ideas in all events we host. The idea of the Singing Christmas Tree was novel to us when we introduced it several years ago, and every year Team MLH is equally excited to host this event.
This is our way of welcoming the season of peace and joy, Mount Lavinia Hotel Public Relations Manager Tinaz Amit commented.

Speaker wants party leaders to discuss No Faith Motion against Ravi
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya suggested that the date to move the No Faith Motion against Finance
Minister Ravi Karunanayake be discussed at the Party Leaders' Meeting.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday during a dispute between the Opposition and the government.
Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the actual passage of the No Faith motion against the Finance Minister should be to defeat the budget proposals.
"The Second Reading of the budget proposal has been passed with a two third majority",Kiriella said. "So there is no point of moving a No Confidence motion".
The Leader of the House said so when Opposition member Bandula Gunawardena raising a Point of Order said that the No Confidence motion against the Finance Minister has been included in the Order Book as an undated motion.
He added that a date should be fixed for this motion.
The Speaker Karu Jayasuriya stated the date should be decided at the Party Leaders' Meeting and then the motion can be moved in the House.

SRI LANKAS demons and deities

The island of Sri Lanka has always been a popular stop for aliens, extraterrestrials, gods, devas, dark angels, sky dwellers, demons, deities  whichever way you describe them. Their chronicles in traditions, folklore, prehistoric cave drawings, archaeological evidence and ancient travellers records support that there have been strange beings living in this island from time immemorial.
There were and still are mountains, hills, strange and unexplained stone buildings and plants with mysterious powers that are beyond human understanding even in the 21st Century.
Knowledge through Generations
Interestingly, 200 million years ago, Sri Lanka was geologically linked to India, Madagascar, Australia and Antarctica in a land mass known as Gondwana. This is a possible explanation for the many language similarities indigenous Veddahs share with Australian aboriginals. According to geography experts, Sri Lanka broke off due to rising sea levels into a land that became known as Lanka Dupa (Island of Lanka). According to the Ramayana epic, this took place because of the misdeeds of Ravana.
Great civilizations have sprung up and disappeared around the world throughout the ages. Egyptians, Mayans and Aztecs built great civilizations but after reaching a heady height, disappeared mysteriously. But in Sri Lanka, a blip in the Indian Ocean, direct descendants of the men and women who built the great Sigirya Rock Fortress and irrigation schemes have survived and passed on their knowledge through generations that still exist in small pockets around the country.
While ancient Egyptians mummified their dead, the Sinhalese learned ways to put people into a deep slumber. The last example of Sri Lankan mummy-making can be seen in the Shrine of St. Xavier in Goa. The mummy on display is allegedly the body of Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thero, which was taken by the Portuguese who ruled parts of Sri Lanka during the colonial era of the island. Whether it is fire eating at the Kandy Perahera or pouring boiling hot water over oneself at the Kataragama Festival, the powers of the island people at times seem so unbelievable, that non-believers say they are just clever tricks, and yet, when they touch the water it burns their hands.
Pressure Point Techniques
While the Japanese, using ninja assassins, developed sophisticated methods of killing people, the Sinhalese developed cyborgs and killer machines (pilli). Western science discovered anesthesia only in the 20th century, but King Buddhadasa, the great sage of the historic city of Anuradhapura, operated on a cobra. The surgical instruments used by the king can be found in the Anuradhapura Historic Museum. While many nations boast of pressure point techniques that can kill humans, ancient Sinhala armies stopped rampaging elephants with their bare hands using own finger point techniques and today, villagers will shove sharp instruments through their tongues showing no sign of pain at all.
While some Western scientists ponder whether aliens exist, the concept of alien visitations is familiar to Sri Lankans. While nanotechnology is considered the next big thing in finding cures to illnesses, there are medical practitioners who heal patients using their touch and plants from forbidden forest areas that are still heavily protected and out of bounds for tourists.
Sinhalese Medicinal Recipes
Many of these techniques survive today but are hidden and protected by old families in Embilipitiya, Matara, Dumbara and Kandy, who are very secretive about these skills. Learning of these families and their techniques to cure diseases like rabies, cancer and psychological disorders, in the 1990s, the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine tried to collect these ancient Sinhalese medicinal recipes in order to create a database.
They failed as the village people, holders of these ancient powers, would have rather died than passed on this knowledge that is kept by only those who have grasped Sri Lankan complexity, which is hidden under a very thin layer of westernization. Western and ancient Eastern cultures have fundamental differences. The most reliable way of uncovering the hidden secrets of the past is through archaeology and the handful of descendants who still exist and keep alive the secrets of Sri Lankas amazing ancient civilization.

The premises have been regarded as the first ever green rest area in Asia. This is an essential rest stop for commuters travelling along the expressway. Each rest area consists of rest rooms, restaurants, supermarkets, Bank ATM machines, clothing stores, first aid and vehicle parking. The fuel stations and service stations are also due to commence functioning in the near future.
On a secondary note, another initiative that Sunrise Engineering has taken up is their collaborative efforts with Ceylon Electricity Board for the purpose of installing Sri Lanka's first fully integrated 'Rapid Charging' Network point at strategic locations around Sri Lanka towards the charging of Electric vehicles (EV). Sunrise Engineering, as a company, strives to highlight the significance of embracing renewable energy integrated Rapid Charging whilst moving forward with the landmark project with Canowin.
The concept of rapid charging will enable electric cars to be fully charged (80%) in 15 minutes. From a broader spectrum, the world's leading innovative entities in rapid charging technology have partnered exclusively in the implementation of EVPOINT.
Sunrise Engineering Executive Director Damith Maiarachchi, elaborated the great potential that Sri Lanka attains in the future of enhancing sustainable approaches as well as educating the public about the significance of utilizing quality, safe and secure re-charging elements when it comes to dealing with electric vehicles. The first batch of rapid charging points "Veefil" and "Rapture" are manufactured by Tritium in Australia and Circontrol S.A in Spain has also been scheduled to be implemented around the beginning of 2016. These intelligent, multi-standard, fully integrated, Re-charging points will be available 24/7 at decisive locations under the preliminary stage of this project.
"We want to give Sri Lanka the best in technology and innovation. These intelligent Re-chargers which will be manufactured and imported is fully certified and encompasses all relevant global regulatory criteria that would ensure quality over quantity. Bringing down the world's most advanced innovation to Sri Lanka, we at Sunrise Engineering believe in emphasizing "EVPOINT" Countries First Fully Integrated, unmanned "Rapid Charger Network" towards enhancing e-mobility in Sri Lanka in the long run," Maiarachchi said.

Sri Lanka squad leaves for Junior Rugby Asiad today
We want to achieve better results than in 2001 - coach Martis
Following threats of resignation by the coach and injuries to key players the Sri Lanka under 20 junior squad eventually put aside their plight and take wing to Singapore today to participate in the Junior Rugby Asiad which will be held from December 13-19.
Sanath Martis
Their opening match of the tournament is against Singapore on December 13 followed by Hong Kong on December 16 and Chinese Taipei on December 19.
The biggest setback to the team led by ex-Isipathana captain and burly number 8 Omalka Gunaratne is the absence from the line-up of Royal College number eight Supun Warnakulasuriya who will miss the tour due a serious knee injury he suffered during a practice match against Police SC at Police Park last week,
"Supun is a big loss for our national under 20 team, because he's one of the best players who read the game well according to the situation," head coach Sanath Martis told the Daily News. "Supun has played his heart out for his school Royal College and national team. When you play a sport in the nature of rugby injuries are always bound to come your way sooner or later. Nothing can really stop that. I hope he will recover fast and I expect to see him play soon."
Martis defended his decision to pitting the national junior team against an 'A' division club side like Police ahead of an important tournament which led to a few players suffering injuries.
"Remember 21 out of 35 players who are in this under 20 national side are contracted to clubs like Navy, CR and FC, Police and Havelocks, so they have already tasted club rugby standards because they are in it," said Martis.
"If the present Royal College team is capable of facing the senior national rugby team in practice matches, why can't this under 20 national team face a club side like Police What's wrong with that
"I had arranged to play practice matches with club sides like CR and FC and Havelocks in the past four days but unfortunately had to cancel them due to poor ground conditions due to the heavy rains, otherwise without any hesitation I would have gone ahead and played them."
Talking of the team's chances in the Asiad, Martis said, "I will not underestimate Chinese Taipei. A couple of years back at Havelock Park we lost to them in the same junior rugby Asiad. They are a competitive team, but this time we are ready for them. We want to perform better than the team under Jeevan (Gunathilaka) in 2001."
Under ex-Thomian captain Jeevan Gunathilaka, the Sri Lanka team qualified for the Junior World Rugby Trophy by ending runner-up at the Junior Asiad held in Sri Lanka in 2001.
However to qualify for the World Rugby under 20 in Harare, Zimbabwe in April-May, Omalka Gunaratne's team will have to emerge champions at the Junior Asiad.
The squad of 25 named last evening by the national selectors in conjunction with the coaching staff:
Props: Charana Chamikara (St. Joseph's), Ayesha Maduranga (Royal), Lasindu Ishan (Science/Havelock's), Nikila Gunadeera (Royal).
Hooker: Nishal Deshatha (Isipathana).
Locks: Matheesha Sarathchandra (Isipathana/Navy), Umesh Madhushan (Royal/Havelocks), Isuru Rangala (Trinity), Mithila Perera (Wesley)
