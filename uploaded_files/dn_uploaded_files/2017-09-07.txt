Country free of ethnic and religious fundamentalism
I was critical of the previous regime because of the ethnic and religious fundamentalism that existed with the blessings of the former President and his family, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, today there is no ethnic and religious fundamentalism and people have been given the freedom to practice their religions.
Humanity has emerged defeating fundamentalism.
The minister was addressing the gathering at Nindavur recently with regard to the launch of development projects at Nindavur Hospital.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the Northern political parties have extended their support towards the government. Today, people live without fear of getting abducted by white vans. If any type of fundamentalism raises its head in the future, I will fight against it, he said.
This Yahapalana Government will keep all its promises made to the people. I took a decision to provide drugs for cancer patients during their lifetime. Earlier, they received drugs worth Rs. 1.5 million. Now there is no such limit. This decision is worthier than the Rs. 10 million spent from the President's Fund for my heart surgery, he added.

I have never given out information or documents while I served in COPE: Rosy
Former Member of Parliament Rosy Senanayake, in a statement released to the media this evening, denied having given out any information or documents relating to COPE investigations.
I have never given out information or documents to any party during the time I have served in the COPE, the former MP said in a statement.
It is a total misrepresentation by the media of a recorded conversation by two parties that had no substance. I will take all necessary steps against such media organizations who have used it to cast aspersions on my character and integrity, Senanayake said.
Whilst the media continuously reported on COPE proceeding at the time, I have not at any time given out information with regard to the proceeding in any form.
The recorded conversation that took place in August 2016 by at which time I was not a member of COPE nor was I a member of parliament. Therefore my son has no access whatsoever to such information and he has not been requested to provide any such information nor would he have accepted such a request by any party, she said.
Any person reading the media reports can clearly see that they are using this third party conversation as a headline grabber whereas there is zero substance in the details. I am deeply saddened by this undeserved attack and will do all that is necessary to keep the public informed of the reality of the situation, the ex-MP said.

Aloysius cannot be contacted yet
All attempts to contact Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius by the CID has failed, by late evening yesterday.
Accordingly, the CID has not being able to handover the notice issued by the Treasury Bond Commission summoning Aloysius to give a statement to the CID.
According to evidence, former Member of Parliament Rosy Senanayakes son may have given Arjun Aloysius a copy of PTL CEO Kasun Palisenas statement to the first COPE committee.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda played a telephone call conversation between Perpetual Treasuries Limited Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado, from which this evidence surfaced.
The said telephone conversation was one of the many telephone call recordings deleted by PTL IT Executive under the direction of PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado and supervision of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
The said telephone call recording has been originated by Kasun Palisena to Nuwan Salgado on 12 August 2016 at 12.58 p.m. Palisena has made the call while overseas, specifically in United Kingdom. Corresponding serial number of the conversation is 176614.
According to the conversation Palisena has wanted Salgado to obtain a COPE statement given by Palisena which Arjun has received from a person they referred to as Rosys son.
The conversation if loosely transcribe will be as follows.
Palisena: Here, a copy of the full statement that I gave to the COPE is with Arjun. He has got it from Rosys son. Take it to your hand.
Salgado: Should I call the boss
Palisena: Yes, boss will have it with him.
Commissioner Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardena cautiously asked
ASG Kodagoda whether the content is relevant to the mandate of the commission.
JJ: We do not want anything that is not relevant to our mandate.
ASG K: It is very much relevant.
JJ: The fact that a copy of a statement given to COPE coming out should be a matter of the Parliament. Parliament should handle it, not us.
ASG Kodagoda then resumed questioning the witness.
ASG K: So, according to the call conversation what manner in which Arjun Aloysius seems to have received this copy
Salgado: According to Palisena, Aloysius has received it from Rosys son.
ASG K: Who could be this Rosy
S: Since there is COPE involved, it could be a reference to former MP Rosy Senanayake.
Rosy Senanayake was a member of the sub COPE committee investigating to the Treasury Bond issue.
ASG K: Who is Rosys son
S: Kanishka Senanayake.
ASG K: Do you know of a particular association between Kanishka Senanayake and Arjun Aloysius
S: Could have been friends.
Justice Jayawardena (in a lighter tone): Could have been an alumni of a particular college!
ASG Kodagoda also questioned the witness on why Palisena wants Salgado to take this said copy into his hands.
ASG K: Does not Mr. Kasun Palisena says (in the telephone conversation as to) why he wants the COPE statement
S: He says it should be sent to the Governor.
ASG K: How did you understand the reference There are Local Governors, there are CBSL Governors, and there are changes of Governors
S: It should be Governor Mahendran.
Following the conversation, Salgado has inquired Aloysius about the said copy. Aloysius said he will take care of it. I do not know what happened thereafter. Salgado said.
The said telephone conversation also refers to a PTL Director named Sanjeewa Fernando. Accordingly, Fernando on that day has gone to the Parliament and has requested for information from Salgado. I got the impression that there was someone else with Fernando, who was the one looking for information and data. Salgado said.
JJ: Did this Sanjeewa Fernando testify before the COPE
ASG K: I dont think so. So we can draw inferences.
Commissioner Justice Jayawardena then requested ASG Kodagoda to carry on with leading evidence while summing up, So, up to now there is a pilfering son of an MP, an over inquisitive Governor and an unprepared director.

Fishing in high seas:
The Fisheries Ministry conforming to EU requirements of recording and reporting fishing activity in high seas, has provided electronic logbooks for skippers of 2,400 multi-day fishing vessels.
The government has spent Rs. 80 million for the provision of electronic logbooks, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
He said it was by reason of not taking into account and ignoring international requirements such as this that prompted the European Union to impose a ban on Sri Lankan fish under the previous government.
The e-logbooks have been distributed among skippers of multi-day boats through district fisheries officers, ministry sources said.
In keeping with recommendations of the European Union, the electronic logbook software system was made by the Information Technology Unit of Colombo University, the sources said.
The skippers of vessels are to report their fish catch, landing and transshipment declarations through the e-logbook.
One can carry it in ones hand like a phone, but it is rougher than a phone. It is like a phone as anybody can use it without difficulty. The item is user friendly and water proof, an official said.
E-logbook is for transmitting and keeping fish catch and activity data. It is transmitted via satellite technology to international monitoring authorities.
The use of E-logbook is compulsory for vessel skippers. It will be helpful for them to carry out their fishing activities on a scientific footing," he said.

Govt. will relieve country of massive debt burden: PM
The present National Government has created 400,000 jobs so far. It has also built 200,000 new houses during the last two years. Reduction of fuel prices, provision of a bag of nutritious food items worth Rs. 20,000 to expectant mothers, Rs 10,000 salary increment to government servants and reduction of grave crime rate by 30 percent are among the other services rendered to the people by the National Government, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this observation addressing a meeting held at Siri Kotha UNP headquarters, Pitakotte yesterday to mark the UNPs 71st anniversary.
The meeting began after all religious services and garlanding of busts of late party leaders and placing of floral tributes by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Ministers Gamini Jayawickreme Perera, John Amaratunge, Malik Samarawickreme and Sajith Premadasa and Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake.
Quipping that on going development work delayed his arrival for the meeting, the Prime Minister said construction work on the Rajagiriya flyover project cought him in a brief traffic jam. This is real development because they had undertaken development work neglected by the former regime. The flyover project was a topic of discussion for 10 long years during the Rajapaksa era but they had no funds to launch the project soon. As they assumed power they launched the project under a Spanish aid scheme.
The Prime Minister said the government had taken steps to relieve the country of its massive debt burden within the time of the present generation through a system of proper debt management undertaken during the next three years.
Detailing the work done by the government the Prime Minister said one of their main pledges was to create employment opportunities. So far nearly 400,000 jobs had been created in the formal, informal and self employment sectors. Some of these jobs brought good dividends while the income devised by other were sufficient to make ends meet though not that satisfying. While trying to increase these earned incomes the government would also strive to provide employment to the rest of the youths too.
The Prime Minister said the government has built houses through various schemes. Financial assistance had already been provided for the construction of more than 200,000 houses. Already 200,000 houses had been provided under rural and urban housing, resettlement and Estate housing schemes.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said We reduced fuel prices by 22 percent. The Rajapaksa regime earned massive profits through the sale of fuel. But we dont want to do this. Fuel prices would be further deceased if world prices plummeted further.
Prices would be increased if world prices escalated. This means that benefits as well as burdens had to be equally shared by all,the Prime Minister said.
He said a program had been launched to provide Rs.20,000 as nutrition assistance to expectant mothers. The government increased the salaries of government employment by Rs.10,000 disproving the accusation levelled at the UNP by the Rajapaksa regime saying it was bent on pruning state sector jobs.
They created a new political tradition by setting up a national government led by President Maithripala Sirisena. All this was possible because late D.S. Senanayake set up a party which was capable of serving the nation 71 years ago, the Premier Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister said Our party is capable of new thinking. Our party is always concerned about the countrys well being as well as the well being of the youth generation. The party had more work to accomplish including the fulfilment of the hopes and aspirations of its supporters. They hoped to accomplish a great deal of work within the next two years too and they would request the support of all for the success of their future tasks.

Hurricane Irma causes devastation across the Caribbean

Hurricane Irma has caused widespread destruction across the Caribbean, reducing islands to rubble and leaving at least seven people dead.
The small island of Barbuda is said to be "barely habitable" while officials warn that the French territory of St Martin is almost destroyed.
With the scale of the damage still emerging the death toll is likely to rise.
Meanwhile, two other storms have strengthened to become hurricanes.
Irma, a category five hurricane, the highest possible level, was passing north of the US territory of Puerto Rico,the US National Hurricane Center said.
More than half of the island's three million residents were without power as Irma caused heavy downpours and strong winds. Officials have said that power could be cut off for several days.
The most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade had wind speeds of 295km/h (185mph) and was expected to pass near or just north of the coast of the Dominican Republic on Thursday.
Hurricane Irma first hit the dual-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda. At least one death, of a child, was reported on Barbuda, where Prime Minister Gaston Browne said about 95% of the buildings had suffered some damage.
"It is absolute devastation," he said after flying over the island, home to some 1,600 people. "The island is literally under water. In fact, I'm of the view that, as it stands now, Barbuda is barely habitable."
However, Antigua, population 80,000, escaped major damage, with no loss of life, he said earlier.
Officials have confirmed at least six deaths and considerable damage in the French territories of St Martin and Saint Barthlemy - the French holiday destination popularly known as St Barts.
St Martin's airport, the third largest in the Caribbean, has been destroyed, with local officials saying that most buildings on the territory have been levelled.
Residents are said to be without drinking water and electricity and emergency crews are still trying to reach the worst-hit areas.
"It's an enormous catastrophe - 95% of the island is destroyed," top local official Daniel Gibbs was quoted as saying.
Significant damage was also reported in the Dutch section of St Martin, known as Sint-Maarten.
US President Donald Trump said he and his aides were monitoring Irma's progress. "But it looks like it could be something that will be not good. Believe me, not good," he told reporters at the White House.
It is still not yet clear what impact Hurricane Irma might have on the US mainland but projections suggested it could hit the state of Florida on Sunday.
Officials started evacuations of tourists and residents of Florida Keys, a resort archipelago.
Flights to and from several airports in Florida were being suspended, while Orlando's international airport said that commercial flights would stop from 17:00 local time on Saturday.
A state of emergency had been declared for Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, mobilising federal disaster relief efforts.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the government was in touch with British overseas territories caught up in Irma, and was doing "everything we can to help those afflicted".

Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita found guilty in Sil Cloth distribution case

Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were today found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC over Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) distribution case and they were sentenced to three-year-rigorous imprisonment by Colombo High Court.
While handing out a lengthy judgment, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accused's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015-Presidential Election.
While observing a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
Each accused were further ordered to pay a fine of two million rupees and in default of the payment of fine they will have to serve additional one year imprisonment.
This is the first time, a High Court delivered a judgment regarding an indictment filed by Attorney General pursuant to the investigation carried out by FCID.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita under three counts, in connection with a criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign. They were found guilty of all charges.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the two accused on three counts of committing a criminal misappropriation funds amounting to Rs.600 million at TRC while spending for a Sil Redi distribution program in contravention of the Telecommunication Act, No. 25 of 1991 Act during the period of October 30, 2014 to January 5, 2015. The prosecutors alleged that the funds referred to had been remitted to a bank account maintained by Secretary to the President.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General decided to drop charges which had been filed under Public Property Act against the two accused.
In his judgment, the High Court Judge observed that on December 5, 2014 a sum of Rs.600 million had been remitted to a bank account maintained by former Secretary to the President through the intervention of Anusha Pelpita, without obtaining Board of Directors approval (TRC).
Evidence given by a secretary attached to the TRC had proved that the Board of Directors approval was not obtained regarding this transaction. It has been revealed that this transaction had been done through a method called circulation in which no written approval was given to remit concerned funds, the High Court judge added.
While observing that he cannot agree with the defense contention that the Sil Redi distribution program was a long-time process, the High Court Judge maintained that this program had been initiated with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate in an urgent manner.
According to the defense contention, distribution of Sil Redi comes under the expenditure of President. The defense was of the view that due to non-sufficient funds at the Presidents expenditure, they were tended to seek financial assistance from TRC. The court is of the view that they should have sought funds through a supplementary estimate to meet financial requirements without following irregular and illegal process.
The accused were charged under section 386 of the Penal Code for dishonestly misappropriating a sum of Rs. 600 million.
Former Election Commissioner Mahin da Deshapriya, former Presidents coordinating Secretary (Religious Affairs) Ven. Vatinapaha Somananda Thera are among the persons who had been named as the witnesses.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the prosecution.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with counsel Kanchana Rathwatte and Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.
UPDATE:
Meanwhile,Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing on behalf of former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita who were convicted of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC over Controversial Sil Redi distribution case today informed that the defense is expecting to file an appeal in the Court of Appeal challenging the judgment of Colombo High Court to convict his clients.
Defense counsel today sought a date to pay off the fine and pavement imposed against the accused. Accordingly, the High Court set September 20 to pay off the fine and compensation.

National Shrine of Our Lady of Matara: Feast from September 8 to 10
The National Shrine of Our Lady of Matara celebrates the Feast from September 8 to 10.
Thousands of pilgrims will gather to celebrate the Feast. Mgr. Ned Alles has remarked in 1949 that this shrine will turn out to be a miraculous Shrine in time to come.
Rev Fr Michael Colin assumed duties as the new Administrator and Parish priest of the Miraculous Shrine assisted by Rev. Fr Lasantha Fonseka. The Parish family will see to all arrangements for the convenience of the pilgrims.
The Shrine of Our Lady of Matara is located on the Southern tip of Sri Lanka. The original shrine was the Church of Our Lady of Mahature as Matara was once known. For the past one hundred years, the Miraculous Statue of Our Lady of Matara has rested at St. Marys Church Matara. Today, this church stands as a beacon of light to visitors and pilgrims.
The Statue is eighteen inches in height and is of the Madonna and Child. Mary is standing with the Child Jesus upon a pedestal featuring three ocean waves. Three times the Statue of Our Lady has been taken by the sea and each time She returned to Matara. The last time was as a result of the Tsunami. The statue was found three days later.
The statue belongs to the Portuguese type of sculpture of the early 17th century. It is a mystery as to who brought the statue to Sri Lanka, but we are aware that it was in Sri Lanka when the Portuguese occupied the area almost 400 years ago.
According to the story that has been passed down through generations, a huge wooden crate was pulled up by fishermen off the coast of Weligama, near Matara early in the 17th century. When the crate was opened, the statue was found inside untouched by the sea water. The fishermen handed over the statue to the Parish Priest and then placed in the original church of Matara. This was the first time that Statue returned from the sea. Sometime after, the statue had to be hidden due to the religious sanctions imposed by the Dutch, but again it returned to Matara.
Later a cholera epidemic swept through the entire southern district and claimed hundreds of lives. The people of Matara rallied around the statue and prayed for an end to the epidemic. The statue was taken in a solemn procession through the streets of Matara. People of all religions participated. After a few days the area was declared safe by the health authorities. There were no fresh cases and no further deaths. Since then the people has viewed the statue as miraculous.
In the early 1990s, the First Bishop of Galle, Rt. Rev. Dr. Joseph Van Reith, a Belgian had the statue send to Europe to be restored by a famous sculptor Zeus of Gehent. After restoration, the sculptor placed the statue on the ship Beachy to be sent to Matara. The ship was caught in a storm in the North Sea and nearly wrecked. Most of the cargo was destroyed or thrown overboard. The ship made it to Middlesborough before continuing on to Colombo, but not before yet another rough path at sea on part of the remaining cargo was also thrown overboard.
Finally, the ship arrived in Colombo without the statue. The Bishop of Galle wrote to friends in Belgium to try to retrieve the priceless item. The statue was traced to a man in Middlesborough, who demanded money in exchange for the sculptor. When the sum was refused, he damaged the face of the statue and threw it away. The figure was recovered and returned once again to Zeus for repair. The sculptor spends a great amount of energy and time restoring it to its original beauty.
The Holy Hour followed by the Eucharistic procession and Benediction will be held on September 8 at 4.30 pm. On September 9 at 3.30 pm His Lordship Most Rev. Dr Justin Gnanapragasan the Bishop of the Diocese of Jaffna together with the Bishop of Galle will be welcomed. September 10 is the Feast Day. Holy Masses will be held at 4 am, 5 am and 6 am. The Festive High will be at 8am.
Masses will be held at 11.30am, 4 pm and 6 pm for late comers. Thousands of Catholics and non Catholics are expected to gather at the feet of Our Heavenly Mother, seeking her intercession in all their needs and celebrate her birthday.
On September 9, a special train will be in operation from Chilaw (Bangadeniya to Matara). On September 10, a special train will be in operation from Matara to Chilaw (Matara to Bangadeniya).

New Inland Revenue Bill will increase revenue by Rs. 45 billion: Finance Minister

The estimated additional revenue from the new Inland Revenue Bill is Rs 45 billion, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament today.
The Minister moving the new Inland Revenue Bill, that introduces a new income tax structure with the aim of raising the state revenue by closing existing loopholes in revenue collection, stated the new provisions would come into effect in two phases.
The provisions related to income taxes will come into effect from October 30, and the legislation will be fully implemented from April 1, 2018.
The Minister said parallel to this move, the Inland Revenue Department, Customs Department and the Excise Department would undergo a series of important modifications next year.
He said the Government intends to introduce a universal tax file number to every citizen over 18 years. However, he clarified that it no way means that every citizen over 18 years has to pay income taxes. If you have no income, you can mention that. They will be entitled to a number of other privileges too, he said.
The Minister said the new Inland Revenue Bill was based on four main concepts, burden proportionate to ability to pay, certainty, convenience and efficiency of collection, adding that Government hopes to achieve its revenue targets without burdening the low and middle income earning people. He said the new legislation has provided concessions and tax exemptions to Small and Medium Scale Entrepreneurs and many other needy sectors including the exports, agriculture, IT, education and tourism etc. 
He said the employees who earn salaries less than Rs 100,000 per month have been exempted from the PAYE tax. He pointed out that senior citizens have been exempted from income tax for the interest they earn up to Rs 125,000, adding that a person should have at least Rs 15 million deposits to earn the above mentioned interest.
Samaraweera, expressing his confidence that the new legislation would create a level playing field for all, stated international best practices have been incorporated in its making.
According to the new Bill, high income earners are liable to pay the Capital Gains Tax, and higher rates of Corporate Tax apply for liquor, tobacco, and betting and gaming. 
Samaraweera reiterated that the main aim of the new Act is to up the state revenue by focusing more on direct taxes while reducing the dependency on indirect taxes. Currently our revenue from direct taxes stands at only 2 percent of the GDP. Ours is the lowest in the region. Sri Lanka is precariously positioned due to gradual drop in state revenue from 19 percent of the GDP in 1990 to 10 percent of the GDP in 2014.
However, we could raise it to 15 percent of the GDP during the last two years. Our aim is to increase it up to 20 percent in the next two years, with the help of new Act. We aspire to change the indirect to direct tax ratio from the present level of 82:18 to 60:40 by 2020, the Minister said.
He noted the penalty for tax evaders would be increased in the near future, adding that provisions would be introduced shortly to expedite taking legal action against them. We have proposed a very transparent and efficient system of revenue collection incorporating modern taxation concepts, he added.
The Minister pointed out Sri Lanka is ranked number 158 out of 185 countries as per the Ease of Paying Tax International Index, adding that the country must strive to improve this to enhance investor confidence.
Bringing out statistics on poor commitment of the affluent to pay taxes, the Minister said that only 43,900 companies and 119,300 individuals have registered in 2016 to pay taxes. Even among those registered only 30 percent of the companies and 48 percent of the individuals pay the relevant taxes on the due date, he remarked.
Referring to an Income and Expenditure Survey of 2012-2013, Minister Samaraweera pointed out the richest 20 percent of the country shared 52.9 percent of total household income, where as the poorest 20 percent only shared 4.5 percent.
There are well-off tuition masters, lawyers, large scale businessmen and doctors who engage in channel service who do not pay income taxes properly. This has to change, he insisted.
The Minister said that the Government hopes to replace the existing Customs Ordinance that was introduced in 1860 with a new one to suit the modern time.

The capacity of the LNG terminal will be decided upon the gas demand in Sri Lanka and is expected to be developed in two years after completion of initial formalities, it added.
Petronet will soon form a joint venture with Japanese and Sri Lankan companies. Sri Lanka has plans to build a 300 MW gas-fired power plant in Kerawalapitiya adjoining an existing power plant. The existing plant which uses oil to generate power, would also be converted to LNG once the terminal is set up and gas imports start.
LNG has become significantly cheaper in the last year and many countries have begun switching their power plants to LNG. The LNG terminal, which will import supercooled natural gas in ships, will take 2-3 years to be built. The terminal in Sri Lanka is part of Petronets vision to own 30 million tons per annum of LNG import and re- gasification capacity by 2020, Chief Cxecutive Prabhat Singh said.
Petronet already operates a 15 million tonnes per annum import facility at Dahej in Gujarat and has another 5 million tonnes terminal at Kochi in Kerala. It has signed preliminary agreement to build a 7.5 million tonnes LNG terminal in Bangladesh and is also looking at setting up smaller facility in Mauritius. Singh said Dahej is also being expanded to 17.5 million tonnes over the next two years.
The India-Japan collaboration comes after a string of Chinese successes in Sri Lanka. China has managed to revive its flagship USD 1.4 billion Colombo Port City project and is also engaged in expansion of major infrastructure projects it built in the past.
The Colombo Metropolitan Area is inhabited by more than 5 million people or roughly 25 per cent of the total population of Sri Lanka generating over 50 per cent of the GDP.
The LNG terminal near Colombo would improve economics of various power plants and also generate immense direct and indirect benefits for vast majority of Sri Lankan people, the statement said.
Sri Lankan economy is growing at 4 to 5 per cent and primary energy consumption is estimated to increase to 19 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2030.

Police reprimands three-wheel driver with sticker depicting violence against women

Police have taken steps to warn a three-wheel driver who had a sticker depicting violence against women on the back of his three-wheeler to refrain from inciting violence against women in that manner.
Police had educated the three-wheel driver, a resident of Haldamulla, on the graver consequences of the sticker - that depicted a man kicking a woman - and also of the laws protecting women in society.
Police said they would not hesitate to implement the law against perpetrators of crimes against women, and the driver was let go only after he had removed the offensive sticker from his vehicle.
Police had also questioned the three-wheel driver at length to find out where he had procured the sticker in order to ensure no other stickers of that nature were being sold anywhere else in Sri Lanka.
Police said they were acting on a complaint directed by Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka and said they would continue to monitor the situation to ensure there was no casual discrimination against women.

Premier stresses role of business for regional development
Speaking at the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) Investment Forum on Monday morning, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the role of business for regional development. We all have to agree on the ease of doing business in South Asia and get all governments to implement that criterion. What matters most is the ease of doing business, the Premier said.
Focusing on Sri Lanka specifically, Wickremesinghe asked, What is our aim Our aim is to become the hub of the Indian Ocean. Our future, like our past, is in the Indian Ocean and in being the hub of the Indian Ocean.
Doing this requires connectivity, he explained. He referenced the progress Sri Lanka has made on that front, with the development of ports in Colombo, Hambantota, and Trincomalee, as well as the airports in Katunayake and Hambantota. He also referenced the expressways that have been developed and are in development and the expansion of WiFi to more rural areas.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the potential for the South Asian region if its scope is not limited. If we enact the full potential, South Asia will be the fastest growing region in the world. It is not so now, he said.
Our region doesnt end in Bangladesh. It extends down to Australia. Youd have to include Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and within the Southeast Asian subcontinent, Vietnam. And west of Pakistan is Iran. Just imagine if we unleash our potential and link it up with these countries. Destiny should be really unkind to us if we cant do this.
Themed 'Unleashing South Asia,' the investment forum was held at the Hilton Hotel in Colombo. The forum signifies the importance of regional cooperation in terms of economic and social development to ensure that the SAARC region has significant impact on the South Asian and global economies.
The investment forum is being organized by the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI), the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industries Sri Lanka (FCCISL) and MP Events Lanka. The investment forum is attended by over 250 investors (local and international) including entrepreneurs, fund managers, CEOs and other senior corporate representatives.

President able to garner the support of many minority parties

The 66th SLFP Party Convention which brought many of the minority parties on to its platform is hopeful that they would support its candidate at a future Presidential election.
UPFA General Secretary and Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Mahinda Amaraweera addressing the weekly SLFP media briefing today challenged any other majority party to be able to do the same,
We saw Sumanthiran from the TNA with Doughlas Devananda of EPDP, then we had the hill country parties of Digambaram and Mano Ganesan. We also had Rauff Hakeem of the SLMC and representatives of the ACMC, said Minister Amaraweera.
He went on to add, It is only President Sirisena who has been able to do this. These parties have said that the Convention has renewed their trust in the President.
If we are to win an election, we cannot do so without the support of these parties, explained Minister Amaraweera further as the SLFP under President Sirisena has tried hard to win the confidence of the minorities which it lost during the previous regime.
The 66th Convention held on 3 September, the Minister said was a harbinger of the support the President and SLFP enjoyed in the country and said it was more successful than any of the previous Conventions they have had.
Members of the Central Committee and MPs had met President Sirisena on Wednesday evening to discuss the future actions of the party in the aftermath of the Convention, said Amaraweera. Those gathered had decided to target party supporters at the grassroots level,
At the village level, we have noticed that we are enjoying much support. Despite whatever the Joint Opposition says, the average SLFPer at the grassroots is with the Party and President. Thus we decided to concentrate our efforts there, he said.
Commenting on reports that certain SLFPers were set to leave the government, the Minister said he was unaware of such a move and that the Joint Opposition has been playing the same tune for some time now with no discernible results to show.

Public information campaign to combat human trafficking launched
A public information campaign to combat human trafficking was launched yesterday to raise awareness among the general public.
This public information campaign is a part of a project implemented by the Justice Ministry in collaboration with International Organization for Migration, with the financial assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Government of Australia. This campaign aims to raise awareness through TV commercials, district and divisional level public officials, as well as community-based organizations.
Addressing the media after launching the campaign, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said that the Justice Ministry and National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force are making every possible efforts to combat this crime. She said that the Government has made significant progress in combating human trafficking and country has been upgraded to 'Tier 2' from 'Tire 2 watch list' by the US Department of State Trafficking in persons report and as a result of that, the country would continue to receive aid, loans and other benefits.
Human trafficking is an organized crime and it is a punishable offence under the penal code of Sri Lanka. Men, women and children are trafficked for labour or commercial sexual exploitation. The Ministry of Justice implemented a national strategic plan between 2015 and 2019 to prevent and combat trafficking and raising public awareness was a key component of that action plan, said the minister.
Addressing the occasion, Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and Maldives Bryce Hutchesson said that millions of people worldwide were subjected to human trafficking and more than fifty percent of them are from Asia-Pacific region. Australia is committed to continuing to work closely with Sri Lanka to combat human trafficking. Not just bilaterally, but we also work regionally and globally as well. Sri Lanka and Australia are working to address the challenges of human trafficking principles' regional mechanism, said the High Commissioner.
