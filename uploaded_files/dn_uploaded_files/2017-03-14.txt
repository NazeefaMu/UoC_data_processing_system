Champion Prince of Wales team breaks 40-year hoodoo
Prince of Wales won their Big Match in 1977 after 18 years and it also fell on their Centenary Year.
Pemlal Fernando was the captain of Prince of Wales and Walter Fernando captained St Sebastians. It is interesting to note that during this encounter both the captains fell for first ball ducks and to cap it all it was repeated in the second innings as well but not first ball ducks but ducks all the same. Probably these ducks came about due to big match nerves. All this took place not in a pond but on a cricket field.
The scores of that match were as follows, in the first innings Sebastianites were all out for 86 with Munaweera 2 for 27, Sripal Silva 3 for 36, Pemlal Fernando 1 for 10, Suresh de Silva 2 for 6, Professor Sandun Keerthichandra 1 for 2 taking the wickets.
In reply Prince of Wales got 118 for 9 declared; Jayantha Perera 17, Amal Silva 23, Wirantha Fernando 10, Munaweera 33 and Sripal Silva 28. Sebs in their second essay was all out for 70. Munaweera 3 for 15, Gamini Silva 1 for 9, Pemlal Fernando 1 for 14, Sripal Silva 1 for 9, Keerthi Chandra 3 for 4. The target for victory was 39 runs and the Cambrians got 41 for 2 sealing a famous victory. Jayanath Perera-11, Amal Silva 17 n.o. and Wirantha Fernando 13 n.o.
Harsha Peiris (1968-1981) an outstanding Cambrian and a key figure in the business circles of Sri Lanka was the host who felicitated this Cambrian Big Match winning team. Peiris stated that this team deserved recognition and honour as none of the teams played thereafter could achieve a Big Match victory, although the College has produced cricketers of repute. He also adds that this unique achievement was due not only to the talent that was available in this outfit but also to the team work, dedication and excellent captaincy by Pemlal Fernando. Incidentally this team also included Sudath Munaweera whose son Dilshan Munaweera is representing Sri Lanka at present.
Peiris pointed out that perseverance, dedication blended with hard work was the formulae for their success and it richly deserved recognition.

Gentleman on the yellow crossing
A trouser-clad gentleman who was crossing a zebra strip at a snail-speed while talking to someone on the other side of his mobile phone, held tight-close to his ear had to face an embarrassing situation at Eheliyagoda town last Sunday.
The town was fully crowded because of the Sunday Fair. The traffic congestion was noteworthy. The gentleman paid no attention to the vehicles that halted to let the commuters cross the road on the yellow crossing. He was quite engrossed on the phone, and had not even reached the middle of the crossing until some time lapsed.
Suddenly a nervous driver raised the engine noise of his car and drove forward. He stopped the car in front of the gentleman.
What the hell you are doing yako! Are we to wait here till you finish your dirty call
He shouted aloud and drove ahead fast.
The gentleman was left speechless. This time he did not take much time to finish the yellow crossing. He made a dash for the other side of the road amid the catcalls and jeers from all fronts.

## Title: Devas proposal

Devas proposal
The proposal by EPDP leader Douglas Devananada to dedicate a day each year for commemorating ALL those who died in the Eelam war should engage the attention of the government, now that it is earnestly pursuing the path of reconciliation. Soon after assuming office, the Yahapalanaya government took several positive steps to narrow the gulf that existed between the two communities, paving the way for a healing of wounds and starting on the process of reconciliation.
In the afterglow of the war victory, the Rajapaksa regime assumed the mantle of conqueror, relegating the Tamil community, as a whole, to the status of a conquered race, to gain maxmum mileage for its political project. Rajapaksa also bellowed nationalist rhetoric and claimed that devolution of power would certainly be offered to the Tamils but not on the terms suggested by any outsider, but strictly on the terms of the government. While, no one will dispute the stand that outsiders should not be allowed to meddle in the affairs of a sovereign state, the tone and tenor of Rajapaksa gave the impression that the Tamils were living on sufferance of the majority community.
However, President Sirisena strove to reverse this state of affairs no sooner he assumed the mantle of leader of the country and made several conciliatory gestures. For the first time since independence, Tamils were allowed to sing the National Anthem in their own language and steps were taken to release large swathes of land, occupied by the military during the war, to their rightful owners. The President also made frequent visits to the North to interact with the people and address their grievances. On the reconciliation front, the appropriate mechanisms were established to bring redressed to those who lost their loved ones and work is on in respect of the Office of Missing Persons, to trace the whereabouts of those who went missing during the war and offer compensation to the families of the victims.
True, there are complaints that the work in this respect has become sluggish and the reconciliation process is moving at snails pace. But, those who make such complaints fail to appreciate the tight rope walk, politically speaking, the President and the government have to tread, given the baying of racist elements who are guided by their myopic political beliefs.
Be that as it may, coming from Devananda, who in fact was a target of the LTTE, and on whose life several attempts had been made, the proposal sounds genuine indeed. It is certainly not aimed at placating LTTE sympathizers, nor a suggestion made to appease those who are making attempts to commemorate an LTTE heroes day. The MP, in fact, has presented a private members motion in parliament in this respect, which, it is hoped, will win the approval from all the members who cherish the bringing together of both communities. In the motion, Devananda has proposed that an appropriate day be declared to commemorate the people of all religious and nationalities that speak all languages, who lost their lives to the war, and to take measures to celebrate that day annually. The motion has further proposed to build a memorial in Omanthei in the North to honour their dedication in the name of the motherland. By suggesting that the day be dedicated to ALL, the MP has sought to divest it of any tinge of racism and make it an inclusive event.
Presently, we commemorate the War Heroes Day on May 19 annually, the day that the country was liberated from terrorism and the President rightly declared that the event, in fact, be dedicated to ALL those who laid down their lives in the war, as has Devananda. However this is still seen as an event dedicated to honour and commemorate only the Sinhala war heroes, by the Tamils in the North. Hence, their attempts to mark the same day in the North to commemorate their own war heroes.
Here, one should come to terms with reality. The LTTE, no doubt, is the most barbaric, bloodthirsty terrorist outfit ever known. By the same token it also cannot be denied that atrocities were also committed by the soldiers against civilians, which is all part and parcel of war. It should also be taken into consideration that a good majority of the LTTE outfit comprised of child soldiers, who were forcibly removed from their parents at the point of a gun. Civilians perished on both sides of the ethnic divide. It has been the perennial grouse of pro LTTE elements in the North, that, if the JVP is allowed to have a day dedicated to commemorate their fallen heroes, why not for them. In their book, the LTTE were not terrorists, but freedom fighters, who waged war to liberate an oppressed community.
Hence, in the name of reconciliation, it would not be out of place if Devanandas suggestion that a memorial be erected in the theatre of war, itself, be considered and an official day to commemorate ALL the war dead be declared, so that the Tamils in the north would not be left out of the event.

Djokovic, Federer, Nadal advance at Indian Wells
INDIAN WELLS March13: Novak Djokovic launched his bid for a sixth ATP Indian Wells Masters crown with a two-set triumph over Kyle Edmund as the stars shone Sunday in the California desert.
The 46th-ranked Edmund served for the second set at 5-3, but world number two Djokovic broke him en route to a 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) triumph.
His reward is a tough third-round clash with former US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro, a 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 winner over fellow Argentine Federico del Bonis.
I think I played very well in the first set, Djokovic said. Second set was obviously up and down. But credit to Kyle for playing some really aggressive tennis.
He made a lot of winners in the beginning and midway through the second. There was not much wrong I did. I did miss some forehands. But other than that, it was a very solid match. Good, quality tennis, a good test. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal also reached the third round, Federer flying through with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over France's Stephane Robert in just 51 minutes. Nadal opened his account with a steady 6-3, 6-2 victory over Argentina's Guido Pella.
The three stars are packed together in a remarkable bottom quarter of the draw.
But Djokovic said he can't afford to think about a possible quarter-final clash with either of his longtime rivals with del Potro coming up.
While Djokovic has won 12 of their 16 career meetings, the Argentine handed him a crushing two-tiebreak defeat in the first round of the Rio Olympics -- a defeat Djokovic avenged in Acapulco this month. Big guy, big serve, big forehand, Djokovic said of del Potro.
Definitely not the draw that you like early in the tournament and that you wish for, but it is what it is, added Djokovic, who is trying to get back to the winner's circle after a shock second-round exit at the Australian Open and a quarter-final loss to Nick Kyrgios in Acapulco.
Ninth-seeded Federer, resurgent after a 2016 season marred by injury, downed Nadal in an epic Australian Open final to secure his 18th Grand Slam title. He hit a speed bump in Dubai this month, failing to convert three match points in a third-round loss to Evgeny Donskoy -- but he was firing on all cylinders against the 81st-ranked Robert.
Nadal was pleased with a solid opening effort against Pella, made trickier by the oven-like mid-day temperatures and the fact that Pella, like Nadal, is a left-hander.
I didn't try to do amazing things. I tried to play solid, the fifth-seeded Spaniard said. For moments I played well. For moments I played a little bit less well. Important thing, I won, and I won in straight sets. Nadal knows he'll have to turn up the intensity if he wants to end a hard court title drought stretching back to 2014.
The bottom half of the draw also features fourth-seeded Kei Nishikori of Japan and sixth-seeded Marin Cilic.
Nishikori, a two-time finalist this year still looking for a first title of the season, eased past Britain's Daniel Evans 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday.
The jam-packed half of the draw is a contrast to the wide-open top half, which lost a lot of its lustre on Saturday when world number one Andy Murray was stunned by 129th-ranked Canadian qualifier Vasek Pospisil. . AFP

Durban stripped of 2022 Commonwealth Games - reports
London: The 2022 Commonwealth Games will no longer take place in Durban, South Africa, the BBC and other British media reported Monday.
South Africa sports minister Fikile Mbalula indicated that the government might withdraw its financial support because of the cost of staging the multi-sport event.
Durban was named as the 2022 Games host in September 2015 but Mbalula told a news conference in Cape Town in February that the South African government and the organising Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) had still to reach an agreement over costs.
It does not look like we will find each other, said Mbalula. We have given it our best shot, but we cannot live beyond our means.
The CGF executive board was holding a scheduled meeting in London on Monday with the future of the 2022 Games on the agenda.
A CGF spokesman contacted by AFP would not confirm the reports about Durban losing the Games but said he expected to issue a statement later Monday.
The mayor of Liverpool has said the northwest English city is prepared to host the 2022 Games if they are no longer in Durban. AFP

Eight Sri Lankans on freighter hijacked off Somali coast
Eight Sri Lankans are on board a ship that is believed to have been hijacked by Somali pirates.
Navy Spokesman Lieutenant Commander Chaminda Walakulage confirmed that eight Sri Lankans were onboard, but said the Sri Lanka Navy was still in the process of clarifying details.
We have lost all communication with the ship, he said. So there is no way of knowing what exactly has happened.We are still in process of verifying details.
He said he didn't know if the ship had been hijacked by pirates, of if some other incident had occured. 
He said Sri Lanka had only been notified that the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in France had registered a distress call from the ship, which said it was being chased by two speedboats.
This ship belongs to Comoros,  he further clarified. It is not a Sri Lankan vessel. Eight of the crew members are Sri Lankans.
He added that Sri Lanka had informed the appropriate channels on the incident:
This had occurred in the Gulf of Aden. This area is frequently patrolled by maritime security patrols and anti-piracy operations patrols conducted by the Combined Maritime Patrol Force  the Combined Task Force, which comes under the Combined Maritime Patrol Force  CTF 151  is responsible for counter piracy actions  we have informed these organisations and they are on high alert.
In addition we have notified the UN Drugs and Traffic Control - we have asked each of these agencies to enable us to rescue the eight Sri Lankans onboard this vessel, he said.
The Ministry continues to remain touch with shipping agents, concerned authorities as well as relevant Sri Lankan Missions overseas to ascertain further information on the matter in order to ensure the safety and welfare of the Sri Lankan crew.
It said it would share information on the incident, as when received, in a manner not prejudicial to the safety of the crew.

EU workplace headscarf ban is legal, says ECJ

Employers are entitled to ban workers from the "visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign" - including headscarves, Europe's top court has ruled.
But the ban must be based on internal company rules requiring all employees to "dress neutrally", said the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
It cannot be based on the wishes of a customer, it said.
It is the court's first decision on the issue of Islamic headscarves at work.
The ECJ's ruling was prompted by thecase of a receptionist fired for wearing a headscarf to workat the company G4S in Belgium.
Belgium's court of cassation had referred the case to the EU's top court for clarification.

The Ex-Muslims of Sri Lanka (EMSL) organisation said it wants the government to bring to an end all activities carried out by foreign-funded Islamic groups, organisations, individuals and related elements in Sri Lanka.
According to EMSL sources, the foreign-funded Islamic groups have links with the Islamic terrorist group, ISIS. They have become a threat to the existence of ex-Muslims in Kattankudy, the organisation said.
They are causing a crisis of faith for Muslims. Some of them have started teaching their doctrine of fundamentalism, an EMSL member said.
He said: There are factions of radical Islamic groups in Kattankudy who are supporting the ISIS, upholding their terrorist ideology. They have also undertaken to play the ISIS advocate role.
The incident that took place between two Mulim factions on March 10 in Kattankudy, indicates that extremist groups are ready to spread their terror,he said.

To express or not To express
What is the nature of your fear They say that Saturn is the planet of fear, insecurity and anxiety. If you fear Saturn, you will be considered unfortunate. Even if you consider yourself as someone who is plagued with fear, you cannot claim yourself as someone unfortunate. There are many unfortunate others who live in constant fear. They live in close proximity to you, probably without much of your attention.
Professor Kamani Jayasekara is more concerned about them.
I do not see much difference between dogs and humans. They can also feel. We could well relate to their feelings. They share our emotions. Unfortunately people are more concerned about pedigree whenever they want to keep them as pets,
A bulk of Jayasekaras poetry is devoted to dogs. Someone can well state that Jayasekara is writing at a rate. She has been acclaimed with several awards too. Jayasekara traces her writing habit to her own childhood under the influence of her father, who was also a professor, while entry into university sharpened it. Jayasekara majored in Greek and Western Classics while offering English Literature as a subsidiary.
I was taken aback by the thought engraved in their philosophy. That motivated and inspired me more to concentrate on poetry,
Jayasekara identifies Greek philosophy as a rich fountain of thought. That thought bears similarities to oriental philosophies like Buddhism.
The dramatists were keen on finding out the reasons behind tragedies. Since I have been a practising Buddhist, I dont see much of a difference. It just shows that my thought stream is shaped with things beyond life. You need something insightful to entertain the reader.
But English poetry is an almost alien sphere in Sri Lanka where the majority has difficulties in understanding the language and another portion hardly interested in the genre of poetry. All the same, Kamani Jayasekara finds enough muse to writing poetry.
I write because I have something to tell. I mostly write to myself because I need to express my inner thoughts somehow. True, it is difficult for the majority to grasp the language. But that situation is gradually changing now, as more and more people are trying to read in English.
But poetry is not without concerns, Jayasekara adds. I write poetry, because I am a person who is desperately trying to put my words. Its coming from within. Being a woman is the next problem. A reader tends to link a poetic experience with the poets personal life. It is unfair by the poet. A poet does not always dwell on the personal life.
Is poetry the easiest way to enter the literary scene You will perhaps support this statement, if you have seen the countless poetry on facebook walls. Every passing minute seems a poetic muse for them.
You cannot write about every single thing like going to the bathroom. You should have something striking to write. And you should have a sharpened language to express them. For that you have to read a lot. Then you can write what strikes you. You need to cultivate that capacity.
Kamani Jayasekara calls herself old fashioned as she does not approve of reading on screen.
I do not see it as reading at all. That is problematic. When you read a physical book, you get the feel of it. You do not get it when you read on internet or screen. You do not find companionship there. It is not readership.

Fairway selected to turn waste into energy
Given the rapidly escalating problems surrounding the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) especially in the Western Province, the Government has seen fit to adopt a waste-to-energy approach in order to ensure that MSW is disposed of in a hygienic and sustainable manner.
The disposal/treatment of 650 and 500 metric tons of MSW per day at selected locations in Muthurajawela and Kardiyana respectively was proposed as Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects with the Waste Management Authority of the Western Province.
The Urban Development Authority published a Request for Proposals to initiate the project. Following the completion of national procurement procedures the Ministry of Megalopolis and Western Development announced that Fairway Waste Management and K C H T Lanka Jang had been selected to carry out the task of converting waste into energy at the given locations of Karadiyana and Muthurajawela respectively.
The projects were launched on March 10 at Waters Edge, Battaramulla. Located within the jurisdiction of the Boralesgamuwa Municipal Area, Karadiyana has been used as a dumpsite for MSW collected from seven local authorities in the Colombo District.
Fairway Waste Management has identified a number of issues surrounding the open dumping of waste over a long period of time and gained knowledge of a number of methods by which such waste can be successfully disposed of.
With the use of German and Danish technology Fairway Waste Management plans to set about constructing a waste to energy plant in the 10 acres of land allotted to them in Karadiyana and begin operations as soon as possible.
As a company that has invested in future technologies such as Bio -technology research, Fairway Holdings (Pvt) Ltd supports and implements a number of endeavours to ensure energy and environmental conservation in order to assure a sustainable future for the next generations.
The countrys leading real estate developer is known for its promotion of sustainable living and being extremely conscious of its carbon footprint. The practice of building green has always been one of the organizations leading philosophies and by developing a waste-to-energy project, Fairway Holdings hopes to further develop awareness about the importance of energy and environmental conservation, thereby ensuring a healthy, sustainable and green future for Sri Lanka.

Forum on 'Maximising on the east west shipping route, Hambantota Port, Kra Canal'
Ships or no Ships, Hambantota Port has been commissioned, what can we do about it The Shippers' Academy Colombo has organised an industry forum on 17th March 2017 at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Auditorium from 3.30pm onwards.
The forum will discuss the current situation with regard to the ports and shipping industry and is expected to brain storm various industry view points on Hambantota as well as the current shipping industry issues pertaining to Sri Lanka.
As the government and the Ministry of Ports and Shipping are now in dialogue with China on a long lease and an industrial zone in Hambantota, there are different opinions in the industry on the viability of the port, the model of development and the government solution. On one hand, it is said that government is facing serious debt issues as the current business generated out of Hambantota is extremely low and thus the Sri Lanka Ports Authority is stretched for its resources to both service loans and administrative costs in Colombo and other ports. On the other hand, its revenue has to be utilized to pay Hambantota debt from this year onwards as per government information.
Given the current business model and the inability of the government to pump in more resources it has turned to the builder and the funder of the Hambantota port China to work towards a long-term lease etc.
The forum will also discuss a much talked about canal project in Thailand known as the Kra Canal. Although it has been a long-standing project that was discussed for more than two centuries due geopolitical reasons it seemed the realization of the project Is a long way away. However, with the recent global developments including the South China Sea security issues and more regional trade developing in Asia new shipping and logistics routes are also planned for supply chain security and to develop diverse trade routes.
The forum will discuss both Hambantota and the Kra Canal issues, how it will affect Sri Lanka as a maritime nation. Former chairman of CILT Rohan Abeywickrama, Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents Chairman Capt. Ajith Peiris (CASA), CEO of the Shippers' Academy Colombo, Rohan Masakorala and other industry personnel will join with presentation and the discussion and to focus on the merits and the de-merits of the said projects. Ranel T. Wijesinha, Founder of The Thought Leadership Forum will moderate the forum. (www.shippersacademy.lk)

CEO, TUI Group, Davind Burling said they hope to announce the Groups plans for the next three years in November this year.
Under the proposed training program, trainees will receive internationally recognized certificates and language training, making them globally employable.

The Executive Committee of the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will meet next Thursday (16) to decide stern future action to be taken in connection with the attacks on medical students and other students who protested against SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today (14) he said that the GMOA vehemently condemn the attack on innocent unarmed students.
It is the sole responsibility of the Government to prevent such brutal attacks and similar incidents, he said. Dr. Zoysa, said it was the Cabinet Ministers who were preventing the President from solving the issue, and that they should take the responsibility of the attack.
"After holding several discussions with all stake holders, the relevant Cabinet Ministers have failed to implement those decisions made by the Presidential Committee appointed to solve the SAITM issue," he alleged.
"Under this situation, it is absolutely normal for students' unrest to develop in connection with the issue.
This issue still prevails since relevant Cabinet Ministers have not implemented the decisions made by the Presidential Committee, he said.

Golmaal 4 goes on floors
After Bhatts Raaz series, Rohit Shettys Golmaal becomes only the second Bollywood franchise to make its fourth part. While the film, titled Golmaal Again, was announced few months ago, the cast and crew have finally kicked off the shoot on Thursday.
All the three parts of the film were successful at the box office and we can expect even better from the fourth part.
Parineeti Chopra, who replaces Kareena Kapoor Khan, the lead actress in the second and third parts, took to Twitter to share a picture of the clapboards of all the four films and added that the madness begins today.
Apart from Parineeti, Tabu will be another female lead in the film with Ajay Devgn, Arshad Warsi and Tusshar Kapoor, who were part of all three parts, to spearhead the cast again. It is not clear yet if Shreyas Talpade and Kunal Kemmu will be part of the cast yet as Neil Nitin Mukesh has also been signed for the film and it is possible that he would replace either of the two.
There is also some confusion over the release date. The makers had earlier announced that the film would be releasing on Diwali but it is also being reported that the release date would be delayed considering that Rajinikanth-Akshay Kumar starrer 2.0 and Amitabh Bachchans Aankhen 2 have also announced the same release date.

Govt. committed to safeguarding farmers: President
The farmers are the real owners of the land and the government takes the responsibility of safeguarding that ownership, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President made these observations distributing the title deeds to residents of the Moneragala district under the Derana Abiseka Programme organised by the Uva Provincial Council, at Wellawaya on Monday.
The President said these farmers didnt possess any legal documents to the lands that they cultivated and developed so far. The farmers shed tears for not having rain and sometimes they are unable to sell their agricultural produce for a fair price. They also lack the ability to purchase fertilizer and pesticides. They face many difficulties engaging in their agricultural activities," he said.
He said, the government is ready face these challengers provide relief to the farmers as agriculture leads the country to prosperity. As a solution to the water scarcity in the Moneragala district the government commenced the construction of the Kumbukkan Oya Water Project last month, the President said.
He said 25 percent of the people in Moneragala are affected by poverty and 16 percent suffer from malnutrition. Therefore, the government will take all measures to address these issues by uplifting the standard of health facilities.
2017 is dedicated to poverty alleviation and the government is ready to launch various projects in this regard, he said.
The President said in 2016 and 2017 severe drought was experienced in Anuradapura, Polonnaruwa, Moneragala and the North West. Consequently the farmers couldnt achieve their agricultural goals. But, we are lucky to experience rain now as a blessing to the county, he noted.
"Some power hungry elements were happy when we experienced the drought but with the prevailing rain their hopes were shattered as the government launched people focused projects during drought, he said.
The President said some independent media channels criticize the government, but the government is very stable. The President also emphasized the necessity to upgrade the facilities of the Wellawaya hospital. He made these observations after opening the new building of the hospital. The President distributed title deeds to farmers of Wellawaya, Moneragala and Madulla Divisional Secretariat areas.

Grave injustice for dryden and pope in Sri Lanka
I have always been an anglophile since I began to suck the nectar of English language. One would be compelled to label me as a Brown Sahib or a man licking the boots of the colonial masters when I pen these lines in favour of the great poetic figures of that far away land. Let me also remind them that I quite palpably understand those who criticize the west send their children there for their higher education. Our Sri Lankans are both double tongued and double minded. I always call a spade a spade. We should give the devil his due. We, as responsible and rational minded senior citizens, should leave behind a legacy for our posterity to thrive.
The circumstances compel me to focus the much needed attention of the relevant authorities to the aforementioned topic with the least delay. The defects of this nature seem to run in the blood of the department of examination because our poetic icon of Chimney sweeper fame suffered the same when had been anthologized for GCE (O/L) English literature. Not a single question was set on his highly successful poem GARDEN OF LOVE once a few lines had been given for names sake. There is something wrong somewhere.
My concern here is another acute defect connected with the GCE (A/L) English Language and Literature question paper bearing the subject number 73. I do not wish to underrate the vast subject knowledge of the question paper panel on this subject, yet the visible absence of DRYDEN and POPE in the array of literary periods in the paper. A careful and analytical perusal of the past papers would drive home the idea that no proportional representation of the periods and writers could be found. Due to lack of journalistic acumen among most of the teachers of English Literature in the country vital subject areas do not come into discussion in the print or electronic media.
The writer would like to play the devils advocate on the above title if any competent authority would come forward.
Poetic icons
Another pertinent aspect is that a new syllabus is said to have been drafted to be effective from 2019. This particular syllabus would remain only for this year and the next. The panel of the examination board will have to repent forever, if they are palpable enough, if they dont do justice to the above poetic icons this year.
JOHN DRYDEN and ALEXANDER POPE were the high priests of the AUGUSTEN period of English poetry. It is heard that the students enjoy their poetic efforts develop a very critical outlook of the society. Their universal applicability opens their flood gates of imagination. Not only that but also the inspirational value of these poems has paved the way for their creativity. The last decades of the 17th century and the early decades of the 18th century of England were greatly benefited by their poetic endeavours. They were the pioneers of the neoclassical period of English literature. Their great efforts to effect social reforms in England deserve to be honoured in Sri Lanka at least by setting a question on the said paper. In their view, classical theory and nature of the world were inseparable. It is the time-tested truth. Hitherto it has stood the test of time.
Moral values of public figures
The million dollar question is that in relation to other literary periods the two Auguston poets in our discussion rendered a yeoman service for the uplift of the moral values of the public figures for the betterment of the society. On the other hand, their relevance to todays Sri Lanka is immense.
Our politicians and other public figures could be highly benefited if we could prepare a guide book and impose some parameters for their rational conduct based on them. Their poetry was basically biting satire on politicians. They took public figures and incidents of the society and fired well targeted salvos to put them on the correct path.
It goes without saying that the upper class society in any country is rotten with unspeakable failings or foibles. To bring back social harmony was their ultimate aim. They made a concerted effort to be inspired by classical literature and pass the benefits for social progress. The drawing room society and the illegitimacy came under their hammer. Their diction in writing was superb and mockery did the needful. Their hyperbolic presentation of the characters is good read. Humour and sarcasm could make the classrooms ribs breaking.
THE PORTRAIT OF ZIMRI and THE RAPE OF THE LOCK respectively by JOHN DRYDEN and ALEXANDER POPE are anthologized for the students to study for their examination purposes. A microscopic view of the past question papers from 2011 to 2016 convinces to us that the same poems have been repeatedly chosen for the exam to test the students. Yet, these two great poets have been sidelined for no apparent reason. England deserves their due share from us if we use their assets for our intellectual nourishment.
The time is opportune to create a genuine interest in the children to study English literature both at GCE (O/L) and (A/L) because of the very reason that it paves the way for good English. The standard of English of both teachers and students is poignantly dwindling. Thus, the results have gone down.

A gripping finale
After 17 years of playing one of the most popular characters in the X-Men franchise, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine/ Logan) naturally has a lot riding on his hunky shoulders in Logan  the third and last installment in the solo Wolverine series.
Dont expect to see the X-Men in all their glory because the characters have aged and been through the fires. Xaviers declining mental and physical health (hes in his 90s now) and Logans ageing body almost make us feel sorry for the two characters. While Logan earns a living by driving a limousine, getting drunk and getting into fights, Xaviers disintegrating mind compels him to stay sedated in order to keep his colossal psychic powers under control. The film has a lot of gory scenes - theres plenty of bloodshed thanks to Logans notorious adamantium claws - so be prepared. But what shines through the action are the number of emotional moments between the lead characters, making it the most moving film of the franchise so far.
Tough competition
Debutant Laura Kinney/ X-23 (Dafne Keen) at 11, will give tough competition to other actresses her age. With skills and claws just like Logans, the feisty youngster is being hunted down by a group of merciless troublemakers, whore led by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook). Logan and Xavier unwillingly become a part of the plan to save Laura and the trio embark on a dangerous adventure, which forms the crux of the film. Its interesting to see how the relationship between the three characters plays out and how despite initial resistance from Logan, the trio become an unlikely family.
Superhero flicks
What makes the movie different from other superhero flicks is the way director James Mangold has dealt with the subject  without hesitating to show his ageing superheroes go into battle while they fight their own inner demons. Also, the highlight of the film is Jackmans compelling performance. He knows it is his swan song and he exits with a flourish  an unforgettable end to a remarkable odyssey. You dont have to be a comic superhero fan to enjoy this movie  watch it for the outstanding performances by Jackman, Stewart and Keen. This ones a gripping finale to Wolverines indomitable journey.

Hadwin holds off Cantlay to win first US PGA title
MIAMI AFP March12: Canadas Adam Hadwin captured his first US PGA title despite squandering a four-stroke lead, parring Sundays final hole to win the Valspar Championship by one shot over American Patrick Cantlay.
A double bogey by Hadwin after finding water off the tee at the par-4 16th left the last-pair duo deadlocked, but Cantlay found a bunker at 18 and missed a 15-foot par putt, allowing Hadwins tap-in par to give him the victory.
I dont know what to say right now honestly. I fully expected Patrick to make that putt, Hadwin said. I just wanted a chance to win on 18 and thats what I had. I thought it would take a birdie to win it.
Im just lucky that one footer wasnt 1 1/2 feet. Hadwin fired a level par 71 to finish 72 holes on 14-under 270 while Cantlays final-round closing 68 left him on 271 with Americans Jim Herman and Dominic Bozzelli sharing third on 272 and Tony Finau on 273.
The victory at the Copperhead course in Palm Harbor, Florida, booked the 29-year-old from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, a berth at the Masters next month on the week he had scheduled a honeymoon.

HNB banks on condo boom to expand lending portfolio
Sri Lankas condominium boom targeting the middle income sector will continue into the future and the Hatton National Bank will keep on lending to this sector, Hatton National Bank Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles said.
Speaking at the Banks Investor Forum Alles said that condominiums priced between Rs. 30 to 50 million are selling well and this trend will continue. I am sure that in the same way there is even a bigger opportunity in the lower segment where a unit can be priced around Rs. 20 million. If an investor cuts costs and come out with a project of this nature it would be really profitable.
He however said that he sees the mega and overpriced condominiums as a risky business to the future.The banks housing portfolio grew by 15% last year and the target for this year is 20%.
Alles said that the bank is very careful when it comes to lending.
Unfortunately the regulations and the legal system in place for recovery is very weak and it takes a long period of time for recoveries. Due to this, the banks are careful when it comes to strong lending.We also have a very strong recovery branch.
I must also say that today the co-laterals that are brought forward are not as strong as they were before and this has prompted us to have a many tiers when processing an advance.
Though a bigger bank will be able to absorb a shock due to a loan going wronga rural branch will bleed. So we are extra careful,Alles said.
He also said that the lending portfolio would be around 15% to 18% and it was 20% a few years ago.
The deposit growth of 18.3% during the year outperformed the 16.5% growth in
the industry to achieve Rs 623.5 billion. HNB emerged as the most profitable private sector banking group achieving Rs 22.5 billion in Group profit before tax and posted the best financial results in its history.
Our digital drive towards becoming the most future ready bank also contributed immensely towards this great success .
Groups Assets surpassed Rs 900 billion representing yet another historical milestone for HNB while Group PAT was at Rs 15.67 billion, Chief Operating Officer Dilshan Rodrigo said.

Korean Foreign Minister here today
South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se will arrive in Sri Lanka today to discuss economic cooperation and joint policies in dealing with a wayward North Korea, his ministry said yesterday.
According to the Korean Herald, Yun will arrive in Sri Lanka today for a three-day visit marking the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the countries. He will also visit Vietnam after the Sri Lankan tour.
The Korean Foreign Minister will hold talks with Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera and pay a courtesy call on President Maithripala Sirisena.
The visit will focus on deepening South Korea's economic cooperation with Sri Lanka as well as stepping up collaboration over North Korea's provocations, according to the Korean foreign ministry.
Last week, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles, the latest military provocation which followed the country's test of a new type of intermediate ballistic missile last month, according to the Korean Herald.
A month earlier, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half brother Kim Jong-nam was assassinated by North Korean suspects at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, resulting in severe diplomatic tension with Malaysia, the report said.
"Yun's visit is expected to produce a milestone in strengthening collaboration with the Southeast and Southwest Asian region in dealing with North Korea," the ministry said.
En route to Sri Lanka the minister plans to briefly stop in Singapore for talks with the city state's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, focusing on security and global issues, the ministry also noted, according to the report.

Laws foreigners need to know when buying property in Asia
In an increasingly globalised world, people are travelling more than ever. Those who travel often consider buying properties abroad, many in Asia.
However, those wishing to invest in property in other countries should bear in mind local laws and restrictions on acquiring real estate. Are you interested in purchasing a condo in the Philippines. Perhaps a coastal villa in Galle, Sri Lanka Or maybe a large luxury property in Indonesia Lamudi explains the various aspects that need to be taken into consideration if you expect to own a property in a foreign nation.
Its now possible to purchase your Indonesian dream home!
While foreigners were not previously permitted to purchase homes in Indonesia, 2016 brought good news. Those who wish to own their own place in one of the countrys beautiful islands now have the chance to do so. However, a certain level of wealth is required, and freehold ownership by foreign nationals is still prohibited. In early 2016, the Indonesian government released a new regulation enabling foreign nationals to take over the ownership of their homes. The decision about whether this acquisition is permitted is based on minimum home values. In East Java, for example, a home must be worth at least 5 billion Indonesian Rupiah in order to be eligible for acquisition by a foreign national. In DKI Jakarta, the amount is 10 billion Indonesian Rupiah Only foreign nationals who are already residents are permitted to purchase property, and there are a number of other conditions to be met. Indonesia is unlikely to relax laws altogether any time soon, and home financing for foreign nationals is not currently possible. However, as evidenced by last years regulation, steps are being taken in an encouraging direction.
Foreigners cannot purchase land in the Philippines, but they can purchase condo units
The Philippines proves to be a hot territory for foreign property investors in 2017, with rising tourism and a demand for affordable, yet high-standard housing from its locals. Just like in its neighbours, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, foreigners are prohibited from having free ownership of land in the Philippines. Despite this, there are some exceptions to this rule e.g. If your property was acquired before 1935 and you are a foreign national who either purchased it or inherited it, you can legally own your property. In terms of property sold after 1935, foreigners are not prohibited from owning property in the Philippines altogether. Thanks to the Condominium Act foreign nationals are permitted to purchase condominium units in the Philippines. However, in a single condominium project, at least 60% of the project must be owned by nationals of the Philippines by law. This regulation prevents one extremely wealthy foreign buyer from purchasing entire blocks and subsequently driving prices up. Unit owners are free to sell their unit and can make reasonable renovations to their unit, as long as these renovations do not affect any areas outside of the boundaries of their unit. Long-term lease is another viable option for foreign investors, looking to acquire land.
2017 promises to be the year of the condotel, which is sold as the foreign investors dream, due to its hassle-free nature. A condotel is a set of condos, grouped together like a hotel. One of the main benefits of the condotel is that the maintenance of the property is taken care of by property management, a particularly attractive prospect for those based abroad, unable to keep a close check on their property.
Sri Lanka is relaxing its property laws
Three years ago, in an attempt to curb tax evasion, Sri Lankas government imposed strict restrictions which prevented international buyers from purchasing land or property on the island. Unfortunately, instead of pulling the country forward, this move ended up holding it back with its goal of competing in a global economy.
The exciting news is that during the 2017 budget announcement, which took place at the end of 2016, Sri Lankas finance minister announced the relaxation of land ownership laws in the country. The government is set to remove freehold right restrictions starting in 2017. In addition, foreigners entering Sri Lanka (e.g. those with an intention to buy) will be allowed to bring an increased sum of money with them.
They will be entitled to bring a maximum of $45,000 into the country, without needing to provide documentation showing where these funds came from. This allowance is significantly higher than the previous allowance of $15, 000.
As well as these policy amendments, Sri Lanka is to see the introduction of real estate investment trusts (REITS) in the coming years; yet another positive step towards becoming a main player in a booming Asian real estate market.
Myanmar: A new player with prospects for foreign investors
It is now possible for foreigners to own property in Myanmar, following the Parliaments decision at the beginning of 2016 to finally approve a foreign ownership law.
The Condominium Law, passed on January 22, 2016, permits overseas buyers to own up to 40 percent of a condo building, a condo constituting of 6+ storeys, on land measuring 20,000sq ft. However, the law also stipulates that said foreigners are not allowed to manage condos, so those looking to rent out units, beware. Current laws also prevent foreigners from owning land, though clarity is lacking as to what this means for foreign condo owners, who, with the purchase of a condo, also receive partial ownership of the land.
It is wise to seek legal advice from an experienced legal professional, if you are a foreigner investor looking to buy in Myanmar. Following the election of the new Government in March 2016 and reports of a slowing economy, Myanmar is expected to revise its corporate law in 2017, which would allow foreign businesses to hold stakes in existing domestic companies, as well as make foreign investment more attractive on the whole, which would signal good news for foreign property investors looking to buy in Myanmar.
When purchasing property in any country the best piece of advice is to always get help from a real estate professional. Get them to do as much research as you can, and do your own supplementary research too. Do your due diligence and always question deals that seem too good to be true.
Asia is a stunningly beautiful continent, and as the markets open up further and further to international buyers, the demand for property can only rise.

Mahmudullah retained in BD ODI squad
Bangladesh have drafted in uncapped left-arm spinner Sunzamul Islam and recalled allrounder Shuvagata Hom to the 16-man ODI squad for the three match series against Sri Lanka starting on March 25. Mahmudullah remained in the ODI squad after the BCB president Nazmul Hassan insisted he wouldnt be dropped from the format.
There were reports in some Bangla newspapers on Monday that Mahmudullah would be dropped from the ODI and T20 squads. From the squad that played against New Zealand in December, Bangladesh have axed Mehedi Hasan and Tanbir Hayder, both spinning allrounders.
Sunzamuls inclusion comes on the back of his exceptional form in domestic cricket in the last five seasons. In the recently-concluded domestic first-class competition, he took 25 wickets, including his first 9-wicket haul in an innings. He is also a handy batsman down the order.
Shuvagata has also been in decent form in the domestic first-class tournament. He made 265 runs with one century, and took 25 wickets. However, he last played an ODI in 2011.
Wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan has been retained in the squad. He had played the last two ODIs in New Zealand after Mushfiqur Rahim was injured in the first game.
Bangladesh ODI squad: Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Imrul Kayes, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Mahmudullah, Mosaddek Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza, Mustafizur Rahman, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Subashis Roy, Sunzamul Islam, Shuvagata Hom, Nurul Hasan

Monster movie in the picture
Kong: Skull Island, a 2017 American monster film by Warner Bros. Pictures is a reboot of the King Kong franchise and is the second film in Legendarys MonsterVerse. It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Brie Larson, Jing Tian, Toby Kebbell, John Ortiz, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann, Terry Notary and John C. Reilly.
A trip back to the mysterious and dangerous home of the king of the apes, the new film will reportedly follow a team of explorers (led by a character played by Tom Hiddleston), who venture deep inside the treacherous, primordial island to find the leaders brother and a mythical serum, confronting extraordinary creatures along the way. The film returns to the roots of the great monster movies in at least one key respect: it understands the appeal of these movies as a reminder of humanitys relative insignificance in the face of horrors it cant possibly comprehend. The distinction of the Kong myth captures the heart and terror of what films like Godzilla which have become so beloved. Every time Kongs island has been invaded since the dawn of cinema, its been by those seeking glory or profit. And now, in the case of Skull Island, its time for retribution.
Kong: Skull Island will be screened at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex at 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.

Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said the Central Bank website provides information on policy directions including the day to day currency movements.
The Bank welcomed the support of the Chamber by creating awareness among its members regarding the ready availability of such information to facilitate their business strategies, by linking with the website of the Central Bank.

No more wedding woes
If you are planning on having a memorable and wonderful wedding consult and hire the professionals. Otherwise your wedding will suffer.
Let me give you a simple example. The photographer is one of the most important people at the wedding. Hire the professional wedding photographers. Dont give the job to someone who likes to play around with the camera. Even a photojournalist will not do. You need to hire someone who is an expert at wedding photography. Because if he or she gets late to come then you will end up with an empty album. Daily News attended the Hilton Wedding Expo 2017 Press Conference at Hilton last week and learnt firsthand about the Grand Wedding Exhibition.
We believe that every bride and groom who wants to be married at Hilton, wants the best. That is the reason why we are organizing the exhibition- Hilton Expo 2017. This is a two day exhibition, showcasing many of Sri Lankas best and most respected wedding suppliers and wedding planners. This event will be held on March 31 and April 1, from 10am  9pm at our Grand Ballroom. Tickets will be available at the entrance and is reasonably priced at Rs. 200. This is the second time Hilton is organizing this wedding exhibition. Our last exhibition held in 2015 was a great success, said Director  Sales Conference & Events, Arosha Perera.
Positive comments
Perera pointed out that celebrating a wedding in Sri Lanka is not just a one day affair.
It involves many people, over a period of time, leading up to the day of the event. Here we will have all professional wedding suppliers who will make your special day unforgettable. It is not just the venue that makes your event a success. You need to have a professional florist, you must have a photographer, you must have dress makers and you need to get your jeweler, you need to get wedding cakes, invitation cards done and also an event planner. All these suppliers have worked with Hilton very closely. We get plenty of positive comments about them from our guests repeatedly, explained Perera.
The Grand Ballroom of Hilton Colombo is known as Colombos most popular venue and the only pillar-less ball room in the city of Colombo.
Our menus are tailor made according to the couples requirements and according to their wedding theme. You name it, any kind of menu could be designed with our expertise. Our conference and events team, who possess more than 15 years of experience in conducting weddings, spend hours and hours discussing details to make the wedding truly memorable, pointed out Perera.
Special offers
It is an ideal opportunity for the couples hoping to get married in 2017 and 2018, for them to visit and get the best and unique ideas for their wedding.
Opportunities will be given to innovative, new service providers to take part with the aim of maintaining competitiveness in the industry. Almost all stall holders will be offering benefits, including discounts, gift vouchers and early bird offers for wedding couples patronizing the exhibition. Hilton Colombo will also be having a stall and invite couples to make reservations with special discounts and many surprises. These special offers are for couples who make the booking during the exhibition for their wedding in the year 2017 and 2018 and confirm the booking with the deposit on or before the April 30, 2017, added Perera. General Manager Hilton Colombo, Manesh Fernando, shared some exciting news at the Press Conference. This year we have made it a bit more special, where the couple who puts down a deposit and books early will have the chance to fly free and stay at one of our newest properties which is Hilton Hotel Bali. It will be fully paid for, including full board accommodation. That will be for those who decide to put the deposit down and sign up to have their wedding at the Hilton Colombo, shared Fernando.
Quick decisions
Fernando stressed that having a wedding is one of the most important occasions in the family. So we have brought all the specialists together to make that day very special. It will be a nice way for a family to come and look at what is available and make some quick decisions. It will be all under one roof which makes things easy rather than running around Colombo trying to put everything together, explained Fernando.
Manager of Fashion Designing Gimhani Yatigammana of Namal Balachandra Pvt. Ltd said that since the event involves brides and grooms it is very much in the field that Namal Balachandra specializes in.
I am so proud to be here as a Platinum Partner of this event. Our brand creator Dr. Namal Balachandra is always trying to make new fashions for the grooms and the brides as well now. We have started a new branch at Nugegoda. We are doing the bridal wear as well. That is why we wanted to participate in this event as platinum partners. This is our first participation at this event. In this event we are giving very special discounts as well. So I invite all the potential brides and grooms for 2017 and 2018 to come and make use of this opportunity, said Yatigammana.
New trends
Director Poru, Umanga Chandrasiri, called her team - florists with a passion.
We do not only do flower decorations, but we always try and create spaces that are dramatic and beautiful for an elegant wedding. So basically we go a little beyond the normal floral decorations. Our aim is to amuse the guest always and give something way more than what they would expect. What I would like to say today is, normally we dont advertise or sponsor events. We depend on our prestigious clientele who have brought us to this stage. Then again we thought that this wedding expo by Hilton Colombo is a good opportunity for us to showcase some of the new trends in the field to our new clients. From the point of view of a wedding designer and a florist, I would say Hilton Colombo has the perfect ballroom for a classy wedding. Why I say this, is that it has the proper height and the size and there is magical wonder because whatever you do in that ballroom becomes so elegant. So I say this out of experience in this trade for 10 or 12 years now. Whatever we do, it comes out really wonderful. The professional service and its friendly manner, have made Hilton the topmost choice of our wedding clients, said Chandrasiri animatedly.
Senior Sales Manager, Vogue Jewellers Indira Hettiarachchi, declared that Vogue Jewelers is known as the Bridal Jeweler for Sri Lankans.
Bridal fairs
We do have other segments, not only 22 carat gold bridal jewelry but diamonds, white gold, colored stones and platinum. Basically you name it with regard to jewelry we have everything. Vogue Jewellers is the first jeweler in Sri Lanka, to launch a 22 carat branded jewelry item, that was two years ago, we launched Tusker Collection and we are still the only Jeweler who has launched a branded jewelry in Sri Lanka. Vogue Jewellers is the only Jeweller in the world who has obtained the ISO 9001 and 2015 quality certification.
When it comes to the venue, in the past we have participated in bridal fairs at Hilton Hotel. At that time there were only a few venues in Colombo, but Hilton was one of the top. So we at Vogue Jewellers want to be associated with this top class hotel, which has the best brand name in Sri Lanka. That is the reason we decided on the venue. We have also been in association with the magazine  Bride and Groom Magazine for a long time.
Here I must make special mention of Pramith Mallawaratchie of Bride and Groom Magazine Almost all the brides who come to us, they have seen this magazine. That has inspired us to constantly advertise with the magazine. It is a privilege for us to be in this exhibition this time. The timing of this is important because we are just launching a new product exclusively for brides. CEO and Managing Editor of Bride and Groom Magazine, the official magazine for Hilton Wedding Expo 2017, Pramith Mallawaratchie said that the magazine is really happy to be a part of this event.
The event in 2015 went really well, and had great feedback from it. Bride and Groom Magazine as the official magazine, what we are doing is making it easier for couples. We are giving off free entrance tickets from the magazine. So if anyone wants free tickets you can send an email to [emailprotected] or send a text message to 0777791681 with the couples name and the number of tickets you need. It is great to be working with Hilton and all the other partners.

No official body scrutinizing decisions of Public Debt Dept. prior to Feb. 2015
There was no official body to scrutinize the decision making of the Public Debt Department and the Tender Board prior to 2015, the Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds observed yesterday.
The decisions were brought to the limelight following the questioned Treasury bond issuance on February 27, 2015, it was also observed. The observation was made following a statement given by the Director of the Macro Prudential Surveillance Department of the Central Bank, D. Nanayakkara who was a former Superintendent of Public Debt at the Public Debt Department.
The former SPD D. Nanayakkara was explaining to the Commission on the Tender Board meeting he attended while he was appointed as the acting SPD for a week during March 2016.
I saw a big difference when I went for the Tender Board committee meeting that day. There was a great sense of fear in the members. Everyone was thinking their decisions will be scrutinized by COPE or other investigating agencies. On that particular occasion, I realized they spend more time preparing minutes, Nanayakkara said.
They were saying, with added humour, that the explanatory minutes will save them from the scrutiny of the agencies such as COPE, he said.
The Commission then questioned Nanayakkara if the decision-making process and minute keeping were done with more priority to do what will save them rather than the governments interest, to which the testifier replied; That is exactly the understanding that I got at that meeting.
Even I had a fear to serve as the acting SPD for that particular week itself, Nanayakkara explained.
Nanayakkara answered in the affirmative when asked if it did seem that the Tender Board exercised much more care in keeping minutes and decisions, assuming their decisions may be submitted for scrutiny in other forums such as the COPE.
So by that same token, does it mean that there was no supervision on the decisions of the Public Debt Department or the Tender Board committee by any other organization prior to 2015 Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane questioned.
The Auditor General peruses us but other than that, we have never been summoned before any parliamentary body such as the COPE at that time, Nanayakkara replied.
In the backdrop of a fear psychosis, the Tender Board members took extra effort to keep minutes, Nanayakkara added.
The statement was followed by Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri who asked: does that mean prior to 2015, the Tender Board was not very committed to maintain explanatory minutes
Nanayakkara differed stating that it does not imply they were not worried about the borrowing cost of the government or any other priority. Reasoning out the fear psychosis that prevailed in the PDD and Tender Board committee members, Nanayakkara said, the Public Debt Department was in the limelight when the public and the press started to talk about the Treasury Bond issue. Everyone feared they will be scrutinized. The Commission once again pointed out that it mirrors the fact that there was much more scrutiny of the PDD and the Tender Board decision-making after the Treasury Bond issue in 2015.
The Senior State Counsel Dr. Avanti Perera led the evidence.

Norton equals record as England win Canada 7s
LOS ANGELES MONDAY: Dan Norton scored a record-equalling 244th try as England came from behind to defeat South Africa 19-7 to clinch the Canada Sevens crown on Sunday.
Richard de Carpentir of England makes a powerful run against South Africa in the final of the HSBC Canada Sevens Series Rugby Tournament at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, March 12.- AFP
England wing Norton scored late in the second half to cap a superb England victory at Vancouver's BC Place Stadium in the sixth leg of World Rugby's International Sevens Circuit.
Norton's score left him level with Kenya's Collins Injera as the all-time leading tryscorer in world sevens.
It's been a surreal two days, Norton said. It's something I never felt I'd be in a position to do but I owe it to the team-mates who helped me get into try-scoring positions over the years, Norton said of his record.
England's win saw them close the gap on series leaders South Africa, who top the standings with 126 points heading into the seventh leg of the series in Hong Kong next month. England are now second with 103 points. South Africa's disappointment in defeat was compounded by what looked like a potentially serious hamstring injury to key playmaker Roscko Specman, who pulled up suddenly in the second half before leaving the field.
South Africa, who defeated hosts Canada in the quarter-finals before downing the United States 14-10 in the semis, dominated the early exchanges of the final and took the lead after a jinking run by Specman.
Specman's burst scattered the English defence and Siviwe Soyizwapi dotted down from close range.
England had battled past New Zealand in the quarter-finals before dismantling Olympic champions Fiji 40-7 to book their place in the final.
However they were kept at bay by some ferocious South African defence in the first half. But on the stroke of half-time, England's pressure told.
Richard De Carpentier galloped clear down the right flank and trampled over the covering Specman before scrambling to his feet to lunge over for the score.
Skipper Tom Mitchell added the conversion from out wide to make it 7-7 at half-time. England then took the lead in the opening minute of the second half when Dan Bibby cleverly gathered his own grubber for a converted score to make it 14-7. AFP

Pakistan to kick off first census in 19 years
PAKISTAN: Pakistan will this week embark on the enormous task of conducting its first census in almost two decades, after years of bickering between politicians concerned about power bases and federal funding.
Fast-growing Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world, with an estimated 200 million people, but has not held a census since 1998, despite a constitutional requirement for one every decade.
The process starts Wednesday and will deploy a team of more than 300,000 people and involve 55 million forms -- a challenge in a country known for corruption and dysfunction.
It will be the basis for revising political boundaries, parliamentary seat allocations and federal funding, while also giving a clearer picture about religious minority numbers in the Muslim-majority country as well as counting the transsexual population for the first time.
The census is a highly charged issue, coming one year before national parliamentary elections.
Pakistan is not a country with a homogenous population, said Muddassir Rizvi, head of programmes at the Free and Fair Elections Network, we are multiple ethnicities, more than 80 different languages are spoken. The count actually determines the political power of various ethnicities.
The mighty Punjab province, for example, could see its political grip weaken as a result of its population not rising at a similar rate to other provinces.
It is not a well received exercise by political actors. Its only on the orders and insistence of the Supreme Court that this exercise is being undertaken, said Rizvi.
The lack of political will has resulted in hasty preparations.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) has been primed and ready on the starting blocks for ten years, but the government only gave its green light less than three months ago -- a short time to train staff and reassure parties and communities.
There was very limited time to get everybody on board (and) ensure everyone feels the importance of being counted  said Dr Hassan Mohtashami, of the United Nations Population Fund.
Many within the country are unhappy about how the presence of approximately two million Afghan refugees, whose nationality is difficult to determine because of falsified documents, could skew the numbers if they get counted as Pakistanis belonging to the Pashtun ethnic group.
In Balochistan, the countrys largest province by area but the least populated, a nationalist party has rejected the census, calling it tantamount to suicide because an influx of Pashtuns -- both from other parts of Pakistan as well as from Afghanistan -- would make the ethnic Baloch a minority in their own region.
The PBS will deploy some 119,000 people, including 84,000 enumerators: teachers and local officials who will go door-to-door to count homes and then individuals. Pakistans powerful army meanwhile announced it would dispatch up to 200,000 troops for the exercise, including 44,000 participating directly in the census-taking and making a parallel count.
Asif Bajwa, the PBSs chief statistician, said the army would act as observers to ensure enumerators did not inflate local counting. - AFP

The very large gathering present was caught in a tense atmosphere for the major part of the game, especially in the second half. In the last ten minutes Royal had only 14 players one had to exit due to a red card. All in all it was good game of rugby under wet conditions underfoot.
For Royal Sabith Feroze and Hamza Reeza scored the tries. One try was goaled by Shaqir Nawfer and the drop goal by Ovin Askey. For Dharmaraja T.B. Bandara and T.H. Epa scored the tries. One try was goaled by I. Deshapriya and the drop goal came off the boot of B. Udangamuwa. Referee: Irshad Cader

Seminar on Japanese Spirit of Excellence
JASTECA Institute of Management in collaboration with HIDA, the Overseas Human Resources and Industry Development Association of Japan will conduct a two day specialized program titled "Japanese Spirit of Excellence at the 'place of action' (Monodzukuri and Gemba)" - a Japanese concept of Excellence for manufacturing, sales/marketing, services, banking and finance,trading, logistics or business operations.
This two day seminar is scheduled to be held on 23rd and 24th March 2017 (8.30am - 5pm) at the Renuka City Hotel, Colombo 3.
Monodzukuri means having a state of mind with regard to Spirit of Excellence in order to produce excellent products or to offer an excellent service.The word "Gemba" is a Japanese term for "place of action". In business, "Gemba" refers to the place where value is created, eg: in manufacturing the "Gemba" is the factory and in service a place of service delivery.
'Profits are made possible by the power of Gemba', due to the degree of excellence to achieve at the place of action (power of Gemba) is one of the concepts that lie at the basis of Japanese Monodzukuri. The power of Gemba is derived from the human interaction based on Omotenashi (thoughtful consideration)logic and skills which Japanese people share with the spirit of hospitality. This is a notion that emerges from the concept of Japanese Monodzukuri.
In the manufacturing and service industries, productivity and quality of products and services depend on how one utilizes the abilities of personnel on the front-line. Keeping good relationships and increasingthe motivation of front-line employees lead to raisethe productivity and quality levels, and eventually generate larger corporate profits.
This is a concept that emerges from the concept of Japanese Monodzukuri.
It is considered that Japanese-style skills of Omotenashi (thoughtful consideration), emphasizing on adequately identifying hidden problems and desiresof clients and doing'what they are pleased', is very effective not only in the service industry butalso in the manufacturing sector.(Gemba/Monodzukuri).
Key benefitsfrom this seminar- discovering the action plan tofind the reason and structure where activities functions in the most ideal manner; implement action that will improve your quality of work at the place of action; typical Japanese way of identifyingthe skills of the staff members to motivate them accordingly.

Directors, VPs,GMs, Senior Managers, Managers and SupervisoryHeads are expected to participate and benefit from this program.
Athulla R F Edirisinghe Chairman of JASTECA Institute of Management commenting on the programme said "the Principle of Monodzukuri and Gemba concept is become extremely popular among Japanese Enterprises and they have starting reaping real benefits in terms of customer satisfaction ,customer retention and a basis to attract new customers to enterprises.
With the increase in reliance on e-commerce and ordering products and services on line, when a Japanese customer knows that an enterprise is committed to Monodzukuri and Gemba it gives a clear indication to the customer that he or she will be dealing with an organisation where there is a mindset among employees that they need to treat the customer with special care with no mistakes whatsoever providing a perfect product or a service."

SLMC challenges court of appeal order
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) yesterday filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the judgement of the Court of Appeal to register a student of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe, provisionally, as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgement dated January 31, 2017 by the Court of Appeal. The petitioner further sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgement made in the writ application bearing No.CA Writ 187/2016, by the Court of Appeal.
In this petition, the SLMC had cited Dhilmi Kasunda Malshani Suriyarachchi, a MBBS graduate of SAITM, the SAITM, the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, the Secretary to the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, the University Grants Commission and the Minister of Health as respondents.
Delivering its judgment on the writ petition filed by a MBBS graduate of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe, the Court of Appeal on January 31 held that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and further held that the petitioner has legal rights to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance. Court of Appeal Justice Vijith Malalgoda (President) and Justice S. Thurairajah had observed that the petitioner, a MBBS graduate of SAITM, has no obstacle to register at SLMC as a medical practitioner in terms of the section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance. The Court of Appeal observed that on or around August 30, 2011, the former Higher Education Minister recognised SAITM as a degree awarding institute in terms of section 25 (A) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.
The Court of Appeal further observed that the Higher Education Minister has not taken any steps to revoke the concerned decision in terms of the section 27 of the said Act.
The SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degree, the Court observed.
In its judgement, the Court of Appeal observed that the SLMC has no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister and further observed that the SLMC had acted in violation of Section 19 of the Medical Ordinance when making regulations relating to SAITM. The Court further held that the SLMC had acted in violation of the Medical Ordinance without having any power to do so. Accordingly, the writ petition was allowed with cost.
The Court of Appeal had made this order pursuant to writ petition filed by Dhilmi Kasunda Malshani Suriyarachchi, a MBBS graduate of SAITM.

SriLankan may resume day flights to certain destinations: KIA run way renovations to end two weeks ahead
The Colombo International Airport (KIA) renovation work and the relaying of the run way will be completed by end of this month ahead of schedule.
We will be able to open the airport two weeks ahead of time, a Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry official said. The staff and the engineers had put their maximum effort and have gone out of their way to complete this task ahead of schedule.
However the benefits of this will not go to the passengers using the airport since the airlines are not in a position to change their schedules.The airport, although open 24 hours will only have traffic flowing in from 6 p.m. to 8 30 a.m. daily.
However there is a possibility that SriLankan Airlines may resume some of their scheduled flights to Indian destinations during day time.
Meanwhile the travel industry is requesting the Sri Lankan Airlines not to halt the Mattala airport (MRIA) to China operations since many Chinese are now using Mattala as a gateway and even travel agents are seeing packages form them.
We now offer China Colombo and Mattala China to them which is gaining in popularity, since they could see and explore more of Sri Lanka and board from a different airport.
Records from Sri Lanka indicate that one particular flight taking off from Mattala had 102 Chinese passengers and two business class passengers boarding to the flight from the Mattala Airport. Only 52 passengers had boarded from Colombo.
SriLankan Airlines said the airport day time closure cost them over US$ 50 million in losses. SriLankan could not get their flight schedules changed for Chinese destinations.The airline which earlier said they were halting SriLankan Airlines Mattala operations since landing and taking off from there was a huge cost.
But six months later the national carrier had to eat their own words and was forced to land their China bound flights at Mattala and while away time for close to three hours.

Take its hand, not life !
Forced birth-control NGO culture Vs. duty of Good Governance government  Part 1
If the present writer is to begin with the end, what has to be stressed is the following: Nation is a notion of illusion and that which vitalizes nation in to an existential reality and with life is, the child. Without children, with the fathers of infertility and in the presence of the mothers of sterility, the final result, a nation can expect is its own extinction, its total cessation and its nullification in to disappearance. Hence, forced birth control and abortion, the vested interest conspiracy propaganda of Planned Golden Family, with less or no children, the concept of unwanted pregnancy, the campaign, being launched to secure individual rights to become childless, the strategy of sterilization in the guise of reproductive health, the drum beat of economic prosperity potential, through the abortion and birth control are poisoned psychologies, introduced to ruin the nation in the years to come.
The Government of Good Governance was elected by the people, not to be preyed in to this pernicious venom, secreted by certain NGO pythons, but to be consciously aware of them, be persistent, perseverant and crush their atrocious efforts and designs, to destroy the nation, particularly, the Sinhala Buddhists.
The central tasking principle of any Government Governance, if it genuinely wants to be seeded in the maxim of goodness, is not blind belief in all, what is being exported from the West, but, nourishment of what is domestically ethical, historically existential and well approved by the majority community. Sri Lanka, the Heladiva, has such a beautiful maxim, to be more precise, the protection of the right to life, from the moment of its prenatal conception.
All nation-lovers, patriots, religious priests, social and community forces, the justice administration community, the Army and Police and certainly people-elected politicians, should get together and fight against this heinous crime of chopping the raw flesh of the neck of yet unborn fetuses, conceived in the wombs of our innocent mothers, not allowing them to peacefully grow in to beautiful and healthy children.
Power of media
Thus, in view of the above, it is deemed extremely expedient and truly timely that firm and continuous measures must be taken to engender a conscious awareness of this danger of forced birth control and abortion, in order to save the nation from a catastrophe, clandestinely being conspired to ensnare the nation in the trap of extinction. Herein, the media corporations, printing, broadcasting and telecasting, must be insisted in to volunteerism and also the internet and the face book medium should be used to proliferate a sense of urgency, to generate a forced-abortion and birth-control-battling-awareness, so that the innocent community members will be conscious, being conscious vigilant, being vigilant active and empirically engaged, in the extirpation of the exacerbation of the forced abortion and birth control.
International law flaw and abortion
The right to abortion, to birth control, to the artificial contraception access, for the most part, seem to have taken root, through the jurisprudential interpretations of domestic and international law.
Thus, Article 1 of the Universal declaration of Human Rights writes: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulates: Article 6:1- Every human being, has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. Convention on the Rights of the Child  Preamble envisions - Bearing in mind that, as indicated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. Article 1 postulates For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.
Now, from the above article content contexts, it is explicitly evident that the international legal etymology retains a definite and specific ambiguity, with no terminological and contextual unanimity at all. One refers to the born being with no allusion to prenatal fetus.
The other concerns safeguard and care of the child before and after the birth. Yet, it is not only pathetic, but truly cruel that the jurisprudential interpretations and international judicial practice and experience of juridical proceedings, seem to have granted preference and priority to the born being, totally deserting the life-potential fetus, empirically conceived in the womb of mother.
These so-called legal experts argue that the prenatal protection of the fetus would create a conflict of law, with the propensity of threat, to infringe the rights of the woman. This is an international law flaw and a jurisprudential dimension, commanding a much focused analytical and globally central attention.
The law must be refined and redefined in order to protect and defend its rights to be born, indeed, striking a judicial, jurisprudential and juridical balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the conceived fetus.
This is not impossible. Hence, what is deserved by the abortion and forced birth control proponents is not commendation, but condemnation. The Government of the Good Governance of Sri Lanka can be proactive and with the direct assistance of the power of media, it can galvanize in to action, in order to proclaim a new, fresh and fragrant ontologico-jurisprudential invention in the orientation of the protection of the rights of the prenatal fetus, potential with the most precious, the life.
Deception of rights violation
The whole world recognizes that the right to life is a fundamental human right, central to the enjoyment of all other human rights.
(a) Yet, unfortunately, though not all, some international human rights legal norms recognize, that, this basic right begins at birth, and some international and regional human rights bodies, as well as certain courts in some countries, try to convince that any prenatal protections must be consistent with womens human rights and the powerful emerging trend to vitalize and extend a right to life before birth, and in particular from conception, poses a significant threat to womens human rights, in theory and in practice. There is no issue in the need of consistence between the rights of prenatal normative protection of the fetus and womens rights. In fact it is what should be. However, should the womens rights are overestimated, to the total detriment and trespass of the rights, which are the legal refuge, the natural life potentiality can take shelter of, right here, the injustice and the crime begins.
The pivotal depth of the truth, some legal luminaries must be well gripped with is, there wont be any life in the world, in the absence of the conceived fetus.
Even the woman, whose rights, the advocates of the abortion and the adherents of birth control polemics are attempting to defend are born in to this world, thanks to the life potentiality of the prenatal fetus. Therefore, the proclaimed thesis of the infraction of the rights of women, by the prenatal rights protection of the fetus depicts not only jurisprudential irrationality, but also a criminal mentality, embedded in sinfulness.
This is not to say that couple of debatable issues cannot be discovered in the fetus and womens right dispute. Such contradiction can be successfully sorted out by means of striking a balance. The Good Governance Government should have the will and courage to strike the needed balance and unify the rights of both women and the life potential fetus. Then, it must also chase out the nation destroying NGOs from this country and save the nation from the death trap.
(b) These abortion and birth control proponents further lament that such efforts, often rooted in ideological and religious motivations, are part of a deliberate attempt to deny women the full range of reproductive health services that are essential to safeguarding womens fundamental rights to life, health, dignity, equality, and autonomy, among others. The abortion and birth-control-supporting-theoreticians seem to equalize all religions, aligning them with the equilibration and absolutization.
The Buddha is the first religious teacher, who treasured women with absolute equality, respect, feminine dignity and their wellbeing.
Hence, the said theoretical yell of the denial of full-range reproductive health to women, declared to be rooted in ideological and religious motivations does not fit to the land of the Buddha. It may be appropriate to countries, wherein such transgressions of discriminations prevail. But not for Sri Lanka. Now, the Good Governance managers have a duty. That is, not to be victimized in to the irrationality of constitutional secularism, the Office of National Reconciliation is determined to constitutionalize and grant the Buddhism, the total constitutional protection so that the ecclesiastical foundation of the protection of womens rights will be well set forth.
(C) The other argument, being brought forth is, these attempts, to grant a right to life before birthand therefore recognize prenatal legal personhoodseek to bestow rights on a zygote, embryo, or fetus that would be equal or superior to the rights of women. Firstly, it linguistically is not very clear what they mean by legal personhood, whether it is living human-being or the entity of legal personality, legally incorporated as a commercial firm.
Secondly, if the legal personhood denotes the human-being, then rejection of the conceived fetus, which is the authentic foundation of the existential life of the woman, represents a totally unnecessary ontologico-jurisprudential dispute. The basic interpretational and terminological breach, the advocates of abortion and birth-control herein committing is, they psychologize the existential-naturality of the conceived life-potential fetus, as having no full-fledged life.
In short these jurisprudential experts of erudition consider, the absolute life potentiality of the fetus as death. The fundamental error of their misunderstood and misrepresented comprehension lies in that, they endeavour to determine the reality value of life with man-made law. Law is not the creator of life. It is life, which made the law. Life is above and beyond law. It cannot be defined by law only, since, life has a dimension above the law, though some aspects of life has to be governed by law. The essence of this beyond dimension is not yet known to us. Nevertheless, our ignorance of it cannot serve as the proof of its absence. Now, the only intelligent option left to man is, to accept this mysterious reality and protect the conceived fetus, to the best of mans ability, unless and until it poses a threat to womans life. Thus, in view of the above, it is inevitable that the first operation of the Good Governance Government will be the chasing away of NGOs of vested interest, which conspire the nation-destroying abortions and forced birth control in this land of the Buddha.
(d) They expound further, in many cases, these measures aim to outlaw any procedure that terminates a pregnancy. The proponents are also troubled that these attempts have sought to justify restrictions on access to in-vitro fertilization and contraception. They also counter-argue that across the board, these strategies attempt to deny women the ability to make autonomous decisions regarding their fertility with complete disregard for womens basic human rights.
Women are born in to this world, not to abuse their freedom and liberties, to sinfully kill their babies, by committing abortions and birth-control, unless such measures are commanded by the threat of death to mother and medically recommended for the wellbeing and health of the mother. Their God-gifted maternal duty is to conceive children, nourish children and continue reproduction. That is her natural right, the foundation of dignity and the depth of respect. Nevertheless, it is true that devastating and deceptive psychology propaganda is being launched to coax women in to so called freedom, and independence in order to drag them in to so-called decision-making autonomousness.
This propaganda proliferation has a selective modus operandi and is aimed basically at developing Asian countries. If a woman is inborn-barren, no sane-thinking person would oppose her in-vitro fertilization. If she is going to encounter medically unfavourable indisposition or infirmity on account of pregnancy, her compulsion in to child production is fraught with the possibility of prosecution. Therefore, the above arguments, being brought forth to promote abortion and birth-control would corroborate only one psychology-the vested interest, conspiracy and criminality.
The Government of Good Governance cannot be good, if it does not fight against vested interest, conspiracy and criminality, the ulterior motive of which is destruction of this nation, particularly, the Sinhala Buddhists and Hindu Tamils, since, the wonderful Muslim women are clever enough not to be trapped in to the heinous death trap of abortion and birth-control.

Tour de France champion Froome finally backs Brailsford
London: Three-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome finally rallied to the defence of under-fire Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford on Monday.
Brailsford, the man behind Great Britains rise as an Olympic cycling superpower, has been under intense scrutiny but has insisted he will not resign from his Sky post despite being engulfed in rows over both doping and sexism.
British Cycling was already reeling from revelations it mishandled the drugs records of star rider Bradley Wiggins, when Brailsford was labelled untouchable in a leaked review publish Friday of how the national governing body handled sexism allegations against a leading coach.
Froomes relative silence had led to suggestions he was trying to distance himself from Brailsford as the likes of Team Sky colleague Geraint Thomas offered their support. But a statement issued Monday saw Froome, the Tour de France champion in 2013, 2015 and 2016, offer his backing to Brailsford. AFP

Unemployment for 2016 third quarter at 4.5 percent
Estimated unemployment rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 4.5 percent according to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) conducted by Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), DCS Director General Dr. A.J. Satharasinghe said.
LFS was conducted quarterly for 36 consecutive years and it is designed to measure the levels and trends of employment and labour force in Sri Lanka. Labour force statistics for the third quarter of 2016 were released as a new series of statistics after the reweighting process of labour force statistics. LFS was carried out in July, August and September of 2016 based on a sample of 6,440 housing units covering the whole country.
The estimated employed population according to the LFS is around 8 Million for the quarter and of which service sector has the highest employment share of 46.1 percent. Contribution to employed population from the Agriculture sector and Industries sector was marked as 27.1 percent and 26.8 percent respectively. Employed population is considered as those who worked at least one hour during the reference period as paid employees, employers, own account workers or contributing family workers. This survey also revealed that 68 percent of the employed population works more than 40 hours per week.
Estimated economically active population was analysed as 8.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 and of which 63.5 percent are males and 36.5 percent are females.
Economically active population is known as the total working age population (age 15 and above) who are employed or unemployed during the reference period.
According to the LFS, Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for the third quarter is estimated as 53.8 percent, where 75 percent of which is identified as male contribution and 36 percent is female contribution.
LFPR is derived when labour force population is expressed as a percentage of the working age population in the country and this indicates the measure of economically active population who are in working age currently.

Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera launched the most unsuccessful strike ever in history, maybe due to the demand of some person who wanted to make a significant change this week, or politically motivated elements, and got his image tarnished, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. Addressing a press conference at his official residence in Colombo yesterday, Minister Dr. Senaratne said over 95 percent of nurses work in almost all hospitals and other trade unions did not have any intention to sabotage this. There was no impact on the services.
There will be no sign of a strike today because a handful of nurses who took part in it yesterday will abandon it today. According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, there was an impact on services due to the strike at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and National Eye Hospital but the daily services were carried out without any interruption at the Colombo National Hospital, several Teaching Hospitals, maternity hospitals, childrens hospitals etc.
Arrangements have been made to meet the demands of the trade union which launched the strike. The Salaries Commission should send the recommendations to the Cabinet to solve salary anomalies.
They have already received an annual salary increase of Rs. 150,000 after a period of 20 years and already Rs. 5,000 added to their salary.
It was me who proposed to establish a community medical service and now they demand the same, the minister said.

Before the well runs dry
In recent years there has been a growing interest in survival by humans in hostile environments. A number of television series have focused on studying and indeed testing the limits to which a person can prevail in a wild environment. The key to survival is really about securing successfully the basics requirements for life, namely shelter, fire, water and food, in that order of importance.
However it can be argued that water is probably the most important of the four. A person can live for about 10 days without eating, but will die within 3 days if he or she fails to secure a supply of fresh drinking water.
In fact, we need to consider that humans essentially consist of water since it makes up for about 70% of our bodies and about 90% of our brains.
Water therefore holds the key to our life in the planet and if food security, is indeed important, then achieving water security is even more so.
This last point was well understood by ancient and medieval Sinhalese rulers whose entire rule over the island, was based on achieving mastery over water through the construction of irrigation tanks. King Parakramabahu I had even said that no drop of water should flow to the sea without first contributing to the well-being of his subjects.
Mahaweli Development Programme
In more recent times projects like the Mahaweli Development Programme have helped considerably for Sri Lanka to boost her agricultural production from irrigation, and her energy needs through hydroelectric power.
But looking today at the issue internationally would underscore the fact that there is a lot of concern about achieving water security. Many countries around the world fear that they may face a situation where ground water resources would be depleted. There is also a concern that this valuable resource cannot be easily restored, if at all. Hence the prospect of some countries not having a regular source of potable water is a very real one.
The problem does not just affect the countries of the Horn of Africa or the Sahel but also some of the Desert States of the USA.
Furthermore, studies have been conducted on how countries have misused this precious resource. It is in fact estimated that the vast bulk of water consumed, a staggering 70%, goes into agricultural production.
In fact what many people do not realize is that everything they eat and drink needs to be produced by using vast quantities of water. In developed countries where meat consumption is very high, it is estimated that 4,500 litres of water are needed to produce a 250-gramme beef steak.
Currently Sri Lanka is looking at developing high end industries such as pharmaceutical and rubber products which will result in economic expansion as they will boost exports and also reduce imports. But it is also important to take stock of the fact that these industries are precisely the very ones which use vast quantities of water, just as Sri Lankas current main exports sector, namely apparel. It takes 6,800 litres of water to produce one pair of blue jeans. To grow the cotton for a simple T-Shirt no less than 1,500 litres of water are required.
The manufacture of a single automobile is estimated to use 117,000 Litres of water. Each tire needed for this car will utilize 1,900 Litres of water in the process of production.
Rationalize use of water
Given the total dependence on this valuable resource, governments all around the world and other institutions are working at ways to rationalize the use of water.
The challenge they often face is that the global economy is market driven, hence it becomes difficult for authorities to shape production, which means that they often have a limited capability to rationalize the use of water.
Crops are grown because there is a demand for them in local and international markets.
Nevertheless Governments can indeed look at ways of saving water by identifying for production specific crops that use comparatively little water.
Recycling of water is also high on the agenda. A lot of research in this field has been done in Israel, an arid country that has achieved the capacity of recycling 80% of its water.
Israel has made significant breakthroughs in this area including in the use of sand as a bio active filter, which waste water passes through.
A new focus is on the need to use water efficiently. There is a realization that flood irrigation which is used all around the world, results in loss of about 15  20% of the water, due to wind and radiation. Lack of planning has caused a loss of a valuable resource.
Desalination plants have often been shown as the solution to the problem of water shortage. However they are yet another Sword of Damocles hanging over our heads given that they are hardly a cost effective and environmental solution costing hundreds of millions of dollars to build and also burning vast quantities of fossil fuel.
One solution put forward to address some of the issues is the so called toilet to tap technology. This is essentially to take the waste water and treat it so that it becomes pure H2O.
This is what Singapore and many parts of California have already achieved, having successfully recycled black water for the purpose of drinking.
It is interesting to look at new solutions proposed to deal with water conservation. One solution that has been put forward is to have two separate pipes to bring in water into the home and two to send the water out.
Future energy needs
The water in one pipe will be used for the toilets and the other for everything else such as cooking, drinking and washing. The water sent out will consist of black water (toilets) and grey water (the rest). The water sent out will be used for specific purposes.
The grey water can be used for non-portable purposes such as cooling power plants. The vast quantity of the waste water could meet the needs of massive power plants required to address future energy needs.
Black water is already used and the carbon food waste is often made into bio diesel.
There have also been research into the field of nutrient recovery from waste water. The nutrients from black water have already been used in some countries to grow crops. Hence there are new opportunities that can be tapped and the recycling of this waste has generated considerable interest in the area of urban farming, where crops could be grown within cities, in buildings where natural conditions would be simulated.
Hence there should be much more awareness on the part of all stakeholders of the fact that water resources need to be carefully preserved and that solutions to utilize this previous resource in a planned and efficient way will determine our long term success in our quest to develop economically or simply to survive.

## Title: Whistling skill  a sheer, shrill thrill!

Whistling skill  a sheer, shrill thrill!
Birds do it. Whales and dolphins do it. Educated tourists do it. Even kettles do it! I dont know about you, but I certainly am addicted to doing it! Now, dont get me wrong, I am talking about the age-old art of self-entertainment or calling for attention.
Most of us observe the world around us, but in some way take it for granted until several things we have become accustomed to suddenly disappear. Now, along with these venerable old traditions, another feature of daily life is slipping away without a murmur. I speak, of course, of the ancient art of whistling.
My maternal grandfather was a phenomenal whistler. As a child I thought he was the worlds greatest whistling virtuoso. His whistling was powerfully clean and crisp and echoed tunefully throughout the home. He whistled while he worked at his hobbies and even when at the wheel of his Lanchester limousine!
It used to be cool to whistle. And Grand-dad did it with such effortless ease. From those puckered lips surged fluid melodic strains that could have beaten the pants off any accomplished flautists performance. Besides, his music was clear and consistently tuneful and with exceptional control on high notes.
An aunt of ours claimed the old boy came out of the womb whistling Brahms Cradle Song, and as a boy warbled along with his fathers opera albums. When I was around six or thereabouts I asked the old boy how he does it. He said: You just put your lips together and blow.
So I blew and I blew and after months of trying all that emerged was a pathetic pffffff sound. And when I had almost given up huffing and puffing there suddenly emerged a raspy high-pitched shriek reminiscent of an asthmatic cockatoo in full throated song. After a while the tone and clarity improved by tremendous shrieks and trills.
So you see, I have always been an obsessive whistler. As my family points out, its one of the reasons I have so few friends, although, as they grudgingly concede, at least they can always locate me whenever we become separated while shopping. When whistling was in vogue I was one of many thousands of practitioners indiscreetly maintaining this fine old musical tradition. Yet lately I have noticed my habit being commented on with mild amusement by family and friends.
As Moya my eight-year-old grand-daughter, going on 18 in the sarcasm department quipped: No one does that anymore! I shot back: Does what anymore Moya returned fire: Whistle! Thats a 60s thing!
What the heck has happened to whistling It has been suggested, as reinforced by the Gospel According to Moya, that the habit seems to have died out. These days, chaps sauntering in the street are more likely to be on their phones or listening to iPods.
Yes the real culprits are surely the ubiquitous iPods and MP3 players. These infernal contraptions have not only virtually obliterated the art of conversation but also have bitten deeply into the heartlands of traditional whistling. Whistling is a pleasure those who choose to walk through life with tiny earphones stuffed in their lugholes will never know.
It used to be a sort of self-possessed attribute to whistle. Whistling has been used during peace and war, as secret codes by soldiers and spies and by kids in their backyards. And also by urban street gangs who would whistle for backup when there was trouble in the air. As an object of folklore, whistling ranges from a representation of joy to an omen of evil spirits. The superstitious say that you are not supposed to whistle after dark because its a clarion call for snakes. But no one has ever dared not to go whistling past a graveyard. Whistling in the dark or whistling by the graveyard is meant to portray confidence when faced with fear or danger or defeat. Men, doing something technical, which needs concentration, such as rewiring a plug or working on a tiny screw, also whistle. This, again, is a warning signal. It says: This is far more tricky than you realise. Dont say anything to distract me. A man who whistles, and surely its nearly always a man, is telling people he is quite content in his own company. Thats why it is often almost tuneless. If he produced a recognisable melody, some stranger might come along and join in and make it a duet. What an intrusion that would be!
Hey! But recently I discovered one place, at least, where whistling survives. It was in a mens changing room in a swimming complex. As they dressed and undressed the males were all emitting that good old fashioned tuneless sound. It was obviously a sign of nonchalance as they stripped in the presence of strangers. So they whistled while they dried themselves and wiped.
Whistling is also supposed to be an art of manliness. Ages ago in my early teens I was reading Ian Flemings thriller The Man with the Golden Gun'. In it was a section in which the head of the Secret Intelligence Service, codenamed M, was reading a dossier on Scaramanga the titular villain of the piece. The dossier reveals that Scaramanga was suspected of having homosexual tendencies on account of his being unable to whistle.
That said, Fleming has a bit of fun with the bit of folk wisdom there when M tries a quick whistle after reading the particular part. It sent me into hysterics and I fell off the couch while executing a long reassuring wolf whistle. Not knowing of any gay pals in my circle, I impishly attempted to test Flemings theory by requesting all of them to produce a whistling toot.
There were uncharitable guffaws all round when some of them could only emit only a feeble pffffft. It was spiteful. The poor chaps were branded for life as having deviant sexual proclivities on an absolutely preposterous theory.
Try as I might I still remain essentially a fair to middling whistler and can never hope to reach the high standards my Grand-dad had set. But defeat for the old maestro whistler came when trying to whistle for a taxi during rush-hour! I stood beside him in my teens as he tried unsuccessfully to hail a cab by raising his arm. Thats when I showed him that there were whistling whizzes of a different variety. I used the two fingers in mouth technique and emitted an ear-splitting shriek that summoned a cavalcade of cabs to the curb we stood on.

No intention to privatise CPC, CEB, SriLankan Airlines
Ministers and Ministry Secretaries assured that the government has no intention to hand over the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), SriLankan Airlines to the private sector.
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said the government will not privatize the CEB. He said no Cabinet paper was presented for such a proposal.
The minister said there is no need to privatise a profit earning institution. He said the CEB earned a profit of Rs. 15 billion in 2015 and a considerable profit had been earned in 2016.
He said the CEB is not needed to be privatised as Sri Lanka is the only country that has provided 100 percent service in the Asian region.
Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said clients in the banking field receive a commendable service as there is a competition between public banks. He said due to this reason, the government does not need to privatise the public banks.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said the government has a sound economic policy. He said the government dose not need to privatise the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), pubic banks, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), SriLankan Airlines.
Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said it was the UNP government in 1977 that brought competition to the public banks.
Bankrupt political parties stand against the decision even today. He said the government invited the private sector to assist the government to resuscitate the SriLankan Airline destabilised by the previous government.

Backdating CB gazettes a long standing practice
For the past several years, it has been a usual practice of the CBSL to backdate and print their gazette notifications due to practical difficulties, the Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds was told yesterday.
The practice has been recognized by the Debt Operational Manual of the Public Debt Department (PDD), a former Superintendent of the PDD D. Nanayakkara told the Commission. A former SPD who was transferred as the Director of Macro Prudential Surveillance Department in January 2015 Nanayakkara was testifying before the Commission yesterday. The Commission observed that from 2011 it has been the same practice, while Nanayakkara said it perhaps is the same case prior to 2011 as well.
It was explained to the Commission by former SPD Nanayakkara that, after reserving a space for a gazette notification, the CBSL provides the relevant information at the end of the year and requests to print it under the reserved date. It is practically not possible for the CBSL to publish what will happen in the coming months at the beginning of a year, Nanayakkara told the Commission.
These observations were made corresponding to the challenged gazette extraordinary 1895/19 issued on January 1, 2015. Senior State Counselor Dr. Avanti Perera led the evidence.

Bangladesh axe Mahmudullah for 2nd Sri Lanka Test
Dhaka: Bangladesh have dropped batsman Mahmudullah Riyad from their squad for the second Test against Sri Lanka in Colombo, a senior cricket official said on Monday.
Mahmudullah is coming back home before the second Test as he is struggling with form, chief selector of the Bangladesh Cricket Board Minhajul Abedin told AFP.
A fast bowler will also return though we have not decided yet who he should be, he said.
Going into their 100th Test match on Wednesday at the P Saravanamuttu Stadium, Bangladesh are trailing the hosts 0-1 in a two-match series after last weeks crushing 259-run loss at Galle.
Mahmudullah, who has played 33 Test matches since his debut against the West Indies in 2007, scored 8 and 0 in the two innings at Galle.
The 31-year-old has scored only one half-century in last seven Tests.
Opening batsman Imrul Kayes has already joined the squad in Colombo as a replacement.
Imrul missed the last three Tests - respectively against New Zealand, India and Sri Lanka -- because of a hamstring injury. AFP

Beat summer acne like a pro
Summer's knocking the doors, so get set with all your flowy-dresses to show-off your glowing skin. But the only hurdle is it is the most difficult period to maintain a healthy, blemish-free skin as most people experience sudden acne breakouts due to excessive sun exposure.
Many of us rely on sunscreen to save our skin from the harmful UV rays. But do you know these sun-blocks can clog your pores, making them oily, setting a breeding ground for bacteria
Excessive sweating during summers and exposure to the sun can aggravate the problem of acne, especially among people with sensitive skin. Hence, Dr Megha Shah, cosmetologist at Beauty & Curves Clinic, Surat, came up with these solutions to beat summer acne like a pro!
Say 'NO' to Acnegenic Foods: No matter how often you crave for those ice creams, chocolates, cakes, and pizzas if you want to take control over your acne say no to sugars and refined flour. Certain sea-foods and fatty food can also flare up acne. Avoid Food that causes Constipation: A fiber-rich diet including citrus fruits, melons and sprouts work wonders for your gut. A properly functioning excretory system prevents constipation and results in a clean, clear face.
Watch that Cleansing Routine: During Summers, a lot of dirt and oil gets accumulated on the face; do not forget to wash your face at least twice a day. Use a good exfoliant once a week to shed off dead skin and clean your pores gently. You have to be an ardent follower of a cleansing routine to banish acne during summers. A salicylic acid-based facemask is great to sooth your acne-prone skin. Tea tree oil is also great to avoid acne.
Change Your Moisturizer: Moisturizing your skin in summers is as important as moisturizing it in winters. Therefore, choosing the right lotion is a big task! Always go for gel-based lotions that don't make your skin greasy. A non-comedogenic product (that doesn't clog your pores) should be selected to avoid acne.
Look out for specific Ingredients in your products: Retinol, glycolic acid, benzoyl peroxide are some great ingredients to control acne especially in summers. A regular application of night cream with any of these products is a good idea.
Early Treatment is the key: In case you feel that acne has aggravated beyond your control, you should visit a dermatologist immediately. Depending on the severity of the problem the doctor will suggest advanced procedures like peels that replenish your skin from within or laser treatment such as non invasive Venus Viva that can support curing active acne and associated flaws.

Beauty and the Beast release postponed in Malaysia

The release of Disney's Beauty and the Beast has been postponed in Malaysia.
The much-anticipated film sparked controversy last week after it emerged it would feature a "gay moment".
It was due for release in Malaysia on Thursday, but Disney said it was being held for a "review" of its content.
The Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with "a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film".
Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is "ridiculous".
A new release date has yet to be announced. The live-action remake was granted a "P13 parental guidance classification".]
"We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened," LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said.
"However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF's jurisdiction. We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not."
Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance.
Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the"exclusively gay moment"in the film.
It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story.
The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it "stupid and laughable".
"Malaysia bans 'Beauty and the Beast' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes," wrote a Twitter user ina tweet which drew more than 4,500 re-tweets.
Priyanka Laxmi<U+200F>wrote: "Malaysia has so many things to improve on but we choose to look at petty stupid stuff like banning Beauty and the Beast. How disgusting."
Tourism minister Seri Nazri Aziz also said banning the film was "ridiculous".
"You don't ban a film because of a gay character. There are also gays in the world. I don't think it is going to influence anyone. We need to think, we must allow people to decide for themselves," he told the Malay Mail.
In neighbouring Singapore, where sex between men is technically illegal, the Anglican Church hasissued a warningto parents over the film.
Bishop Rennis Ponniah said Disney films were "usually associated with wholesome, mainstream values" but that parents were "strongly advised to provide guidance to their children" about the film.
Last week, a Russian MP petitioned Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky to ban the film over the inclusion of a gay character but the country's culture ministry granted permission to screen the film, with a 16+ age rating.
A Russian law prohibits the spreading of "gay propaganda" among minors.
Emma Watson plays Belle, the young girl who falls in love with a monstrous beast with a dark secret.
Her suitors - the Beast and Gaston - are played by British stars Dan Stevens and Luke Evans.
The film opens in the UK on Friday.

## Title: Bus Lane pilot project tested
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Bus Lane pilot project tested
The usually congested 176 bus that departs from the Koswatte, Nawala junction was less crowded and the journey from there to Borella which usually took close to 30 minutes was made in 10. It was the first day of the pilot project to introduce a Bus only lane from Rajagiriya to the Ayurveda junction.
The buses, all travelling in single file, had no opportunity to compete with the other to pick up extra passengers and the presence of policemen and bus marshals at prominent intervals helped ensure that the buses stuck to their lane. The journey was not smooth for all however and many who drove to work or school complained that the allocation of a whole lane to just buses had left very little space for them to drive on in an already congested route.
Daily News thus spoke to a few who ventured to take the bus as well as their own transport to work on this 1km stretch of road yesterday, to find out their initial reactions to a project which eventually seeks to reduce traffic congestion within Colombo.
If this 1km stretch turns out to be a success, the government hopes to introduce the concept of a bus only lane to all cities in the country.
Public transport vs private
For Amina Rehana, her usual trip to work from Battaramulla on a Monday morning was filled with several choke points on the way,
The traffic was bad as usual but there were certain areas that were more blocked than normal. The point from Parliament road to Welikada Plaza was a main one. They had opened an addition lane of the oncoming traffic side but even that lane got blocked near Cargills, Rajagiriy because they had not clearly demarcated the lanes, she said.
She added that a bus lane would be a good idea if there were four lanes of traffic. The rest of us get stuck more because of one lane being removed this way, explained Rehana.
Roshani Fernando, a university student, usually takes the bus to work chose to hitch ride to work with her father yesterday and soon regretted her decision. Later I realized that I should have taken the bus, because it was moving faster than the private vehicles, she said and added, The government should implement a plan where all the people will be benefited not one sector or party.
Traffic was a lot worse today compared to the other days. I think it was very hard for the people coming to work in their private vehicles. It would have been good for the buses as they had a separate lane to go, said Harini Wijethunga.
There are only two lanes on the Rajagiriya road and now one lane has been taken for the buses. The private vehicles do not have enough space to go and the number of private vehicles are higher than buses, she complained. The Megapolis and Western Province Development Ministry stated that at least 150 to 180 buses travel per hour from Battaramulla to Colombo Fort during rush hour from 7am to 9am and 4.30pm to 7pm carrying around 8,000 to 10,000 passengers.
Choke points
I come from Malabe. I got in to the bus around 7am and reached Fort around 9.30am. It usually takes only two hours to come from there but today the traffic was bad, said Roland Somaweera, an employee at a private company. He was of the opinion that separate lanes for buses should be implemented from the Parliament junction (Polduwa junction) onwards as it was here that the traffic reached a bottle neck.
To have the project from the Rajagiriya junction onwards does not have much impact on reducing the time spent on the road, he added.
For Somaweera to cover the 13 to 14 km stretch from Malabe to Fort is a two hour journey every day. This is equal to the time it would take to get to work if I chose to walk that distance, he stressed.
Rehana and Wijethunga in the meantime also complained that there were many private vehicles who were breaking the rules and using the Bus Only lane to circumvent the traffic in their own lanes.
The usual indiscipline of cars and tuk tuks turning into the bus lanes just cause more traffic congestion, said Rehana.
The police were present only at the beginning and at the end of the road. They were not present in the middle, so the private vehicles were also taking the bus lane to move fast. Signs were also displayed only at the start and at the end, Wijethunga added.
The bigger picture
The Megapolis and Western Province Development Ministry along with the officials at the Road Development Authority (RDA) has braced themselves for criticism over the pilot project and according to Deputy Director of the Traffic Management Unit of the Road Development Authority, Dr. Saman J. Widanapathiranage, the complaints were very much expected.
We expected several people to scold us and complain. We want them to give us their feedback throughout this week so we can improve on it and get to know what needs to be done, said Dr. Widanapathiranage.
He explained that their master plan would be to implement a bus only lane from the Polduwa Junction, Battramulla to Pettah to solve many of the traffic issues faced by people like Somaweera on a day to day basis.
Until now, there has been no special lane for public transport and thus the system faced a severe drawback and it simply resulted in the increase in the number of private vehicles, explained Dr. Widanapathiranage.
Contrary to demand that more lanes would also make it easier for private vehicles to travel along with the buses, Dr. Widanapathiranage made it clear that the government had no intension of making it easy for someone to use their own car.
We cannot broaden these roads any more. There are high-rise buildings on either side making that impossible, so the only solution is to manage the space we have. And to do that we need to improve the public transport system, he said. On the first day of the pilot project, Dr. Widanapathiranage observed that it was only natural that users of private vehicles would not be happy with the pilot project but added that many bus drivers had thanked him for the project. During this week, the officials as well as the Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) are to meet every evening to discuss the issues and ways in which they could improve on the system.
The bus lane is much needed but it will not be a success overnight as there are a few shortcomings we have to fix, said President of the LPBOA, Gemunu Wijeratne.
The first day of the pilot project showed that most of the buses were getting stuck in traffic near the Polduwa junction and thus few buses could make way to the bus only lane at Rajagiriya. Once the bus lane is extended to the Parliament area, it would be better. Right now it takes the bus longer to get to Rajagiriya and as a result we have few buses on the lane, said Wijeratne.
Dr. Widanapithiranage also observed that the usual choke points were at the Polduwa junction and that every morning as vehicles turned towards HSBC Rajagiriya, Nawala and into Kotte, they caused further blocks.
Today because of the current construction of the flyover, there is a traffic congestion. We also saw private vehicles entering the bus lane causing more traffic blocks. This is a social problem we also have to take into account; some people follow the rules and others dont, he said.
Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Chairman, Ramal Siriwardena said, We have to give this more time and see. We can comment on its success after a week.
The RDA is also currently working on the extension of the bus only lane to Battramulla and Fort area too, but Dr. Widanapathiranage expected that to take longer given the complexity of the roads.
Despite such promises however those like Fernando believe that simply the introduction of a separate bus only lane would not encourage people to switch to public transport immediately,
Our public transport system is not at all friendly towards the people; that should be sorted out first, she said.
This pessimism however has not been lost on the government and Dr. Widanapathiranage said they would introduce air conditioned buses and better buses so that people will opt to take the bus more often. We cannot increase the number of lanes, we want people to keep their vehicles at home and take the bus, he added.
The Ministry of Transport has in the meantime received Cabinet approval to purchase 500 buses and they are expected to bring down 100 luxury buses to Sri Lanka soon.
The pilot project has a few more days to run its course and while many are prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt, given our dire traffic circumstances, Nadeeka Silva, an employee at a government institution said, We must also ensure that the drivers are monitored rigorously and that both bus drivers and private vehicle owners should stick to their dedicated lane.

Bus priority lanes project draws mixed reactions
The implementation of the pilot project on priority lanes for passenger buses in the Rajagiriya area yesterday morning was met with mixed reactions.
While the new rule caused traffic jams in some areas, there was less traffic than the usual during rush hour in other areas.
There was heavy traffic from Battaramulla to Rajagiriya while the traffic significantly eased from Rajagiriya to Fort. A majority of the public interviewed on the subject welcomed the new regulation adding that it should be extended up to at least the parliament junction. The one-week pilot project on the priority lane for buses commenced on Sunday morning from Rajagiriya to Ayurveda junction.
When contacted, Road Development Authority (RDA) Traffic Management Unit Deputy Director Saman Vidanapathiranage said the number of police officers would be increased to ensure efficient execution of the pilot project for buses in Rajagiriya.
He said a part of the private vehicles would be encouraged to use the Cotta Road to minimise the difficulties caused to private vehicles by the pilot project.
Priority lanes would be dedicated to buses under the one-week pilot project from Rajagiriya to Ayurveda junction aimed at finding a solution to the traffic congestion in Colombo and to uplift the standard of public transportation.
On the first day of the pilot project, Dr Vidanapathiranage observed that it was natural that users of private vehicles would not be happy, but added that many bus drivers had thanked him for the project.
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry is implementing the project jointly with the RDA, Sri Lanka Transport Board, Sri Lanka Police, Moratuwa University, Western Province Road Passenger Transport Authority and Colombo Municipal Council.
Under the pilot project, priority lanes for buses have been allocated from Rajagiriya to Ayurveda junction and from Ayurveda junction to Rajagiriya. The pilot project will continue until next Sunday (March 19) with the aim of finding a long lasting solution to the traffic congestion in Colombo.

CCC makes submissions on proposed Inland Revenue Bill
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) has made submissions to the Government containing recommendations and observations on the proposed new Inland Revenue Bill.
The Chamber was alerted by its members that the Government is in the process of formulating a new Inland Revenue Bill, to be implemented from April 1,2017. The Taxation Steering Committee of the Chamber compiled a set of comprehensive observations and recommendations on the draft bill.
As with all Chamber submissions, the viewpoint was of the entire private sector, but bearing in mind national needs for enhancing revenue.
Given the wide implications of a new Act governing the Inland Revenue regime, on business operations and investor confidence, we believe that consultations with the private sector is important, prior to finalising a new statute. IMF statement issued on March 7, 2017 winding up its Sri Lanka Mission, also stated that advancing the legislative process for the new Inland Revenue Act, with effective public consultations, is a critical step towards rebalancing the tax system toward a more predictable, efficient and equitable structure.
The Chamber fully supports efforts to modernise the tax system - both in terms of tax policy, tax law, and tax administration. We look forward to an early opportunity to engage with the authorities to discuss our suggestions and concerns and hope that the Finance Ministry and the Inland Revenue Department opens up this space. This submission is available for download on the CCC website www.chamber.lk.
