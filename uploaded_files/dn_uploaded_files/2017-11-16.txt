India want Sri Lanka to make them uncomfortable - Kohli
KOLKATA, Wednesday: India want underdogs Sri Lanka to force them into an uncomfortable zone in their latest Test series starting Thursday, captain Virat Kohli said.
Kohli said his world number one Test side have to use the series to toughen up ahead of their visit to South Africa in January and England later in 2018.
If you can embrace playing in difficult conditions that will be the difference, Kohli told reporters.
We want to be uncomfortable, we want to embrace being uncomfortable and thats the most important thing.
We want to build our games in such a way that we want to look forward to playing anywhere in the world.
India are unbeaten in a home series in any format since being defeated by South Africa in a one-day challenge in 2015.
Sri Lanka are yet to win a Test on Indian soil, but they head for the opener in Kolkata with renewed hopes after winning two Tests against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates last month.
Sri Lanka do not have happy memories from their last encounter against the Indians.
They lost all three Tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 international at home in July-September.
The humiliating show prompted Sri Lankas selection panel, led by batting great Sanath Jayasuriya, to resign.
Kohli said India and Sri Lanka had to put on an exciting show to ward off suggestions that some of the sheen has been stripped from the series because the neighbours have played so many times in recent years.
The two played Tests in Sri Lanka in 2015 then a limited overs series in India in 2016, ahead of the two tours this year.
India will travel to Sri Lanka in 2018 to play the Independence Cup T20 tournament.
Kohli acknowledged the risk of overkill.
It definitely has to be taken into consideration because you dont want fans going away from the game, he said.
We have to maintain a balance of how to engage fans and keep players fresh at the same time and keep cricket exciting and keep it competitive throughout the year. That point will be discussed in future definitely.
Kohli said India have to be at our absolute top intensity all the time.
Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal confirmed meanwhile that veteran Angelo Mathews will bat at the key number four position, but will not bowl as he recovers from injury.
He gives us confidence as a batting unit, said Chandimal. He will bat at number four. He has all the experience, and at the top of the order, and we will get maximum out of it.
Mathews has not scored a Test hundred since August 2015, typifying Sri Lankas slump in the past three years.
The second Test begins on November 24 in Nagpur with the final match in Delhi from December 2. The two sides will also play three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches. - AFP

JUDGE GIHAN KULATUNGA OVERULES OBJECTION
The Colombo High Court yesterday rejected a request made by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who sought an order to transfer the controversial almanac case from High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to another High Court. High Court Judge Judge Gihan Kulatunga overruled preliminary objections raised by defence and fixed the case to be heard on a day-to-day basis beginning November 24.
The Court had been informed that Basil Rajapaksa had filed a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, seeking an order staying any further proceedings into the controversial almanac case before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, currently presiding at Court No.6 of the Colombo High Court.
The High Court Judge observed that there is no legal basis to transfer this case to another High Court. He further observed that so far there is no order by the Court of Appeal regarding this transfer application and moved the High Court to proceed with the trial.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment regarding Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three-year-rigorous imprisonment by Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC.
Defence Counsel appearing on behalf of Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC), which initiated an inquiry against him. He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal was thatt he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
Accordingly, the case filed against two accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.29.4 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department was yesterday re-fixed for trial on November 15 by Colombo High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the former Minister and former director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing five million almanacs with the image of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs.29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material, during January 2015 Presidential election.
The Attorney General alleged that by printing these almanacs between November 23 and December 31, 2014, these accused had attempted to influence citizens of this country to vote for presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa. The AG maintained that the act of the accused deems him guilty of the offence of bribery in accordance with the section 79 of the Presidential Election Act No 15 of 1981.
Furthermore, the two accused had been charged under the Public Property Act No 12 of 1982 to file misappropriation charges. The AG had listed 32 people including former Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya as witnesses in the case.
Senior State Counsel Sudarshana Silva appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Anil Silva with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC appeared for the accused.

Kandy still rusty against Police
Rugby champions Kandy Sports Club were very much settled in the game against Police and played to a set plan the way we know they can. They were a bit rusty and that can be understood because it was only their second outing. In particular the three quarters showed tremendous fight with power in their second game of the inter club league rugby match against a young Police SC side most of them being from Kandy schools. The policemen with a set of young players, all are attached to the Police department sans outsiders came out strong in attack but found Kandy SC stiff in defence.
The policemen who are under the rugby chairmanship of former ruggerite Senior DIG M.R. Latiff and veteran new coach Shamlie Nawaz have planned on a day-to-day basis while providing technical advice and leadership. Those are three key positions that is going to help the cops. There are no individual messiahs who are going to lead the resurrection of police rugby. For all the good work, the president of Police Sports Club Pujitha Jayasundara the IGP a former sportsman is giving his fullest backing and support to ensure a better Police team, the secretary a well-known man in the rugby field ASP  M. Nizam Jamaldeen and the rest are all-out to bring back Police rugby to its glory days. It was also nice to see M. Abdul Majeed the 1968 and 1970 Police captain at the match.
This seasons captain Rasith Silva is playing his part in a big way.
In this game Kandy SC were absolutely dominant in the line outs winning 8 of 13 throws and winning all of their own throws. Kandy SC got on the board early with a try at the 7th minute with an attack with the kick-off charged by Gayan Weeraratne captain leading from the front. The Policemen got several opportunities of scoring but failed due to lack of experience and commitment. The winners scored seven tries against one.
So, the man who did everything possible both with his hands and legs was non-other than Thilina Wijesinghe scoring a hat-trick of tries and with four conversion pocketed 23 points out of the total.

Laggala new town construction work faulty
Although construction work on buildings underway in the Laggala new town, that would accommodate state institutions removed form Laggala to make way for the Moragahakande and Kaluganga reservoirs, are nearing completion, they are threatened of destruction before their opening, said Matale District Parliamentarian and Laggala UNP Chief Organiser Rohini Kaviratne.
She expressed this sentiment when she visited the Laggala new town to inspect buildings which are being built by the Mahaweli Authority, following representations made to her by the public in the area.
Kaviratna said when preparations were made to erect the Moragahakanda reservoir, scientists and experts from nearly five foreign countries who visited the area on an inspection of the site had advised to abandon the project, but the President relaunched construction work. It would be undertaken with the use of new technology to prevent any damage. But she wished to record her opposition to this proposal. Now that the Moragahakande reservoir project was at its final stages of completion, it would become the hill country Tsunami Catastrophe, unless new technology was used to secure it with the use of new technological innovations.
Although she had discussed this position with the President, he had confirmed that State institutions would be shifted there soon. However, many buildings now under construction by contractors and the Mahaweli Authority officials had already shown signs of cracking.

Lanka has underplayed potential of PPPs
Unlike most other countries, Sri Lanka has underplayed the potential of public-private partnerships (PPPs) and is slow in engaging in them, said international PPP expert, David Baxter.
He said that while Sri Lanka has PPP projects totalling US$ 6 billion for nearly 20 years, India engages and executes PPP projects to the value of over US$ 42 billion annually.
He was speaking at a workshop by USAID Short-Term Assistance to Improve Public Financial Management Reform (STAIR) Project in collaboration with the Department of Public Finance of the Ministry of Finance.
The workshop was conducted to discuss the finalization of the draft public-private partnership guidelines after receiving comments from various government institutes. The event was attended by officials from 57 line ministries.
This final draft is the fourth draft of the PPP Guidelines that has been collaboratively developed between USAID and stakeholders from the Sri Lankan government during 2016-17. The document has also been shared with the World Bank and other development partners for input and comments on proposed PPP best practices.
The drafters of the document have referenced existing PPP and procurement related legislation to ensure that this document is harmonized with the laws of Sri Lanka.
He said that PPP projects if executed with transparency can be very successful and their benefits would trickle down to the
masses as well.
The private sector too should be keen in engaging in them, he said.
Baxter said that PPP is like a marriage and if properly engaged it is for a lifetime. Also when the stipulated period is over the project comes back to the government, he emphasized.
Director General of Department of Public Finance, P Algama said that the Revised PPP Guidelines clearly outlined the PPP Project Management Cycle and the procedures and roles of institutions were included for each phase of the PPP Project Management Cycle. The guidelines will serve as the basis for new PPP legislation that will be drafted by the Government of Sri Lanka. (SS)

Prof. Arjuna de Silva extols medical team and support staff:
Lanka start Indian series with zero injuries
Injuries have been part and parcel of the Sri Lanka cricket team in recent years contributing largely to the poor standard of fielding. To say that injuries have been eradicated calls for some sort of appreciation.
Everyone is talking about injuries in cricket now finally after about 10-15 years we have zero injuries going into the Indian tour, Prof. Arjuna de Silva told the Daily News. Todays Test series Sri Lanka is going into against India we have zero injuries. There are 42 players in the squad and all of them are available for selection.
From the time we have been keeping count we have not had an issue like this - zero injury. I dont know what will happen after the Indian tour but they are going into the tour with zero injuries, Prof. de Silva emphasised.
Citing an example Prof. de Silva stated that fast bowler Dhammika Prasad was ready to play and was injury free but he was not selected because he had not played enough matches.
Prasad suffered a shoulder strain on his bowling arm during the tour of England in May last year and has not played any international cricket since.
The whole medical team, the whole support staff all should be congratulated on that. In any international team normally 10-15 percent of their players are injured at a time. Thats an acceptable level but if it goes beyond that only it becomes an issue, said Prof. de Silva who heads the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency and helps cricket with the medical part.
Prof. de Silva attributed the vast improvement on injuries to the physiotherapy and medical teams working in harness.
We have a good physio team and a medical team working together. Head of the medical team is Dr Harindu Wijesinghe, I am there and another two doctors altogether four. Then we have a new team physio, very talented Nirmalan (Thanabalasingham) who has come from Australia. He is a Sri Lankan born and bred in Australia. Then we have for strength and conditioning Nick Lee and then a guy called Andrew. We have a very good support staff, Prof. de Silva said.
We have a WhatsApp group where we keep in touch wherever we go with the physios and the rest of the team, the selectors are also in touch through e-mails so everyone is in touch. We have contacts abroad as well to get advice Dr Chamindu in the UK and Dr Siri Kannangara in Australia.
Prof. de Silva said that to prevent players from getting injured a rotational policy was a must.
We have to go for a rotational policy that every country is going with and for that you have to have a pool. See India has rested (Hardik) Pandya for the Tests even though he is young, pointed out Prof de Silva. The intensity of cricket we are playing now across three formats you have to rest players before they are injured. Injury prevention is one of the key to reducing injuries. It is important to rest players before they get injured. We have been doing that well now. We looked after Rangana Herath pulling him out when he was not feeling well. When a player feels that he is tired we must pull him out early.
The player must also be honest to himself. Now they cant lie because they all have to undergo a fitness test before a tour. Everyone has to pass the fitness test. We have to be very grateful for that to the Sports Minister who is very keen on fitness, Prof. de Silva added.
We have been monitoring the players, in the past they were never monitored. Now it is very scientific the amount of overs they bowl at practice sessions and matches everything is added up. They are not allowed to bowl too much. If the workload is too much they are pulled out even if they think they are okay.
If you look at the Indian team they are the best in the world. They are much fitter than anyone they are very athletic and not only fit you have to be an athlete.
Prof. de Silva said one of the key factors to reduce injuries was to reduce your weight. It has been shown that injuries are less if your fitter. All those things have come into play, now its upto the cricketing skills to get it done. We cant help with that but everything else is now in place. Our team is looking much better than what it was. That is a contributory factor to the reduced injuries.

'Leonardo da Vinci artwork' sells for record $450m

A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci has been sold in New York for a record $450m (341m).
The painting is known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World).
It is the highest auction price for any work of art and brought cheers and applause at the packed Christie's auction room.
Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence.
Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands.
Bidding began at $100m and the final bid for the work was $400m, with fees bringing the full price up to $450.3m. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes.
The painting shows Christ with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere.
In 1958 it was sold at auction in London for a mere 45. By then the painting was generally reckoned to be the work of a follower of Leonardo and not the work of Leonardo himself.
It apparently once belonged to King Charles I of England in the 1600s and was "rediscovered" in 2005.
Before the auction it was owned by Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E Rybolovlev, who is reported to have bought it in a private sale in May 2013 for $127.5m (98m).
The painting has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as "worm-tunnelled" and at some point it seems to have been split in half - and efforts to restore it resulted in abrasions.
BBC arts correspondent Vincent Dowd says that even now attribution to Leonardo is not universally accepted.
One critic has described the surface of the painting to be "inert, varnished, lurid, scrubbed over and repainted so many times that it looks simultaneously new and old".
"Any private collector who gets suckered into buying this picture and places it in their apartment or storage, it serves them right," Jerry Saltz wrote on Vulture.com.
But Christie's has insisted the painting is authentic and billed it as "the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 20th Century".
When Salvator Mundi re-emerged from obscurity in 2005, it created huge public interest as a "lost Leonardo".
1.Interchange by Willem de Kooning- $300m (230m)
The 79 x 69 inch (2 x 1.75m) expressionist piece was painted in 1955. It was sold to hedge-fund founder Kenneth C. Griffin, who spent about $500m in total in 2016 on a Pollock piece too.
2.Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry) by Paul Gauguin- $300m (230m)
His post-impressionist painting of Tahiti women was sold in February 2015 to a mystery buyer, rumoured to be a Qatari museum, and is thought to share the top spot with a piece by William de Kooning.
3.The Card Players by Paul Czanne- $250m (190m)
This sale to Qatar broke records in 2011. The piece was painted at the end of the 19th Century and was part of a five-part series. The others in the series are at some of the world's most prestigious art museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
4.Number 17A by Jackson Pollock- $200m (150m)
This abstract expressionist piece was also sold in 2016 to Kenneth C. Griffin from American businessman David Geffen.

Liberalising shipping agencies to transform  Colombo into a maritime hub - Advocata
The port played a significant role in the development of Singapore, helping the country become a first world economy in a generation. With the right reforms, Sri Lanka's ports could do the same.
Singapore's domestic market is small-but its trade volumes massive; trade value is 3.5 times its GDP. Transshipments make up 85% of Singapore's port's volumes. Sri Lanka has 750 local shipping, freight forwarding and clearing agents but Singapore open market has over 5000.
The availability of frequent and reliable connections via sea and air (thanks to liberalisation) encourages companies across the logistics chain to operate from Singapore. High-frequency connections sometimes allow goods to reach their destination faster via Singapore than they would through direct shipments.
A foreigner-friendly regulatory environment has attracted investors to Singapore. Around 20 of the world's top 25 logistics companies have based their global or regional operations in Singapore. The presence of these big firms drives local companies to emulate international standards
The Colombo port starts with a number of advantages; well situated on the trade routes, it has a deep enough draught to accommodate post-panamex ships.
With a limited internal market Sri Lanka, like Singapore, cannot depend on traffic from its hinterland to develop its port. It must depend on transshipment traffic. Colombo already handles a significant amount of transshipment - 75% of volume; but mostly to India. The expansion of Indian ports poses a threat to this business, but to truly become a hub Colombo needs to look beyond India.
Transshipment is a service that does not add any value to cargo, so to grow this business costs and productivity are critical. Fast turnaround times and competitive rates are needed but Sri Lanka's restrictive ownership rules and fixed fee structures result in high costs.
Unlike other major ports where cargo handling rates are determined by market conditions, Sri Lanka is set by the Central Bank which decides on agency and transshipment tariffs to local agents. The current fees structure is complicated, encourages malpractice, is determined arbitrarily and adversely affects port and logistics industry competitiveness.
Shipping lines working with very thin margins this fixed fee structure represents a significant additional cost. This limits transshipment volumes to the essential-those that flow naturally due to location. Shipping lines have little incentive to route cargo from further afield.
The budget proposes to lift restrictions on foreign ownership of shipping agencies and the creation of a port regulator. This is the first step towards attracting the interest of global shipping lines.
Sri Lanka will not become a logistics hub without significant participation of global players. Almost no major hub has succeeded without substantial investments and presence of global firms active on ground.
The initial target would be to attract Maersk or another leading shippers to establish its South Asia hub in Colombo. That would go well beyond its limited activity with its present JV arrangement with a local agent. Plenty of jobs would be created and this anchor investment would attract other leading shippers to do the same, thereby creating critical mass.
This in turn would attract the top ten freight forwarders. It would persuade DHL to take another look at Sri Lanka as a regional hub or Amazon, for warehousing and e-commerce.
To develop, the logistics sector it should be open to foreign participation and restrictions (eg Sri Lanka Ports Authority monopoly on destuffing local loose cargo), regulations on terminal handling charges. should be removed. Foreigners should be permitted to invest in freight forwarding and the minimum investment thresholds and export revenue requirements imposed to be eligible to invest in declared free ports should be eliminated.
Warehousing space available within the port is limited and outdated. To support the growth of the logistics business, private investment should be permitted within the port; to build and operate new, upgraded warehouses. Alternatively, there should be zoning of a warehousing district outside the port but in close proximity to it (like Singapore).
Other investments include creating logistic networks between producer and consumer areas, markets and transport nodes that connect to the Colombo Port, industrial zones and Inland Container Depots (ICD) that speed port access and support a modern logistics corridor.
The presence of global third party logistics firms in Sri Lanka will enhance the confidence of multinational manufacturers who will be more willing to use Colombo as a destination for value added logistics functions (e.g. packaging, labeling, quality checking, simple assembly).
These firms will bring new technology, new knowledge about logistics and supply chain management and are experienced in managing highly sophisticated and complex supply chains for their clients.
It is the trust the global firms have in their logistics companies that make them outsource key logistics and supply chain functions and their presence firms will be a huge value add to the location advantage of Sri Lanka.
These firms will also help market Sri Lanka as a destination for logistics- which is needed to get business. This is far easier for such firms with their global presence and networks, than for local businesses.
This would form the core of a maritime-cum-logistics hub as these anchor investments create an ecosystem of supporting services -- financial, legal and other professional services. A maritime-cum-logistics hub would be a boon to competitive local companies with relevant service-support skills, and allow some of the bigger competitive companies to go global.
The Colombo International Financial Centre, a financial hub between Dubai and Singapore, is underway within the Port City. Along with the proposed National Logistics Policy for Shipping and Air Transportation and the Telecommunication Connectivity Policy it will establish Sri Lanka as the hub of the Indian Ocean.
Production and service standards would improve massively from their present woeful state, with more transparency and less corruption.
This aligns with the Port City, linking up the port and airport, a hub around the airport as part of bigger Vision 2025 plans and would be the beginning of Sri Lanka's insertion into global value chains beyond garments. The big prizes are in services, not manufacturing, especially with the servicification of Global Value Chain.
The lower cargo handling costs and greater efficiency will create spillover benefits to local exporters who will increase their competitiveness, further driving volumes.
Opening up the agency business does not necessarily mean the end of the local agents; Singapore has over 5000 agents and sub agents working for ship owners and operators in numerous support businesses.
The shipping and logistics business is continuously evolving and new competition is emerging. An ADB working paper opined that Slow implementation of the Colombo outer harbor development plan has already caused significant damage to Colombo as a transshipment hub.
This damage may be repaired but it is unlikely. Further threats to its current role exist, not least the further development of ports in India.
Sri Lanka has been lucky for a long time, because we still retain our advantage in terms of serving the Indian Sub-Continent cargo but it is naive to imagine that this will last. Sri Lanka is operating far below its potential, especially in terms of logistics. Therefore, it is important to remove all constraints which prevent us from reaching our potential.
The budget proposals are a good start but full reform package of port, shipping and warehousing services is needed. This presents much greater opportunities for existing players in the long term and they should seize the challenge. Unless reforms take place we may well find ourselves stagnating while traffic moves to competitors.

Lip luster
Red lips have always been seen as the quintessence of female beauty. There are millions of different shades of lipsticks so it is difficult to pick and choose just a few. When it comes to picking the right shade of lipstick, the most important thing to keep in mind is your skin tone. Following these few simple rules will ensure that you will find yourself reaching for the right tube of lipstick every time.
Locating a suitable lip liner
Lip liner got a bad rap during the 90s. People started wearing these dark shades of liner around bizarre frosty, pale lipsticks. It was truly a horrible look and had no place on anyones mouth.
Those days are behind us. Lip liner can be incredibly flattering when applied properly. Not only does it define your mouth, it makes a MAJOR difference in your lipsticks staying power.
If youre totally new to lip liner, the best thing that you can do is go out and find three or four very versatile shades of lip liner. The colours that you chose will totally depend on your style and lipstick preferences, but there are a few nearly universal shades that are handy for everybody to have around.
When you are first building your lip liner collection, look for a red, a wine and a nude. The red will work with vibrant berry shades as well as orange-based colours. The wine lip liner is critical anytime that you want a bold wine, plum or raspberry look. The nude shade is perfect for all of your lighter pink tones.
Dry and wrinkly matt lipsticks
To fix the dry and wrinkly look that matt lipsticks set off:
l Exfoliate: Even if your lips seem smooth, theres bound to be some dead skin hanging around. Before applying a matte lipstick, exfoliating is a must. Grab your favorite lip scrub and get scrubbing. If you dont, the matte formula will be sure to cling to any cracks and accentuate them, which is definitely a no-go.
l Hydrate: While youre probably thinking that matte and moisture dont go hand-in-hand, the truth is that for best results, they should. After exfoliating, its extremely important to apply a lip-balm to add some hydration back to your lips. Allow the balm to sink it before applying your lipstick. This way there wont be any shine ruining your matte look, and your lips will remain looking smooth all day long, too.
l Prime: Typically, bleeding colour occurs with creamy or glossy formulas, but when it does happen with a matte lipstick, its even more annoying to fix. To play it on the safe side, apply a lip primer directly on your lips before applying colour to make sure it stays put.
l Conceal: To make your matte lipstick really pop, dab a little bit of concealer on your lips to cancel out your natural lip colour. This way, when you do apply your lipstick, it will show up bold and as true-to-colour as can be.
l Line: To keep things nice and neat, apply some lip liner along your lip line. Whether you use a shade that matches your lipstick or one thats natural-hued - either will do. The lip liner will help further create a smooth base for your matte lipstick to lay on top of and keep it in place throughout the day.
When to discard a lipstick
Lipstick and gloss: two years.
Lip liner: two years or more.
Lip stick also dries out with age. They no longer look creamy on the lips. Long-wearing formulas may have an even shorter life span since they often contain ingredients that evapourate more quickly than creamier formulas. Pencil lipliners may last a little longer since putting them through a sharpener removes the old surface.
Another way to find out if your lipstick should be discarded is to sniff it to verify whether it smells like wax or petroleum jelly. If the answer is yes, then you should discontinue usage as it is a clear indicator that the lipstick has crossed its expiration date.
Toss out lipstick after having a cold
It is okay if you do not toss your lipstick if you have just suffered a cold because the chances that you will get infected by cold germs are low. That is because the virus dies quickly and they cannot infect you again because your body builds antibodies against the virus. However, the respiratory virus can survive on a surface for varying amounts of time depending on the environmental conditions and the type of virus. If you have suffered anything more than a cold like a strep throat, flu, mono or a cold sore it will be wise to throw away your lipstick as the bacteria may be able to survive longer and you may thus risk infection again.
Lipstick colours that are in this season
Some people have their signature colour that they swipe on day after day, while others keep a bevy of shades on heavy rotation. From pink pigments to glossy textures, these colours are quite popular these days.
Pointers to keep in mind while selecting and applying lipstick
There are no strict rules that bound you to apply lipstick in the correct manner. It is the technique that matters the most.If you have more yellow undertones in the skin, youre warm and should select lip colours with an orange base such as brick reds, burgundy, deep red, maroon, orange, corals, peach nudes, caramels, warm browns, and bronze. If you have more pinky undertones in your skin, youre cool and should select lip colours with a blue base such as cherry reds, deep plum, wines, pinks, pinky nudes, and pinky browns. Everyone can wear lip colours that have a mix of cool and warm tones such as plums, peach, brownish pinks, poppy red, nudes, and neutral browns.I think every girl should own gorgeous nude, a summer bright (like a hot or fuchsia pink), a beautiful deep or rich berry, and a couple of great reds.

Home remedies to lighten dark underarms
Lemon juice
Before taking a bath rub lemon slices on your armpits and follow with moisturizer to soften the skin and skip the deodorant for a few days.Lemon is a natural bleaching agent and will slowly lighten the area.
You have to take fresh lemon juice squeezed in a container and dip a cotton ball over it. Slowly apply the lemon juice over the skin layer of your arm pit where you can see the dark skin. You can also slice a lemon and rub the juicy portion over the under arm. Since lemon has the natural beaching effect, it will make your skin lighter and attractive.
Milk and saffron
Take a pinch of saffron in two spoonfuls of milk or cream and apply to the underarms before bed. Leave this for the whole night, and wash it off the next morning. This lightens the underarms and also kills all germs and bacteria causing underarm odor.
Saffron is one of the expensive spice that is mixed with milk and fed to a pregnant lady so that she gives birth to a fair little boy or a girl. Now, to get a beauty effect for yourself, you need to dip few strands of saffron in the milk for 6 hours. Once the time is over you can see saffron has changed its color and made the milk yellow in color. This solution must be applied over the under arm and kept for 15 minutes till it becomes dry. Remove it with cold water.
Cucumber and potato
Take either Potato/ Cucumber slices and rub it on the underarms OR you can grate them and apply the juice on the affected area. leave it for 15 minutes and wash. we can see the Underarm skin color lighten very soon. Both potato and cucumber are natural bleaching agents.
Potato and cucumber are separately a good solution for lightening the skin tone. Now, if you can combine both the natural ingredients, getting double effect will be natural. You can take 1/4th of a potato peeled and same quantity of cucumber. Slice then and get them inside the grater so that it becomes pulp. Now add a spoon of besan to make the pulp tight and apply it over the under arm portion. Remove it with lukewarm water after 15 minutes.
Rose water and sandalwood
To treat dark underarms naturally make a paste of sandalwood with rose water. Apply and leave the paste for a few minutes and wash it off . Rose water will cool down the skin and make it soft whereas the sandalwood lightens the colour .we can use this on a daily basis to see a difference.
You can get sandalwood stick in the market which can be rubbed against a stone and get sandal wood in paste form. Instead of using water while rubbing the stone with sandalwood stick use rose water. You will get the watery paste which needs to be applied under arms. Alternatively you can also mix sandalwood powder and rose water. Keep it over your underarms for 10 minutes and remove it with water.

Monsoon rainfall delay in Apura
The district Agrarian Service Development agriculture officials and farmer organizations representatives emphasize that pattern of the monsoon rain is peculiar and rather poor comparably. It is learnt that the water levels of the 13 major tanks in the district are still under 50 percent after two weeks of Monsoon rainfall which is now dwindling.
District Agrarian Services Development Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said that although there were 3,030 minor tanks, only around 25 tanks in Galenbindunuwewa, Parangiyawadiya and Kahatagasdigiliya started small scale spilling. He said since the rainfall is in the nature of intermittent gusts (showers), the disposal of sediment program involving 200 minor tanks would continue aiming to dig 1,200,000 silt from them by end of December.
Apura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka has instructed the Fertilizer Secretariat officials and Agrarian Service Development officials to provide the facility to the farmers actually and genuinely engaged in paddy cultivation and in accordance with the water level of the tanks. He said that the overall paddy cultivation target was to cultivate 130,000 hectares during the current Maha Season.
We are already adhering to the above criteria and have paid fertilizer subsidy to 900 farmers cultivating 900 hectares amounting to Rs. ten million. The subsidy would be released depending on the reports being provided by the 600 agriculture production and research officers and farmer organizations, said Wanninayaka.

More to be done in garment sector: PM
Although textile exports are up, more needs to be done to support the industry, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was speaking at the Third Intex Textile Conference at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre, yesterday.
There is more to be done and there are more opportunities on the value chain that we have not taken, he said. Premier Wickremesinghe said the way forward now was through new free trade agreements with major regional economies such as India, China, and Japan. He said a new free trade agreement with Singapore would hopefully be signed in January.
As we integrate with the global trading system, Premier Wickremesinghe said, Sri Lanka will become a hub.
He said he was glad to see the resumption of talks between the countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement, minus the United States. He said the government would engage countries in the partnership, such as Vietnam, Japan, and Australia, to bring the TPP to the Indian Ocean. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said domestically, the national unity government was changing policies in order to boost production and employment.
The country will not thrive if there is no improvement in the export sector, he said. The previous government focused on infrastructure development, but these projects did not create permanent employment for Sri Lankans. He said to grow the economy, the government would offer 200 percent tax concessions to investors. He also said the government has already allocated Rs. 5,000 million to vocational training for youth. We expect to increase this allocation yearly, he said. He added that he remained committed to establishing a development bank to help exporters reach the international market.
Intex is the largest textile showcase event in the region. This years conference has over 200 vendors from more than 15 countries. This exhibition will help improve businesses, and will help them to enter the international market, the Prime Minister said.

Nathan Lyons burnt toast halts cricket match
BRISBANE: Australian bowler Nathan Lyon is known for troubling the batsmen with his wonderful spin bowling and has often picked up wickets at crucial junctures to give his team an upper hand in a game. However, this time Lyon is not in the news for his bowling but for stopping a play with his burnt toast. There have been other instances in the past where a cricket match had been stopped due to bizarre reasons but this one tops the list.
New South Wales were facing Queensland in the JLT Sheffield Shield match on Wednesday at the Allan Border Field when a fire alarm suddenly went off that forced the umpires to suspend the play for around 30 minutes.
Following the alarm, the Stuart Law Stand, which houses both teams, the scorers and the media was evacuated as two fire tenders arrived at the ground. Usman Khawaja and David Warner, among others, were perplexed at the proceedings.
An embarrassed Lyon, who is in the Australia squad for the 2017-18 Ashes, later confessed to the culinary crime that led to the stoppage of play.
(The toast) popped up first and I wasnt happy so I put it back down and I got carried away watching the cricket. It happens every second week (at home), I reckon. I was getting a bit bored in the changerooms. Steve Smith already said hes going to cover it (the fire truck call-out fee), cricket.com.au quoted Lyon as saying.
Lyon further went on to add that he had intended to add peanut butter on the toast before the incident occurred.
NSW needed just 18 more runs to win the match at the time when the game was delayed. Later, they went on to win the match by six wickets.

Nothing can stop release of  : Padmavati
A decade ago when she forayed into Bollywood, Deepika Padukone never imagined she would be a Sanjay Leela Bhansali heroine. Now, as she prepares for the release of epic drama Padmavati, which clocks her trilogy with the filmmaker, the actress is confident the movie will tide over the controversy, hit the screens and win a bigger battle for the industry.
As a woman, I feel proud to be a part of this film, and to tell this story, which needs to be told. And it needs to be told now, Deepika, who plays the title role in Padmavati - Bhansalis professed tribute to the sacrifice, valour and honour of Rajput queen Rani Padmavati - said.
Doubts on the extent to which the National Award winning filmmaker has fictionalised the story, has led to a spiralling controversy with politicians, organisations and individuals raising a finger at Bhansali for distorting history and demanding that the release of Padmavati be stalled. Deepika is convinced the movie will release, as scheduled, on December 1.
Its appalling, its absolutely appalling. What have we gotten ourselves into And where have we reached as a nation We have regressed, she said, commenting on the hullabaloo the movie is causing pre-release. The only people we are answerable to is the censor board, and I know and I believe that nothing can stop the release of this film, said Deepika, adding that the film industrys support symbolises how this is not about Padmavati... Were fighting a much bigger battle.
Padmavati marks the third film that Deepika has worked in under Bhansalis direction after romantic crime drama Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela and historical drama Bajirao Mastani - all of which, she says, gave her roles so similar, yet so different.
They are very independent individuals and very strong characters, Deepika said, her voice exuding pride that in Padmavati, while there are two men - Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh - she essays the title role, which does not happen often in a womans career.
I celebrate that, she said. Interestingly, November has marked not just Deepikas 10 years in the film industry - her debut film Om Shanti Om was released on November 9 - but also November 15 is when Ram-Leela hit the screens four years ago.

Over 160 wild elephants killed so far this year
Over 160 wild elephants have died by electrocution, being knocked down by passenger trains, being shot and being caught in traps, during past ten months of this year.
The recent surveys conducted by the government have proved that these wild elephants have died in the Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Anuradapura and Trincomalee districts within the wildlife zones of the Mahaweli, Northen, Western and Eastern regions.
S. M. Premaratne of the Kurunegala District Small Farmers Association revealed these facts speaking at a meeting of farmers of the Kurunegala district over the hardships and nuisances caused by wild jumbos towards paddy and chena cultivations of the North Western Province (NWP), held at the Youth Training Centre in Bingiriya, Kurunegala, on Monday.
He said the farmer community should extend their fullest support to the Ministry of Wildlife Conservation to protect the vanishing wild elephant population of Sri Lanka as elephants of our country are our pride and a cultural heritage of our motherland. He added that a sum of Rs. 34 million would be spent this year by the government for erecting electric fences to prevent wild elephants from entering inhabited villages and cultivated lands during night hours.

Import of 20,000MT of oil in 2012:
Country did not incur any loss: Premajayantha
Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha complaining of a politically organized attempt to sling mud at him, took pains to clear his name from the import of substandard oil which led to a controversy in 2012.
The minister, participating in the Second Reading debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, said the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) or the country did not incur any loss from the controversial import of 20,000 MT of oil by the CPC in June 2012.
Due to a chemical reaction in the oil stock, several vehicles and oil pumps had been affected. Compensation was paid to the damaged vehicles, while measures were taken to recover Rs 55 million from the company which supplied the oil. The CPC acting Chairman at that time wrote to the Committee on Public Enterprises and the Auditor General to clarifying the matter. The COPE report also said the step taken to recover the money from the relevant company, prevented any loss to the CPC or the country, the minister explained.
He said a few backbench MPs were involved in a mud-slinging campaign against him because he expressed his views frankly on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee.
I informed the President and Prime Minister about it. I know who was behind the malicious campaign and I will reveal their ugly faces when the right time comes, he added.
Budget proposals to be taken up today at 5pm
The vote on the Second Reading of the Budget proposal for fiscal year 2018 is scheduled to be taken up at 5 pm today (16) in Parliament.
Mass Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera presented the Budget proposals for the financial year 2018 last Thursday (09).
The proposals were debated for six days on a daily basis since then, except on Sunday from 9.30 am to 7.30 pm. The second reading stage of the Budget comes to an end today. The Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposals would commence tomorrow. It is scheduled to be continued till December 09. The final vote on the Budget is scheduled to be held at 5 pm on December 09.
The JVP and the Joint Opposition have already expressed that the vote was against the proposal at the second reading debate vote, while the TNA has said that it had not yet decided its stance. However, members of the parties have been instructed to be present at the time of the vote by their respective political parties.
When the third reading commences tomorrow, the expenditure heads coming under the President, the Prime Minister, Judges of the Supreme Court, Office of the Cabinet of Ministers, Public Service Commission, Judicial Service Commission, National Police Commission, Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Office of the Finance Commission, National Education Commission, Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, Parliament, Office of the Leader of the Opposition, Offices of the Chief Government and Opposition Whips, Leader of the House of Parliament, Elections Commission, Auditor Generals Department, Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, Audit Service Commission, National Procurement Commission, Delimitation Commission, Right to Information Commission and Department of Management Audit are scheduled to be taken up for debate.
Govt. has allocated Rs. 325 Bn for education: Eran
The government through its Budget 2018 has given priority to education, strengthening state universities and education, but had in no way reduced the allocations for welfare, said Finance State Minister Eran Wickremeratne in Parliament yesterday.
The Finance State Minister said so joining the second reading debate when the Appropriation Bill (2018), (fifth allotted day) was taken up for debate in Parliament yesterday.
This is a Budget that would fast track the economy. Although there are proposals to create an open market economy, this proposal has been included taking into account the current world we live in. Many proposals have been included in order to rebuild entrepreneurship. Opening the market is a turning point and some are of the view that this was a risk. We live in a competitive world. It is through exports that we could uplift the lives of our people. However, we have not reduced any of the allocations made for social welfare activities. We have established a safety net for low income groups and have invested in improving social infrastructure. Generally, it is after wealth is amassed that how it should be distributed was discussed. However we have done not just re-distribution but pre-distribution. We have allocated Rs. 183 billion for social infrastructure and Rs. 44 billion for Samurdhi welfare. In fact, we have doubled the Samurdhi benefits. However, there are allegations that certain people who are not eligible to receive Samurdhi benefits are getting it and to address this issue, we are in the process of revising the lists, he said.
Further, Minister Wickremeratne said the government had allocated Rs. 5 billion for season tickets for students. A further 1.9 billion has been allocated for Mahapola scholarships. A greater sum has been allocated for education and also to provide infrastructure facilities, while Rs. 10 million had been allocated for the elderly. Rs. 1.3 billion had also been allocated for kidney patients. Another Rs. 1.2 billion had been allocated for the differently abled services.
In addition to social welfare, it is through education that society could be developed. Just because a person is born poor, he need not die poor. We could overcome poverty through education alone and that was the reason we had made 13 years of education compulsory with the aim of equipping them with vocational or trade capabilities as not all students could enter university. All this time the responsibility of students who were unable to enter university was on the shoulders of the parents, but now the government aims to take that responsibility on.
Budget focused on attracting foreign direct investment on non-debt based type
A significant focus had been given to this budget in attracting foreign direct investment which is of a non-debt based type. This government is correctly moving away from taxes mainly introduced to fund the war which unfortunately was continued by the previous government to fund their protectionist economic vision, said City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem.
Joining the second debate on budget proposals for 2018 in Parliament yesterday, he said the current macro-economic climate is clouded by indications of retarded integration growth decline in export earnings and foreign direct investments. To compound these matters further, inadequate foreign exchange reserves cover too was an issue that the Finance Minister had to tackle, he said.
Apart from these challenges, climate related disasters compounded the structural weaknesses that the country was facing. Debt services requirements between 2019 to 2022 is in the region of almost US$ 15 billion. Therefore, this budget had to be prepared in the background of such challenges and the Finance Minister had to focus on two important areas. One being to stabilise the macroe conomic fundamentals and the other to stimulate growth, he said, commending the Finance Minister for avoiding populist and add hock proposals being included in the budget, which is a matter of encouragement.
He said many innovative taxes have been introduced to protect the environment and improve the health conditions of the people, while earning revenue.
However, Hakeem expressed hope that the Finance Minister would take not of the concerns raised against the proposals to liberalise the shipping sector that would negatively impact on almost 500-600 local shipping agents.
TNA happy with reconciliation proposals
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is happy for most of the proposals in the budget for reconciliation which are proposals made by the TNA, said Jaffna district TNA parliamentarian Mavei Senadirajah yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals for fiscal year 2018.
MP Senadirajah also said that yet the government has had to keep the pledges that it gave to the international community and the people in the North or else they would be worried much and act accordingly.
He also said that there are a large number of military personnel retained in the Northern Province causing inconveniences to the people there. They are occupied in the lands in the Northern Province while they are engaged in the agriculture in those lands as well.
He also said that it was his personnel view that those military personnel could be settled in the areas such as in the valleys of the Mahaveli river, Maduru Oya and Malwathu Oya. They can be given the lands in those areas to the members of the forces, Senadhirajah. Then they can engage in agriculture and developing those areas using their expertise. Thenadditionally the issue of the people in Jaffna would be solved. This is my personal view.
Financial discipline essential for improvement of govt. income: Ravi
Financial discipline is absolutely essential to improve government income to an anticipated 2,325 billion. The countrys economy was on its knees when the unity government took over, said UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake.
He said the biggest issues affecting the country is the countrys debt and decrease in investment. Why has this country that gained independence for over 70 years ago, still not gained speedy development Although many governments came into power, gave many promises and tried to take this country forward, we are still stagnating in one place. Our expenditure is far higher than our income, which has put us in debt. By December 31, 2004 the countrys debt stood at Rs. 1,784 billion, but when we took over on January 08, 2015, it had increased to Rs. 9,800 billion a fivefold increase, he pointed out, adding that despite the bleak situation, the government had taken measures to increase income.
Karunanayake said so, joining the Second Reading of the Budget proposals for the fiscal year 2018.
He said many are concerned about the liberalisation of the shipping sector. Liberalising the shipping sector does not mean we have opened it to foreign shipping companies to simply come in and dominate the industry. I feel the government has presented this proposal in the proper context, but the manner in which it is to be implemented needs to be determined by the government based on how it would benefit the country. We need to specify the investments that these companies need to make in order to be allowed to come in and invest. Otherwise, it would cause the local shipping industry to collapse, Karunanayake said.
He said the country cannot move forward because of the Central Bank. The Central Bank thinks they are in another world. The Central Bank has been established in order to function independently, but they tend to follow a different path. Although the government changed, the Central Bank officials did not change. The monetary policy and the fiscal policy must work hand in glove and that is the only way the country could be taken to a rapid growth, he said.
TNA MP asks why funds for two projects under resettlement allocated to Industry and Commerce Ministry
TNA Wanni District MP Charles Nirmalanathan yesterday in Parliament, questioned the Government as to why funds for two projects coming under resettlement had been allocated to the Industry and Commerce Ministry.
Rising to a point of order when Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne was on his feet, the MP brought to the notice of the House that Section 188 and 189 of expenditure proposals allocate funds to Minister Rishad Bathuideens ministry, but actually those tasks come under the purview of the resettlement ministry.
Proposal 188 is about providing housing and infrastructure for resettlement of Muslim IDPs, while Rs 2,500 million had been allocated for the purpose. Proposal 189 is about rehabilitating the Mannar town with shopping complexes and a bus stand and continuing with the township development programme at Silawathura. Rs 250 million have been allocated for that purpose. In the previous year, these allocations were made to Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry held by D M Swaminathan. This year, allocations on those projects have been made to the Industry and Commerce Ministry. What is the link between that Ministry to resettlement work the MP questioned.
When I queried this from the Government, a front row senior minister told me that Minister Bathiudeen had made a deal with the Finance Minister in that regard. Minister Rauf Hakeem will prove what I say, because he was also present at that time, the MP added.
Buttressing this argument JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa also questioned the rationale of that allocation. If Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne asks for the Beruwala Port Development project, would you allocate money for that project to the Health Ministry he argued.
State Minister Wickremaratne however, replied that the matter could be discussed. He also asked the TNA MP to reveal the name of the minister who spoke of a deal between Minister Samaraweera and Minister Bathiudeen. The relevant minister will respond to this claim. As I understand, the subject of rehabilitation is a broad area and its work could come under several ministries. It seems that there is a personal issue here. That could be taken up separately, Wickremaratne replied.
There is nothing for the people in this budget: Weerawansa
The people have had to pay an additional tax of Rs. 984 billion this year, in comparison to 2014, said Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa yesterday.
He made this observation joining the second debate on Budget proposal for 2018.
He said the people have had to pay even for obtaining a Police report and a Grama Seva Niladari certicicate. There is no relief to the public, other than those included to market the budget, MP Weerawansa said. There is no relief even to local industrialists. There are more proposals to create investment opportunities for foreigners.
MP Weerawansa pointed out that there was no proposals to increase the salaries of public servants. He said that the number of loans that has been planned to be taken next year was Rs 1,800 billion. However, the loan rate had been increased by 64 percent today, compared to the loans that the country had when this government took over power. This loan has been taken even in a situation where there is no civil war, MP Weerawansa said. The previous government had taken 5.2 trillion during the past nine years.
He said that there was nothing in this budget for the public.

People stood by me:  Piyasena Gamage
The people of Hiniduma, who stood by me from the time of the 1989 Insurrection, have never isolated me up to date. It was not the people of Hiniduma who defeated me at the last General Elections, but certain other candidates who warned people not to vote for me saying that I will join hands with Maithree. However, the people who accused me have themselves joined the government and obtained Ministry Posts, said Galle District MP Piyasena Gamage.
Gamage, who was sworn in as a Parliamentarian to fill the vacancy created by the disqualification of Geetha Kumarasinghe, on charges of being a dual citizenship holder, said he had always safeguarded the honour and respect of SLFPers who voted for him.
Gamage was addressing a meeting at Neluwa held to felicitate him, recently.
Gamage said he was first appointed SLFP organiser for Hiniduma by the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Now he is a senior Vice President of the SLFP and a party senior who first entered Parliament in 1989.
Now all the people should shed petty differences and work in unison to take the country forward, he said, adding that the Hiniduma electorate with four Pradeshiya Sabha areas covering the largest land mass in the Galle district, did not have any representation in Parliament for the last two and a half years. But he represented the area during the previous 29 years and rendered a great service towards its development.

The 32-year-old star said it is easy for people to relate with the superhero as she is compassionate and her approach towards life is similar to the Princess of Wales.
I remember a quote from Princess Diana where she hit the nail on the head. She said she worked from the heart and not the head and I think that Wonder Woman, Diana Prince, is the same. I know one Diana was real and the other isnt, but Wonder Woman is such a great character because she works from the heart, Gadot said.
The Justice League star believes Wonder Woman is a great female role model. We are so exposed all our lives to amazing male superheroes and never to one really good female superhero and I think Wonder Woman really captures the beauty of what it means to be a woman.PTI

Rugby aplenty for the weekend
November rains have failed to dampen or restrain our local fans from soaking in the rugby each weekend...its pretty intense and unforgiving ...both at the same time.
Looking...especially at the top end clashes in the Dialog driven league schedule... we add new meaning to confrontation...
Rugby is without a shadow ...quite the brand driving the kids to distraction ...its warrior image reinforced on the biggest stages around the world.
The teams lining up this long rugby weekend, adding new meaning to mesmerizing and fabulous...World champions New Zealand, Australia, England, South Africa, Wales, Scotland, Argentina, Ireland, islanders Samoa, Fiji, France ...all lining up to unleash their warriors.
My little script is based purely on that deep oasis of rugby passion and is written not in English ...but in glorious rugby speak...should the known and accepted experts, pundits of all shapes and sizes ...choose to scrutinize and sharpen their literary blades.
The game needs all of us ...and when England line up for their anthem, sharp and adrenaline charged in their high tech Canterbury strip ...Australia will be breathing hard to change that English winning streak ..Eddie Jones confident that the boiler house boys can break the gallant Wallaby 8 ...upfront, and beat them at the breakdown. What a tantalizing Saturday it promises to be...
On that same note step boldly to the Racecourse in the heart of our city by the sea ...and sit back, if thats possible...to absorb traditional rivals CR, hoping to repeat last weeks remarkable comeback against Navy ...versus an unlikely CH...who just lacked a decent finish against a driven Army XV. Army 20, CH 15.
The adrenaline and commitment quite the same as the Blacks focus on Scotland and no shortage of passion or love lost, between the clashes ...despite the oceans in between.
The code demands maximum for the 80mins in the middle...and that has special meaning for the entire squad ...irrespective of playing as an impact designate for 20minutes...or the full 80mins from kick off to long whistle.
International Rugby is the flagship for the codes greatest showcase as we hint at world cup preparation ...both hemispheres clashing with gusto ...especially those impact tackles head on ...or a traditional ... Maori sidestep...that leaves many spitting grass and wiping off a thin veil of insult ...more so if the result is a try under the sticks!
All islanders will be hoping for good fire and a chance to see their icons proudly strut the club badge for adoring fans. Friday: CH v CR 3.45pm Racecourse,
Saturday: Havelocks v Navy 3.45pm Welisera
Sunday: Air Force v Police 4pm Ratmalana and Kandy v. Army 4pm.Nittawela.
All matches will hopefully have plenty of official support and video replays for the match official, to assist the referee in the middle...apart from the two touch refs who have a vital role in delivering a fair clash for the fans and believers.
On that note ...horrified to learn that red cards already served and players from CR, CH serving 4 match suspension orders ...a telling fact and hopefully not a sign for the league ahead.
We understand the pressure is intimidating to say the least ...but we need management and mentors to insist on a clean slate and a good hard relentless game, to knock us off our seats ...warriors on warriors and fair play all the way.
Each weekend is critical in every sense of the months of pre season, the miles of running, huge burdensome hours thumping and bench pressing, weeks of physio etc ...plus of course the inevitable investments that run in close to 25million or close, to underwrite a club premier season and maintain a comprehensive competitive squad right through the season.
All told its a massive stride out for the boys down to play the fixture and nervous shudders through the crisp kit worn by committee and management, sat in the VIP section....its a grand sight indeed.
The traditions that matter, bind all of us, generations of club loyalists and family who have supported the colours through thick and thin ...encouraging and hoping for results despite the odds stacked up against.
Attitude is everything, especially when we play the current champions Kandy, in form Havelocks or settling fast CR ...who stunned Navy with tries and conversions in the 2nd half ...giving Ratwatte as skipper, a memorable day for his special kicking boots ...and the grandest of claw backs to win 38/23 after being behind 23/7 points at half time ..!
What a storm and plenty of skill plus patience to get their sights to finish as a team...quadruple pleasing for the red shirts backroom and much relief for their Fijian coach.....who is no doubt adjusting to the spikes in that performance graph
Havies v Navy might be the shocker this week....the rumble in Welisera, dominated by the sailors home team advantage...interesting to see how coach Martis will set his game plan on Saturday...will he want to close the Navy upfront...or will he choose to absorb all their firepower and outmuscle the fitter service team ...experts to the front please...VIP pass or not...
Thats the rush this weekend islanders and rugby hearts ...both International and local rugby ...just as the doctors ordered. Fri to Sun ...back to back and plenty of stamina ...hydrate well, energy up and ready to absorb our magical rugby November...its just too good to be true ...4 top end local Dialog league matches and 6 full internationals to write off Fri to Sun in one sharp angle kick to touch from the in goal...behind the right uprights...
Cheers islanders...!

Scholarship award programme held
The Sisu Nena Pradeepa scholarship award programme was recently held to felicitate bus conductors drivers and to also award schoolbags, stationery and scholarships to their children.
It was organised by the Southern Provincial Road Transport Authority, in collaboration with the Chief Minister's Office.
Addressing a gathering, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said that bus drivers and conductors do not want their children to do the same job when they grow up, but to give them a better education in the best possible schools so that they could engage in good jobs that would give them a better salary. The Chief Minister further said that it was the duty of the children to concentrate on their education and excel in all the exams they have to face in future.
There are unruly elements in society who are all out to mislead children in the wrong path. Parents should be vigilant to protect their children from such elements.
Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said it was not big people that we require, but good people for the progress of the country and as such, children who receive awards today must concentrate on becoming good people.
"Today, we felicitate the employees who come under the purview of the Southern Province Road Transport Authority as a mark of respect for their services and also to encourage them," he said.
The Chief Minister said that it was the sixth programme and that it was the only such programme launched in Sri Lanka.
He said the wives of drivers and conductors must make up their minds to treat their husbands in the best possible manner when they come back home, because they come back home after engaging in their jobs under trying circumstances.
Southern Provincial Council (SPC) Member S. V. P. Ananda, Southern Provincial Road Transport Authority Chairman Kapila Tyrone de Silva and Director General B. M. A. Raja Kumara were present for the occasion.

Fathima Rizna, 10, a Grade 4 student of Balangoda Kirimetitenna Vidyalaya, had committed suicide by hanging herself from a beam of her house at Randolawatta Divisions Balangoda on November 13.
At the inquest held into the death by Balangoda city coroner A. G. Wimaladasa, the girls mother, Mallida Jeyamary, 33, said she had two daughters out of whom Fathima Rizna was the eldest. On the day of the incident, she had not attended school. When she had asked her daughter the reason for cutting school, she had not said anything.
Three months ago, she found a mobile phone inside her daughters schoolbag, which she returned to the class teacher by accompanying her daughter to school. Her daughter told the teacher that she did not rob it, but some prankster had put it into her schoolbag without her knowledge.
But the class teacher did not accept her daughters explanation. On subsequent days, when her daughter attended school, the teacher had asked why she robbed the phone and other girls had started teasing her by labelling her a phone robber.
Jeyamary said she earned a living by working as a tea picker. Her husband abandoned her three years ago. On November 13, she had visited a neighbours house to inquire whether there was plucking work available and when she returned home, she found that her daughter had committed suicide.
Balangoda Hospital medical superintendent Dr. B. N. C. Dassanayake who conducted the postmortem examination, reported that death was due to strangulation of the neck caused by hanging from a rope. The corner recorded a verdict of suicide committed due to mental agony.

Singapore inflation touches 6-month high
The Wholesale Price Index had, in comparison, registered a growth of 2.6% in September. wInflation at the wholesale level accelerated to 3.59% in October, a six-month high, on the back of quickening food price inflation and firming oil prices, according to official data released by the Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday.
The Wholesale Price Index had, in comparison, registered a growth of 2.6% in September.
Within the Index, the primary articles segment saw inflation quickening to 3.33% in October from 0.15% in September.
This was mostly driven by food and fuel prices. The food articles segment saw inflation at 4.3% in October, climbing from 2.04% in the previous month. The fuel segment saw a much slower contraction in prices in October, of 2.1%, compared with a contraction of 11.55% in September.
The food index - which is a composite of the food segment within primary articles, and the manufactured food category - saw inflation accelerating to 3.23% in October from 2.99% in September.
Vegetables - stress point
Both wholesale and retail prices edged up in the month of October, Pankaj Patel, president, FICCI, said in a written statement. The increase was led by firming up of food prices with the vegetables segment remaining a key stress point at this juncture. The Hindu News
However, this is due to adverse weather conditions and the situation should ease out in the coming months.
The minerals segment also saw inflation quickening sharply to 14.8% compared with a contraction of 7.08% in September.

Sri Lankas beer industry will regain market share from hard liquor following a more favourable tax regime for the segment announced in the Sri Lankan governments budget on 9 November, Fitch Ratings says.
However we expect the ratings on Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC (DIST, AAA(lka)/Rating Watch Negative), the largest hard liquor manufacturer, and Lion Brewery (Ceylon) PLC (Lion, A+(lka)/Negative Outlook), the leading beer maker, to remain steady.
The Sri Lankan governments 2018 budget reduced excise taxes on strong beer by 33% and raised that on hard liquor by 2%, effective immediately. The budget also introduced a Nation Building tax of 2% on all alcoholic beverage sales, which will take effect from April 2018.
With the latest tax revisions and barring further changes, we expect beers market share of total reported alcohol consumption in Sri Lanka, as calculated by Fitch, to increase to around 24%-25% in the medium term, posting an average volume growth of 22% over 2017-2019. We expect hard liquor sales volumes to contract 2% over this period, reversing some of the market share gains it made in the last few years. Hard liquors share rose to 84% in 2016 from 71% in 2014, after a series of tax increases for beer. The market share for beer fell to 14% from 27% over the same period.
Lion accounts for over 80% of Sri Lankas beer sales, and the lower excise tax has led to a 23% drop in the price of its main strong beer product. This will make it competitively priced per unit of alcohol against hard liquor. Beer makers will also be helped by the removal of a tax on beer cans in the government budget. Fitch expects beer to regain market share lost to hard liquor during the last two years, when frequent tax increases on beer eroded its price advantage.
However, we believe beer sales volumes are unlikely to recover fast enough in the next 12 to 18 months for Lions net leverage (as measured by net debt/operating EBITDAR) to reduce to less than 3.0x (6.3x at end-March 2017), given the already high debt levels.
At the same time, we expect sales volumes of hard liquor market leader DIST to drop, as consumers substitute strong beer for arrack, the most popular hard liquor in the country. Effective immediately, spirit producers will also have to pay additional duty on raw materials used for ethanol production, which will increase input costs for hard liquor makers. However, we expect these taxes to have minimal impact on DIST's profit margins because the company has increased the price of its key product, Extra Special Arrack, by around 6% per bottle to reflect both the higher input costs and taxes.
Taxes on alcohol makers are hefty with top-line taxes accounting for around 70% and 60% of gross company revenues for DIST and Lion, respectively, in the financial year ended 31 March 2017. We believe the government is unlikely to impose further taxes on the industry to the extent that alcoholic beverages become prohibitively expensive to the average consumer, because the alcohol excise taxes contributed 8% to government tax revenue in 2016. As such, we expect further tax increases to be gradual, especially for hard liquor.
The budget also proposes to simplify the issuance and rate structure of liquor retail licenses, which we believe will help sales, although further details are yet to be disclosed. Both Lion and DIST command leadership in their respective segments, given their entrenched brands which continue to benefit from a complete ban on advertising of alcoholic beverages.

SLFP OPPOSES SHIPPING SECTOR OPENING UP
The SLFP is against the budget proposal to fully open up the shipping sector to foreign companies, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Speaking at the Second Reading debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, Samarasinghe said all Cabinet, Deputy and State Ministers representing the SLFP unanimously decided to oppose the budget proposal on lifting restrictions on foreign ownership of shipping and freight forwarding agencies.
Since 1992, foreign ownership of shipping and freight forwarding agencies has been restricted to 40 percent by way of a Gazette notification. The balance of 60 percent is reserved for local companies.
There are over 500 shipping and freight forwarding agents in Sri Lanka earning about USD 800 million in trade. This money is for the Sri Lankan economy. These local companies have provided about 12,000 direct jobs and 100,000 indirect jobs. Therefore we request not to allow 100 percent foreign ownership at once, he explained.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera with this proposal intends to encourage foreign investment to make Sri Lanka the maritime hub. If the Government is going ahead with this proposal, we in the SLFP propose to impose a pre-qualification that full foreign ownership would be allowed only if the foreign companies agree to bring in an investment over USD 100 million, he proposed.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena met with the representatives of local shipping and freight forwarding agencies on Tuesday and agreed to take up the matter with Minister Samaraweera. Minister Samaraweera has also agreed to meet those representatives on Friday.

SLIBC strengthens trade ties in Jakarta
Members of the Sri Lanka  Indonesia Business Council (SLIBC) recently attended the 32nd Trade Expo Indonesia that was held in Jakarta, as part of an ongoing effort to strengthen the longstanding trade relationship and strategic partnerships that Indonesia and Sri Lanka have shared.
The annual event was instrumental in paving the way for SLIBC to find new ways in which businesses from both countries could expand their opportunities and work together more closely in the coming years.
Participating in the trade show was a 15-member delegation comprising representatives from various sectors and product lines, including paper manufacturing, waste paper production, umbrella manufacturing, F&B, IT, shipping and logistics and tea. In addition to visiting the trade exhibition, the delegates also took part in a business forum and a B2B business matching session, which was organized by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Indonesia and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce. The event featured in-depth discussions between all parties who went on to explore ways in which business cooperation between the two countries can be uplifted and enhanced.
Commenting on SLIBCs participation in the 32nd Trade Expo Indonesia, Kalinga Wijesekara  President, SLIBC and the Head of Marketing & Communications, Serendib Flour Mills, stated: We were pleased to attend the 32nd edition of Trade Expo Indonesia in Jakarta, which served as a significant opportunity for us to strengthen our trade ties and alliances with Indonesia. We are also grateful to the Indonesian Embassy in Colombo, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Indonesia and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce for hosting a dynamic series of sessions and events, which enabled us to take a closer look at how we can develop new Indo-Lankan trade ties whilst maintaining and improving the existing ones. Established in 1991, the Sri Lanka  Indonesia Business Council was formed under the aegis of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. The council was formed at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the main objective of promoting trade, investment, services and tourism between Sri Lanka and Indonesia.

Sri Lanka taken important steps towards reconciliation- Dr. Harsha
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva addressing the Third Cycle of the Universal Periodic Review of Sri Lanka which was held in Geneva yesterday said that for the first time in Sri Lanka's history, a section of the National Budget for 2018 is expressly dedicated to reconciliation.
Further speaking Dr. De Silva said that Sri Lanka consider investments in reconciliation and peace as sound economic policy as they strengthen security and stability and foster a fertile environment to attract investment.
Likewise, sound economic policy that fosters income growth and employment helps us to build the conditions necessary for long-term peace, security, stability and reconciliation, the Deputy Minister said.
Dr.De Silva pointed out that Sri Lanka has taken a series of important steps towards reconciliation including the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) which became operational on September 15, 2017.
Deputy Minister De Silva pointed out that the government recognising the Right of access to Information as a fundamental right through the 19th amendment to the Constitution, it enacted the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
De Silva also pointed out that Sri Lanka has made significant progress between the brief period of roughly 2 years and 10 months since the election of the present National Unity Government in 2015.
Dr. De Silva also said the SL government is setting new benchmarks to manifest the commitment to open and transparent processes, and respect for engagement with our citizens, and bottom-up approaches to policy-making, we embarked on an extensive and inclusive consultation process involving ministries and departments; civil society representatives; and experts in different fields.
Sri Lanka has accomplished much. Yet, we do not consider it a reason to be complacent. Neither are we, as some tend to allege, indifferent or uncaring about human rights. We remain acutely aware and conscious that there is much more to be done, to ensure that all our citizens enjoy the rights due to them to their full extent. We firmly believe that citizens empowered by their individual rights will strengthen our nation. Dr. De Silva also said.

Center of Hope initiatives include KidzKlubz, Community Centers, and Rays of Hope.
Recognizing the moral deprivation that persists in the poorest communities in and around Colombo, KidzKlubz work to instill good values in children aged between 4 and 14 years of such communities through a specially developed curriculum that is administered on a weekly basis by a network of volunteers.
In order to supplement the holistic development of disadvantaged children between the ages of 3 and 16 years, and in an effort to keep them in school, Community Centers have been set up in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka, to run various programmes including daily feeding programmes, after school classes, talent development classes, and medical drives. In the context of the prevalence of child sexual abuse in Sri Lanka, Rays of Hope works with schools and at Community Centers, to deal with situations of child sexual abuse, and to create awareness on the issues surrounding it, with a view of preventing it.
Tickets to Christmas with the star are priced at Rs. 3,000, 2,000, 1,000 and 500 and will be available for purchase during office hours every weekday at the Peoples Church Office/Resource Centre, No. 160/30 Kirimandala Mawatha, Colombo 05, November 19 onwards.

The status quo will remain
So, the Joint Opposition has decided to go it alone, for the upcoming Local Government Elections. The final decision, in this regard, had been taken at a meeting of JO parliamentarians, at the Parliament Complex, presided over by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, on Tuesday, it has been reported, in the vernacular press. A majority of the JO MPs, according to the news item, were opposed to contesting alongside the UPFA, since they could not agree to the conditions laid down by the Sirisena faction, to coalesce, to fight the UNP. There had also been a section, who favoured the joining of forces, but the majority, it is reported, had opposed such a course, chiefly due to the harassment of it's members, by the government.
The JO, which will be contesting the poll, in alliance with several parties, under the pohottuwa symbol, has also commenced joint discussions to select the candidates. A poster campaign has also been launched, bearing the slogan 'victorious battle' jayagrahi satana, although on behalf of whose jayagrahanaya, it is not clear. Hence, one has only to surmise that it is towards the victory of Mahinda Rajapaksa that all this noise is being made, since it is the former President, who has been the focal point, in all the propaganda rallies held, since his ouster on January 8, as also with the maiden pohottuwa rally held in Anuradhapura, last Sunday.
If that, indeed, is the whole idea, then the JO's energies would be best directed elsewhere, since Mahinda Rajapaksa, is, today, a has been, where high political office is concerned. The 19th amendment saw to that. He will also, certainly, not be considered for nominations at the next general election, from the UPFA, and, he could kiss goodbye to his Prime Ministerial prospects. The JO, has, as much a chance as a snow ball in hell of winning sufficient seats at a general election to make MR, PM.
It is also moot that Mahinda Rajapaksa will be a deciding factor at a local government election, where, the ladle to dish out the gravy, is in the hands of the government, a fact which has not escaped the voting public, in the past. Besides, the two party system has come to stay in this country, a fact which was also brought home at all previous elections.
Sinhala cinema's heartthrob, Vijaya Kumaratunga, broke away from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, along with wife Chandrika, to form the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya, in 1984, in a bid to challenge the SLFP. In the by-elections that soon followed, except in Minneriya, where Vijaya himself contested, and, beat the SLFP candidate to third place, the SLMP received a drubbing in the two other electorates, it contested. It is doubtful if Mahinda Rajapaksa possesses more charisma than Vijaya, to stage an upset, notwithstanding his war winning credentials which, anyway, failed to make an impact, on January 8.
Not just Vijaya, there were others, who were potential leaders of this country, who deserted their parties to form alternatives, to challenge the status quo. Gamini, Lalith, Premachandra et al. also formed a political party, after being forced to leave the UNP in the aftermath of the impeachment episode. However the Rajaliya party, which they formed, failed to make any headway at the Provincial Council elections, that followed the assassination of President Premadasa, coming a poor third, behind the UNP and the PA. Well, one could argue that the sympathy vote went the UNP's way. But this could not be the case, since the late President, was, at the time, portrayed as the darkest villain, by the Opposition. This, however, failed to sway the voting public, to vote for the UNPs alternative. Ditto for Rukman Senanayake, the grandson of the Father of the Nation, whose Eksath Lanka Janatha Pakshaya died a natural death.
Of course, the JO must be buoyed by crowd attendance, at its rallies, to feel confident of victory. Sirima Bandaranaike, too, drew mammoth crowds to her elections rallies, in 1977, but the SLFP was practically wiped out, at the poll, handing JRJ a five sixth majority. Similarly, Mahinda Rajapaksa drew the same crowds, as was witnessed in Anuradhapura, on Sunday, at both, the presidential and general elections, but came a cropper when it mattered.
The JO has overlooked the fact that a large SLFP element, which was with MR, at both, the presidential and general election, is today, in the Yahapalanaya government, which is bound negate any headway it (JO) hopes to make. In the Yahapalanaya are SLFP ministers, who topped the list in the preference vote, or, those who were placed very high on the list. This support base could not have dwindled, all that much, even in the face of certain adverse developments, such as the recent petroleum crisis. Among this lot are ministers, holding important portfolios, which place them is a position to dispense largess, to the SLFP supporters.
All these factors, no doubt, are going to combine to bring forth a similar fate to the JO, that befell all the breakaway parties, mentioned above.

The story of Dr. Jane Goodall: A rose in  the green wild
Over a half a century ago, when 26 year old Jane Goodall ventured into the wild, she barely held anything other than a notebook and binoculars in her hand. She had no field experience and no college degree but in her heart, she bore pure fascination and sheer will to learn.
Her distinct interest was captured by a species none other than our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. For 55 years, Goodall remainedin Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania,studying the Kasakela chimpanzee community.
She had been sent to Tanzania by Kenyan paleoanthropologist and archaeologist Dr. Louise Leaky and she studied chimps for more than 57 years and by the 80s, the looming threat of habitat destruction inspired Goodall to leave the jungle and begin advocating for conservation full time.
Today, at age 83, her endeavor is still in motion and she has come to be a renowned and respected primatologist, ethologist, anthropologist, and UN Messenger of Peace. She inspires people to conserve nature, connects them to a forgotten part ofit and travels up to 300 days a year in order to accomplish her task as a fellow earthling.
I think I was given a mission, and I feel something up there pushing me.
Bound to nature
All the time, I was getting closer to animals and nature and, as a result, closer to myself and more in tune with the spiritual power I felt all around, she says in the new documentary JANE which follows Goodall into the field and recounts her work studying primates.Most of the footage is culled from 134 hours of film shot by Goodall's ex-husband Hugo van Lawick while they were in Tanzania.
I've always loved being alone, and being alone is very different from being lonely. Being alone out in the rain forest you're not alone, you're surrounded by life forms, where everything is interconnected and in the rare moments where you are completely in tune with the natural world you are part of it, she once said to presenter Kathryn Ryan on Radio New Zealand.
Enclosed in the green nest of the wild, Goodall raised her son, Hugo amidst the natural world. Mama, he says, big lion out there eat me. Dr. Goodall laughed in delight at the memory, says dailytelegraph.com. It was, she conceded, a hell of a first sentence.
It was wonderful, Goodall told the site. Hugo very much grew up in nature. He never wore any clothes, and every single afternoon Id be out with him, the two of us discovering the world together.
But I had to be careful and make sure he was never alone outside, and I had a big cage on the verandah where I would put him at times  because chimpanzees have been known to eat human children.
The young animal-lover
Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall was born on April 3, 1934 London to Mortimer Herbert Morris-Goodall, a businessman, and Margaret Myfanwe Joseph, a novelist who wrote under the name Vanne Morris-Goodall.
As a child, she was given a lifelike chimpanzee stuffed animal named Jubilee by her father; her fondness for the toy started her early love of animals. Today, the stuffed animal still sits on her dresser in London. As she writes in her book, Reason for Hope: My mothers friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares.
Goodall loved books about animals and Africa, especially The Story of Dr. Dolittle and Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan series. However, Goodall was disdainful of Tarzan's romantic interest, Jane Porter, and thought that she would be a better romantic match for the tree-swinging hero.
Everybody said I'd never do it, but not my mum, Goodall told motherboard of launching her career in the jungle. So I didn't care what anybody else said, and I knew I could do it. I watched animals all my life. I knew I was going to go to Africa and live with animals. I was right,
She did well in school despite an unusual neurological condition, known as prosopagnosia, which makes it difficult to recognize faces  She reveals about the condition in her autobiography. Unable to afford a university education, she moved to London after school to work as a secretary for a documentary film company.
Goodall has a sister, Judith, who shares the same birthday, though the two were born four years apart.
A woman of science
Despite Leakeys confidence in her abilities, other experienced professionals did not believe a lone young woman from England could survive in the African bush.She speaks to hollywoodreporter on how her womanhood was a beneficial factor in the challenge she found in life in the wild. Being a woman helped me, I think. Louis Leakey believed that women would be better observers than men, had more patience. That's why he chose [me]. I'd say way over half of people now out in the field studying animals are women.
Goodall is largely an apolitical figure, though she couldn't resist taking a few digs at political stances that rejected science. She says, in the same interview, that she is more shocked than surprised, that some people tend to not accept science even today.They're denying the scientific observations of thousands of scientists around the world. How do I get through to them Sometimes if you get the feeling of a person and you find out who he is, you can tell a story that gets into the heart so that he might take away some different thoughts.
A radiant rose
Goodall is the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute which contributes to the wellbeing of the planet by restoring critical habitat to save chimpanzees from extinction; improving health for women and education for girls; cultivating local livelihoods in harmony with nature; and helping young people become the informed generation of conservation leaders the world so urgently needs through the Roots & Shoots youth programs in nearly 100 countries.
She has served on the board of the Nonhuman Rights Project since its founding in 1996 and she has worked extensively on conservation and animal welfare issues.
Jane Goodall is a soft flame of light in the path of nature, science and society as a whole. That softness received the gratitude it deserves when she recently got a rose named after her. A portion of sales for the sunrise colored pink-yellow hybrid tea rose goes to help the work of the Jane Goodall Institute as her mission still continues to this day.

Meanwhile, commuters who had booked seats to travel from Vavuniya to Colombo that night had to face great inconvenience due to the disruption of train traffic. Since they came over to Anuradhapura to board the train to Colombo there was a heavy rush of passengers at the Anuradhapura station.
Railway workers were busy from November 14 night to place the derailed compartments back on rails and repair the track.

Transportation budget proposal needs revision - Wijeratne
Lanka Private Bus Owners Association president Gemunu Wijeratne said the budget proposal need to be revised where transportation is concerned.
Taxes on smaller vehicles have been lessened which is in itself a huge problem. This has led to congestion on the roads. Because of this 1 billion rupees are lost to the country per day. This further complicates the matter. We feel that these budget proposals need to be revised in relations to these matters. If this is not done the public transportation system cannot be developed, Wijeratne said.
The public transportation system is essential for the development of a country.There is no budget proposal at all when it comes to the development of the public transportation system. This is a serious problem, Wijeratne said.
Like the countrys Health and Education, the Public Transportation system is vital. We cannot give it step-motherly treatment. You cannot take the country forward, if it is not given due consideration. For the development of the Public Transportation, the basic facilities have to be developed. Once the issue of basic facilities have been addressed and the budget proposals have been revised, then we can address the issue of congestion in the country, Wijeratne added.

Two Lankan referees to Durham
Two top up and coming rugby referees Hasun Praneeth Weranga Horange and Mohamed Aaqil Jamaldeen left for U.K. yesterday on an official invitation from the Durham County Rugby Football Union Referees Society.
The invitation was sent on behalf of the Durham County Rugby Football Union Referees Society by secretary John S. Denham. The program which started few days back will come to end on November 21. For the two Sri Lankans accommodation is provided by the Durham Referees Society during this period. This is going to be a good experience as one of the two referees will get a chance to blow in UK. Earlier referees like Roshan Deen, Dilroy Fernando, Anil Jayasinghe and Aruna Jayasekara have attended similar types of refereeing courses in the UK.
The Durham County Rugby Football Referees Society was founded in 1895 and the body is responsible for appointing referees to all clubs up to level 5 within county Durham, covering all fixtures. This society offers training and development opportunities to referees.

Upsurge in sword attacksJaffna Police looks for links
Four individuals were hospitalised in Jaffna following a resurgence in two separate sword attack incidents which Police say were motivated on personal grounds.
Speaking to Daily News DIG K.P.Fernando of the Jaffna Range said that while most of the attackers used swords as their choice of weapon, the Police were still investigating any probable links.
So far, weve found that the motive in most of the cases were personal issues among the assailants and the victims, he said.
We are still investigating for patterns or links between these individuals.
Earlier this week, another individual in Koppay was pursued from Jaffna town by two assailants on two motorbikes before being attacked close to the Koppay Police station.
Later that day, another individual was injured in Navaly when his house was broken into. Reports also suggest another attack in Gurunagar on Sunday which left two individuals hospitalised.

US leads world in oil and  gas production, IEA says
International energy markets are set for major upheaval as the US cements its status as the worlds largest oil and gas producer, while China overtakes it as the biggest oil consumer.
The predictions come from the International Energy Agencys annual energy forecast.
It believes that global energy demand will rise 30% by 2040, driven by higher consumption in India.
At the same time, the renewable energy sources will become more important.
The IEA, which tracks the energy for 29 countries, said the US - once reliant on imports - is becoming the undisputed global oil and gas leader.
It expects the US to account for 80% of the increase in global oil supply to 2025, driven by increases in shale.
That will keep prices down and help make the US a net exporter of oil - in addition to gas - by the late 2020s.
The US Energy Information Administration estimated that the US became the worlds top petroleum and natural gas producer in 2012.
The emergence of the US represents a major upheaval for international market dynamics, said Dr Fatih Birol, IEA executive director.
US oil and gas output is projected to surpass that of any other country in history, due to a remarkable ability to unlock new resources cost-effectively.
The agency said renewable sources such as solar and wind are expected to meet 40% of the new demand.
In the EU, renewable energy will represent 80% of new capacity. Growth in energy demand is half what it would have been without improvements to efficiency.
In China, for instance, government focus on renewable energy has led energy demand to increase by an average of 2% annually since 2012, down from 8% between 2000 and 2012.
China is still on track to have higher per-capita energy consumption than the EU by 2040, it added. BBC

Virtue of versatility
Versatility is his virtue. Having excelled in many diverse fields in both the academic and aesthetic sectors Maleesha Yasasvin Perera recently bagged the Best Senior Nalandian (Visistathama Jesta Nalanda Puthra) 2016 award at the schools annual prize giving held at the BMICH on October 24. This award is presented to the top performing Nalandian each year.
Maleesha had been studying at Athurugiriya Mahamathya Vidyalaya before joining Nalanda College through the grade five scholarship examination by scoring 175 marks. Three years into Nalanda College his talents shone through and won him the Best Junior Nalandian (Visistathama Kanista Nalanda Puthra) award 2010. He was the first Nalandian to win both awards after entering the school through the grade five scholarship examination.
I had to face several interviews which focused on all my achievements when I was at Nalanda College. Though a lot of emphasis is on the academic activities, they give considerable marks for non academic activities too, Maleesha said.
Apart from academics, athletics is Maleeshas forte. He says that he has managed to get to the top of the ladder in most of his achievements because of his experiences as a school boy athlete.
Nalanda College opened a wide range of opportunities for me to explore my talents. The main thing I learnt was to handle the pressure. I was passionate about cricket and wanted to join the team. However my parents did not encourage me to venture towards that sector. They allowed me to pursue athletics which I was equally passionate about, Maleesha mused.
The track has taken him a long way. He has won 31 medals at national school level and has set a national record. One of the highlights of his school athletic days is clocking 0.06 seconds behind Shehan Ambepitiyas record.
I am not a good starter but I was able to take long strides and surpass other athletes due to my height. This is the reason why I began to prefer the 200m because I had ample time to catch up if I got delayed during my start, says the youth who stands six feet two inches tall. This made him the tallest athlete in his age group at Nalanda as well as among other schools.
Recalling his first moment in the limelight on the track Maleesha notes it was the Under 12 Relay Carnival in 2008 in which the team got into the finals but failed to win a medal. His first all island individual victory was in 2011 in the Under 15 Sir John Tarbet Junior Championship in Kandy where he won a silver medal.
He notes that to excel in athletics a person needs to have good discipline.
Hard work and dedication will take you a long way along the track. I spent most of my time either studying or on the track. I did not get much opportunities to hang out with my friends or to party. That is a sacrifice you need to pay to shine in both sectors, Maleesha explained.
He considers his best achievement as being part of the relay team which won the gold medal for 4x100m at the second South Asian Junior Athletics Championship held in Ranchi, India in 2013. He was 16 then and the youngest in the team. Maleesha has been Nalanda Colleges Deputy Games Captain in 2015 and the Games Captain in 2016. He has represented the Sri Lanka Junior National Athletic Pool for three years. He has trained under Tikiri Bandara, Sujith Prasanna, Sunil Gunawardena and Badra Gunawardena. The current athletic coach of Nalanda College, M Marasinghe, too has been a pillar of strength to Maleesha.
Receiving the Best Senior Nalandian 2016 from Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam award at the annual prize giving held at BMICH
He says that there is no margin for error in athletics. If you make a mistake which takes even a fraction of a second, you might be out of the game.
If you get your strides wrong you might end up being injured which will cost you your place in the tournament or even your career.
Maleeshas role model is Olympic champion Usain Bolt not only because he is a power sprinter but because the techniques he uses also suits Maleesha due to his height.
Having followed the commerce stream for his G C E Advance Level examination Maleesha was ranked 61 all island. This won him the Dayawansa Jayakody Challenge Trophy for the best results in the Commerce stream of Nalanda College as well as the L H Mettananda Memorial Trophy for the best results in the commerce and art streams of Nalanda College in 2016. He has put together a number of events such as the Schools Commerce Day for the school with his colleagues.
Maleeshas father, Jayalath Perera, is the assistant director in the administration sector at the Sri Lanka Parliament. His mother, Lalitha Padmini, is a teacher at Rahula Balika Vidyalaya, Malambe. His sister is studying at Gothami Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo.
Maleesha started his first year at Sri Jayawardenapura University. He hopes to take up the B. Sc. Mgt. (Accounting) Special Degree. His ambition is to become a qualified professional in the corporate sector in Sri Lanka first before trying his luck as a professional in the global platform.
His message to youth is to believe in their potential and strengths.
You might face hardships along the way but if you have a stimulant, it will raise your confidence. This is also the best time to recognize your strengths. Do not bow out of the game. Get back on your feet and move on till you get there.
You need to capitalize on your strengths when you reach the peak. More emphasis should be given to execution rather than planning. Rather than being one dimensional, try to excel in several sectors so that there will be many options open for you, he said adding that his vision is to be an unstoppable prospect rather than an unbeatable prospect.

JO employing delaying tactics
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday charged that the Joint Opposition members are attempting to delay local government elections by sending their henchman to Courts.
Addressing a media conference held at Sirikotha yesterday, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said the Joint Opposition members who acted like heroes by asking the government to hold local government elections, are now acting like rabbits.
He said the UNP is ready for the upcoming local government election and is confident of victory. However, the Joint Opposition has now realized that they do not have a powerful vote base as the SLFPers at grassroots level are disgruntled and divided.
The Deputy Minister added that the people at grassroots level will teach a good lesson to local government members, who engaged in fraud and corruption during the previous regime, by defeating them at the forthcoming local government election.
The government is now attempting to accelerate the process of taking legal action against the previous regimes top members who have massive corruption charges, he said.

Unfounded allegations against me
IGP Pujith Jayasundera said he had faced many challenges since being appointed the IGP, which he faced with self-confidence.
There have also been several unfounded allegations against me which I have completely ignored. The best punishment that can be given to persons making false allegations is to totally ignore them, IGP Jayasundera said.
Addressing a meeting held in connection with strengthening the community police service, at the Police Crime Division, the IGP said a serious allegation was also made against him during the ceremony held to commemorate the 2nd death anniversary of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera.
People have the freedom to speak but the fact remained that the Police Department had rendered a dedicated service to ensure national security and the security of the people and stabilize peace. The government too has rendered a valuable service towards the welfare of the police service, he said.
The IGP said the community police service was a dream come true to him. He first introduced the concept in Ratnapura when he was stationed there. However, senior police officers at the time did not understand the value of this service. Later, when he tried to extend it to other areas, there were allegations that he was preparing to contest elections.
National security is an important factor in a developing country. Threats posed to national security could be best identified at the village level. Intelligence gathered could easily bust serious crimes. As such, the village and its residents should keep constant contact with the police, he said. The IGP said graduate police officers recruited as community police co-ordinating officers were not expected to idle after receiving their postings. They should have constant contact with the people in the village through village committees. Certain members of the police too were engaged in wrong-doing like the ordinary people. This situation should change, he said.
In his capacity as the IGP, he would not allow any room for errant members of the police. He said the Police Department was at present undergoing a major transformation.
A marks system had been devised regarding granting promotions. Disciplinary action would be taken through the Police Commission against corrupt officials.
He said the benefits of the service rendered by the community police service would accrue not only to the present but future generations as well. Director Community Police Service SP W. A. Priyankara Silva was also present on the occasion.

An analysis of the budget 2018  from an automotive perspective
Historically, Customs duty on motor vehicle imports has been calculated on the CIF value of the vehicle. In Customs terminology, the value for Customs duty is assessed on the price 'paid or payable' by the importer.
The assessment of value for duty computation has a significant impact on the selling price of a vehicle, because duty in Sri Lanka is so high. Duty for a 2,000 cc[1] petrol vehicle used to be an effective rate of 184% of the price paid or payable. Thus, if the value for duty purposes were to drop by one rupee, the cost of the car would drop by Rs.1.84.
The assessment of the value for Customs duty purposes has always been a challenge, and in my assessment, the complexity of making this assessment has historically led to a loss of revenue to the Government.
The key change in the Budget of 2018 is that the motor vehicle duty is no longer calculated on values, but on the cubic capacity (cc) of the engine, be it petrol, diesel or hybrid, and the kilo watt (KW) output of the electric motor for an electric vehicle (EV).
I feel this system is much more equitable to all segments of the industry, including the customer. From the Government point of view, the system is transparent and easy to administer.
What did the Government set out to achieve from the Budget
Reading the Budget speech and studying the relevant appendices, it seems the Government set out to achieve the following:
Create transparency and a level playing field for the various segments of the industry;
Maximise revenue and minimize leakages;
Limit outflow of foreign exchange on the import of motor vehicles;
Set direction to the industry.
If these were the objectives of the Government, I feel the Budget has been very successful. In fact, I feel it has been one of the most successful Budgets for the automotive industry in recent times.
Create transparency and a level playing field for the various segments of the industry
The tables here define the import duty on any vehicle to be imported into Sri Lanka. All you need to know to work out the import duty of a vehicle to be imported is the cc of the engine, and whether it is petrol, diesel, petrol hybrid, diesel hybrid, or electric. Once you define which of the four sources of power the vehicle to be imported is powered by, and you define the power of the vehicle, the table allows you to simply and easily calculate the duty payable. This is the easiest system of duty calculation that has ever been implemented in Sri Lanka.
This system is transparent to everyone. The system is absolutely easy to implement. It is not open for interpretation and thus not open for abuse.
Maximise revenue and minimize leakages
The transparency of this system will stop leakages that were prevalent to this point. These leakages existed because some importers could benefit from the complexity of motor vehicle valuation and get away with lower duty payments. Thus, the Government will be able to collect greater revenue through the recommended system. In fact, the estimated revenue collection from import duty is Rs. 25 billion. I feel this target could be exceeded.
Limit outflow of foreign exchange
Encouraging smaller vehicles to be imported If you look at the steep cascading of the duty rates applied to vehicles with more powerful engines, it shows a steep cascading of duty applicable for more powerful engines, and even within a cc band, the smaller engine pays significantly less import duty than a more powerful engine.
Take for example a 1,000 cc petrol car compared to an 800 cc petrol car; the more powerful 1,000 cc car would attract a customs duty of Rs. 1,750,000 (Rs. 1,750 x 1,000) compared to the 800 cc car attracting a duty of Rs. 1,400,000.
Rs. 350,000 is a very material sum of money in this market segment. Most people buying the smaller cars buy them on lease. An average four-year lease repayment would cost Rs. 1,500 per Rs. 100,000 borrowed. This, the 800 cc car would cost Rs. 5,250 per month less on a lease. This again, is a material sum of money in this market segment and hence the policy will be effective to drive consumers to purchase less powerful engines.
Whist a 1,000 cc petrol vehicle attracts a duty of Rs. 1,750,000 a 1,300 cc petrol vehicle will attract a duty of Rs. 3,536,000. This further proves the Budget will persuade consumers to purchase smaller engine vehicles.
Encourage fuel efficiency via encouraging import of hybrids
The table shows that a hybrid vehicle below 1,000 cc petrol attracts a duty of Rs. 1,250 per cc and hence the duty of a petrol hybrid would be Rs. 100,000 less than that of a compatible petrol non-hybrid.
The benefit of pushing consumers towards smaller engines and hybrids will lead to a significant reduction in expenditure of fuel. Hybrid vehicles are at least 25% more fuel efficient than non hybrid vehicles. So, if all vehicles in Sri Lanka were to move to hybrid, we could save 25% (or more) on the total import value of fuel for motor vehicles.
The total value of fuel imported for transport is approximately US$ 1,700 million[2]. This is around 9% of total imports and one of the largest imports for the country. Comparatively, the total import value of transport equipment which is not just motor vehicles but all transport-related equipment including agricultural equipment, earth moving equipment and may even be rolling stock[3] is US$ 931 million. This means that the foreign exchange outflow from the import of vehicles is much less significant than the foreign exchange outflow from the purchase of gasoline.
Assuming the entire fleet of Sri Lankas motor vehicles were to move to hybrid, which could bring a 25% saving in fuel imports, this saving would translate to US$ 439 million.
This value would be 4% of our total exports. The point being made is that any possible saving in fuel is significant in the context of import reduction and balance of payments.
Encouraging electric vehicles (EVs)
In context of reducing fuel imports, the benefits given for the import of electric vehicles is very significant.
The arguments presented above show that the Budget 2018 has actively targeted the balance of payments improvement in a two-pronged manner. On one side, it is actively discouraging the import of expensive motor vehicles through an import duty that cascades steeply for more expensive vehicles (through the increase of import duty in relation to cc) and on the other side, though the encouragement to import more efficient transport equipment, thus reducing the import of fuel.
The benefit of EVs are not merely derived from the benefit of reduced fuel imports. The main benefit of an EV is that the vehicle, in terms of its design, is fundamentally more efficient than an Internal Combustion Engined (ICE) vehicle.
In terms of energy efficiency, an ICE vehicle is estimated to transfer only around 50% of the input energy to the vehicles driven wheel. An EV is estimated to be able to transfer over 90% of the input energy to the driven wheel. This is a significant difference in efficiency.
The argument that Sri Lankas national grid is powered by fossil fuel and hence EVs dont bring efficiency is thus negated. Further, the potential to capture more solar and other alternative energies in Sri Lanka supports the strategy that we should actively promote EV adoption. Professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala, of the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras, and automotive advisor to the Indian Prime Minister, addressing the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA), at their annual sessions 2017 in New Delhi stated that research showed that if all the vehicles in the world were to immediately convert to EVs, the world would only need to increase its electricity generation by 10% and this increase could easily be generated by sources of alternate energy without resorting to using more fossil fuel.
Many countries have announced that all vehicle registrations will be electric by around 2025 onwards. Sri Lanka has made the announcement in this Budget, with an announced date of 2040. This target I feel is conservative, but at least we have a target.
Reduced EV duty for brand new vehicles
It is noteworthy that the Budget has an increased rate of duty for used vehicles, and a cheaper rate for new vehicles. This makes a lot of sense, as the lithium ion battery in EVs have a life of around five years. At the end of its life, the battery needs to be responsibly recycled. Sri Lanka is presently developing the battery recycling infrastructure and hence, the Government granting an added benefit for new vehicles is a sound strategy.
Some importers argue that the agent for Nissan doesnt import the Nissan Leaf as a brand new vehicle and in order for this vehicle to be imported, this criterion should be deleted. The issue is if this criteriion is deleted, it allows for older vehicles to be imported, and this is not in the best interest of the country.
Set direction for the industry
The Budget 2018 is encouraging the import of smaller engines, encouraging the import of hybrids which are more efficient and encouraging the adoption of EVs.
One hopes that the Government will keep reinforcing these objectives so that the industry will take the cue from the Government and present the consumer with transport solutions that are cleaner and greener. The Government's sustained assertion of these objectives will also spur the provision of the infrastructure required to promote and facilitate accelerated EV adoption.
Safety, congestion and underemployment
The Budget has, for the first time, introduced minimum safety standards for motor vehicle imports. The Budget requires all vehicles being imported into Sri Lanka to have airbags, anti locking brakes (ABS) and three-point seat belts. With the introduction of highways and better quality roads that increase the driving speeds in the country, these import restrictions must be welcomed.
I feel the adoption of these minimum safety standards is well timed and one hopes that the Government will not alter these restrictions during the budget debates. The Budget imposes import surcharges on trishaws and concurrently gives significant encouragement for the import of electric trishaws.
I personally feel that the trishaw has provided yeoman service to the people of Sri Lanka by supporting public transport when the Government could not afford to upgrade it. However, I feel the product has reached the end of its product life cycle. The road conditions and the traveling speeds make the trishaw unsafe, particularly when they travel on inter-city A roads.
We have also been reading about the shortage of labour in Sri Lanka. We have 1.1 million trishaws, which also means the same number of our workforce are driving trishaws.
If we are in need of a trishaw, in most cities in Sri Lanka, we dont need to wait more than two to three minutes to hail one. Have we reached the point of saturation of trishaws and do they bring about underemployment[4]
Permits
Permits have become an integral part of the Sri Lankan motor industry. Permits allow Government employees to purchase a vehicle at a reduced duty. Given our high duty environment that has been in effect for the over the past decade, permits present a significant benefit to the recipient. Most Government employees do not avail themselves of this benefit and instead pass on their benefit to a third party.
In the broader usage, the concept of the permit could be interpreted as the Sri Lankan public making a transfer payment to Sri Lankan government employees. In return, the public are able to purchase a vehicle at a reduced duty. This transfer payment does make sense as it enhances the remuneration of the Government employee, without increasing the Government wage bill and thus Government recurrent expenditure.
Permits have historically caused distortion within the industry. The reason for the distortion is that in effect, one US dollar can change the effective rate of duty from 100% to 200% or even more.
The permits had limits to the CIF value of vehicle that can be imported under its cover. This distorted the industry in terms of giving significantly increased sales volumes to vendors whose products came under the purview of the permit, and adversely disadvantaging those whose products didnt come under this purview.
The present Budget does away with the CIF limit on the permit and gives a specific rupee discount on duty payable. The fact that permits are recommended to be transferable takes away the previous circumvention of this somewhat dubiously.
What cars are cheaper and what are more expensive
The Budget has not made vehicles that much cheaper. In fact, many vehicles are more expensive than they were. But, the difference in many cases is not hugely material.
The 2,000 cc syndrome - regressive taxation
The best example to explain the problem of regressive taxation is the example of the Mahindra Scorpio. It is a robust and utilitarian 4x4, with a 2,523 cc diesel engine. The CIF price of this vehicle should be around US$ 17,000. That is around Rs. 2,635,000[5]. The duty, based on the present system is Rs. 22,707,000. This is an effective rate of duty of 861%. This probably beats all world records of the highest incidence of duty. So, obviously the Scorpio wont be attractive in Sri Lanka.
Does this example serve to discredit this method of levying Customs duty
Looking at this question from the point of view of the Mahindra Scorpio, on one hand, the prevalent duty mechanism renders the product unsellable.
However, if we were in the regime of CIF based duty, and a competitor selling a similar product imported it at a cost for duty purposes of US$15,000 the Scorpio would again have been uncompetitive. This sort of issue was prevalent during the previous form of valuation.
Another point to note is that many European manufacturers have luxury vehicles like Mercedes S Classes, BMW 7 Series, and the Range Rover with sub 2,000 cc petrol and petrol hybrid engines. These vehicles will now be cheaper than they were because of the cc based duty. On the other hand, the duty on some of the larger engine vehicles could be higher than before.
The point I am making is that the methodology adopted by this Budget is not infallible. Like any proposal, it will see some winners and some losers.
But, in an overall sense, based on my experience in the automotive industry in Sri Lanka, I feel the method of calculating duty as per the suggestion of the 2018 Budget will be the more equitable to all industry stakeholders, than any other methodology implemented.
The regressive nature of the duty incidence, as explained with an extreme example in the above paragraphs, could occur in the category of petrol vehicles up to 2,000 cc and petrol hybrid vehicles upto 2,000 cc
Today, most manufacturers flagship model is available in a 2,000 cc engine format. Take for example, the BMW 7 series is available in a 2,000 cc petrol version. So is the BMW 5 series and so is the BMW 3 series, and also the BMW X3, and X5. All the listed models will attract the same Customs duty. Rs. 12,000,000. Since the CIF prices of the listed vehicles are very different, the duty, as a percentage of CIF will vary. Some may argue that this is unfair and regressive.
If one were to look at this issue from the purview of the Government, a 2,000 cc engine consumes similar amounts of oxygen and emits similar amounts of carbon monoxide into our environment. The listed cars take very similar amounts of space on our roads.
They consume nearly identical amounts of fuel. So, then, why shouldnt the Government levy a uniform tax on any 2,000 cc engine The problem in Sri Lanka is that we are used to a cheaper model differing from a more expensive model by a large rupee differential, because we are used to the price difference being a function of price multiplied by duty.
If we were buying a car in the US, where duty is near non-existent, then, the difference in price of the vehicles in the above example would be merely a function of the difference in the manufacturer's price of the listed models and the sellers margin. The price difference would be small.
With the CC based duty system, the price differences for different models with the same CC engine will be smaller that we are accustomed to. I dont think it is fair to attribute this change as a demerit of the CC based duty system.
Summary
I reiterate that I feel the proposed system of levying duty on motor vehicles is more transparent, easier to administer and broadly more equitable for the industry. The transparency and the added competition that this methodology will bring will ensure the consumer gets the best possible deal. The system will ensure that the Government collects a stable revenue with no possibility of leakage.

Budget 2018 lays down path for  pragmatic long-term policy on alcohol
Following Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweeras proposal to impose excise tax based on the volume of alcohol and type of liquor, much has been said and discussed over the media on the relief it provides to the price of soft alcohols like beer and wine.
Whilst the majority of commentary over digital and social platforms have tended to welcome this proposal as a step in the right direction, we have also observed a number of politicians and press stating that this measure will bring about ill consequences to public health. It is imperative to consider some practical observations and ground realities during this debate.
For instance, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and some of the lobby groups state that only 6% of Sri Lankans consume illicit alcohol in this country. They state that there are no national level studies on illicit alcohol usage, but then they themselves state that technically sound sub-national studies show that illicit, or kassippu, consumption is less than 10% of the population or not more than 6% of total consumption.
However, the Minister and these NGOs and other affiliated offices merely need to consult the 2017 Global Alcohol Report of none other than the World Health Organiszation, which puts the figure at 45% of consumption. If the WHO is not a national level statistic for consideration, they merely need to consult the records of the Sri Lanka Police and the Department of Excise, which gives evidence of raids on Moonshine (kassippu) at the rate of 12 every hour for the past five years. A tall order for a country with only 6% per cent of total consumption. A close inspection of the statistics would also reveal that there has been no reduction in the numbers.
The argument that increasing the price of all alcohol products will reduce consumption holds no water. In that event, the multitude of price increases over the years should have disrupted the existence of the alcohol industry in this country. It persists because there is demand. When Sri Lankan consumers can no longer afford to purchase legitimate products, they then turn to kassippu  which is widely prevalent even in the Western Province.
People are driven toward illicit because of cheap price and easy availability. If the illicit trade is being dealt with by appropriate law enforcement then the WHO need not report 45% volumes in its report this year. There are many examples the world over, which have also been cited by the WHO in its reports, where high prices of legal alcohol products have driven consumers underground. For example, in Australia in 2015, researchers found consumers switching to illicit products including narcotics due to the high price of alcohol, making even substances such as cannabis and ecstasy a more sensible choice. The findings are published and are easily accessible. Is this what we want for Sri Lanka too
To safeguard against youngsters taking up alcohol consumption at an early age, the government in 2006 introduced legislation to halt the sale of alcohol products to persons below 21 years of age.
At 21 years, Sri Lanka it is believed presents a very late age where a person is legally allowed to purchase an alcohol product and this law is enforced island wide at all legal sales outlets. But who is monitoring its implementation at the illicit liquor dens island wide.
Who is collecting tax from the 45% of consumption of kassippu islandwide. Is there any regulating authority or standard that is monitoring the method of production of kassippu, which retails for low as Rs. 150 a bottle in some parts of the island.
It is well and good to question and stand up against the actions and existence of the legal alcohol trade, but the same should be applied, or much worse, against the kassippu trade for which no one seems to muster the courage.
In many developed markets, 80% of national alcohol consumption is safer softer alcohol products like beer and wine. The per capital consumption of pure alcohol in these countries are much lower than countries like Sri Lanka, and this achieved via an effective process of price, education and distribution that favours softer safer alcohols. There is adequate scientific and market data available globally that corroborate their success. The WHO figures on Sri Lankas kassippu problem is corroborated by the Colombo University research findings which put the figure at 49% of total consumption. Thus, beer and wine are the naturally the safer legal alternatives that policy-makers must promote to control the situation, rather than provide an outlet through enhanced spirits consumption.
The proposals laid out in the budget take a long-term view towards developing a safe, sustainable and responsible alcohol culture. Having spent decades at the wrong end of the global alcohol consumption index, this proposal provides the foundation to get it right! It may not serve the interest of anti-alcohol lobbies who promote a state of prohibition, but prohibition can never be a reality and it breeds a far more dangerous culture of criminal activity which would be far more difficult to control as the Americans trialed and failed with in the early 1930s, and as India and Africa did in certain states.
What is proposed is not to make beer or alcohol products freely available in every roadside grocery; what has been proposed is a first step in a systematic process to correct the balance of alcohol consumption in the country towards safer legal products as opposed to illicit. This is a policy and a proposal that we must all support for the sake of the public, health and future generations, and also to safeguard state revenue which is essential to uplift public services all round.
It is our sincere hope, that we could all rise above petty politics and personal agendas to do what is right by the country and its people, to ensure that we will finally graduate from a developing state and take our rightful place on the world stage.

Chevron Lanka PLC to supply lubricant oil to Sapugaskanda plant
Chevron Lanka PLC, a subsidiary of the US based lubricant company is to be awarded the contract to supply 1.1 million litres of lubricant oil to the Sapugaskanda Power Plant for the year 2017/2018.
In July, a proposal was submitted to Cabinet to obtain approval for the Tender on purchasing lubricating oil for the Sapugaskanda power plant run by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). At the time, it was suggested that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) be approached for the lubricant and a Joint Committee comprising of CEB and CPC officials was formed to discuss the possibilities of such a venture.
The Joint Committee revealed that lubricating oil of the prescribed specification of the plant manufacturer should only be applied for this power plant and that the particular type of lubricating oil was not manufactured in the CPC. Thus the CPC was not in a position to supply the oil.
CPC officials however have decided to look into the possibility of manufacturing this particular type of lubricating oil in the CPC and discussions with the CEB are to continue.
The lubricating oil needed for Sapugaskanda is called Taro 40 X L 40 and according to the recently approved agreement, Chevron will supply the lubricant at a rate of Rs 234.43 per litre.
The Sapugaskanda Plant A requires 800,000 litres which will cost a total of Rs 187,544,000 + 15 percent VAT, Plant B requires 300,000 litres which will cost a total of Rs 70,329,000.000 + 15 percent VAT and for unplanned urgent requirements they will purchase 110,000 litres at a total cost of Rs 25,787,300.00 + 15 percent VAT.

China to invest US$ 7-8 bn in Lanka - Senasinghe
The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) together with the Ministry of Development strategies and International Trade and International Trade Center (ITC) Geneva organized the 4th and Final Consultation on "Finalization, Consolidation and Validation of the National Export Strategy (NES) yesterday at the Gall Face Hotel, Colombo.
State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe speaking at event said that, Sri Lanka has hardly manufactured anything here over the last 20 years, but with the upcoming Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with several countries, Sri Lanka would be able to garner immense opportunities in the international market.
The Minister also noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping has chosen Sri Lanka as one of the main investing countries by China and has committed to invest US $ 7-8 billion in Sri Lanka in the coming years.
NES is funded by the European Union (EU) while the technical assistance to develop the NES is provided by the International Trade Centre (ITC). The fundamental objectives of the NES are to develop a strategic vision for Sri Lankas exports sector and to improve the quality and competiveness of the exports sector to realise future growth targets.
The consultative process leads public sector institutions and private sector enterprises to design a common and agreed plan for growing and diversifying Sri Lanka's export products and reaching new target destinations.
The National Export Strategy (NES) has been developed by private and public stakeholders through extensive consultations which commenced from the First National Symposium held in April 2017 at Temple Trees, under the patronage of the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe.
During the consultation process, between the private and public sector, six priority sectors which include ICT, Wellness Tourism, Spice Concentrates, Boat Building, Processed Food and Beverages, and Electronic, Electrical and Machinery and four trade support functions (TSF) which include National Quality infrastructure, Innovation and R&D, Logistics and Trade Promotion were identified. All export sectors including the mature sectors are to benefit from the strengthening of trade support functions, thereby invigorate rural economies and create many new employment opportunities. NES is being developed as part of Sri Lankan governments' ambitious target of achieving US $ 20 billion in exports revenue by 2020.
The Sri Lankan markets will benefit significantly from foreign investment and these sectors were identified as having the greatest potential in the next five years to attract foreign investment.
This has the potential to lead to setting up of international partnerships to benefit local markets and make most of the current Free Trade Agreements already in place.

Chinese Navy ship deck reception held in Colombo
A deck reception was hosted in Colombo on the Chinese Navy Ship Qi Jiguang, on November 13. Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene, Chinese Task Commander Rear Admiral Yan Zhengming, Commander Lieutenant Genearal Mahesh Senanayake and high officials from the Sri Lanka Armed Forces and the government, as well as members of diplomatic corps in Colombo, attended the function.
Rear Admiral Yan welcomed distinguished representatives for attending the reception, thanked the considerate arrangement, powerful support and cordial hospitality provided by the Sri Lanka Navy, after which he expressed the best wish to enhance the friendship and cooperation between two Navies.
State minister Ruwan Wijewardene said the relationship between China and Sri Lanka spans more than 60 yearsit lasts for centuries. On the historical moment of the 60th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations and the 65th Anniversary of the signing of the Rubber & Rice Pact.
He said he was glad to see the friendship continuing. China has always been a warm friend of Sri Lanka. China helps Sri Lanka not only economically. During the internal conflicts, China offered help to Sri Lanka. Because of China, the Sri Lankan government managed to defeat the LTTE and won peace. On behalf of the tri-forces of Sri Lanka, he welcomed the visit of the Chinese navy ship.
Ambassador Yi said that it was the fourth Chinese Navy ship visiting Sri Lanka this year. The exchange between China and Sri Lanka, especially the two navies, becomes more and more frequent.
They come here for peace, cooperation and friendship. Six hundred years ago, Zheng He, Admiral of the Ming Dynasty, called on the ports of Sri Lanka five times. This year, many naval ships visited Sri Lanka, including those from USA, Indian, Japan, Indonesia, Pakistan etc.
Yi strongly appreciated the balance policy of the Sri Lankan government that opened its port to everyone. As ambassador of China to Sri Lanka, he said he fully supports such a balanced policy of foreign affairs.
Sri Lankas good relations with everyone is not only important for Sri Lanka, but also for China and other countries. He cited the motto of Alfred Thayer Mahan, one of the most important American strategists of the nineteenth century, Whoever dominates the Indian Ocean, controls Asia.
Fortunately, this anticipation didnt come true. If some country dominates Indian Ocean, it might be a disaster for the whole region.
Yi further said there were more than 500 crew members on board of the Qi Jiguang. Most of them are students from Chinese Navy academies. They came here to exchange with the Sri Lankan Navy.
All of them went out shopping and interacted with local people, which further improved the understanding between each other and enhanced the friendship between them and the Sri Lankan people.
The Chinese Navy ship crew and Sri Lankan Navy officers who have been trained in China, brought performances for the guests during the reception.

My War Heroes
The president rightly said that no war hero should appear before a war tribunal. I applaud him for such a strong statement.
Why should they
War heroes protect people and put their own lives on the line for good of the country.
War heroes abide by the law and protect civilians.
War heroes do not torture or shoot children.
War heroes do not stand by and let their troop kill and rape at will.
War heroes have nothing to hide.
War heroes do not lie.
War heroes speak the truth, even if that means putting their own lives at risk.
I salute these war heroes; they finally put an end to this long and bloody war.
War criminals on the other hand, are the ones who should appear before the war tribunal.
War criminals killed innocent children and bombed hospitals.
War criminals lined up surrendered people and shot them, because they can.
War criminals made people disappear.
War criminals profited illegally from war and stole from this country.
War criminals try to mingle with war heroes, and hope they would be mistaken for one too. But they wont. Because the country is going from strength to strength; strengthening our rule of law, strengthening our governance structures and strengthening our standing on the world stage. But we would never be fully free of our past until weve faced up to our demons and confronted them. And we will.

Compensation for Britisher deported over Buddha tattoo
The Supreme Court yesterday awarded compensation and costs amounting to Rs.800,000 to the British tourist, who was arrested, detained and deported for allegedly displaying a Buddha tattoo.
The Supreme Court ruled that the Katunayake Police have violated the fundamental rights of a British tourist when she was arrested, detained and deported for displaying a Buddha tattoo on her upper limb at the Katunayake airport in 2014.
The Supreme Court ordered the State to pay Rs.500,000 to the British tourist as compensation for violating her Fundamental Rights.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Nalin Perera further ordered the state to pay the petitioners costs in a sum of Rs. 200,000.
Police Sergeant Upasena and Police Inspector Suraweera of Katunayake police station were also ordered to pay Rs.50,000 each as compensation to the petitioner. In her petition, the British tourist Naomi Coleman had sought a compensation from the respondents and further sought a declaration that her detention was null and void and contrary to Articles 13(2) and 12 (1) of the constitution.
In the B Report itself it is stated that the Petitioner had no intention to outrage such feelings. A charge relating to Section 291 B of the Penal Code cannot be maintained i.e outraging the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. There is no acceptable evidence placed before this court that there was a possibility of public outcry, though the police attempt to say so in their statements recorded. I agree with the Petitioners learned Presidents Counsel that surmises will not suffice. As stated above bona fides or mala fides of the arresting officer is irrelevant in deciding whether Article 13(1) has been violated, Justice Anil Goonaratne observed.
Petitioner Naomi Coleman (37), a nurse by profession at the Hawkesbury Lodge, Rehabilitation Mental Health Services filed this petition through Presidents Counse J.C. Weliamuna and Pulasthi Hewamanne and Thishya Weragoda on the instructions of counsel Vishwa De Livera Tennakoon on Pro Bono.
In her petition, she had cited the Attorney General, Police Sergeant and OIC of Katunayake police station, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, Inspector General of Police and OIC of Negombo Prison as respondents. The petitioner stated that she is a devout practicing Buddhist, who has attended meditation retreats in Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and India. She stated that as a personal expression of her devotion to Buddhist teachings, displaying a tattoo of the likeness of Lord Buddha seated on a lotus flower on her upper right arm; accordingly she is aware that there are many followers of the Buddhist path who display such tattoos as a mark of respect and reverence to their religious leader. She further stated that she visited Sri Lanka on two occasions and possessed the same tattoo and had no hindrance in displaying the said tattoo on those occasions. The petitioner stated that she arrived at the Katunayake International Airport on April 21, 2014 around 5.00 a.m. She stated that an individual purporting to be a Civil Defence Officer initially informed her that her tattoo was unacceptable and further asked her to the nearest police station. She said she was deprived of her liberty to continue with her travel in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner further stated that on April 21 at around 10.30 am she was taken to the Negombo Magistrates Court and detained behind bars with several other female suspects. She stated that she was detained at the prison transfered to the detention centre. She said she was detained for two nights at the Mirihana immigration detention camp. She further stated that she was escorted to the Airport by officers of the Immigration Department and her thumbprint was obtained. The petitioner stated that she met her friend at the airport and she was checked into the business class, whereas her friend checked into the economy class of Sri Lanka Airlines flight to London. She said her passport was kept in the custody of a member of the cabin crew of the said flight during the entirety of the flight and returned to the petition upon landing in the United Kingdom. She further stated that the unlawful detention has been based on order made by the Magistrate who had made such order without any jurisdiction whatsoever and without fair inquiry.
J.C. Weliamuna PC appeared for the British tourist while Deputy Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe appeared for the Attorney General.

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said yesterday that President Maithripala Sirisena is the only leader in Sri Lanka who had taken action against corruption and fraud in his own government.
He said that certain politicians in both government and the opposition who have been exposed by the Bond Commission are now viciously attacking President Maithripala Sirisena.
However, the former regime did not appoint any Commissions to reveal these scams.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Devapriya alleged many media institutions and websites which attack the President are directly connected to Ministers of this government.
A certain website connected to a former Minister of this government had attacked me and Minister Patali Ranawaka saying that we had earned money from garbage disposal,.
This type of clean political culture initiated by President Sirisena has not been seen previously in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we will not stop taking further action against corrupt people.
We have created a new SLFP after introducing many reforms to the party. We are fielding candidates who have not been associated with corruption and this has strengthened the party, Devapriya.

The committee will sit every two weeks and submit a progress report on corruption allegation investigations to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The UNP Working Committee meeting was held under the directions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday (15). The Working Committee extensively discussed on the slow pace at which the investigations are conducted. Minister Sagala Ratnayaka pointed out that the Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) has concluded and submitted investigations into 92 cases which were handed over to the Attorney Generals Department, but the AGs Department has taken legal action only on 11 cases.
It was also discussed at the Working Committee that some government institutes are reluctant to give information and reports for such investigations. It was also suggested that action should be taken against such actions as well.
The Working Committee expressed its concerns on the slow pace at which the investigations are conducted, which they believe hinders the governments objective to bring persons involved in bribery and corruption to justice.
The Working Committee also pointed out certain defects of the AGs Department while highlighting that some officers attached to the department are playing favourites. Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera pointed out that 100 new officers will soon be recruited to the AGs Department to prevent delays in filing cases and taking legal action.
It was also pointed out that it is a deficiency on the part of the AGs Department which allowed Anura Senanayake to obtain bail as one who is involved in the Thajudeen murder case.
Another committee was appointed by the UNP Working Committee on nominations for the coming local government polls. Discussions were also held on assuring the UNPs victory at the LG polls.
The Working Committee also proposed to commend Ministers Mangala Samaraweera and Thalatha Athukorale for the budgetary proposal to establish three new anti-corruption high courts. The Working Committee also proposed to appoint three judge benches to all anti-corruption high courts, allowing to file appeals directly to the Supreme Court and to establish a special unit that reports to the Attorney General.

DSWRPP intervention for safety and efficiency of major irrigation systems:
Earth regenerated
Intervention of the Dam Safety and Water Resource Planning Project (DSWRPP) in renovation, rehabilitation and modernization of the large dams of Sri Lanka has greatly improved the safety of the dams and efficiency of the major irrigation systems of the county supporting the growth of the agriculture sector. Renovation of 31 main reservoirs has been completed in the phase -I of the project started in 2008 and ended in 2014. Another 32 dams are now being renovated under the DSWRPP (Additional Finance) Project started in 2014. The renovation work is now under way achieving expected targets and the project will be ended in mid-2018.
The greatness of the irrigation systems in Sri Lanka is a consequence of the greatest engineering skill exhibited in the ancient Sinhalese Kingdom. The progressive building up of a huge and complex system of interrelated dams, canals and tank cascade systems to mingling the water of rivers flowing in different directions are notable achievements in water management in our history.
As a result of destructions by South Indian invaders and abandoning during the colonial rule over 400 years, this irrigation system and the associated civilization was ruined. In the post-colonial era from the independence from the British in 1948 again the economic development of the country is centred on this ancient irrigation system. Ancient tanks and irrigation systems were renovated and farmer colonies were started. Following the ancestors the first government of independent Sri Lanka further expanded this irrigation network and in 1949 Galoya dam was initiated. Again in 1970s Mahaweli Development Scheme was designed with the same objective of boosting the agriculture sector of the economy as well as generating hydroelectricity for the industrial development.
Loss of water storage capacity
Over the time these ancient hydraulic structures as well as reservoir dams built in recent past were facing with interdependent challenges due to aging of structures, suffering from various structural deficiencies and shortcomings of operation and maintenance of such structures. This situation threatens public safety of downstream lives and also affects the operational efficiency of the dams and appurtenances. Failure of a dam structure or emergency spillway operation, could lead to disaster which resulting hazards including physical damages, loss of life, as well as long term economic losses associated with loss of water storage capacity for many users. Therefore, dam structures and reservoirs demand both regulatory and operational safety measures and timely remedial repairs. The need of immediate remedial measures and comprehensive rehabilitation of these dams was emphasized after the disaster caused by the collapse of Kanthale dam in 1986.
On the other hand the National Hydro-meteorological data collection, storage and management were done in fragmented way without having linked with databases managed by different stakeholders. Such databases were outdated, inadequate and inappropriate for modern-day water resource planning, flood forecasting and management. Therefore, dedicated Hydro-meteorological Management Information System (HMIS) had to be established by integrating and networking of prevailed operative units by improving and upgrading their capacities and also introducing fully equipped existing and new units.
With the increasing population demand for water is increasing and now the main challenge the dam owners have been faced is the catering these increasing and competing demand for water. Today water in main reservoirs is used for several purposes; for hydro electricity generation, irrigation, drinking water supply, industrial usage etc. In a situation of growing urban and rural demand for water, competition for water among different uses is immensely increased. This emphasized an urgent need to manage and allocate the country's water resources efficiently and effectively by adopting sector wide approach to swapping individual interests to maximize shared management of water resources.
In 2008 government started DSWRPP to addresses the above challenges by undertaking remedial works of critical dams, provision of basic safety facilities, upgrading hydro-meteorological data collection, storage, management and dissemination system, enhancing capacity of institutions involved in the water sector to acquire knowledge and skills in using modern analytical tools and management practices to undertake sustainable multi-sector planning, development and management of the water resources in the country.
In addition, project assists to reviewing and exploring the development potential and feasibility of existing water resources plans, including revised Mahaweli Water Resources Development Plan.
Accordingly 32 high risk dams out of 80 large dams were identified to be fully renovated under the phase I of the project. Basic facilities for efficient operations and maintenance were provided for all 80 large dams including 32 dams. By the end of 2015, out of the 32 dams renovation of 28 dams had been fully completed and the physical progress of the project was 93%.
Disaster management agencies
DSWRPP also invested money for the establishment of modern HMIS system. The large reservoirs are also playing an important role in flood control as they hold large volume of water. Therefore in the flood risk assessment water levels of the reservoirs is also an important data. HMIS stations have been set up in all major reservoir and now the disaster management agencies can receive all these data real time through modern automated measuring system. Therefore HMIS is one of the important component of the DSWRPP.
Dam owners of Sri Lanka, Irrigation Department (ID), Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Water Supply & Drainage Board (WSDB) are joined hands to implement the project together with other stakeholders involved in the water sector. Emphasis is given to safeguard the Social and environment aspects in the rehabilitation process of dams together with due consideration on protection of cultural properties of the dams. The Total project cost of the Phase I of the project was US$ 71.66 million which was shared by US$ 6.33 from GOSL and US$ 65.33 million from the World Bank.
With the success of the phase I of the project the government decided to extend the project to cover other high risk dams out of 80 major dams and the World Bank agreed for additional financing. In 2014 another 31 dams were selected for renovation with continuation of water sector development and estimated project cost was US$ 83 million. The rehabilitation of 31 dams is now underway under the direct supervision of Implementation Agencies (ID, MASL, CEB, and WSDB).
Rehabilitation work of Periyapandivirichan dam in the Mannar district and Mahakanadarawa dam in the Anuradhapura district have been fully completed and the progress of the whole project is impressive.

Events within Budget
Local Government elections are no longer a distant dream and will become a reality early next year. With the polls in sight the major political parties are jostling with each other to enter the good books of the voter. This was evident as Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera presented his first budget last week.
The two major parties in the National Unity government, the United National Party (UNP) and the mainstream faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) loyal to President Maithripala Sirisena, will go their separate ways at the Local Government elections. Naturally, this would lead to some friction between the two parties and this is only to be expected.
Some observers are quick to pounce on such differences and claim that the days of the National Unity government are numbered, predicting that the local polls would bring the two warring factions of the SLFP- the mainstream party under President Sirisena and the dissident faction loyal to his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa- together.
Others point out that a similar situation existed during the run up to the August 2015 general election. That was an even more challenging proposition because parliamentarians of both parties were contesting each other. That the National Unity government came into being after such an exercise indicates that its survival is not under threat by a mere local government poll, they argue.
In any event, the two parties have to be seen to take the moral high ground, in their quest for votes. Therefore, party stalwarts and even Cabinet ministers of the UNP and the SLFP criticising each other could become the norm in the days and weeks to come, but this does not necessarily mean that the government is about to collapse.
Sale of Central Bank bonds
In this context, a focus of attention last week was the commemoration of the late Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera. The much respected prelate who passed away two years ago after a brief illness was widely recognised as the person who initiated and inspired the campaign for good governance or yahapaalanaya. His commemoration was attended by President Sirisena.
At the ceremony, President Sirisena was critical of those criticising him for appointing the Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank bonds. This has been interpreted by sections of the media as a deliberate strategy to weaken the UNP in the wake of Local Government elections.
However, the President was also to allude to the redeeming features of the National Unity government. He pointed out that, for the first time in the history of post-independent Sri Lanka, the SLFP and the UNP were governing the country together. The UNP endorsed and actively supported the general secretary of the SLFP to run for President, he pointed out.
Nevertheless, there were UNP backbenchers who entertained concerns about the Presidents remarks. Among them, Badulla district parliamentarian Chaminda Wijesiri was to publicly state that a meeting would be sought with the President to ascertain the context of the Presidents statement. This is unlikely to eventuate.
That is because President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have already discussed the issue. Following this discussion, Wickremesinghe censured his parliamentarians for attending a meeting of MPs organised by former minister Ravi Karunanayake at which the President was reportedly criticised for his role in investigating the alleged Bond scam.
Karunanayake was compelled to resign as Finance Minister following disclosures at the Commission of Inquiry where it transpired that his wife had leased an apartment for which the rent had been paid by Arjun Aloysius, who is a focus of attention of the Commission of Inquiry and is also the son-in-law of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
For his part, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is well aware of the damage that the alleged Bond scam has done to the standing of his party. He was also conscious that his own reputation as the Mr. Clean of Sri Lankan politics- no mean feat after 40 years in Parliament- could be at stake here. That is why he has offered to present himself before the Commission of Inquiry personally to give evidence. This is likely to take place in the coming weeks.
It was in such a volatile political environment that the Budget was presented. That the government is keen to provide concessions to the electorate was obvious, what with the public already burdened by a fuel crisis for which Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga had to take a lot of flak although, in reality, there were a series of co-incidences that led to the disruption.
The shortage was brought about by a shipment of petrol imported by the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) being rejected due to poor quality in mid-October. A fortnight later, another shipment imported by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was delayed. The cumulative effect was a countrywide fuel shortage.
The CPC accounts for about 85 per cent of local fuel market and the LIOC supplies the balance fuel. While there was an unfortunate confluence of events that led to the crisis, it has been pointed out that, had there been better contingency planning, the shortage could have been avoided. The causes for the shortage are now the subject of a separate inquiry.
That it was not only the mainstream SLFP and the UNP which had an eye on elections was evident when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to exploit the fuel crisis to score a few political brownie points with the electorate. Forever media-savvy and belying his age, Rajapaksa and a few other parliamentarians from the Joint Opposition (JO) cycled to Parliament on budget day to protest the fuel shortage, knowing that the media will be out in force.
Blue Green budget
Rajapaksa did get his share of publicity but the move backfired because Rajapaksas security detail followed him in a convoy of vehicles, raising questions as to how that would contribute to minimising the fuel shortage. Others lampooned the JO parliamentarians on social media asking how such physically fit MPs fall sick overnight when they are taken into custody.
Although not an MP, among those taken into custody was Gamini Senarath, Rajapaksas former Chief of Staff and two others. They are accused of misappropriating Government funds allocated for the construction of Hyatt Regency Hotel in Colombo. Senaraths detention, following that of former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga, suggests that, for all the speculation in the media, rapprochement between the two factions of the SLFP is probably many years away.
The budget itself was generally well received. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera called it a Blue Green budget alluding to the partners in the National Unity government. While it provided some concessions for essential food items, there was an emphasis on long term gains and environmental issues, with a target being set for all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2040.
Minister Samaraweera has however come in for some criticism for reducing taxes on canned beer with even his colleague Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne expressing his disapproval. This proposal might be reconsidered in light of widespread censure from professional bodies allied to the medical profession.
Despite the current state of flux in UNP-SLFP relations within the National Unity government, no one is losing sleep over whether the Budget will be approved. Despite a few defections from the mainstream SLFP to the JO in recent weeks, the Budget is likely to sail through Parliament comfortably suggesting that, for all the rumblings of dissent within the government, it is still very much in power and in charge.

When the case filed under money laundering charges came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansuriya, the FCID said that the preliminary investigations regarding the incident have been concluded and sought AGs advice in this regard.
Accordingly, further magisterial inquiry into the incident was fixed for April 26.
Four suspects Namal Rajapaksa, Sudarsha Bandara Ganewatta, Nithya Senani and Sujani Bogollagama were present before Court.
They are currently out on bail.
Meanwhile, the Court was informed that Indika Prabhath Karunajeewa who had evaded court since the inception is living in Australia.
The Court had issued warrants through the Interpol for the arrest of Indika Prabhath Karunajeewa.
The FCID commenced investigation into a complaint that MP Namal Rajapaksa had purchased Hello Corp. Pvt. Ltd for Rs.100 million using ill-gotten funds of Gowers Corporation and NR Consultation Pvt Ltd, allegedly owned by Namal Rajapaksa.
The FCID informed Court that investigations revealed that MP Rajpaksa had been allegedly involved in money laundering to the amount of Rs. 15 million at NR Consultation Pvt Ltd and another Rs.30 million in Gowers Corporation Pvt Ltd, in 2012.
The Attorney General filed indictments in the Colombo High Court against Namal Rajapaksa and five others who are alleged to have money laundered to the amount of Rs.30 million at NR Consultation.
Police alleged that money laundering transactions had been taken place through a company named Boston Capital, allegedly owned by Rohan Iriyagolla and he has revealed everything on this regard.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being a MP, from the Rs.125 million he earned through illegal means.

Fish consumption risen by nearly three percent
The per capita fish consumption in Sri Lanka has increased by 2.7 percent this year compared to last year. This was revealed at a progress review meeting held on Tuesday at the National Aquaculture Development Authority under the patronage of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
It was also revealed that per capita fish consumption in Sri Lanka was remained as 44 g in 2016 and it has increased up to 46.7 g, this year.
This years total fish production is 389,500 metric tonnes, which includes 335,750 metric tonnes of marine fisheries production and 53,750 metric tonnes of inland fisheries production.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that the bounteous fish harvest and the apparent tendency to consume fish rather than meat, have resulted in the increase in per capita fish consumption in Sri Lanka.
Meat consumption could lead to many non-communicable diseases such as cancer and heart disease. In contrast, Omega 3 in fish boosts the immunity against heart diseases and several other non-communicable diseases. According to researches, a large proportion of the daily protein requirement for humans can be satisfied by fish consumption. At least 24 kg of fish should to be consumed within a year for the satisfaction of the annual protein need for humans. However, the amount ranges between 12-15 kg in Sri Lanka and in several areas of Central province, it has been reduced to 500 g.

Fly ash to be sold to cement and asbestos industry
Fly ash, a major environmental and health hazard at the Puttalam Coal Power Plant is to be disposed of through its sale to the cement and asbestos industry.
Cabinet approval was granted this week to sell the ash to companies chosen by the Department of Public Finance appointed TEC and SCAPC committees.
The Power Plant comprises of three units of 300 MW for power generation with a total coal requirement of 2.4 million metric tons annually.
Each unit generates up to 850,00 MT of ash per year and together these three units manage to discharge 255,000 metric tons per year.
Tenders called for by the Ceylon Electricity Board to dispose of the fly ash resulted in 12 bids being put forward, according to the Cabinet Paper submitted on the proposal. The bids were for both Quality 1 as well as Quality 2 ash.
The committees have thus chosen the companies of; High-Tech Cement, Ceylon and Foreign Traders PLC, Sri Ramco Roofing Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Tokyo Cement Company Lanka PLC, SIAM city cement Lanka Limited and Tokyo Super Cement Pvt Ltd for Quality 1 ash at unit prices varying from Rs.1200-1370 per ton. Each company will sign an agreement for five years with the CEB for the ash.
Quality 2 ash being sold at Rs.200 per ton will be sold to Tokyo Super Cement and Tokyo Eastern Cement Company.
Tokyo Cement is already a major customer of fly ash and has an existing laboratory opened near the Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant and buys 43 percent of fly ash production from Lakvijaya.

Former Navy Spokesman ordered back to Prison hospital
Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake, who is in remand custody, has been ordered to be transferred to the Prison Hospital from the Welikada Navy Hospital.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order taking into consideration a request made by both prosecution and aggrieved party of the case alleging that seventh suspect D.K.P.Dassanayake was enjoying special privileges while being at Welisara Navy Hospital, contrary to the normal prison procedure.
The Magistrate observed that the Navy Hospital cannot be considered as a public hospital maintained by government in accordance with the Prisons Act. She further said that a consultant physician had also recommended that the suspect does not need surgical intervention to his back-pain symptom.
Commodore Dassanayake and five others arrested on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth in 2008 and 2009.
He was ordered to be further remanded till November 29 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
The Court refused bail for the suspects citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release the suspects on bail. Dassanayake was not produced in court by prison authorities citing that he is currently receiving treatment at a hospital.
On July 12, the CID arrested the former Navy Spokesman at the Sri Lanka Navy base in Welisara following an investigation into the incident. The Colombo Fort Magistrate had earlier rejected a request made Dassanayake to leave the country for a foreign course. On a previous occasion, the CID informed Court that the 11 persons who were abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2008, had been taken to underground detention cells at a navy camp in Trincomalee which were supervised by a Navy Lieutenant Commander.
The missing persons were abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009. Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara with OIC of CIDs Gang Robbery Unit, Inspector Nishantha Silva prosecuted.Counsel Achala Seneviratne appeared for the aggrieved parties.

Four new taxes added in Budget 2018
The 2018 Budget has added four new taxes and it will increase the number of tax to 39, said Suresh Perera, Principal, Tax and Regulatory, KPMG. He was speaking at a post-Budget seminar organised by the National Chamber of Exporters. The new taxes are the debt repayment levy, carbon tax, cellular taxes levy and SMS advertising levy.
He said that Sri Lankas Doing Business Index had deteriorated from 109 to 111 while Indias position has increased a great deal. I think the reason for this is that the simplification of tax and India hopes to be among top 70 in this raking soon.
He said the government hopes to collect a revenue of Rs. 12 billion annually from the cellular tower tax per year in addition to tax from sms advertising which would be 25 cents and this has to be borne by the advertiser.
Perera also said that they are very happy about the tax on sugar products for soft drinks and said that this was a welcome move.
A sugar tax was first implemented in 1922 and it is now being implemented in many countries. (SS)

Fuel shortage: Three member technical committee to probe those responsible
A three member technical committee comprising of officials with specialized technical knowledge in petroleum is to investigate into the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to identify officials responsible for the recent fuel shortage.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee chaired by Minister of Special Assignments, Dr Sarath Amunugama had made the above recommendation due to the fact that even though their preliminary investigations found that CPC officials to be responsible for purchasing,storage and distribution of fuel needed to be held accountable for the recent fiasco, many of the issues which led to the shortage were persistent systematic issues and thus it was difficult for the Cabinet Sub-Committee to identify those directly at fault.
They have however noted the following as the main root causes of the shortage: Not making space to build buffer stocks in light of panic pumping and storage, not informing the political authorities of a possible shortage, no plan of action in place for such emergency situations, not maintaining emergency stocks which is a major need when managing stocks, not having a pricing formula and adopting a transparent purchasing mechanism (need to adopt term tenders), not acting to increase stocks despite previous ministers pointing out the need to do so to officials, no steps taken to quickly increase capacity, problems due to a lack of a long term decision on the Trincomalee oil tanks and no successful plan put in place to increase capacity using existing storage capabilities.
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday also noted that Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga would also need to take certain responsibility as the minister in charge.
He further explained that Ranatunga who had earlier suggested that there was political interference which led to the shortage has now denied making such allegations.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee which also comprised of Ministers Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Arjuna Ranatunga, pointed out that the immediate reason for the shortage was the delay in the ship Lade Nevaska which was carrying 30,000 MT of 92 petrol and 6,500 MT of 95 petrol to Sri Lanka until November 8. In addition, the breakdown of the Sapugaskanda oil refinery for three days had further aggravated the issue.
The CPC at the time it rejected the LIOC stocks had usable stocks of 116,978 MT (92 and 95).
The LIOC which caters to 16 percent of the market has a total capacity of 100,164 MT whilst the CPC has a capacity of 16,814MT in addition to 12,000 MT in 11 provincial warehouses and 1200MT in petrol sheds around the country.
Thus apart from petrol sheds, LIOC and CPC have a total capacity for both 92 and 95 of 128,000 MT.
Thus according to these figures, the committee pointed out that even if the rejected shipment of LIOC amounting to 20,000MT along with the CPCs 36,500 (92 and 95) from Nevaska were to have arrived on time, it would only add up to a total of 56,500 MT-allowing the CPC to have plenty of space to stock up on buffer stocks.
The question thus is why were no steps taken to build a buffer

Gamini Senarath, two others further remanded
Three suspects, including former Presidents Chief of Staff, Gamini Sedara Senarath were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till November 21 by Colombo Fort Magistrate.
This is for allegedly misusing public funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet for a hotel project in 2012.
Three suspects Gamini Senarath, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage and former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna were produced before Court by prison authorities.
Defence Counsel appearing on behalf of Gamini Senerath and Niel Bandara Hapuwinna yesterday tendered their written submissions seeking bail on behalf of the suspects when the matter came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne. However, defence counsel appearing on behalf of Piyadasa Kudabalage told Court that the written submissions on behalf of his client will be filed in due course.
The Magistrate announced that she would make an appropriate order on the next inquiry date after inspecting both legal and incidental material relevant to the case.
According to a B report filed before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, they have been accused of misusing government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012.
The funds in question had been the allocation for the Kollupitiya Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel, to be constructed by Canwill Holdings Ltd, a company affiliated to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, but had been invested in the Hambantota Hyatt Regency Hotel project.
It is revealed that Canwill Holdings formed two subsidiaries, Sinolanka Hotel and Spa, which was implementing the Hyatt hotel project in Kollupitiya and Helanco Hotels and Spa to carry out the proposed Hyatt hotel in Hambantota.
The re-construction work of the partly build Celestial Residencies building of the failed Ceylinco was then transformed, during the past three years, to build the Hyatt hotel in Colombo. The main land was leased for 99 years from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) after the former Ceylinco property was expropriated by the previous government in 2011 in terms of the provisions in the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilised Assets Act No.43 of 2011.
The prosecution maintained that Canwill Holdings is a state-owned public enterprise, set up during former regime, with Rs.18.5 billion in equity, secured from its major shareholders, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, which has invested Rs. 8.5 billion, and Litro Gas and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) with Rs. 5 billion each.
Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, Anil Silva PC and Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appearing for the suspects had argued that the suspects cannot be charged under Public Property Act citing that the Canwill Holdings is not a state institution.
Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is a company registered under the Companies Act. Money were invested on a contract by several parties, including Canwill Holdings, EPF and Litro gas Lanka company. No offence has been disclosed against the suspects, Mr. Ali Sabry added.
At a previous occasion, Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige ,appearing on behalf of the FCID, denied the claims made by defence that the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is not a state institution. He stated that the company named Canwill Holdings had been formed by first suspect, in his personnel capacity and he is a shareholder of the company.
On November 9, the three suspects appeared before Court as per an undertaking given to the Supreme Court. However, at that time the defence counsel appearing on behalf of the suspects told Court that their clients were not surrendering to Court, but merely appearing for the purpose of making a statement to the FCID.
Senarath and two others had filed three Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order preventing the FCID from arresting them n connection with a magisterial inquiry, under the Public Property Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
This petition is to be taken up for support on November 17.

Greece: Deadly floods hit Mandra, Nea Peramos and Megara

Flash floods caused by heavy overnight rain have killed at least 15 people and caused destruction in central Greece.
The industrial towns of Mandra, Nea Peramos and Megara, west of the capital Athens, were the most affected.
Many of the dead were elderly people whose bodies were found inside their homes, reports say. Fast-flowing torrents of red mud flooded roads.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared a period of national mourning in the wake of the tragedy.
"Everything is lost. The disaster is biblical," Mandra Mayor Yianna Krikouki told state broadcaster ERT.
At least 37 people have been taken to hospital, the broadcaster said, and some are still missing.
Bad weather has hit parts of Greece for about a week, but particularly heavy rain overnight caused the sudden flooding, for which locals said they were unprepared.
The force of the water moved vehicles, damaged walls and roofing, and left many homeless as their homes flooded to a life-threatening level.
By Wednesday afternoon, Greece's fire service said it had received over 600 calls for help and dispatched almost 200 firefighters in 55 vehicles to the towns, which have a combined population in the tens of thousands.
"The water came down the mountain, millions of tonnes," Stavros Fotiou, the deputy mayor of Nea Peramos, told ERT.
"Our roads are completely destroyed... 1,000 homes have been flooded, that's a third of the town," he added.
The region's deputy governor, Yiannis Vassileiou, told the broadcaster that emergency services had been prepared for poor weather, but then "the Niagara Falls came down and could not be stopped".
Prime Minister Tsipras said that declaring a period of national mourning was "the least we can do".
He also vowed to provide aid to the victims and ensure they were housed safely.

GSP Plus boosts SL apparel exports to EU by $1.67 bn
GSP Plus has delivered its most prominent success for Sri Lankan exports to-date since its announcement, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the launch event of the third edition of Intex South Asia 2017 in Colombo yesterday.
As a result of regaining GSP Plus, our apparel exports from January to September this year has increased by 11.3% to US $ 1.67 billion, the Minister said.
It is also an indication of how we are integrated to the global trading system. SL apparel industry is important for our economy and is important for integration of Sri Lanka with the global trading system and the rest of South Asia. But there is more to be done. There are many opportunities in the value chain in the region that we have not taken. This type of events will lead to closer integration with South Asian countries.
Our apparel exports to EU have increased by only 2% from January to September 2016 in comparison to the same period in 2015. After receiving EU GSP Plus, our apparel exports to EU from January to September this year compared the same period last year at US $ 1.5 billion, has increased by a huge 11.3% to US $ 1.67 billion.
Even though US market is not connected to EU GSP our apparel exports to US too has increased this year by 12% to $ 1.8 billion (in January to September). I am also pleased to say that our overall apparel exports to all countries this year from January to September increased by 13.4% to US $ 3.97 billion in comparison to the same period last year at US $ 3.5 billion. We believe this growth trend would continue and therefore expect even better performance next year.
In 2016, Sri Lankas apparel exports were at US $4.86 bn, claiming 43% of total Sri Lankan exports basket of that year.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called for more events like Intex as a way for Sri Lankas integration with the region. Intex is the largest textile sourcing exhibition in the region, said PM Wickremesinghe. Having completed two previous fairs in 2015 and 2016 in Colombo, Intex has now become the largest and sole international textile sourcing event in South Asia for yarns, apparel fabrics, and accessories.

Guru Prathibha  Prabha at BMICH
A heart touching video titled Guru Panduru was shared extensively on social media recently. Inspired by a true story, the video was conceptualized by Rainco as a tribute to Teachers to coincide with Guru Prathibha Prabha, the National Felicitation Ceremony for Teachers.
The event was held recently at the BMICH with the attendance of the Speaker Deshabandu Karu Jayasuriya as the Chief Guest along with the Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan.
Organized by the Ministry of Education, the National Felicitation Ceremony Guru Prathibha Prabha aims to pay tribute to those special teachers we encounter, who have made a lasting impression on our lives. It is a ceremony of ovation for teachers who have contributed to enrich lives of students in remarkable ways.
Four hundred teachers, principals and pirivena lecturers representing educational institutes were felicitated at the ceremony.
It has been an honour for Rainco to be associated with Guru Prathibha Prabha, which felicitates teachers,an idea close to us as a brand and core-product.
Teachers play an important role in nurturing our future generation, but there are no large scale events where they are recognized for their silent services.
A childs mind is molded, not only through the lessons they learn in the classroom, but also the lessons of humanity, compassion, respect and creativity. It is the teachers who are mainly responsible in inculcating these into a young mind.
In the words of Michael Marpurgu It is the teacher that makes the difference, not the classroom, commented Rainco Private Limited, CEO, Aroos Ahmed.

HAMBANTOTA PORT PAYMENTS speeded up
The Government will sign an additional agreement to amend the payment clauses of the Hambantota Framework Agreement with China Merchant Port Holding Company Ltd (CMPort).
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara addressing the weekly cabinet media briefing yesterday said the government reopened negotiations with the company to fast track payments and they have agreed to the governments request. The Framework Agreement signed on July 29, 2017 has the Chinese company purchasing a 70 percent stake in the Port at a cost of USD 1.1 billion on a 99 year lease. The Concession Agreement for the Port on a public-private partnership was between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Government of Sri Lanka, CMPort, Hambantota International Port Group and Hambantota International Port Services Company.
According to the agreement, all condition precedents have to be fulfilled by parties within 180 days from the date of signing but the takeover was delayed due to the decision taken by the government to renegotiate the payment tranches.
CM Port through its affiliate has already paid the security deposit pursuant to the signing of the Framework Agreement, a sum of USD 5 million, and is being held in an escrow account jointly maintained by CMPort and the Ports and Shipping Ministry Secretary.
Earlier it was agreed that pursuant to the signing of the Agreement, the security deposit shall be transferred to the Ports Authority as the first portion of the Tranche on the effective date of the agreement. In addition it was agreed to pay 10 percent of the investment value (Tranche 1) within one month after the signing of the agreement, 30 percent after three months of signing (Tranche 2) and the remaining 60 percent within six months of signing (Tranche 3).
This agreement has now been amended to have 30 percent being paid on the date of signing, 10 percent after a month since signing and to pay the remaining 60 percent within six months of signing.
Accordingly the joint venture company between CMPort and the Government will take over the activities of the Port on December 8. Flashback: Officials exchanging the agreement in July.

Importance of accreditation for environmental conservation
Accreditation is a third-party attestation associated to a conformity assessment body conveying formal demonstration of its competence to carry out the tasks of conformity assessment. Simply, accreditation seeks for the ability of individuals/organisations in applying knowledge and skills on their respective fields.
Accreditation body is an organisation that provide oversight to organisations, by assessing them against international voluntary standards such as ISO/IEC 17020 (Specific requirements for the competence of bodies performing inspection and for the impartiality and consistency of their inspection activities), 17021 (Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems), 17025 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories), 17065 (Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services) etc. This process reduces risk for environment and sustainability goals by assuring them that accredited organisations are competent to carry out the work they undertake.
Effective environmental management system
The role of accreditation has been such diversified as it has expanded its roots into deep in our society. Protection or rather conservation of environment is also one such area where accreditation has made an influence. Out of many approaches, environmental certification schemes is a strong tool that has been widely used for environmental conservation. All such schemes attempt to provide organisations with an effective environmental management system to help them to achieve environmental and economic goals. The current high levels of resource utilization often leads to the degradation of land and pollution of the natural environment. The aim of the move towards sustainable development is to ensure the availability of natural resources for future generations. Within environmental certification the life cycle approach is often adopted, where the life cycle of the product from its production to its disposal are followed to ensure that it is produced, used and disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally sound way. There is increasing pressure on companies to respond to environmental pressure from stakeholders, therefore increasing the use of voluntary environmental regulations such as certification to achieve sufficient social legitimacy and to protect their profits.
Some of the leading certification and verification schemes involved with environmental conservation are Carbon Trust Standard, Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, Forest Stewardship Council, ISO 14001, ISO/IEC 14065, MCERTS. These schemes are mainly focusing on Energy usage and greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions, Water usage management and effluent, Waste management and disposal, environmental performance, responsible international forest management and ensuring sustainable chain of custody, implementation of an Environmental Management System, emissions to air etc,.
The importance of accreditation begins with certification schemes like above where the competency of personal who provide certification under various schemes are assessed. Availability of a certification body that has been accredited has proven that it complies with best practice. It is competent to deliver a consistently reliable and impartial service which meets the appropriate, internationally-recognised standard.
When a particular organisation related to environmental conservation applies for accreditation that will be assessed on the qualifications, training and ongoing competence monitoring of staff, technical competency of people that have the relevant experience and sector expertise, independency and impartiality during verification.
Ecologically sustainable development
In many countries, accreditation is not compulsory. However, it is important to keep in mind that the fact that an organisation is not accredited does not, by itself, mean that it is not a reputable organisation. However, many organisations engaged in environmental conservation choose to seek accreditation in order to be able to demonstrate an independent confirmation of their competence and independence. This will automatically upkeep the effort of conserving environment with higher effectiveness and efficiency.
Though, there is not a straightforward relationship of accreditation with the conservation of environment, indirectly it helps for the environment by assisting in the co-operative implementation of national and international environmental responsibilities, provide for the protection of the environment, especially those aspects of the environment that are matters of national environmental significance, promote ecologically sustainable development through the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources, promote the conservation of biodiversity and provide for the protection and conservation of heritage and promote a co-operative approach to the protection and management of the environment involving governments, the community, land-holders and Indigenous people.
