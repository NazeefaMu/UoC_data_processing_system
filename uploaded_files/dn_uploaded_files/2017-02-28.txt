Efficient collection increased excise revenue
The main reason behind the increase in excise revenue during the past two years was rigorous and efficient conduct in collecting excise taxes, Presidential Task Force for Drug Prevention Project Director Dr. Samantha Kithalawaarchchi said.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Governments Information Department yesterday, he said rise in alcohol and cigarettes prices also had directly increased excise revenue between 2015 to 2016. Therefore, saying that rise in excise revenue is a result of the increased consumption of addictive drugs is false, he said.
Speaking at the press conference, Colombo Hindu College Principal T. P. Parameshwaran said the College and Jaffna Hindu College would organise big matches from March 2 to 4 to promote sports programmes free from addictive drugs.
A cricket tournament, a football tournament and a debating competition with the Presidential Task Force for Drug Prevention will be held in this regard, Parameshwaran added.
Hindu College Old Boys Association (OBA) Vice President Dr. Prasanna Warun said a thematic walk would be held prior to the cricket encounter instead of a parade to promote the big match free from alcohol and drugs with the participation of Cricket World Cup 1997 champions.
Dr. Warun said schools in Colombo would be invited to join them to increase ethnic and religious diversity of the participants.
A hashtag will be introduced as Do Sports Not Drugs along with the thematic walk, he added.
Sports is a main mechanism to divert childrens attention from addictive drugs and big matches can be used as a platform to say no to drugs. We will introduce a new big match culture, he said.

Moonlight' wins best picture as Oscars ends in chaos
US: Coming-of-age drama Moonlight won the coveted best picture statuette at Sundays Oscars, but the evening ended in chaos as La La Land -- already the winner of six prizes -- was first mistakenly handed the award.
Until the final minute, the film industrys biggest night had run smoothly, and was marked by plenty of political statements, mainly jabs at President Donald Trump, and light-hearted jokes from host Jimmy Kimmel.
But the epic stumble on the final award was the nightmare Hollywood ending no one wanted to see. Tinseltown legends Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, stars of 1967 crime classic Bonnie and Clyde, were meant to give the best picture Oscar to Barry Jenkinss film, but she mistakenly called it for Damien Chazelles musical.
Scenes of confusion and embarrassment followed after the La La Land crew -- already on stage and delivering speeches -- suddenly realized the mistake and announced themselves that Moonlight had actually won, prompting Beatty to mumble apologies.
The Oscar-winning veteran actor and director, 79, said hed been given the wrong envelope -- the one containing the card announcing La La Land star Emma Stones best actress win. Stone said backstage she had been hanging on to her winning envelope the whole time, although slowed-down footage of the commotion appeared to corroborate Beattys explanation.
Several reports suggested that two sets of envelopes are typically on site during the ceremony -- one on either side of the stage.
This was confusing, obviously, so... we thought he was being coy and cute and milking it but, in reality, he was perplexed by why her name was on it, host Jimmy Kimmel told ABC after the show.
So far, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has not issued a formal statement about the embarrassing mix-up.
Moonlight was a shock winner for best picture, after Chazelles runaway favorite La La Land -- a modern take on the all-singing, all-dancing Golden Age of Tinseltowns studio system -- had taken six prizes for best director, actress, score, song, production design and cinematography. I noticed the commotion and thought something was strange. And then I was speechless by the result, Jenkins, who won earlier for best adapted screenplay, said backstage. - AFP

MR has no connection with Treasury Bond issue
A group of Joint Opposition parliamentarians held discussions with Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday on the alleged Treasury Bond scam.
Opposition Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardane said the JO Parliamentarians had informed the CB Governor that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was being falsely accused in the incident while presenting a bogus gazette notification.
Gunawardane said the CB Governor had told the group that there was no connection between former President Rajapaksa and the Treasury Bond issue.
The meeting with the Governor had gone on for nearly two hours. Apart from Gunawardane, Parliamentarians Dinesh Gunawardane, Dallus Alahapperuma, Prasanna Ranatunge and others had participated.
Gunewardane said the JO team informed the Governor that there was an unacceptable delay in taking action against those accused in the alleged Treasury Bond scam and had requested him to speed up probes conducted by the CB on the issue.

A Sing a long party will come alive with Sam the Man at the Lotus Ballroom of the Grand Oriental Hotel, on March 4 at 7.30 pm.
This Sing a long party is a presentation of the Centenary Group of the Old Boys Association of S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia.
The Centenary Group comprises students who were in College in the year 1951, when the school celebrated its 100th Anniversary. It is the most vibrant group of the Old Boys Association which has undertaken many projects for the Development of the College.
Sam  when he was performing at the Royal-Thomian Dance in London was invited to the Royal Albert Hall for a sing along conducted by Max By graves. It was here that he got the idea of having a similar show here in Colombo.
The very first Sing Along was conducted by Sam at the Galle Face Hotel in 1997. It was a resounding success and thereafter the sing a longs became the order of the day.
Sam in his own inimitable style has developed the sing along to suit international standards. Perhaps this is one reason his presentation has an appeal both here and the international arena.

Academy 'deeply regrets' Oscars best film award fiasco

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has apologised to the casts and crews of La La Land and Moonlight and said it deeply regrets the mistakes that led to Warren Beatty and Faye Dunawayannouncing the wrong film as winner of the best picture award.
In its first statementsince the debacle at the end of the 89th Academy Awards stunned the stars gathered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles and made headlines around the world, the Academy paid tribute to the tremendous grace shown by those involved in both films and acknowledged their experience of the night was profoundly altered by this error.
The statement went on to say thatPwC  formerly Price Waterhouse Coopers, the accounting firm that has been used by the Academy to handle the voting process for 83 years  had taken full responsibility for breaches of established protocols that led to the error.
We have spent last night and today investigating the circumstances, and will determine what actions are appropriate going forward, it said.
PwC,in its own statement, said its staff did not move quickly enough to correct the unprecedented error and placed the blame squarely at the feet of company partner Brian Cullinan, one of two accountants whose job it was to hand out the winners envelopes.
The two partners  Cullinan and Martha Ruiz  each carry duplicate envelopes of the complete set of results, held in the wings at each side of the stage to hand to presenters as they arrive.
PwC said several mistakes were made and that the two partners assigned to the prestigious awards show did not act quickly enough when La La Land was mistakenly announced as the best picture winner.
It took so long for the mistake to be rectified  more than two minutes  that three of La La Land producers had given their acceptance speeches by the time the real winner emerged.
PwC takes full responsibility for the series of mistakes and breaches of established protocols during last nightsOscars, the company wrote. It said Cullinan had mistakenly handed presenters Beatty and Dunaway an envelope for the best actress award, won by Emma Stone for La La Land.
Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr Cullinan or his partner, the statement read.
It did not address in detail which protocols were violated, or say whether a tweet Cullinan sent about Stone before the best picture announcement contributed to the mistake. The tweet was later deleted.
The firm apologised to Beatty, Dunaway, the cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight, the Academy, and host Jimmy Kimmel.
We wish to extend our deepest gratitude to each of them for the graciousness they displayed during such a difficult moment, the statement said. For the past 83 years, the academy has entrusted PwC with the integrity of the awards process during the ceremony, and last night we failed the Academy.
The statement came after aday of speculationabout how the worst gaffe in Oscars history unfolded. The fiasco launched countless punchlines, memes and a probe of what went wrong.
On Monday afternoon, theWall Street Journal reportedthat Cullinan had tweeted a behind-the-scenes photo of Stone holding her statuette. The tweet, sent moments before the best picture announcement, raised the question of whether the accountant was distracted, handing Beatty the duplicate envelope.
Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel used his regular late-night show on Monday to explain how the chaos unfolded, explaining that Beatty had made Dunaway read out the winner because he was worried it might not be right.
Clyde threw Bonnie under a bus; it was a slick move, he said.
Kimmel said he had been just as confused as everyone else on stage. Who the hell knows whos who from each movie, he said. Im feeling bad for these guys and also trying really hard not to laugh.
Kimmel said he spent the rest of the evening answering questions about the fiasco and insisting it was not an elaborate prank.
If I had pulled a prank it wouldnt have just been the wrong winner in the envelope, it would have been a Bed Bath and Beyond coupon or something. It was not a prank.

Afghanistan roll over Zimbabwe for 54 to seal series
Afghanistan's bowlers combined to roll Zimbabwe over for 54, helping the visitors seal a 3-2 series win with a 106-run D/L victory in the final ODI in Harare.
Afghanistan elected to bat and were provided a brisk start thanks to opener Noor Ali Zadran's 49-ball 46, even as Zimbabwe got regular breakthroughs early on. Noor Ali eventually fell at the end of the 15th over, a wicket that put the brakes on Afghanistan's momentum as captain Asghar Stanikzai and Rahmat Shah tried to steady the innings from 85 for 3.
The pair put on 39 off 64 balls, which was followed by a fifth-wicket stand of 35 between Shah and Samiullah Shenwari. After Rahmat reached his fifty, both he and Shenwari were run-out as Afghanistan found themselves at 172 for 6 at the 40-over mark.
Allrounder Mohammad Nabi then batted with the lower order, hitting four fours and a six in his 48 off 40 balls. Dawlat Zadran hit 14 off 6 balls to lift them to 253 for 9. Medium-pacer Chris Mpofu finished with figures of 3 for 46 while the spin duo of Graeme Cremer and Sean Williams kept things tight and conceded a combined 74 in 20 overs.
Zimbabwe's response was delayed by rain and a wet outfield, leaving them with a revised target of 161 off 22 overs. They suffered an early blow, losing Peter Moor in the second over. Three balls later, left-arm spinner Amir Hamza removed Solomon Mire, before returning two more wickets off four balls in his next over to reduce Zimbabwe to 13 for 4.
There was to be no recovery, with only two batsmen getting into double-figures, as Nabi and Rashid Khan - who were both picked up by the Sunrisers Hyderabad at the IPL auction earlier this week - took combined figures of 5 for 22. Rahmat was named Man of the Match for his fifty.
Scores:
Afghanistan 253-9 in 50 overs (Rahmat 50, Nabi 48, Mpofu 3/46)
Zimbabwe 54 in 13.5 overs (Nabi 3/14, Hamza 3/20)

To align SECs regulatory framework with international benchmarks: New SEC Act ready in third quarter
The new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Act is expected to be passed by Parliament in the third quarter of this year.
Speaking at the South Asian Federation of Exchanges (SAFE), seminar held at the Colombo Stock Exchange, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Tilak Karunaratne Karunaratne said the Act to be passed will align SECs regulatory framework with international benchmarks and will include provisions to enable the licensing and regulation of a Demutualised Exchange.
In this process, we will focus on governance arrangements as the primary means of ensuring Stock Exchanges have robust arrangements for maintaining a proper balance between the commercial interests and its regulatory responsibilities.
Moreover, after Demutualisation, stock exchanges evolved into profit seeking commercial enterprises which will explore arrangements to establish global alliances to remain profitable and internationally competitive, he said.
He said that for that reason, there is a need towards greater integration of markets where there are no barriers to the movement of capital and there is easy access to each others stock markets.
Noting that fair and efficient functioning of exchanges is of significant benefit to the public, he pointed out that failure of an Exchange to perform its regulatory functions properly can have a far reaching impact on the economy as a whole. Regulatory functions of traditional Exchanges include rule-making in respect of members, products and trading itself. But as Exchanges move from mutual entities to for-profit enterprises, as most of you have already done, they can create a number of challenges in respect of the regulatory roles the Exchanges perform.
These concerns include the compatibility of for-profit operation of Exchanges with public interest objectives to the adequacy and efficiency of regulation.
Commenting on regional capital markets activities, Karunaratne said the removal of controls on capital transactions within the region, harmonization of capital market infrastructure including regulations, taxation, accounting, trading systems and cross-listings of securities are necessary steps to move towards regional financial integration.
Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and South Asian Federation of Exchanges (SAFE), Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka speaking at the event noted that capital markets in the region are significantly evolving and at the same face the challenges of making them more viable and competitive with well developed capital markets in the world.
He also added that the SAFE event in Colombo could be better utilised to foster collaboration and to accelerate development in the regional capital markets.

The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is to go before Court, challenging the report of the Delimitation Review Committee.
ACMC General Secretary S. Subairdeen told the Daily News that a court case would be filed no sooner the Gazette notification on the Delimitation Report comes out.
He said the ACMC felt representation of the Muslim population would be very badly affected in the way the new boundaries of wards are demarcated. 
We are losing our legitimate representation in the local authorities. The new delimitation boundaries they have drawn - the Muslim majority areas may become diluted. Therefore we have consulted our lawyers to file a case in this regard, he said.
He pointed out the total number of LG members would rise to 11,000 as of the new electoral system, adding that this would lead to unnecessary expenses, not in proportion with our economic system.
He stated that the ACMC would go before the court first and that other small and minority parties are expected to follow suit because they too have the same grievances.

The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for written submissions on April 6, the appeal filed by Attorney General against the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder were not sufficient. When the appeal application came up before Court of Appeal Justices Deepali Wijesundara and Lalith Jayasuriya both accused appellant and respondents were directed to file thier written submissions before April 6.
Four convicts former Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Sampath Chandrapushpa Vidanapathirana, Lahiru Kalum, Saman Deshapriya and Prageeth Chaturanga who were found guilty of killing British tourist Khuram Shaikh in December 2011 and for raping and brutally assaulting his fiance while holidaying at the tourist resort of Tangalle were sentenced by the Colombo High Court.
While requesting to amend the punishments given to the convicts, the AG also suggested that these convicts should be given death sentence or life imprisonment as they committed the murder using weapons as members of an unlawful assembly. Through this appeal, the Attorney General maintained that the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder were not sufficient.
The petition also noted that the Judge had reiterated that fourth accused in the unlawful assembly had used a firearm and that in cases of unlawful assembly an offence committed by one applies to all in the group.

B.L. DOliveiras cricket could never have reached first-class status and quality had he not left his native land, states J.M.Kilburn, in his book titled Overthrows.
As a coloured South African DOliveira was debarred, under apartheid law from South African national teams containing white players, points out Kilburn. The principle of separate development determined his boundaries.
DOliveira rose to county and international cricket in England, by bringing raw talent and uncommon resolution. He justified himself and his advocates and after six years at league and county level he played for England, thereby stirring implications too intriguing to be overlooked recalls Kilburn.
The possibilities simmered for two years. DOliveira stayed in the England team through 1967-68. MCC were to send a side to South Africa. Kilburn recalls that on estimates of cricketing ability DOliveira was a candidate for this team, but not an unquestionable selection. Neither his medium pace bowling nor his middle order batting had found much success in the West Indies nor after England had been heavily defeated in the opening match against Australia, DOliveira was not invited to the second third and fourth Tests. Early season speculations over consequences of DOliveira as an England player in South Africa had largely withered when the prospects for the tour were being discussed in mid August. Any awkwardness seems to have settled itself, purely on playing considerations.
In a week the whole situation turned turtle states Kilburn. DOlveira was brought into the Oval test as a substitute, played an innings of 158, took a timely wicket in a dramatic English victory and so restored himself to the sporting headlines of the world.
Kilburn states that at the appointed hour the touring team for South Africa was announced without DOliveira. Reception was predictably controversial and impassioned. The selectors were accused of either political cowardice or myopic cricketing judgment; they were alternatively; commended for diplomatic discretion or balanced assessment of evidence derived from more than one match. There was a case for choosing DOliveira; there was a case for omission. As a player he has risen to a specific occasion; as a player he has been unsuccessful on tour in the West Indies and had not held an England place throughout the latest Test series. Hard luck Dolly summed up Kilburn.
We in Sri Lanka are fortunate that our cricketers are not judged by the colour of their skin. They come in all hues and there are no issues.
I have had this experience firsthand by being to countries like England, Switzerland, Jamaica and Australia for lengthy stays and played cricket at different levels. I resided in England from the late sixties to early eighties, and came across discrimination in finding digs and also getting employment where my batch mates who were of course a lighter shade of pale got jobs with lesser qualifications. I also experienced reverse discrimination because my better half then was a Swiss national and we used to visit a famous pub called Swiss Cottage. I was targeted by the Jamaicans, the Indians and a few Sri Lankans as well in that cozy old pub; at times the so called barracking was below the belt. All this was not exactly due to discrimination but because of jealousy of me for bagging a white woman.
In Switzerland we were in Geneva and we hardly came across discrimination but there was an interesting incident where I had to stand outside a boys school in St Gallen, this was where my then wifes home town was, suddenly a bell rang and kids of the ages between 10 and 12 poured out of the school gates and suddenly they saw this brown man standing and two of the more adventurous ones came and one held my hand firmly and the other started rubbing my hand vigorously, after some time the boy who was involved with the rubbing looked at his mates quite alarmed and yelled in Swiss German, the English meaning of it is as follows Hey it wont go thinking that I have painted my skin brown, the upshot of it was that they have never seen people of different hues. Can you blame them In Jamaica of course I was discriminated thinking that I was an Indian, so they referred to me as a Cooley man . At that time in the eighties in Jamaica I was working at the Scientific Research Council. And about 30% of the Jamaicans were of Indian origin, I found them to be nice and meek in comparison to the Indians in Trinidad and Guyana. The Aussies were the friendliest of the lot.
So it takes all sorts to make a world.

CA overrules preliminary objections by Gnanasara Thera; case fixed for argument

The Court of Appeal today (28) decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet filed by Attorney General over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court amounts to Contempt of Court on January 25, last year.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice (President) Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena fixed the matter for argument on May 16.
When the charge sheet was read out before Court of Appeal, Gnanasara Thera informed Court that he was not pleading guilty to the charges.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence, which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address open court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court.
He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

Cabello to perform at Kids Choice Awards
Camila Cabello will hit the stage with rapper Machine Gun Kelly at the upcoming Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards for her first big performance since quitting Fifth Harmony.
The 19-year-old walked away from the hit girl group in December, and made her live debut as a solo artist with a set on Americas The Ellen DeGeneres Show in late January.
Now Camila is preparing to perform one of the tracks she played then, Bad Things, at the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards in California on 11 March, reports People.com.
She originally released the song with Machine Gun Kelly in October, when she was still a member of Fifth Harmony.
Camila could very well come face-to-face with her former bandmates at the Kids Choice ceremony as the new quartet is nominated in the Favorite Song category for their hit Ty Dolla $ign collaboration, Work From Home.
They will also be hoping to secure the Favorite Music Group prize for the second year running after taking home the same accolade last year (16).
Camila recently revealed she hasnt heard from remaining members Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane, Lauren Jauregui, and Ally Brooke Hernandez since her exit, despite her efforts to reach out.
I dont want to get into the details of that (their strained relationship), because it was really intense and its hard for me to talk about, she admitted to Billboard magazine. It makes me sad.
She continued, I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.
The girls fell out after the bandmates released a statement suggesting Camila had informed them she was moving on via her representatives, prompting the singer to fire back, insisting the other four girls were well aware of her plans to go solo.
I did not intend to end things with Fifth Harmony this way, she added at the time.

Question of legality
A prominent government minister recently claimed that the Malabe Private Medical College has earned the legal status. The minister added that the much-spoken institute is an approved entity of the University Grants Commission. All this had come to pass during the previous regime under the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidency.
If the minister speaks truth, the SAITM is a legal entity. But then why is this so called Joint Opposition creating a great fuss about an institute already established as a legal entity during their regime Is it merely a measure taken to counter good policy measures of the incumbent government
The good minister offers a valid argument. If there are hundreds of private institutions affiliated foreign university bodies in Sri Lanka, then what is wrong with the SAITM Of course a poor student cannot afford overpriced rates offered at the SAITM. However, the rich students are anyway blessed with the opportunity to study abroad. Such students will get an opportunity to study in Sri Lanka. So you would not get the hard earned monies flowing out of Sri Lanka. So why not make SAITM a private medical college as a place for students who can afford to pay the expensive rates This is a democratic country, after all.
What an average medical student does is they opt for private practice. Most doctors are hell-bent on money-making. Mind you, these students have studied from the tax money. At least the SAITM students are learning from their own funds. So they have every right to opt for private practice and earn millions.

Crown eye shadow is in vogue
Made popular by German makeup artist Swetlana Petuhova and America-based makeup artist Marissa Melhorn, the crown makeup trend is now seeing beauty daredevils crafting delicate tiaras on their eyelids using eye shadows and topping them with bling for extra regality.
Crown makeup does not need to be relegated to your eyelids. Some people are accenting their brows with the royal emblem. Instagram user Cassisel is doing her own versions, by making crown makeup go beyond her eyes, and extending it to her forehead with glitter.
City-based makeup artist Kulsum Parvez said, Though it is artistically beautiful, it is unrealistic as you just cant wear it in your daily lives. I would suggest it for fancy concept parties on occasions like Valentines Day or Halloween. Make sure you have a steady hand, or ask your friend to do it for you. You can glam it up with the use of glitter and crystals. The Times of India

All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way - Leo Tolstoy
Gamini is an inveterate day trader. He buys small quantities of shares at the stock market hoping that the price will move up during the day, enabling him to sell before the market closes in the afternoon, at a profit. For example, he may at 10 a.m. buy 5,000 shares of stock X at Rs. 20. By 2 p.m. Stock X may reach Rs. 22. He will sell at that point, with a profit of Rs. 10,000 minus the brokerage on the transaction.
Of course, everybody knows that trading in securities is not as simple. More often than not, the stock picked by Gamini ends up lower than the morning price. Yet he will sell the stock and use the money to buy another stock the next day. There have been days when Gamini made impressive profits. On such days he is jaunty, boastful; suggesting that his winnings were due to clever stock picking and market timing. But most times, the stock ends up flat or lower. Gamini then goes quiet but is already thinking of his buy for the next day. It is said that a gambler is a person who makes his living out of hope. The hope of eventual profit, keeps Gamini going.
In his working days Gamini had been a senior executive in the private sector. Upon retirement he found time hangs heavy on him and decided on becoming an investor in the stock market, mainly to keep himself occupied, I suspect. He only invests small amounts, less than Rs.50, 000 at a time. I am not certain whether he is ahead in his investments but it seems unlikely for him to have done well in our somewhat topsy-turvy market.
Investor confidence
After a prolonged state of depression, for a few days last month our stock market picked up sharply. I met Gamini on one of those days. He had done well the previous day and was happy. I asked him what in his opinion made the market suddenly go up.
I cannot tell. Our market is not based on any rationality. The only positive news I have heard is that our Prime Minister has been awarded an honorary doctorate by an Australian University. Maybe, that this bolstered investor confidence. Whatever the reason, I am very happy about market these days.
It seems extremely irrational to lay the credit for a market upswing on the awarding of an honorary doctorate on the Prime Minister. Where there is no rational explanation for the happenings, events and developments in a country, it is not uncommon for the people to look to the irrational.
We both being non-academic types had no interest in further exploring the merits of the award by Deakin University to our veteran politician for his achievements in public life. Deakin University in Victoria, Australia is a world away from our life experiences. However, it made me wonder what the reaction of the Australian Prime Minister (and public) would have been had one of our universities, say Sri Jayewardenepura University, deemed it ought to reciprocate the honour. It would have not been too difficult to find merit in the Prime Minister from down under; Australia scoring very high in indexes such as quality of life, perception of corruption (the absence of it), integrity of systems, democratic political culture and so on; the politicians or the culture have obviously got certain things right there.
But such a move by the University in suburban Colombo to turn Malcolm Turnbull into Dr. Malcolm Turnbull would have been met with incredulity in Canberra, as a tasteless attempt at patronizing. A funny situation of a recipient race, assessing the aid giver; a target country for desperate immigrants being recognized by the country they run away from!
Good wine needs no bush, they dont need our praise.
Presently, in little Sri Lanka, it seems there are doctors and doctors; and there is no getting away from them.
In the second class of doctors, we have those with degrees in Western medicine and registered to practice as such. Where this form of medical care evolved, the courtesy title Dr is widely accepted as a form of addressing medical practitioners.
Medical practitioners
However, the first official recognition of Doctor being applied as a title to medical practitioners, regardless of whether they held a doctoral degree was in 1838, when the Royal College of Physicians resolved that it would regard in the same light, and address by the same appellation, all who have obtained its diploma, whether they have graduated elsewhere or not.
To put this (1838) in historical perspective, it is useful to remind ourselves of the fact that the Colebrook Cameron Commission reforms (1831-2) which set us on the journey from the old to the new were only a few years before. In the view of the Colebrook Commissioners the old Rajakariya system in the island tied the people to the land and could not change their occupations and therefore could not take to new crafts or new types of work. Even the practice of native medicine, was a family tradition.
In England, like the Thames, the medical profession flowed forward. The Medical Act of 1858 made it illegal for anyone not qualified in medicine to use the title Dr. A forward looking people keep changing and improving. While various changes were being made to the formalities of address, the substance, the quality of its medical services kept advancing, acquiring an international repute. Today there are many medical schools in the United Kingdom, most private and fee levying. But the English, the institution builders that they are, have maintained high standards, with regulatory bodies that would not let their guard down.
One time, Londons Harley Street was synonymous with the best medical services available in the world. One may pay lip service to an idea but it is with your feet that the real voting takes place. In the past, almost all our rich and famous went to London for medical attention. London was the chosen destination of DS Senanayake, our first Prime Minister, whenever he felt like a medical check-up. This was followed by most of his successors in politics, including NM Perera the Trotskyite. By the way, an educational qualification from England was open sesame to any Sri Lankan institution; social, political or economic. In the former colony, there were no counter values that could substitute effectively. Since of late, other international medical centres have come in vogue, America, Australia and of course Singapore leading. Primarily, the credit for these developments should go to private sector initiatives and of course the supportive vision of the respective governments of those countries. Even when one of our young cricketers pulls a muscle badly, it is to Australia that he will go for help. Today, almost anybody with the means will fly to Singapore even if the ailment is of a minor nature. It is said that you can meet more Sri Lankan politicians at Singapores up-market Mt Elizabeth Hospital than at our Parliament library.
Recently, one former Health Minister took ill and was flown immediately to Singapore, You cannot take a chance on these things No! The Minister had more than one hundred visitors from Sri Lanka at the bedside during his stay at the plush hospital. Only last week there was a news item that even our hard working Defence Secretary was flown to Singapore for medical attention. He by no means looks like a person who blindly follows anything foreign. But when a person is unwell, surely he is entitled to the best attention that is available in the world.
Medical colleges
There is no denying that the greatest hope of the vast majority of our doctors and even present medical students would be that one day their children would have the opportunity to study in a Western country, still better, live there; an opportunity denied to the father by circumstances.
It is argued that the medical degree awarded by SAITM, a private medical school, is not up to the required standard while the degree awarded by the government run medical colleges are of a high standard. With the former assertion, we can sympathize; after all there is hardly any institution or idea that has not been degraded or diminished in this country. We cannot trust that just one institution, whether it is SAITM or any other, can buck the trend in a sea of corruption and decay.
However, as to the latter assertion about high standards, the sample group; those who seek treatment from the doctors produced by our medical colleges, are handicapped, as they can only speak of one category of doctors. Perhaps, we should ask those who have had the experience of receiving medical care from two systems, Sri Lanka as well as Singapore, for their comparative assessment. Here, we have the advantage of having a large sample group: a former Health Minister, a Defence Secretary and many other politicians and business magnets.
Tolstoy thought all happy families are alike; while each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Perhaps, each unhappy nation is also unhappy in its own way.

Drug peddling around leading schools in the Matale district has become a great cause for concern. Parents allege that although the authorities are aware of the situation they are silent and no action is being taken to curb the situation.
Organised gangs are involved in this racket and engage in distributing drugs secretly targeting students in higher classes. Some students are also involving to distributing drugs.
Ganja mixed Mawa, Babul, Madanamodaka and tobacco powder are among the drugs being sold.
Parents are fearful that if this situation is not brought under control, their children will fall prey to the drug menace. They urge the authorities to take action to arrest those responsible for selling drugs to these school children and save the children from being lured into the drug habit.

Epithet in praise of C. P. DE SILVA
TITLE: C. P. DE SILVA THE MINNERY DEVIYO SO CLOSE AND YET SO FAR
AUTHOR: DR. WIJEYADASA RAJAPAKSHE
PUBLISHER: S. GODAGE & BROTHERS (PVT) LTD
The splendid book entitled: C. P. de Silva - The Minnery Deviyo  So close and yet so far - was launched on March 30, 2015 in presence of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe gracing this momentous occasion.
The biographical study of C. P. De Silva, that charismatic political leader, statesman of par excellence of the yester year, has revived the interest of Sri Lankan in all walks of life those who yearn and vie for a new political culture in the country.
I read and re-read the English and Sinhalese edition of this opus. (My interest to this book was drawn to by a son of soil from Welitara, Buddhika de Zoysa, the Assistant Registrar of the Land Registry Colombo. I owe him much for arousing my intellectual curiosity and the stimulating discussions I had with him in writing this review.)
The authors preface says that: Great men like C. P. De Silva left their footprints on the sands of time. But I feel that those footprints are now getting erased either by ignorance or by design.
This reviewer ventures to place on record that the footprints that left by CP is effaced due to both elements of ignorance and also by design. Most of the pen sketches or thumbnail impressions written on erudite men of the past have forgotten this true man of the nation. For e.g. D. B. Dhanapalas Among Those Presents H. A. J. Hulugalles the book on pen sketches, Gunadasa Liyanages Me Kauda (Who is this) (1968) 2014.
Therefore all the avid readers owe a deep debt of account to Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe for venturing into this path breaking study on C. P. de Silva whose life as would make our lives sublime and for resurrecting him from the deep oblivion or from the abyss of despair. The learned writer would have received the inspiration for this unenviable task from his elder brother who served the minister in the capacity of a secretary.
Political biographies in Sri Lanka are indeed very rare. Prof. K. M. De Silva and William Howard Higgins the biography of J. R. J. is in two volumes, Premadasa of Sri Lanka by Bradman Weerakoon in another biographical account which led to a controversy to write under a pseudonym K. T. Pereras Premadasa of Sri Lanka  what Bradman did not say. Chandrika Kumaratungas authorized biography by Graeme Wilson published by Media Prima 2014.
Political culture
There biographies immensely contribute to the development of the political culture. I congratulate Dr. Rajapakshe for shouldering this onerous task in compiling this biography on CP. In recent times we saw two other interesting research accounts Dr. A. P. De Zoysas biography by his daughter Dr. Kumari Jayawardene in 2012 Sanjeev publishers, who also hailed from Randombe like C. P., the other book is on P. De S. Kularatne by Kamalika Pieris 2015 published by Sarasavi Publishers.
This reviewer wishes to make certain comments on this opus. At page 16 of the book Dr. Rajapakshe provides a photograph of the parents of C. P. de Silva, Charles Reginus de Silva his father was a Proctor and a Notary Public in Balapitiya. The reviewer wishes his ge name and the mothers ge name would have been included as they are of the Salagama caste clan from Randombe. This reviewer has enabled to discover the birth certificate bearing No. 1295 where his ge name is found as Nallahandi.
CPs mother is Obinamuni Adelin de Silva who was one of the founders of the Museaus College, Colombo 7 and aunt of late Dr. Colvin R. de Silva.
His father C. R. de Silvas name is enlisted in C. Arsaratnams Hand Book of the Supreme Court of Ceylon, Ceylon Daily News Colombo 1929 at page 158 as a practicing Proctor in Balapitiya out of the 13 Proctors, enlisted therein.
At page 35 of his book Dr. Rajapakshe states that the Sir John Kotalawalas claim for his premiership after the death of D. S. who earned the honorific epithet Father of the Nation was borne by the book Premier Stakes the authorship was attributed to Sir John Kotalawala despite his denial An Asian Prime Ministers Story Great Britain, the only autobiography of a Prime Minister in Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka).
This reviewer consulted chapter 10 of this book: Threat of Dismissal in this regard. Page 97-8 of this book it is found where Dudley Senanayake has sought his resignation in view of this publication, where J. L. Kotalawala has not handed over same.
New political party
At page 38 of the book Dr. Rajapakshe at the outset of the chapter 4, the date resignation of then Premier Dudley Senanayake is found as October 13, 1953. John Kotelawala in his autobiography (supra) at page 106 it is found as 12th of October evidently a lapsusclamai or lapsuspennae in Dr. Rajapakshes work.
At page 57 of his book, the anecdote on Sir Oliver Goonetileke is not found in the authorized biography entitled: OEG A Biography of Sir Oliver Ernest Goonetileke by Sir Charles Jeffries.1969 London.
At page 71 of the book Dr. Rajapakshes account on CPs new political party established namely Sri Lanka Freedom Socialist Party which contested the then general election under the symbol sun, where Wijayananda Dahanayake secured the seat of Galle, from his party.
Chapter 14 titled: Salvage of Nindagam Occupants from pages 87  9 has directly dealt with the role of C. P. de Silvas introducing the Nindagam Bill in Parliament on February 25, 1968 culled from evidently the Hansard.
This reviewer wishes, had the esteemed author of the book, explained as to what is a Nindagama it would have not gone the readers astray. S. A. W. Mottau in his Glossary of Terms Used in Official Correspondence of the Government of Sri Lanka, The Sri Lanka Archives Vol. 3 1985  86 vide: at P139is found the Sinhalese word ninda i.e. exclusive possession. He also cites several definitions extracted from DOyly, Dickman, Gunasekera, Fergusons glossary, John Budd Phear, Codringtons Notes on Some Kandy and Chief and Headmen and their dresses 1910. The reviewer has found another reference from Codringtons glossary 1924 vide: at page 46. Also vide: at P 281  2 in Dictionary Law by U. D. J. Jinadasa and Arjuna Udawatta Sarasavi publishers 2008.The Nindagama Lands Act No. 30 of 1968 (Chapter 301) came into force on 12.12.1969 from the Gazette bearing No. 142884.
The act defines the word Nindagama lands but does not contain the origin of the word.
From pages 107 to 118 the author has devoted the chapter 17 on short-lived Memories of People where the sub-titles are on Anagarika Dharmapala the year of arrival of Colonel Olcott and Madam Blavatsky is cited as 1980 it should be read as 1880 (17th of May) and embraced Buddhism at Wijeyananda Temple in Galle. But a contrary view is also found at P72 f.n. 17 Tissa Kariyawasam in his Religious Activities and the Development of a New Poetical Tradition in Sinhalese 1852  1906 Godage publishers 2009.
At page 110 on C. W. W. Kannangara, this reviewer finds an error has seeped in. That is: When he was a student in a lesser known college in Galle Rev. W. J. T. Small who was the principal of Richmond College Galle .. The Chief guests name is not Rev. W. J. T. Small it is Rev. John Hone Darrel (See: Richmond Centennary magazine 1976) Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara was a proctor who later passed out as an advocate like A. K. Premadasa and Arthur Samarasekera. Dr. C. W. W. hailed from Randombe like A. P. De Zoysa and C. P. de Silva.
The reviewer also finds a glaring omission, on Dr. C. W. Ws endeavour to introduce free education he was ably supported by inter alia Dr. A. P. de Zoysa at the State Council vide: Kumari Jayawardane. (supra)
The reviewer sees another lapse that the use of diacritical marks is not found in the Sinhalese words used by the esteemed author on this book on CP. The reviewer does not find any bibliography which would have encouraged further research on this multi-faceted statesman of par excellence. C. P. de Silva was indeed a true son of soil of the nation.
The reviewer wishes if the biographer would have placed on record that C. P. enjoyed the singlehood bliss. He was wedded to the nation for the cause of the needy poor alleviating their poverty- who played an indispensable role in uplifting the standards of villagers.
Election petition
A reported judgement is found in the 67 New Law Reports found pages 569 to 573 pronounced by Justice Sirimanne, K. D. Ramunuwa Vs. C. P. de Silva in 1965 the election petition case No. 40 which was filed against C. P. de Silva for the Minneriya electorate bearing No. 118.
The Petitioner K. D. Pamunuwa challenged the election of the Respondent C. P. de Silva as a member for the electoral district of Minneriya on the grounds of initimation, general treating an alleged failure to make a deposit as required by Section 29(1) of the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council (Chap. 381).
It was held that the preliminary objection should have been taken before the Returning officer in terms of Section 31(1)d and cannot be permitted thereafter by way of an election petition.
The election petition was dismissed in favour of C. P. de Silva with the cost of the suit granted in his favour.
The reviewer could not find the formative years of C. P. de Silva and on his early days of schooling. CP had his early schooling at the Wesleyan Missionary school of Randombe like Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara and Dr. A. P. de Zoysa. This school was the precursor of the Dharmasoka College Ambalangoda. At St. Thomas College Mount Lavinia he won the Gregorys scholarship and also won the coveted Millers award.
The biography by Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is neither an authorized biography nor a conventional political biography detailing chronologically every single event in its subjects life. It is posthumously written after four decades.
It is said that a persons life becomes subject to poetic license at the hands of the biographer. This reviewer finds that Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has judiciously examined the pros and cons of life of the C. P. de Silvas outstanding political career which envisions a coherent society.

Fowler closes out Honda Classic victory
MIAMI: Rickie Fowler, buoyed by a brace of long-range birdie putts, won the US PGA Tour Honda Classic on Sunday with a one-over par 71 in the final round at PGA National.
Key burdie putts of 40 feet and 25 feet helped Fowler overcome two tee shots into the water.
He started the day with a four-shot lead and with five birdies, four bogeys and a double-bogey finished with a 12-under total of 268 -- four strokes ahead of Morgan Hoffmann and Gary Woodland.
My putter saved me, said Fowler, who was in the water off the tee en route to a double bogey at the sixth, and shockingly in the water again off the tee at 17, where he salvaged a bogey.
He dropped another shot at the par-five 18th, where his third shot found a greenside bunker.
Despite the ugly ending, the round saw Fowler win for the first time when holding the 54-hole lead on the PGA Tour, after four prior misses.
His lead had dwindled before he rolled in a 40-footer at the 12th and a 25-footer at the next, and his advantage was up to five strokes when he birdied 16.
Its nice to have a cushion when you are playing the last two holes, Fowler said, adding that the round in breezy conditions wasnt easy.
To go from yesterday, where it was pretty chill out here, not a whole lot of breeze, and good conditions to just go hit golf shots and pick this golf course apart, today was completely different, a lot of crosswinds, he said.
This was a tough wind to play this golf course in. And I felt like I hit some good shots that got just on the wrong side of the wind and didnt come back like I was. Woodland had applied some early pressure, but he finished with back-to-back bogeys to settle for a 69 and a share of second on 272 alongside Hoffmann, who carded a 68.
I gave myself a lot of chances. Just didnt get the putts to come in down the stretch, Woodland said. But obviously Rickie is playing some great golf. So happy with the way Im playing and looking forward to next week. Englands Tyrrell Hatton, who started the day in second place, carded a two-over 72 to finish in a large group sharing fourth on 273.
The group also included Venezuelas Jhonattan Vegas, whose 64 was the best round of the day and included a hole in one at the par-three 15th. AFP

Fragrant glitz!
As the excitement that surrounds Unilevers iconic beauty brand Lux heightens as a result of their latest promotion Lux Suwadaka Siwu Abarana, where Lux consumers now have the opportunity of winning for themselves an exquisitely crafted piece of jewellery that can be worn as it is, or as a pendant, a pair of earings as well as a ring, and whats more it contains a signature fragrance co-created by the winner as well, jewellery designer Harshini and lux master perfumers have added to the magic that is and always will be Lux !
Fragrances tell a story and each ingredient is a character, each note, a word, with the best of fragrances, fine fragrances, evolving as they are immerse into your skin.
Creating the best Lux perfumes ever is a continuing journey of exploration and imagination - because the Lux woman isnt easily defined. To do her justice, you have to find the scent equivalent of her sassiness, her strength says Inura Jayasuriya Brand Manager Lux.
The opportunity for Lux to create perfumes inspired by Sri Lankan women is such a compelling idea, as here, women express themselves so subtly, theres so much under the surface. Theres a wonderful mystery about Sri Lankan women that I think the Lux perfume could do justice to .
Its a chance to feel iconic; only a few women in history have ever had the honour of being captured in scent - Marilyn Monroe, for example said Brand Manager Lux, Inura Jayasuriya. Jayasuriya went on to say that 25 lucky women in Sri Lanka will have the opportunity to become a part of that elite club; namely they will be the owners of the rarest perfumes ever, a piece of beauty history.
Thats the power of Lux , to make you feel limitless, to feel celebrated in every moment, to bloom better than ever before
As for this unique piece of jewellery, designing the jewellery that encases the rarest of perfumes in the world is a tall order! Like the perfumes it will hold, this item of jewellery is an expression of the amazing character of the Lux woman.
It is her timeless charm, her versatility, the way she looks delicate but stays strong, her ability to adapt yet stay true to herself, to play different roles with the same beauty and integrity that this unique piece of jewellery will embody.
The earrings, ring and necklace are all facets of the same core - inspired by French Roses in Lux perfume. They blossom out of golden vines that encapsulate the perfume, and bloom into pieces that adorn your ears, neck and hand. Its a testament to the ultimate Lux woman - who is constantly drawn to the treasures within herself, so she can bring them out and add more value to the world in various ways, says jewellery designer Harshini who has been given the amazing task of designing this iconic piece of jewellery .
Jewellery designer Harshini herself is a former miss Sri Lanka and no novice to the allures of Beauty and femininity that lux embodies in its task of reaching out to all women who are unapologetically feminine.
We hope that with this piece of iconic history, this worlds first jewellery perfume bottle innovation, Lux can inspire that in 25 women. Ignite that moment when she feels she can stop looking elsewhere, and find the confidence she needs from within to be anything she wants to be , said Jayasuriya.
What more could a girl want Surround yourself in all that is magically Lux, as Lux Suwadaka Siwu Abarana creates yet another milestone in Lux unique and star studded history .
So hurry up and send in your Lux wrappers and be a part of the Lux Suwadaka Siwu Abarana promotion, said Jayasuriya.

Glad MR taking advice from Singapore and not Uganda or Swaziland: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said he was happy that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had switched to taking advice from Singapore and not from Uganda and Swaziland anymore.
When I met the Singaporean Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs for dinner on my way back from Australia, the latter informed me that the former President was also there and was leaving Singapore that night, the premier said as he addressed a gathering at the new premises of the Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs at 492, R.A.De Mel Mawatha.
I hoped to meet him on the plane back but unfortunately he took the flight after me. I will tell him in Parliament,the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said that it was important for all to think differently and it was better for the former President too to change his way of thinking. China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia,Indonesia and even Bangladesh changed the way they thought and acted over time and they are progressing. But, we are stuck here, even though the war has ended. This is because we have no national unity. But, we are building on that now, he said.

My sincere appreciation to them and to the dynamic Board of Directors of CCC for their unstinted support and guidance. I would also like to extend my appreciation towards

GMOA Central Province doctors will strike tomorrow
Doctors attached to state hospitals in the Central Province will launch a strike tomorrow from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon in protest of the 'private medical faculty' at SAITM, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said in a statement.
Dr. Zoysa said it is possible the strike would extend to other districts, if the other doctors attached to the GMOA decide to join the strike. This is the fifth in a series of strikes launched by the GMOA in all nine provinces.
The GMOA Secretarypointed out that several protests in the forms of rallies, conferences, hand outs will take place on the same day with the participation of all anti SAITM movements. So far no step has been taken by relevant authorities to solve the SAITM issue and prevent people from undergoing various difficulties, he said.
Dr. Zoysa also said the GMOA was going on strike in order to safeguard patients lives - and not for the benefit of doctors. He said all emergency care, maternity care, pediatric care, kidney treatment, cancer care will not be affected by any of the planned trade union actions.

## Title: GMOA, a willing tool of JO

GMOA, a willing tool of JO
The GMOA, it appears, is hell bent on crippling all government hospitals by its trade union action against SAITM. It is obviously testing the waters for a full blown strike. First, it struck work at the Uva, Southern, North Central and Eastern Province hospitals. Yesterday, it launched the fourth phase in the Wayamba Province.
The signs are all there. Medical students of the state run universities are distributing leaflets in their thousands while candle light vigils too are being held. Which begs the question as to who is funding the whole project The GMOA, for the first time, had resorted to hoisting black flags at government hospitals, demeaning themselves to the level of just another run of the mill trade union.
The doctors agitation against SAITM is bound to dovetail with the signing of the ECTA agreement, slated for April and it is clear that the twin issues are being planned to cause the maximum effect to bring the government to its knees.
Which also begs the question, if the doctors campaign is solely based on altruistic reasons to provide a better health service to the public by opposing the SAITM, which the GMOA claims has fallen short of standards, or is there another motive behind the whole exercise to cause destability in the country and assist in the political project of the governments opponents. We say this based on a newspaper interview given by JO firebrand Vasudeva Nanayakkara that it had targeted toppling the government this year. Asked how they were going to get about this business the maverick politician said that they naturally could not disclose their plans but that the growing dissatisfaction of the people with the government was clearly apparent and they would naturally seize upon the opportunity to bring their plans to fruition.
Obviously, the JO is waiting for the public dissatisfaction to reach a crescendo to seize on the opportunity to topple the government (although how they would get about this business is not clear) and is banking on the creation of the ideal scenario for this dissatisfaction to reach boiling point.
What better way to create such a background by paralyzing the countrys health service and cause the public to direct its wrath against the government and also by drumming up the ECTA goni billa to fever pitch to say that the countys youth will lose their jobs to the Indians who will flood the countrys labour market, with the signing of the agreement. There is no other rationale for the doctors strike. We say this because there was no agitation by the good doctors when SAITM came into being under Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2008. Certainly not the type of protests we see today where the entire academic community has joined in the party to cause the maximum difficulty for the government. No standards were insisted by the GMOA when the Kotelawela Defence Academy was established, at the instance of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and, as Dr. Rajitha Senaratne observed, the inference was inescapable that the good doctors dare not mess around with Gota.
Be that as it may, the SAITM issue had been decided by the Court of Appeal and the doctors who are learned professionals ought to abide by the court ruling. If not, they would be opening the floodgates for lesser minions to disobey legal judgements and take to the streets, throwing open the doors for chaos and anarchy. Or, is this what the GMOA really want

National Freedom Front spokesman Mohammed Muzammil has once against accused the government of a witch-hunt against members of the military intelligence, following the arrest of five Intelligence operatives, including a major, over the abduction and torture of journalist Keith Noyahr. We have been arguing ad nauseam in these columns that fighting in the Eelam war did not give any member of the security forces a license to commit acts of crime. Military personnel are also not immune from prosecution when found out about their involvement in criminal activity.
Muzammil says that the witch-hunt against the military Intelligence officers was carried out to appease the enemies of the state. Is the former MP suggesting that these enemies of the state had planted the evidence that led to the arrest of the military Intelligence officers responsible for abducting Noyahr Is the NFF spokesman denying that there was no Special Unit set up, composed of military operatives, to target journalists, as unraveled by the CID
Let Muzammil be reminded that a soldiers committed suicide, by hanging himself, after writing a letter, begging to exonerate another military colleague taken in, in connection with the Lasantha murder Does this not tell a tale about military collusion in the crime

Government committed to welfare of war heroes: President
The government has taken important steps to cater to the welfare of war heroes and help them win over their rights and privileges during the last two years after coming into power.
Without resting on its laurels the government will do much more to further promote the welfare and the cause of war heroes, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President was addressing a ceremony held at the Sri Lanka Navys Western Command Headquarters at Mullikulam, Mannar to mark the passing out parade and official badging ceremony of the first Naval Marine Battalion held yesterday.
The President said since assuming power the government had taken every possible step to restore the honour and credibility of the Sri Lankan armed forces both locally and internationally.
The government had also restored opportunities for training facilities in developed countries for the armed forces which had been denied earlier.
The United States and the US Navy had now agreed to provide higher technical training for the Sri Lanka Navy.
The President also commended the Sri Lanka Navy for its mission rendered for the motherland during the war and the efforts taken to ensure national and regional security with the use of high technology during the post war period.
The Sri Lanka Navy has for the first time established a marine battalion under the leadership of Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegoonaratne. It joins marine battalions the world over as a nascent marine battalion.
It has a strength of 165 men and officers. The President who watched a mock marine landing and attack on a ground enemy camp staged by the battalion.

He said they maintain the stipulated thickness of the helmet and also cater to not local but to international standards. This is why we were able to get orders from Pakistan for export. He said the HHCO helmets are definitely about the standards not only of Pakistani but also for region and India and Bangladesh.
Today he said that they are clueless as to how the standard for children's helmets are being set. There is no proper guidance and hence we don't manufacture it. But this is a very big lapse as there is no quality set to measure children's helmets putting their lives in danger.
He also said that the decision by the government to ban full face helmets puts the rider in a bigger risk during an accident. We also did manufacture full face helmets according to international standards and due to the ban we are unable to sell them which has made us lose several millions of rupees. Had the government warned us three months before of a ban we would have stopped production.
He said though the there is a ban on the import of helmets.Chinese helmets still invade the market.They are around 30% less than locally manufactured ones but their quality is not up to the specified standard.
He said they had invested around Rs. 70 million so far and employ over 100 staff. Our production has over 95% local value addition.

Horana Rigid tyre factory hangs in the balance...
The Board of Investment (BOI) says that South East Asia's largest, fully integrated, ultra-modern tyre plant Rigid of Italy project in Horana is on and investors have not moved out.
Vignettes of the ground breaking ceremony of the Horana proposed Rigid tyre plant.
The project for which the ground was broken by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in January at the Horana Zone rolling out a blue print for a US$ 75 million investment, is tipped to be the biggest fully integrated tyre manufacturing plant in the whole of South East Asia.
This project will be creating over 3000 job opportunities, both direct and indirect. The selected investor will be required to make a one-time payment of Rs.178 million for the 99-year lease of the 100 acre block of land at Wagawatte in Horana for the construction of a tyre factory and official from BOI said.
We are here to encourage investors and not to drive them away and now we are re looking at this project to iron out any lose ends and see that it gets going again.
The BOI worked out in line with the valuation of the Chief Government Valuer. The statement that the land was given for Rs 100 per acre is incorrect. In fact, the government Chief Valuer had valued the land at Rs 170,825,000 and the investor has agreed to pay the total amount upfront. Rs 10,000 will be charged as an annual nominal fee.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema had earlier said that he had informed both the President and the Prime Minister about the investor of the factory well in advance.
Furthermore, two Cabinet papers i.e. initially one proposing the land and then giving details of the incentives and other terms were submitted on the project and in addition, the project was discussed and endorsed at several meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management.
Meanwhile a spokesman for the investor said that the allocated 100 acre land at Horana, Wagawatte, an Industrial Zone is a bare undeveloped land undulating in most areas. Based on the technical investigations it's noted we have to invest around Rs 300 to 400 million to bring the land to a usable state.
In addition we also have to relay a 3 million cube layer of weak soil which has to be removed throughout 25 acres of the land.
He explained that the BOI is not providing any infrastructure facilities like in other zones. We also have to invest on a waste disposal treatment plant and build all internal roads.
These investments would also be beneficial to other investors who would invest in the nearby area in the future. Hence we are also doing part of the work what the government should have done.
He also said that when the popular Passikudah tourism zone was created by the previous government on an abandoned beach front area sweeping benefits, tax holidays for investors were offered. These drove investors to the war tone and abandoned beach front and today it has over 500 rooms including four star hotels. In addition over 5,000 direct and indirect jobs were created.
Furthermore, a land vested in BOI in Kuliyapitiya was given on a freehold basis to Western Automobile Assembly for a proposed Volkswagen vehicle assembly plant that never got off the ground. The BOI has also granted 357 acres in the same area on a 99-year lease for 1 USD per acre per annum to Merbok, in settlement of a dispute arising from a contract signed in 2000 it was reported in media.
Similar concessions were offered to a garment plant in Vavuniya where over 2,000 new employment was created.In India,in certain States land is given for one Indian rupee per acre per year to attract investors.
The (Foreign Direct investments) FDIs in 2015 was US$ 970 million and in 2016 it was around US$ 450 million, which is extremely low by any standard. The total investment for the Horana project is US$ 75 million and this kind of investments have to be egged on.

Igniting young minds
Sri Lanka needs a boon in technology associated spheres to facilitate the country that is on fast track towards sustainable development. Young and innovative scientists are the backbone of this endeavour.
Our country has been deprived of scientists and innovators over the decades due to brain draining but now we cannot afford to let that happen anymore.
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Research is engaged in a long term program to groom local scientists in a methodological manner. The program spearheaded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under the patronage of Minister Susil Premjayantha is in the process of identifying budding scientists at school level to be groomed as fully fledged scientists.
Scientific projects
Subodhi Institute at Moratuwa glittered with these promising scientists on January 17, 18 and 19. Around 70 Advanced Level students representing 16 schools too part at a residential training program. They were the semi finalists shortlisted from representatives of 800 schools in the preliminary rounds who presented their scientific projects.
Residential training sessions took place with the supervision of the NSF towards identifying innovative scientific projects. Viable and novel scientific projects that are selected and patented would be showcased at the International Science and Engineering Fair aka INTEL ISEF 2017 that will be held in the United States.
Out of 55 research projects presented at Subodhi Institute by the semi finalists, 10 were shortlisted. It is significant that two research projects presented by Dehiwala S de S Jayasinghe Central College students are within the 10 selected projects. Four students who championed the two projects, Ravindra Sankalpa, Mohomad Musthak, Shehan Kavishka and Mohomad Asri, rejoiced by their achievements, spoke to the Daily News.
Mohomad Musthak and Mohomad Asri were the first to speak on their project titled Waste to Wealth. There are acres of lands that are not suitable for cultivation since the compositions of these soils are salty.
Unfertile soil
We submitted a proposal to NSF that carried a biological method to change compositions of such unfertile soil to make them viable for cultivation. The green light was given by NSF with necessary support to carry out the project. Prof Meththika Vithanage at National Institute of Fundamental Studies guided us, said Musthak.
Mohamad Asri spoke next.
After browsing the internet and reading various science books we encountered chemical and physical methods to change the composition of soils. But these expensive methods also have detrimental after-effects such as killing insects living in these soils that are vital to keep the soil alive. Hence we looked for an alternate cheaper method, he said.
We researched for a cost effective and hassle-free method suitable for a developing country like ours. Bio char and compost gave us the solution. Bio-char is a waste product of Thermal Power Plants that come in bulk and compost can be made by any household. We used these two natural attributes and made a solution that can change the composition of salty soil to make it viable for cultivation. It has no after effects too. Our country can use this method to enhance cultivation that will contribute towards the growth in GDP concluded Musthak.
Ravindu Sankalpa and Shehan Kavishka who have championed the second research project, Micro and Nano engineering for Waste Water spoke next. Prevention is better than cure was the theme of our project. It is much better to eliminate the sources of cancer rather than finding cures. One out of seven deaths in the world today are due to cancer.
Nano technology
One major source of cancer is the highly poisonous Cr(V1) aka Chromium Six iron that comes in waste water from factories. We researched to make waste water free of this element, said Ravindu. We made use of secondary data to find necessary information. We used Nano technology coupled with Bio-char to find a magnetic solution to kill Cr (VI) iron in waste water from factories. Prof Meththika Vithanage and Gayani Samarasinghe, our school science teacher guided us towards finding this valuable solution, added Shehan.
These students of Dehiwala S de S Jayasinghe Central College said they are proud to be Sri Lankans. They paid gratitude to their school Principal P P D C Pathirana who gave his blessings and encouraged them to indulge in research studies. Cost effective and hassle free scientific methods such as these would definitely help Sri Lanka boost its productivity. The significance of this event is that such findings are being done by school children.
The Government should invite the private sector to join hands in assisting these resourceful youngsters to excel as scientists by offering them with scholarships.

Jack Mackerel contains nutritional benefits
Gayan Caldera, Marketing Manager FMCG Cluster of Renuka Foods said, Jack Mackerel contains nutritional benefits that makes it special. There is a higher content of Omega 3 fats in the oily meat found in Jack Mackerel.
Omega 3 is a type of polyunsaturated fat that offers great health benefits. Canned jack mackerel is the highest in omega-3 fats of all mackerel fish. One ounce of canned jack mackerel, drained, solids only, provides 385 mg of omega-3 fats. 
Omega-3 fats benefit the heart of both healthy as well as those at high risk ofor who haveheart disease, according to the American Heart Association. It is true that all fish contain some omega-3 fatty acids, but varieties such as Jack Mackerel are particularly rich sources. Jack Mackerel is less expensive than salmon that also contains Omega 3 fats. So therefore the preferred choice in Sri Lanka is Captain Jack Mackerel.
COO of FMCG Cluster of Renuka Foods, Dinesh Nalliah commented as a company marketing Jack Mackerel we take pride in offering housewives in Sri Lanka a popular choice of fish that is both healthy and delicious, which young families readily enjoy. Jack Mackerel has been the most important commercial fish in the world for the past 50 years because it is considered to be better than other Mackerel. Its texture, chunkiness and higher nutritional value has greater appeal among housewives
The versatility of Jack Mackerel is greatly appreciated by Sri Lankan housewives who find it enormously convenient when preparing curries and short-eats, especially Sri Lankas party favourite cutlets.

Japan seeks balance with China in seas around Sri Lanka
COLOMBO -- Japan and Sri Lanka are celebrating 65 years of diplomatic relations this year, but their bilateral ties have rarely seemed more important -- especially in relation to maritime security in the Indian Ocean.
The two countries launched a dialogue on maritime security and other oceanic issues in January, following a 1.83 billion yen ($16.3 million) aid package from Japan in June 2016 designed to boost Sri Lanka's maritime security and crime-fighting capacity.
The Japanese embassy in Colombo said the dialogue was aimed at ensuring that the Indian Ocean remains open, stable and governed by the rule of law. The dialogue has become a wonderful step for developing such cooperation, the embassy told the Nikkei Asian Review.
But analysts say that Japanese strategy in the region is also spurred by worries about the expansive reach of China, which has become increasingly belligerent in maritime affairs. Abhijit Singh, head of maritime policy at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, said Tokyo is certainly concerned about Beijing's growing investment in Sri Lanka and its influence over the government in Colombo.
The last thing Japan would like to see is a Chinese vassal state in the eastern Indian Ocean -- and that, too, so close to the critical sea-lanes, Singh said. It is gradually beginning to take greater interest in hard military security as well, [although] the military aid is presently rudimentary and not on a scale meant to attract undue attention.
For Sri Lanka, foreign assistance is welcome. Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the island state's surrounding seas are 27 times larger than the country itself, so it needs whatever aid it can get to police the area. We require international support from countries such as Japan to secure and strengthen our maritime boundary, as well as strengthen our capabilities in search and rescue, he said in an interview.
People trafficking and drug smuggling are major problems for Sri Lanka, with many undocumented migrants traveling illegally by sea from the island to destination countries such as Australia. Since 2009, Sri Lankan police and the Australian authorities have intercepted 89 vessels transporting more than 4,500 migrants without visas, according to the Sri Lanka police.
Narcotics are also smuggled from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Latin America. In March 2016, drug dealers used fishing trawlers to transport a 101kg consignment of drugs into the country. Later in the year, purported "sugar" containers were seized with huge loads of cocaine from Brazil, according to the Police Narcotics Bureau.
Biggest donor
Apart from marine security, Japan has also been involved in socioeconomic projects in Sri Lanka, including infrastructure improvements and providing access to electricity and clean water. From 2013 to 2015, Japan granted a total of $143.5 million to Colombo for development-related projects. But China remains the biggest donor to Sri Lanka by far.
From 2005 to 2015, China provided $15 billion in official development assistance and foreign direct investment. Beijing also played a major role in providing military equipment to help Colombo fight the militant group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, bringing a quarter-century war to an end in 2009 with the killing of LTTE leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran.
After building a new port, airport and convention center in the city of Hambantota, China is now constructing the $1.4 billion Colombo International Financial City project, the largest foreign-funded investment in Sri Lanka. The offshore project is being built in an area larger than Monaco, and aims to attract more than $13 billion in FDI.
By comparison, $338.4 million in loans promised by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe when Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena visited Nagoya in 2015 is relatively small. The loans are expected to help finance the construction of transmission lines and water facilities in the North Central and Eastern provinces.
However, analysts say that a close relationship with Sri Lanka is essential to Japan. R. Hariharan, a retired military intelligence specialist who also served as the head of intelligence for an Indian peace-keeping force in Sri Lanka from 1987 to 1990, said the country's strategic location makes it an important element in Tokyo's efforts to protect maritime communication routes.
There is an increasing Chinese angle to Sri Lanka-Japan relations, and the maritime security and cooperation [element] has also become an important component of this relationship. Colombo is becoming a frequent destination for the goodwill visits of Japanese self-defense forces and this is also likely to grow in the coming years, Hariharan said.
Since 2009, more than 55 port calls in Colombo have been made by Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and Japan Coast Guard ships.
The Japanese embassy said the Sri Lanka Coast Guard does not have sufficient patrol boats capable of open sea navigation. Those that do exist are deployed off the island's northern coasts, leaving southern and western regions exposed. Japan's 2016 aid package included two patrol vessels and financing for the construction of other vessels and training for coast guard crews.
These measures are expected to contribute to an improved capacity to provide prompt and appropriate marine rescues, prevent smuggling and other marine crimes, and to respond to oil spills from ships, the embassy said.
China is likely to remain Sri Lanka's principal donor, however. Rohan Samarajiva, founding chair of LIRNEasia, a Colombo-based Asian infrastructure policy and regulation think tank, said Colombo would take opportunities offered by China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative to consolidate its trading relationships and channels.
It is important for Sri Lanka to position itself to benefit from Chinese investments and loans, while balancing its traditional good relations with India and Japan, he said. If Sri Lanka does not welcome Chinese investments, they will flow to other locations.

John blasts Education Ministry over putrid Sigiriya toilets
Lands and Tourism Minister John Amaratunge lashing out at the Education Ministry said they are responsible to provide facilities for tourists visiting the Sigiriya rock fortress.
He said that due to Sigiriya washrooms not functioning there were reports to say that tourists were forced to use the jungle to answer calls of nature. The blame for this is now diverted to the Tourism Ministry and I want to categorically state that we are not responsible since we have no say there.
Speaking at the official launch of Sri Lankas first ever crowd sourced destination campaign, Cinnamon Sri Lanka Photo Contest 2017, at the Cinnamon Grand yesterday he said that cultural sites including Sigiriya comes under the management of the Education Ministry.
The Education Ministry also takes all the money generated from entry fees, he said.
He also said that tourism is now moving in an upward trend and they are targeting 3.5 million arrivals this year. This will bring in revenue in excess of US$ 3.5 billion. The revenue in 2016 was US$ 3.2 billion.
He said that this year they are also launching more international promotions.Amaratunge said they hope to attract around 4 million tourists by 2020 and revenue of around US$ 5 billion.
Sri Lanka Tourism Chairman, Paddy Withana said that several new international hotels chains will open in Sri Lanka this year and many more have requested for investment opportunities.
He also disclosed that UNESCO has also identified as the traditional route of Adams Peak as an area heritage and the Tourism hopes to provide market this in future as well.

John Legend has poked fun at the hacker who took over his Twitter account.
The 38-year-old singer uploaded his own messages on Friday (24Feb17) after realising what had happened.
Someone just hacked my account. Im back. My hacker was vulgar and kinda (sic) hilarious. Ill try to be funnier from now on so he wont feel the need to ghost write for me, he joked.
The hacked tweets included vulgarities directed towards Hillary Clinton and President Donald Trump.
I cant stand by and be silent @realDonaldTrump. Youre a b**ch a** n**** and, if I see you, Im stompin your s**t you f**kin cheetoh, the hacker wrote to the 45th President of the United States.
The tweet to Hillary Clinton read, rain drop drop top I want @HillaryClinton to ride my big c**k. Both posts have been deleted from the Oscar winners account.
The singers model wife Chrissy Teigen also laughed off the incident, after one of her followers pointed out Johns bio on Twitter hadnt been changed since the online attack.
Best dm (direct message) of my life, she posted, as she shared a message sent to her showing the All of Me hitmakers bio saying, I have a small penis.
John later went on to defend himself explaining he doesnt wish Trump any harm, even though he disagrees with his controversial policies.
I would never threaten violence to the President. No matter how much I wish he would go away. I wouldnt call him a Cheeto because I enjoy Cheetos, John posted on Twitter.
I did call him a Liar-In-Chief. Then my hacker took over to do the Angrier John version of it all. My hackers assessment of my endowment was confusing. Big in the tweet about Hillary. Small in the bio. Make up your mind, hacker.
John is currently preparing for his performance at the Academy Awards on Sunday (26Feb17), where he will sing a medley of his songs from awards favourite La La Land, which he also starred in.

Joint Opposition trying to incite army coup: UNP

The Joint Opposition is trying to incite an army coup by prorogating falsehood that the government is on a witch-hunt against war heroes, UNP back benchers complained today.
At a press conference at Sirikotha UNP MPs Mujibur Rahman and Wijayapala Hettiarachchi said the Joint Opposition is engaged in a conspiracy to turn the countrys armed forces against the Government through provocation.
They also complained that the series of protests in and around Colombo is an organised attempt by the JO to sabotage the Governments work: We observe the protests blocking the main roads have become a trend in the recent times.
Each day there is a protest at Fort obstructing the routine activities of the commercial hub. These have a huge negative impact on the countrys economy.
We understand that defeated political elements are behind instigating these protests, MP Rahman said.
In the past, the street protests were the last resort when the problems could not be resolved through negotiation. In the recent times, the Government is even unaware of the existence of such a problem as they have not attempted to discuss prior to protesting, he said.
He stressed the Government would be forced to take certain decisions to control these protests, if the trend continues unabated.
The Joint Opposition tries to create an impression among the military and general public that this Government is against the war heroes. This is clearly a political project. They know they cannot grab power through elections. They have no alternatives solutions to the problems the country is facing. Therefore they simply try to sabotage all the Governments work, he said.

Jones says Scotland will have to justify big talk
TWICKENHAM: England coach Eddie Jones tried to get an early blow in against Scotland by questioning whether they could back up their big talk in next months Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham. Joness men remained on course for a second successive Grand Slam with a 36-15 win over Italy at Twickenham on Sunday, after eventually overcoming the Azzurris spoiling tactics of refusing to commit to rucks.
Victory over Scotland in the Calcutta Cup clash on March 11 would see Six Nations leaders England equal world champions New Zealands all-time record of 18 successive wins by a leading rugby union nation.
Scotland, however, are on a roll after beating Wales 29-13 at Murrayfield on Saturday and they have now won two out of their three Six Nations matches this season.
We believe we can beat England if we play like we did in the second half, said Scotland captain John Barclay after his side scored 20 unanswered points against Wales at Murrayfield.
But the fact remains that Scotland have not beaten England at Twickenham since 1983.
Expectations
Were looking forward to Scotland coming down, said Jones ahead of the Triple Crown decider.
Theyre talking big already, theyre on a roll, theyre confident, but theyve got to carry round the expectations now for the whole Scotland nation for the next two weeks before they come down and play us, the Australian added For all the frustration he felt with Italys approach on Sunday, Jones -- yet to lose a match as England coach after he was appointed following the teams first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup -- had no complaints about his sides position.
If you said where we wanted to be at the end of three rounds (of the Six Nations), were exactly there. England, 10-5 down at half-time against Italy, scored five of their six tries in the match after the break and Jones said: Six tries, three wins, a bonus point. Mate, were flying.
More crazy things
Meanwhile Italy coach Conor OShea was proud of the way his side, thrashed 63-10 by his native Ireland in their previous match, had fronted up.
Jones had said he wanted England to take Italy to the cleaners, a point not lost on OShea.
He wanted 70 (points) so he wanted to take us to the cleaners, OShea said.
Is that respect I actually loved it when they kicked for goal as that was a bit of respect and Im gutted that we finished the game off the way we did. OShea said assistant coach Brendan Venter, the former South Africa international and the man who laid the foundations for the current success of English and European champions Saracens, for the tactical plan which so annoyed England.
Sergio Parisse, Italys captain, insisted the Azzurri had done nothing wrong in standing off rucks and trying to block the line of a pass from England scrum-half Danny Care to fly-half George Ford.
We just followed the rules. Obviously its still a defeat for us so we cant be happy for that, but Im really proud of the boys and the team because we are not the same level as England, and we come to Twickenham, and we go into the changing rooms (at half-time) leading in the score, said Parisse.

Lee Hedges drops Rs 2.8 bn Colpetty Mills project
Lee Hedges Investment Ltd, a fully owned subsidiary of Lee Hedges has decided to abandon the idea to build a 15-story mixed development complex in Colombo 3 (Colpetty Mills) with an investment of Rs.2..8 billion.
The company signed an agreement with Board of Investment (BoI) for this project in 2014 March. Eleven investors owing 2.76 million shares have indicated that they disagree with the proposed investment plan and are requesting Lee Hedges to buy their shares.
The company was planning to build on the former Cashew Corporation premises which were taken on a 99 year old lease by the company. The extent of the land is 53 perches.
Lee Hedges told the Colombo Stock Exchange that the total investment in leasing the land was Rs.466.6 million.
The land on which the building is to be constructed was originally owned by Lee Hedges PLC. The land was acquired by the government in 1970 for the Cashew Corporation.

Mentor on Road programme to connect SMEs, Start Ups
The Mentor on Road programme will get off the ground connecting SMEs and Start Ups in 13 days in 28 cities driving through over 1400 kms.
Beginning March 18, Mentor on Road will start its first journey from Colombo, meeting micro, small and medium scale enterprises and business communities in 28 cities of Sri Lanka.It will end on March 30, 2017.
Several industries segregated through clusters would be advised on how to either start business and exports or build on existing businesses or export for higher profits.
MSMEs, Business community, Exports, Impact Investors will be addressed in leg one covering Colombo,Moratuwa, Panadura, Kalutara, Ambalangoda, Hikkaduwa, Galle, Weligama, Matara, Tangalle, Ambalantota, Hambantota, Kataragama, Buttala, Monaragala, Kalmunai, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Pulmoddai, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Anuradhapura, Puttalam, Chilaw and Negombo.
With this vision, the Mentor on Road project will have three bottom lines.They are: Building confidence in the micro and cottage industries by equipping them with low cost tools to start national and global marketing, encourage small industries to work in clusters to form consortia to reach national and global markets and help all stakeholders to receive the most innovative ways and best case practices around the world to start business or export and build relations and network globally.
Mentor on Road -Sri Lanka will not be charging any fee from beneficiaries, as this tour is being undertaken with a purely philanthropic point of view.
After a year, Mentor on Road - Sri Lanka aims to create 20 success stories in improved Business Development and Export related activities.
The programme has mentored start-ups, rural enterprises, micro, small, medium enterprises, corporates, women business empowerment institutions, in India, Sri Lanka and across 20 countries.
After having worked in 102 clusters in India and in 23 other countries, Founder and Chief Mentor Jagat Shah is convinced that one way to motivate SME business community world over to upgrade their technology and production processes is by convincingly proving the big size of the cake i.e. the market. This can be achieved by market access through exports. Once they see the huge overseas opportunity, they will willingly invest in their production processes in order to match demand requirements.
The most challenging project of his lifetime has been in Afghanistan where he worked with support of USAID with 20,000 carpet weavers, 6,000 dry fruit farmers and 2,000 handicraft artisans to not only take them out of poverty but to make them into exporters with warehouses and offices in USA, Germany and India. He strongly believes that if change can be brought about in Afghanistan, then it can be brought about in any country in the world.
What do the participants get through this initial journey
With the rising new economy and industries, Sri Lanka has to capitalise on the strengths of its globalisation prowess. Mentor On Road aims to connect the industry clusters of Sri Lanka to the global markets.
Through our highly informative and interactive seminars, we equip all participants with the knowledge of Innovative ways to start business/exports and innovative ways to grow business/exports.They will have access to
* Knowledge of the latest online tools used to acquire real time trade data for micro analysis.
* Knowledge of best case practices of Export done by various countries.
* Knowledge on the proven methods of building export oriented processes in growing companies.
* Analysis and advice from case studies that showcase growth of small businesses.
* Hands on mentoring for life.
This would be an ideal opportunity for the partners to initiate the journey for a deeper business impact. We will be establishing a network on how to access international markets and how similar companies like them in India and China are targeting foreign markets with innovative approaches. We will discuss about global competitiveness approaches also.
The advantages you will enjoy as a partner/sponsor of this program is multiple. Creating / establishing brand recognition, customer awareness, appoint potential brand agents, building loyalty, and giving back to the community for development of human potential. Besides SALT Global Founder Jagat Shah,Shaveen Fernando (Country Mentor - MOR Sri Lanka) will be conducting the mentoring. In each of the town they will be identifying a local mentor who will travel with us till the next town and we will train him/her on mentoring. These individuals will keep mentoring people in their towns and raise those issues to us which they cannot advise on. In turn, we shall advise them.
This way a network of mentors will be developed across Sri Lanka.
The areas of mentoring include: Marketing, exports, technology, production, finance, HR, new product development, innovation, IPR, joint ventures, investment, soft skills, interview skills, personality development, writing a business plan and how to make a bank loan application.
The participants will get a life long mentor. Plus the knowledge during the session in their own language with copies of presentations and FAQ's.
Though each session will be of two to three hours, but through the local mentor, there will be life long mentoring support. Whatsapp groups will be made for joint efforts and info dissemination. Success stories will be shared in the Mentor on Road websites, on youtube channel, electronic and the print media, besides social media.

Mourinho demands United trophy charge
LONDON: Jose Mourinho has challenged his Manchester United stars to use their dramatic League Cup final win against Southampton as a springboard to bigger prizes.
Mourinho lifted the first major trophy of his United reign on Sunday after Zlatan Ibrahimovics late header clinched a 3-2 victory at Wembley.
The 54-year-old is the first United manager to win a major competition in his maiden season at Old Trafford and the 19th trophy of his glittering career made him only the third boss, after Alex Ferguson and Brian Clough, to enjoy four League Cup triumphs. Now Mourinho wants his players to learn from the winning feeling as they chase FA Cup and Europa League titles this term, and ideally Premier League and Champions League glory next season.
The reality is that we want more: my contract is long, I have two more years with this one, so hopefully I can win more, Mourinho said.
This season I know its difficult, but the reality is we have to try to fight for more. Despite the landmark occasion Mourinho wore a stern expression during the trophy presentation.
But he insisted he was merely hiding his pride because he wanted his players to soak up the adulation.
I am very happy. I always try to put myself in the secondary position -- its important for the fans, the club, the players -- but its also important for me, he said.
I put a lot of pressure on myself, you (the media) put a lot of pressure on myself.
 I wanted very much to win a major trophy at every club. By doing that with Manchester United its quite the sense of relief because it was a big target for me. AFP

NPC to end wastage of public money
Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya said that the National Procurement commission (NPC) will ensure that the peoples money and the wealth of this country is not wasted, but spent correctly for the benefit of the people.
He said, We have lots of hopes in this area because independent commissions were part of the pledge that was given in the last election to ensure good governance and transparency,
He was speaking at the launch of the Action Plan and website of the NPC, yesterday, at BMICH.
Speaking on the importance of procurement, he said that there have been issues in the past especially when it came to tenders where public money was wasted.
We saw in the past how the tenders and specifications were manipulated. The National Procurement Commission has a tremendous role to play. They are going to be the watch dogs for the peoples money, he said.
Speaker further said that in 2007, one of the eminent programmes called clean hands was formed by the Ministry of Public Service and they studied the expenditure of the government money. The final report revealed that nearly 40% of waste and corruption were involved in spending public money.
There was neither a correct procedure nor a proper system in place. The audit reports were also not followed up, he said. The Action plan was developed by the NPC with the assistance of Short-term Assistance to improve Public financial Management reform (STAIR) project under the USAID Sri Lanka Reform Agenda (SLRA).
The main mandate of the commission is to prepare fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost effective guidelines and procedures for public sector procurement process, said Chairman of the NPC Eng. Nihal Wickramasuriya.
He said that NPC will play an oversight role on public procurement, and is now formulating proper procedures and guidelines for the procurement of goods and service, works, consultancy services and information systems of government institutions.
He said, These guidelines are being prepared in accordance with international best practices and with the assistance of International donor agencies to fulfill the needs of the country.

Over 90 percent women face sexual harassment in public transport
Sexual harassment against women on public transport is one form of gender-based violence. In order to address the issue of gender-based violence (GBV) at large, nationwide data should be gathered to assist in formulation of evidence-based policies, said the Representative-designate of the The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Ritsu Nacken.
She made this comment yesterday during a news conference at the U.N. Compound to announce the findings of its nationwide study on the prevalence and effects of sexual harassment on public transport. The UNFPA also presented a policy brief to the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs.
The study, which covered 2,500 women between the ages of 15-35 from every district, found that 90 percent of women and girls in Sri Lanka have suffered some form of sexual harassment while on public buses and trains. Of those, only four percent sought help from the police.
Sri Lanka needs to strengthen its response systems and promote positive behavioural change. It also must empower victims to speak up and bystanders to intervene so that perpetrators are held accountable, she said.
Swarna Sumanasekera, Chairperson, National Committee on Women, said the Ministry of Womens Affairs is concerned about the issues and is working on action plans to spread awareness about sexual harassment while trying to prevent it. The policy brief recommended engaging stakeholders for policy interventions, strengthening response and grievance mechanisms, empowering women and girls to speak out, encouraging bystander interventions, and sensitizing drivers and conductors to take action and prevent harassment.
Paba Deshapriya, of Grassrooted Trust, said it was important to educate young children, especially boys, about gender equality in order to limit sexual harassment. Nacken ended the conference by mentioning the need to make men and boys allies in the fight against gender-based violence. Sexual harassment is not a womens or girls issue, but the whole countrys issue. We need to engage men and boys as solution makers and partners to address this problem, as it is societys problem, Nacken said.

Pan Asia Banks posts Rs.1.25 bn profit
Pan Asia Bank, has closed its financial year ended December 31, 2016 recording a profit before tax of Rs 1.8 billion, an increase of 17% over the previous year.
Meanwhile the Bank increased its profit after tax by 20% for the same period to Rs.1.25 billion or Rs.4.24 a share, surpassing its previous earnings record. The Bank is also in the process of raising equity over Rs. 2 billion via a rights issue which will issue one new ordinary share for every two existing ordinary shares held.
The Banks acting Chief Executive Officer, Lalith Jayakody attributed the performance to the proactive measures taken to successfully acclimatize the Bank to the rising interest rate scenario from the beginning of 2016.
Our performance is a clear testament to Pan Asia Banks ability to deliver excellent performance despite the challenges thrown at us by the economic headwinds
Although the economic conditions were less supportive towards the banking and the financial services sector due to rising interest rates and the tightened credit conditions, we could still achieve these record numbers because we remained nimble to adjust ourselves fast to the new economic order, he said.
Meanwhile for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 (4Q16), the Bank reported an earnings of Rs.4.65 a share or Rs.346 million which translated in to an increase of 19%. The Return on Equity (RoE) which measures the return generated towards the shareholders, a widely used performance matrix in the banking industry stood at 19.97%, above the industry average of 17.30%. Pan Asia Bank remains among the few banks which have a RoE with a 20% level.The Banks principal source of income, the Net Interest Income rose by a modest 16.93% to Rs.4.63 billion.
This was a significant achievement at a time when the banking sector margins were coming under pressure due to low interest rates prevailed during most part of the year.

Passion just happens
Muhanned Cader has little to say. His answers too, are vague. He is also completely unpretentious. In other words he is a completely orthodox artist. All this comes down to the fact that the contents of his mind are better defined by his works of art. That is what makes him comfortable. Like many artists, he is able to better articulate his ideas through forms. Through pictures. His forms too are extremely subtle. They are completely open to interpretation. Absolutely abstract. Completely subjective. Daily News visited the Barefoot Gallery to talk to Muhanned Cader, only to be confronted with the imperceptible.
My creations just come into my head. I have been doing this for a long time. My latest show which I am previewing at the Barefoot Gallery, GLUEANDSTICK is an abstract work.
It is another way of thinking. These works are hand one with Collage.
Then they are digitally printed. Most of these works are from my sketch books. The sketch books are mine and this is a way of transferring it into another language. When I do it hand done, the collages, it is transferred into a digital format, said Cader.
Cader has been involved in art for the past 25 years.
This is my fifth solo at Barefoot. I have done quite a few solos over the time in UK, America and India. I have a style but I do not show the same thing over and over again. There is something different. I look at nature and retain it in my memory. I see something and keep it in my head. And then I put that on paper. It is not the same thing but the essence of it, stated Cader
Cader works mostly with abstracts and also paint landscapes. And this show GLUEANDSTICK has abstracts but there is a landscape element to it.
It is how you perceive my pictures. Different people perceive my pics in different ways. You are allowed to interpret it as you please. My pictures are also quite subtle. The beauty of it is that it is perceived differently by different people. I want to get better at my work by self- teaching and self- discipline through art and giving people pleasure, added Cader.
Born in Sri Lanka and having lived most of his life in Sri Lanka, he has been abroad and has taught in Sri Lanka. He also has studied in Chicago at the Art Institute.
You have to be passionate about art otherwise you cannot work. Passion just happens. I dont know what drives me to do it, said Cader
Caders work is Collage works transferred into digital print. The work is done on paper with magazines cuttings. Basically Collage transformed into digital format.
My father used to have a lot of art works and that is how I got into it. I have looked at books and painters. I have been doing this for so long I now have my own language. It has been a lot of practice and a lot of shows. I also enjoy doing these shows and it has been hard work. It has to be good and of high quality, informed Cader.
Cader is also into movies and different forms of music. This he enjoys. His wife is also an artist who does exhibitions. They met when he was teaching in Lahore.
Art is politics. It is a political point of view. My work keeps me thinking. And I felt that I wanted to show the world my passion. It is a lot of work as there are 80 pieces in this exhibition. My future dreams are to keep on painting and see where it takes me. I just want to keep working and see where it takes me, explained Cader.
People having an open mind is most welcome to Cader.
I would love them to have an open mind. I dont want to spoon feed people. When it is an abstract you cannot pin point what everything means. It is nothing to do with that. It is working with spaces, pointed out Cader.
Many artists have been inspired by the pain they have felt in life. Cader too has felt this.
You suck in the energy of everything. And then you put it out in the form that you know. What you see in the world you absorb and put it into other forms.
It needs to work together. When you see my work you can immediately know it is the same artist. So you are always searching. And you never stop learning. It is a hard life being an artist, expressed Cader.

Portmans four steps to becoming Jackie
Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky first asked Natalie Portman if shed be interested in playing Jackie Kennedy in 2012. Portman liked Noah Oppenheims screenplay, but told Aronofsky her decision would depend on finding the right director. (Aronofsky, who directed Portman to an Oscar with Black Swan, was, by that point, on board solely as a producer.)
Flash forward almost four years: Aronofsky had persuaded Chilean director Pablo Larran to make the movie and, liking his unconventional approach to the films story of Kennedys life in the days following her husbands assassination, Portman agreed to star.
The catch: Time was tight, leaving Portman just one month to prepare.
How do you wrap your head around playing one of the 20th centurys most iconic women, particularly when youve never considered portraying real people as part of your skill set We sat down with Portman not long ago and identified her four-step plan.
1. Get her voice in your head. Just as JFK had a distinct r-dropping and sometimes r-adding (you get the idear) Boston accent, Jackie Kennedy had her own breathy, mid-Atlantic thing, a dialect that Portman describes as a mix between high-class finishing school and 20th century Long Island girl. Theres a gently descending lilt and an unmistakable encoding of social status.
Portman grew up on Long Island, so that aspect of Jackie-speak came easily. But I could still use some finishing, she jokes, talking about Kennedys private-school presentation. So Portman watched every clip of Kennedy she could find on YouTube, listened to tapes of her interviews with historian Arthur Schlesinger and hunkered down with dialect coach Tanya Blumstein, rehearsing the first ladys televised 1962 White House tour so many times that she could say it in her sleep. (That tour figures prominently in the film.)
But even though the clock was ticking, Portman, mother to a 5-year-old son and expecting her second child with her husband, choreographer Benjamin Millepied, drew the line at maintaining the accent during off hours.
Its confusing to me when people are like, I just stay in character all the time, she says. I cant get away with that with my family. Theyd just laugh at me.
2. Wig out. Kennedys beautiful bouffant is instantly recognizable. Portman doesnt particularly resemble Kennedy, but when she put on the wig, she felt an instant, almost magical transformation.
Any brunette who would put that wig on would resemble her more, she says. For me, it was always scary to think I could even convince anyone that Im someone they know so well. But with that wig, as soon as I looked in the mirror, I had more confidence.
3. Try on the suit that is its own character. When Portman put on the pink suit that Kennedy wore the day her husband was assassinated in Dallas, she said it was almost like having a sense of foreboding music in a scene that tells you whats going to happen.
When I put it on, I went uh-oh and my heart dropped, she says.
Jackie shifts back and forth in time, primarily focusing on the days immediately following JFKs death as Kennedy plans his funeral and attempts to shape her husbands legacy. Costume designer Madeline Fontaine re-created numerous dresses that Kennedy wore, including her mourning outfits and the red, two-piece day dress she wore in the 1962 White House tour.
But it was the pink suit, soon stained with her husbands blood, that became the crucial piece of clothing for Portman. Kennedy refused to change out of the outfit, saying, I want them to see what they have done to Jack.
Says Portman: On the one hand, you think, Oh my God, why dont you just take it off It has to be such a morbid and dirty feeling to be covered in the blood of someone you loved who just died next to you. And she, of course, has this understanding already that her private trauma is also a public trauma and part of the images that will be coming out that are going to tell the story, the horror of what just happened. Its this interesting combination of someone stuck in their own sorrow but also simultaneously creating an image for the world.
4. Contemplate the mask of grief. Portman read every Kennedy biography, but simply looking at images of her face at her husbands funeral procession really gave her an understanding of the singular kind of mourning she experienced.
I could just look at those photos and it would put me in the place, Portman says. Its unimaginable what she went through because it was so public, so violent and so unexpected  and so traumatic, personally. I think we forget that, how terrifying it must have been to have happened right next to you.
Weve seen the photos and the footage of all this so many times, but I hope the movie makes you consider it in a more personal way, Portman continues. It still feels very upsetting  and it should. Los Angeles Times

Previous govt imported 250, 000 T rice: Amaraweera
Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Mahinda Amaraweera said that people who blame the government for importing rice have forgotten that the previous regime imported 250,000 T of rice despite the country attaining self-sufficiency in rice production.
He said this while addressing the gathering after launching development work in the Mamaduwa fisheries village in Vavuniya, under the ministry's 'Wewak Samaga Gamak' programme, recently.
The minster, who admitted that there was a problem regarding the price of rice, to which the government had given special attention, said that the price of fish had remained stable for quite sometime despite the fluctuation of other commodities.
Rice price increase was the work of a 'millers' mafia. Millers hid the paddy stock released by the PMB without milling it, and issued the rice to nearby markets. Nearly 200 black-marketeers who hid rice stocks were taken into custody to institute legal action against them. The long spell of drought was another factor which contributed to the shortage of rice. Price of rice has become the best tool of bankrupt politicians.
The government would never allow the people to starve without their staple food.
The government had insisted rice imports as a contingency plan, and prices in the local markets progressively decreased.
Minister Amaraweera said that the government never postponed local elections intentionally despite allegations made by critics.
The government never feared elections because as it was certain that the SLFP led UPFA would emerge victorious in any election under the able and astute leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The SLFP had arrived at a firm decision that it would team up with small parties which promoted communalism.

Public duped by Gazette content: Acting Govt. Printer
The Acting Government Printer yesterday said the public has been put on the wrong track by the content included in the extraordinary gazette notification related to the Central Bank Bond issue.
The gazette notification that was challenged was reserved to be printed on 01.01.2015. However, the Government Printer received the content of the gazette only on November 18, 2016, the Acting Government Printer said.
Acting Government Printer Gangani Liyanage was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds.
The Acting Government Printer also answered in the affirmative when Presidents Counsel, Additional Solicitor General Yasanta Kodagoda questioned her whether she agrees that the validity of a gazette has now dwindled due to the discrepancies in its issuance process.
The Presidential Commission also questioned if it is possible for the public to accept that information and announcements included in gazette notifications to be real time.
Because anybody who reads this gazette at face level would believe all the information regarding the Treasury Bond issuance is of real time, but truly otherwise, the Presidential Commission pointed out.
The said gazette notification in the gazette number 1895/19 issued on 01 January 2015 was recently challenged.
Supreme Court Justice Prasanna Jayawardane asked Liyanage whether it has been the general practice to back date and print a gazette.
Liyanage said it has been the case for a long period of time, and that she has information to prove so, on similar procedures until the year 2012.
Explaining the setting to the challenged gazette notification, Liyanage said even though a certain government institute reserves a date to print a gazette, the Government Printer receives the content for the gazette after a lapse of time from that the reservation has been made.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardane pointed out the Government Printer has not received the gazette content for more than a year.
PC Yasanta Kodagoda, who led the evidence, questioned Liyanage whether the Reading Room of the Government Printer, did not see the inconsistencies in the gazette.
Yes, the Assistant Head Reader W.R.J. Mel pointed out to me the discrepancies that may occur if it was printed under the name of former Finance Minister. So I requested the said officer to inquire regarding this from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Liyanage said.
Asked about what followed, Liyanage said a CBSL officer named Wasana, when inquired has told the Assistant Head Reader to go ahead with the printing since the date of the gazette says 01 January 2015.
PC Kodagoda also asked the Acting Government Printer as to why not a copy of an extraordinary gazette not be sent to the Department of the National Archives which records the historical details of the country.
PC Kodagoda also pointed out certain footnotes that appears in the gazette published in Sinhala does not appear in English or the Tamil versions.
The Presidential Commission pointed out, in the challenged gazette, there is a marking that appears in the first page foot note as G2457017 (2016/11).
The year and the month included in the brackets indicate the actual date on which the gazette has been printed, it was also pointed out.
Justice K.T. Chitrasiri questioned the Government Printer as to how a Tamil or an English reader could derive this important information, if it is not included in all three languages.

Pushpakumara scalps 13 and helps Lanka s seal dramatic win
Left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara claimed a 13-wicket haul and then hit the winning runs as Sri Lanka A completed a dash to victory in the second unofficial test to win by three wickets and square the unofficial test series with England Lions at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
England Lions won the first unofficial test at Pallekele Stadium by 195 runs.
Needing 90 to win during the final session, having been defied for much of the day by Liam Livingston's second hundred in the match, Sri Lanka A lost wickets regularly but did enough to hold off the Lions unlikely tilt at snatching victory. Udara Jayasundera made 32 off 36 and Dhananjaya de Silva, Sri Lanka A's captain, 23 off 13 to bring the target in sight before Pushpakumara finished the job after a late wobble.
The Lions began the final day still 163 runs in arrears and were grateful for Livingstone's painstaking, unbeaten 140; in all he batted for seven-and-a-half hours in the match, becoming only the second batsman after Kevin Pietersen to score a century in each innings of a first-class match for England Lions (or their predecessors, England A and England B).
Ben Foakes was the only other Lions batsman to pass 20, though, as the Sri Lanka A spinners worked their way through the order. Pushpakumara claimed 5 for 78 to go with his eight-wicket haul in the first innings, finally leaving Livingstone stranded when he bowled Jack Leach for 1 after a dogged 12-over, last-wicket stand.
Tom Curran threatened to spark an upset, taking the first four wickets to fall. Sri Lanka A were 34 for 3 when first-innings centurion Sadeera Samarawickrama was dismissed but Jayasundera and de Silva added 34 in 4.2 overs to regain the momentum.
The stand was broken by Curran and then Sri Lanka A lost three wickets for four runs to Leach and Ollie Rayner to leave them 82 for 7. When Dimuth Karunaratne, batting down at No. 6 after making a career-best 212 at opener in the first innings, was caught behind off Rayner, Foakes had ten victims in the match - including a couple of stumpings off Leach - to set a new Lions record. But with the skies remaining clear, Pushpakumara and Jeffrey Vandersay got Sri Lanka A over the line with five overs to spare.
After the Lions had resumed on 32 for 2, Vandersay made the opening breakthrough by bowling Tom Westley for 12. Keaton Jennings was then stumped off Pushpakumara, giving the left-armer his tenth in the match, but Livingstone and Foakes combined to hold up the home side during a partnership of 107 in 36 overs.
Foakes fell to the final ball before lunch, edging Pushpakumara to slip, and the Curran brothers were both dismissed in single figures with the Lions still in deficit. Livingstone continued to play with authority, however, reaching his fourth first-class hundred off 156 balls, with 11 fours and a six.
In partnership with Toby Roland-Jones, Livingstone eked the Lions into a lead, before Rayner and Leach helped add valuable extra runs but with extra time available to make up for overs lost on days two and three, Sri Lanka A were not to be denied.
Scores:
England Lions 353 and 284 in 92.1 overs (32/2 o/n) (L Livingstone 140 n.o., B Foakes 54, M Pushpakumara 5/78, Dhananjaya de Silva 2/47, J Vandersay 3/102)
Sri Lanka A 548 and 90-7 in 17.4 overs (U Jayasundera 32, Dhananjaya de Silva 23, T Curran 4/38, J Leach 2/3)
Herath to lead; Pushpakumara included in test squad
Veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath has been named as captain to lead Sri Lanka in the two-Test series against Bangladesh commencing at Galle on March 7.
Herath led the Sri Lankan team to a 2-0 victory against Zimbabwe in November last year in his first series as captain.
Herath replaces Angelo Mathews as captain for the series. Mathews is fighting to regain fitness following a hamstring injury sustained in South Africa.
Meanwhile, slow left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara who bowled Sri Lanka A to victory against England Lions at Dambulla yesterday with a match haul of 13 wickets has gained selection to the Test squad which is to be announced today after ratification from the Minister of Sports.
Pushpakumara first represented the Sri Lanka A team in 2012 when he faced South Africa and Zimbabwe during a triangular tournament and made an appearance for the Sri Lanka A team in 2015 against Pakistan.

Ravi challenges MR to go to courts over Jan 1. 2015 Gazette notification
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to go to Courts if he can over the controversial Gazette notification dated Jan 1, 2015 on the issuance of Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank. This is exactly what we want for the truth to come out, Karunanayake said. He was speaking at a press conference at Finance Ministry yesterday.
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Kumaraswami was also present on the occasion.
Former President Rajapksa had reportedly stated at a public ceremony in Horana on Monday that he is seeking legal advice from his lawyers to take Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and the Central Bank to Courts over the issue concerned.
Minister Karunanayaka said, it has been observed that the previous regime had issued Treasury bills without publishing their details in the Gazzette, which is a legal requirement in raising loans by way of issue of Treasury bills under the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance.
The former regime had not published details of Treasury bonds in the Gazzette from the outset of 2005 as per law under the office of President Mahida Rajapaksa who had also been the Minister of Finance then, Minister Karunanayake pointed out.
They had followed a practice of dodging the publication of details in respect of all issuing of Treasury Bonds by publishing them all in just one gazette notification, he said.
Minister Karunanayake also expressed his concern why that this has not been brought up in the recent COPE report.

Revive the rural economy to increase government revenue:PM
The need to revive the rural economy as a possible measure to increase government revenue in the face of mounting debt, was stressed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday as he declared opened the new premises for the Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs at 492, R. A. de Mel Mawatha.
The Prime Minister observed that over the last few decades, the rural economy had simply consisted of the unemployed moving to an urban centre or to the Middle Eastern, Italian or Singaporean economy. This is all affecting the economy of the village. How do we create development within the rural economy he asked.
Wickremesinghe requested the ministry to focus on improving and modernising two or three sectors such as dairy and poultry to be able to generate greater employment and establish industries within the village itself.
The dairy sector should be able to provide fresh milk to all school children, said the PM as he noted that the poultry industry needed to be transformed into an export oriented industry. The biggest issue with poultry is the cost of raw materials. We have to see whether we need to increase local raw material production or import them to help bring down the cost of production of poultry, said Wickremesinghe.
Economic development both rural and urban have become a dire necessity of the government as the Prime Minister pointed out that they had to find ways to pay off foreign debt amounting to Rs. 4,820 billion in the next 10 years. This is apart from the local debt burden of the government, he said. We need to look at alternative incomes, jobs and try to reduce imports, he said.
Despite such a need however, the Prime Minister observed that Sri Lankas situation remained unchanged over time. We have not progressed despite the end of the war and the main reason for this is the lack of national unity. We are working on it now, he said as he brought up the example of Tamil citizens now being allowed to sing the national anthem in Tamil.

Richies knee surgery forcing tour delay
Soul veteran Lionel Richie is reportedly postponing his upcoming tour with Mariah Carey to allow him time to recover from knee surgery.
The All Night Long hitmaker is due to kick off a 35-date trek with Mariah in Baltimore, Maryland on 15 March, but sources tell TMZ.com the 67-year-old underwent an operation on an injured knee last month and is still not fully back on his feet.
As a result, he is expected to push back the joint gigs until the summer, although representatives for the two musicians have yet to comment on the claims.
The All The Hits Tour was announced in December and had been set to wrap in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on 27 May.
Mariah recently revealed she was looking forward to hitting the road with the soul icon.
Im honoured because hes a legend and has been doing this for a lot longer than I have. Hes awesome, she told St. Louis, Missouris Fox 2 channel. Ill be doing my own show; it is about 60 minutes. Im going to do some hits and fan favourites. Its really going to be for the fans.
The rumoured postponement will give the Hero singer extra down time to spend with her kids, five-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe, from her marriage to Nick Cannon, and her new boyfriend, backing dancer Bryan Tanaka. The couple has been dating since late last year (16), after Mariah called off her engagement to billionaire businessman James Packer.

Rishad to challenge Delimitation Review Committee report
The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is to go before court challenging the report of the Delimitation Review Committee.
ACMC General Secretary S Subairdeen told the Daily News yesterday that a court case would be filed no sooner the Gazette notification on the Delimitation Report comes out.
He said the main reason for this move is because they feel that the representation of the Muslim population would be badly affected in the way the new boundaries of wards are demarcated. We are losing our legitimate representation in the local authorities. As of the new delimitation boundaries they have drawn, the Muslim majority areas may become diluted. Therefore, we have consulted our lawyers to file a case in this regard, he said.
He pointed out that the total number of LG members would rise to 11,000 as of the new electoral system, adding that this would lead to unnecessary expenses which are not in proportion with our economic system.
He stated that the ACMC would go before court first and that other small and minority parties are expected to follow suit because they too have the same grievances.

Secretary says he cannot recall attending meeting
Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said he cannot recall attending a meeting a day prior to the first auction of the treasury bonds took place with the participation of the Finance Minister, the Highways Minister, and former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran.
Samaratunga was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the issuance of Treasury Bonds yesterday.
Presidents Counsel, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda leading the evidence said it was critical for Dr. Samaratunga to refresh his memory on the meeting since it was very much relevant to the primary focus of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the issuance of Treasury Bonds.
Dr. Samaratunga said he cannot recall on the meeting since there would have been series of meetings on a given date.
A very seasoned civil servant of your calibre would obviously be having details of an appropriate time on the meetings that you have attended. Especially on a briefing where a critical decision said to have been taken, PC Kodagoda said.
Dr. Samaratunga said he, as the Secretary to the Finance Ministry, does not keep minutes of all the meetings he attended.
Following Dr. Samaratungas answer, PC Kodagoda read out the page 66 of the Hansard proceedings of the 17 of March 2015 where Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tells the House that there was a meeting on February 25, 2015 with the participation of aforesaid officials including the Finance Ministry Secretary.
Dr. Samaratunga added that he cannot recall who proposed to opt for a 30-year bond at the discussion.
Asked whether the decision to issue 30-year bond is a deviation from the issuance of treasury bonds, Dr. Samaratunga said it is not so.
Are you in a position to explain the factors you put in to consideration when agreeing with this decision Kodagoda asked.
I can only give a general explanation since I do not recall the incident, Samaratunga answered.
It was also pointed out to the Presidential Commission, the minute of the discussion reveals that the decision has already been implemented by the Central Bank, and the information on the decision was provided to the Monetary Board by the then Central Bank Governor, Arjun Mahendran.
It was also pointed out to the Commission that a board paper of the discussion was not available.
I was unaware of a press release published in print media on February 26, 2016, Dr. Samaratunga said.
He said he did not issue or authorise to issue such a press release. The press release may have been issued by the Finance Ministers office as they are also responsible in issuing press releases, he said.

This gang of about 15 members dressed in police-type uniforms travelling in a cab fired gun shots at a prison bus transporting remand prisoners from the Kalutara Prison to the Kaduwela Courts and a prison van escorting it at Ethanamadala Kalutara around 8.30 am yesterday.
Five prison officers were also injured in the shooting and one among them is said to be in a critical condition. Prisons media spokesman and Prisons Commissioner Thushara Upuldeniya said the armed gang in the cab had fired at the prison vehicles after blocking the road.
The four other remandees who died are believed to be Samayangs cohorts.
They were K. Amila Prasanga Sampath, J Thilak Mallikage, Wadduwa Pathiranage Kelum Priyankara and C D L Prasanga Kumara.
Thirty year old Samayang was a resident of Ranala. He had been indicted in the Kaduwela Magistrates Court on several counts including for five murder incidents in Nawagamuwa and several other areas, and being in illegal possession of a T56 weapon.
Among the injured prison officials are one Jailor S R Wijesinghe and Jail Guard S Tharmikan. A Guard named Buddhika who was seriously injured has been admitted to the Colombo National Hospital. Four other injured prison officials were admitted to the Nagoda Hospital and three of them are said to be in a critical condition. Police Media Director DIG Priyantha Jayakody said another underworld gang led by underworld kingpin Angoda Lokka is believed to be behind the shooting. After blocking the prison bus at Ethanamadala, the gang had surrounded the prison bus and opened fire. After shooting the officer at the first door of the bus, they had forced open the door and gone near Samayang and fired several gunshots at him till he died. Immediately after the shooting, the Kalutara Police as well as contingents from other police stations in the area rushed to the area and placed road blocks and other security measures to prevent the assailants from making a getaway. A special Police Crimes Division team has launched investigations into the incident to apprehend the culprits.
Meanwhile, the Department of Prisons yesterday started a separate investigation into the attack on prison bus in Kalutara that resulted in the death of seven persons including two prisons officials. These investigations are being conducted under the patronage of Prisons Commissioner General Tissa Jayasinghe.

Shaping lifestyles
It used to be said that Sri Lanka is a great nation without couch potatoes. Well, now we are, whether we like it or not, and we had better make the best of it.
First it was Oshin, telecasted on Rupavahini, which lured the Sri Lankan audience just a few decades ago. Following Oshins departure, several years lapsed without much news about any other foreign teledrama. And then not so long ago, the local audience was attacked with a sudden outburst of foreign teledramas imported from countries such as Korea, China and India. Some of them - Sujatha Diyani, for instance - were instrumental in shaping the common viewers lifestyle.
The latest to arrive in the small screen is another Japanese TV series, Tora-san, claimed to be highly revered in the country of its origin. Tora-san is a tele film series initially telecasted on a leading Japanese channel, Fuji TV. In the final episode, the lead character succumbs to an accident.
But that was only to draw ire from the Japanese fans.
The director and the writer were compelled to bring the character back to life. They recommenced the production, this time for a long run. That earned Tora-san a secure place in the Guinness World Record as the longest running tele film series. Tora-san is the lead character of the tele film which is originally titled as Otoko wa Tsurai yo (Its tough being a man). The film had been telecasted between 1969 and 1995 with 48 episodes.
The tele film is a gift from Japan to ITN as a goodwill measure, following the cordial discussions between ITN Chairman and Japanese Ambassador.
If Oshin offers a specific kind of flavour, Tora-san will offer myriad kinds of flavours, says Professor Patrick Ratnayaka with his years of experience in Japan. On surface, it is a comedy, but underneath the tele film takes viewers into many planes. It showcases the evolution of language and other cultural elements over the years.
Otoko wa Tsurai yo is incomparable, when you speak of the cinematic and other aesthetic elements. I am sure it will be a hit among the Sri Lankan viewers. This tele film helps us understand the similarities between Japan and Sri Lanka, Professor Ratnayake explains.
Sri Lanka ignored its agricultural background on the path to development, whereas Japan cherished with its rich agriculture, Professor Ratnayake elaborated.
Sarasaviya Editor Aruna Gunaratne observes a uniqueness in the comedy.
It does not make us laugh at certain instances. But in the end, we wonder why it happened that way. It kind of forces us to think deep into some subjects. For instance, Tora-san manages to overcome some challenges. But you need to watch the whole episode to see how he managed to do that, Gunaratne notes.
Even amid trends of commercialism following the World War II, Tora-san never lost his ground. He retains his unique spiritual qualities throughout the tele film. Professor Patrick Ratnayake predicts that the common Sri Lankan would be a different person, at least by an inch, after they watch the tele film.
For Dubbing Producer, Pran Vakishta, however, this was quite a challenge as Tora-san is a big time talkative character.
He talks almost incessantly throughout the tele film. And the other challenge is that the production has English subtitles. So it was a tough exercise to make subtle changes to suit the lip movements, Vakishta said.
Translator Dulani Dharmadasas challenge was grasping the different dialects spoken in the tele film.
Tora San travels to many regions. Japanese language has different dialects based on each and every region. I needed time to study these dialects separately before translating, Dharamadasa said.
Tora-san will be telecasted on ITN every Sunday at 4 pm.
Otoko wa Tsurai yo (Its tough being a man) is the latest gift from Japan, following its hallmark production, Oshin. The tele film stars Kiyoshi Atsumi as Tora-san a kind-hearted vagabond who is always unlucky in love. The series has been referred to as Tora San by its fans. Spanning 48 installments released between 1969 and 1995, all of the Otoko wa Tsurai yo films except episodes 3 (Azuma Morisaki) and 4 (Shunichi Kobayashi) were directed by Yji Yamada, who also wrote (or co-wrote) all the screenplays.
Each film featured a different leading lady, called a Madonna, and a different region of Japan. Two films were usually made each year between 1969 and 1989, one for summer and one for New Year release. From 1990 to 1995 only one film was made each year, for New Year release.
The film series ended with Atsumis declining health and death from lung cancer at age 68, without Tora-san ever settling down and finding domestic happiness. Atsumi was so identified with the Tora-san character that his death was also considered by fans to be the death of Tora-san. Director Yamada decided not to continue the series after Atsumis death, but reworked a Tora-san script stuck in development as Niji wo Tsukamu Otoko starring Nishida Toshiyuki as a traveling cinema operator. Although Niji was a tribute to movies in general, the final scenes were Yamadas touching, loving posthumous tribute to the Tora-san series and to Atsumi Kiyoshi. Almost all of the principal actors from Otoko wa Tsurai yo have cameos in the Niji film, and the Tora-san character even makes a surprise cameo appearance near the end of the movie hinting that perhaps Tora is still out there somewhere. The film ends with a dedication to Atsumi Kiyoshi.

SL On course to eradicate Child Labour
According to the recent Child Activity Survey 2016, launched by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), incidents of child labour have shown a significant decrease over the years.
Department of Census and Statistics Director General, Dr A.J. Satharasinghe said Sri Lanka reports a very low level of child labour which has been estimated at one percent of the total child population.
Child Activity survey; SL will soon be a child labour free country
A.J.SatharasingheM.I.M Rafeek
Dr Satharasinghe said this phenomenon is common to all three sectors urban, rural and estate sector.
The fact that not only child labour, but working children and hazardous forms of child labour also has shown a significant decline.
He highlighted that the hazardous form of child labour has reached a very low level of 0.9 percent adding that the governments policy on making education compulsory for children up to 16 years and the equal opportunity provided for children on education has been a contributory factor.
The survey revealed that the total number of children in the age group of 5-17 years in Sri Lanka in 2016 is 4.6 million. The survey estimates that 90.1 percent of the children were attending school during the survey period. Among the children not attending school, the majority (84.2%) are in the 15-17 year age group and about half of them are awaiting G.C.E (O/L) results. A small 6.8 percent have not yet enrolled due to being below the age of 5 years by January.
The survey further revealed that only about 2.3 percent of children aged 5-17 years are engaged in some kind of economic activity. This is a decline of 10.6 percentage points from the 12.9 percent reported in 2008/2009. The total child labour is only one percent of the total child population and hazardous forms of child labour is as low as 0.9 percent.
Dr. Satharasinghe said child labour and hazardous forms of child labour are subsets of working children and are defined considering national legislations and guidelines of ILO.
Labour refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful, he said.
He further said that many other related statistics on working children, child labour, hazardous forms of child labour, health conditions of working children, parents perception of working conditions and living conditions of children are available in the report which will be of value to policy makers, researchers and especially those who are working for the welfare of children in Sri Lanka.
The Child Activity survey was conducted at the request of the Ministry of Labour and Trade Union relations. International Labour Organization (ILO) provided all assistance to conduct this country wide household survey in 2016. This is the third in the series of Child Activity Surveys (CAS) conducted by the DCS. The previous rounds were conducted in 1999 and 2008/2009 with the assistance of the ILO.
The data collected in the CAs- 2016 includes demographic characteristics, school attendance, economic activities, health and safety, housing, household characteristics and perception of parents/guardians on working children and other characteristics pertaining to the children aged 5-17 years. This is a household survey and covered all children aged 5-17 years who are usually living in households, but some information was collected on children who are living away from the households as well. This field of the survey was carried out from January to May 2016.
Not all childrens work is bad. Many children work. They do household chores around the house and help in shops or farms. Such work can help children learn new skills, develop responsibility, manage their resources and gain experience which might be helpful in their future social responsibilities. However, not all work has a positive effect on childrens lives. Some forms of child labour can damage childrens health, hinder their education and have major psychological effects, said Dr. Satharasinghe.
Challenges in making informed decisions
President Maithripala Sirisena adhering to the United Nations Conventions signed the Convention for ending Child Labour developed by the International Labour Organisation with the aim to completely eliminate child labour from the country, in July Last year. The government took greater efforts to combat issues related to child labour in the recent years. However, Secretary to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, M.I.M. Rafeek highlighted the challenges in making informed policy decisions and the importance of reliable evidence.
According to Rafeek, as a government which pays great concern in providing social welfare to its people, it has to implement policies to uplift the living standards of the people.
At a time where much emphasis is made on good governance, transparency and accountability, policy makers should have access to reliable data in order to justify the reasons behind the policies formulated by them, he said.
He further said that the statistics pave the way for a scientific approach to investigate all available evidences in formulating policies which will result in achieving the desired outcome.
Rafeek emphasised the necessity of accurate data on formulating policies which will result in the development of the country.
Accurate and timely data plays a major role in formulating policies in order to make need based demand driven interventions to bring about rapid developments in the country. Evidence- based policy has been defined as an approach which helps to make well informed decisions about policies, programmes and projects by using the best available evidence, he added.
Rafeek claimed that it will help the planners to make better informed decisions by putting the best available evidence at the centre of the policy process.
However, he was of the opinion that this approach stands in contrast to opinion-based policy, which is mostly based on selective use of evidence or on the untested views of individuals or views.
These views may not provide a better picture, since they can often depict the ideas of the designer rather than the actual evidence. The present world is moving from opinion based policy towards evidence based policy which enhances achieving the long term, middle term and short term goals of a country, he explained.
Speaking about the Child Activity Report 2016 he said that this report provides evidence to formulate effective policies for the welfare of the children in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, he emphasised that as a developing country, Sri Lanka has to pay much concern over the overall development of children.
Dr. Satharasinghe said Political commitment, through the adoption of coherent policies in the areas of poverty reduction, basic education and human rights, eradication of child labour can be considered to have enabled the progress that had been achieved in eliminating child labour in Sri Lanka.
Particularly such policies and countrywide awareness programmes have helped to create a new generation of more educated parents less inclined to send their children to work, he said.
According to Dr. Satharasinghe, it seems that a future without child labour is within our grasp.
For Sri Lanka to eradicate child labour completely, policies need to take into consideration, the fact that of the estimated 4,571,000 children aged between 5-17 years covered in the survey, an estimated 103,700 (2.3%) worked at least one hour during the seven days before the interview; 43,700 (0.1%) were involved in child labour while 39,000 (0.9%) were engaged in hazardous forms of child labour, he said.

Sri Lanka assures UNHRC of commitment to accountability and reconciliation
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, in his address to the High Level Segment of the 34th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, said Sri Lanka was committed to formulating a new constitution, with the consensus of all parties involved:
We want to ensure that this Constitution, the 3rd Republican Constitution, unlike those before, that did not involve consensual and consultative processes, would reflect the true aspirations of our people, the Foreign Minister said.
He said a parliamentary process and referendum were imperative, towards that end.
The Foreign Minister also assured the UNHRC gathering Sri Lanka would have the draft legislation on the Truth-Seeking Commission presented to the Cabinet of Ministers within the next two months.
The Report of the Task Force is presently being studied in the context of designing the relevant Mechanisms for Truth-seeking, Reparations, Justice, and other reconciliation processes, the Foreign Minister said.
Our resolve to bring justice to the victims of human rights violations remains firm.
The full text of his address is reproduced below:
It is an honour for me to be here today at the 34th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, which I believe, has the highest number of dignitaries in attendance.
I stand here today at a time when the very basis and fundamentals of human rights are being questioned around the world. Many of the universal values that we subscribe to are being challenged in the name of populism, with populists spinning webs from threads of ignorance. The role of this Organisation, in this context, is becoming more important than ever.
This Council is familiar with Sri Lankas story. After years of denial, disengagement, and self-isolation, the National Unity Government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, proceeded to set our country on a transformative trajectory in terms of human rights, good governance, rule of law, justice, reconciliation and economic development.
The people of our country voted in large numbers granting a resounding victory to President Sirisena at the election in January 2015. The voter turnout was the highest recorded for any Presidential candidate, and in the North and the East, President Sirisenas share of the vote was also the highest ever as people placed their trust in President Sirisena who they believe will not short change them as in the past. Therefore, we not only owe the people who voted for us 2 years ago, but also to history to uphold that trust, and we are committed to do so.
It is with this firm conviction, that soon after the August 2015 Parliamentary Election, we co-sponsored Resolution 30/1 titled Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in Sri Lanka, which was adopted unanimously by this Council, on the 1st of October 2015.
I speak today, just over a year, or 15 months since Sri Lanka took the historic step of co-sponsoring Resolution 30/1. Many in our country criticised and continue to criticise us for this step. Some even see this as an act of treachery and betrayal of the nation. We have a simple message for them, as we journey towards 2018, our 70th year as an Independent Nation:
The Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers, those of different faiths and beliefs, across gender, caste and creed, that constitute our country, worked together to gain Independence for our nation in 1948. That achieved, we failed to forge the perfect nation of individuals who all hold equal rights, working as one to achieve the heights our nation could attain. As a result, for 69 long years, we journeyed through pain, violence, loss of life and precious human resources, ruining chances of socio economic progress. This was clearly an experiment in nation building that failed, which is certainly not worth pursuing further. We must have the courage to acknowledge that truth, and that era must now end. The Sri Lanka that we seek to build here onwards, should be one where justice reigns; where human rights are valued; where every individuals dignity is upheld; and where civil society and the media play their due role; a society that believes in the importance of the independence of the judiciary, and the rule of law; and where everyone has equal rights.
As we move forward in this journey, the forces of extremism and regression on both sides of the divide are creating road blocks for narrow, short-term political gain. While stubbornly refusing to acknowledge any of the far-reaching gains we have made in the last 2 years, they argue that we have either done too much or too little. I would, in this backdrop, like to say that the recommendation of the GSP+ concessions from Brussels, and MCC compact assistance from USA were announced recently, in recognition of the progress made in Sri Lanka in the last two years, and we await their formal approval in the coming months.
Since I last addressed this Council, on the 29th of June 2016,
 legislation to give effect to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, and published in the Government Gazette, and is expected to be tabled in Parliament shortly;

 the List of Designated Persons under Regulation 4(7) of the UN Regulation No. 1 of 2012 was further amended;

 the Reports of the 6 Sub Committees of the Steering Committee tasked with deliberating and submitting reports on fundamental rights; judiciary; law and order; public finance; public service; and centre-periphery relations; have been completed, and handed over to the Constitutional Assembly;
 the National Human Rights Action Plan for the period 2017-2021, evolved through a wide consultative process, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers;
 11,253 houses were handed over during 2016 to the internally displaced; and Rs. 4,785 million has been allocated for 5,732 houses for the internally displaced for 2017;
 the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority (REPPIA) payments for beneficiaries in 2016 amounted to Rs. 605,809,359.00; and Rs. 574,000,000.00 has been allocated for 2017;
 5,515.98 acres of state land and 2,090.03 acres of private land were released in 2016; and 1,383.51 acres of state land and 30.54 acres of private land were released last month, in January 2017;
 the first ever National Integration and Reconciliation Week was observed from 8th to 14th January 2017, with all public officials as well as school children taking a pledge, resolving to work together, hand in hand, respecting the richness of our diversity, to foster peace, understanding, and mutual trust, for a new Sri Lanka that is united in its diversity;
Another important undertaking that was successfully concluded during this period, is public consultations carried out by the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms, the first of this nature carried out in the country. Over 7000 written submissions were received from persons from all walks of life, many of them victims of human rights violations who came forward to give their views. The Report of the Task Force is presently being studied in the context of designing the relevant Mechanisms for Truth-seeking, Reparations, Justice, and other reconciliation processes.
We expect the draft legislation on the Truth-Seeking Commission to be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers within the next two months. Our resolve to bring justice to the victims of human rights violations remains firm.
While taking the allegations of continuing incidence of torture seriously, it is reiterated that the Government maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards torture as also demonstrated by the Presidents participation against torture last year. Although the National Human Rights Commission has recently indicated to us that there is a downward spiral of incidents, even one incident of torture is one too many. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, the Police Commission, the Ministry of Law & Order and other relevant agencies are working together to prevent and combat torture. As in many other areas, this too is an area in which we require technical assistance, and I hope that countries with experience in this area will come to our assistance.
The Constitution drafting process is for us both central and essential not only for democratisation, but also for ensuring non-recurrence of conflict. As this Council is aware, the Parliament of Sri Lanka, in April 2016, unanimously adopted a Resolution to prepare a draft Constitutional Bill for the consideration of Parliament. As we approach the 70th year of our nations Independence, we seek, for the first time in our countrys modern history, to engage in this process wholeheartedly as an exercise that would unite our people who have been divided for far too long. The Parliamentary process and referendum are for us, imperative. We want to ensure that this Constitution, the 3rd Republican Constitution, unlike those before, that did not involve consensual and consultative processes, would reflect the true aspirations of our people. An exercise where, after years of conflict, the executive, legislature and sovereign  that is the people of our country  will unite to define and chart our nations future, guaranteeing equal rights, justice, and dignity for all citizens, honouring the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-lingual character of our nation, upholding the right of citizens to participate more fully in decisions that impact their lives, and guaranteeing non-recurrence of conflict.
The journey we have undertaken, arising from our commitments to our people and the mandates received at elections, is challenging. This may be a journey strewn with both success as well as some setbacks. In the face of roadblocks and other obstacles in the day to day world of realpolitik, there may have to be detours from time to time, but the destination and our resolve to walk the distance will remain unchanged. Our resolve to see the transitional justice process through, has not diminished. With the help of all our citizens in all walks of life, our friends and partners in the international community, and Sri Lankans overseas; with patience, understanding, and constant and consistent effort and perseverance; we strongly believe that we can make the reconciliation process a success, and establish a progressive and united society, working in harmony to take our nation towards new heights of socio-economic development. We believe that we can make Sri Lanka a shining example of a country that is prosperous, united in its diversity, upholding human rights, justice, and the rule of law.

Sri Lankan student facing deportation: Order lifted at eleventh hour

A university student who faced being deported to Sri Lanka has had the order halted hours before she was due to board a plane.
Shiromini Satkunarajah, who is studying electrical engineering at Bangor University, North Wales, faced being sent to her country of birth with her mother Roshina on Tuesday morning.
The student, who has lived in the UK since she was 12, faced leaving the UK three months before completing her degree.
However the Home Officerescinded her deportation order shortly after her local MP Hywel Williams raised a point of order in the House of Commons.
Satkunarajah and her mother were due to be released from Yarl's Wood Detention Centre.
Williams, the Plaid Cymru Westminster leader, said: "This is the news we've all been hoping for.
"I'm so very glad that Shiromini and her mum have had this deportation order rescinded and released from the detention centre.
"I'd like to thank everyone who backed the campaign to have the deportation order lifted. So much has been achieved in so little time."
He added: "The outpouring of support from across the country has been staggering, particularly from North Wales where Shiromini is highly regarded within the Bangor community.
"Since the campaign was launched on Friday I've received messages of support for Shiromini from across the country and I'm glad that Bangor University will now be able to welcome one of their best students back.
"Of course the campaign to right this unjust situation is not over. There is clearly something seriously wrong with the current system and it is an issue I intend to pursue."

SriLankan inducts first leased Airbus A320 neo to its fleet
SriLankan Airlines commenced the induction to its fleet the latest Airbus aircraft A320 neo and the A321 neo series by unveiling the A320 neo yesterday.
The leased A320 arrived in Katunayake on Sunday from Hamburg Germany and is expected to be ready for commercial operations by early March.
The aircraft has been acquired on a monthly operating lease and five more A320-A321 aircraft are expected in the next 15 to 18 months, Chief Technical Officer Dinnaga Padmaperuma said.
With this leased A320 neo aircraft SriLankan will have a total fleet of 25 aircraft out of which two will be returned to the owner which results to 23 flying aircraft.
The Neo-series has been designed to provide significantly lower fuel consumption and lower operating costs through more modern engines, aerodynamic refinements, large curved winglets, known as sharklets and weight savings, he said.
It also features cabin improvements such as more passenger seats, larger hand luggage spaces and an improved air purification system as well as reduced engine noise levels and a significantly increased flying range.
The aircraft which is 13 to 15% fuel efficient can fly a longer distance and SriLankan was one of the first airlines to take delivery of an A320 neo aircraft, Padmaperuma said.
The wet lease with PIA has lapsed and the aircraft will return back to Colombo by the end of the week from Pakistan. A payment of US$ 3 million was due for the wet lease till February and is expected to be settled after closing the account and reconciliation done.
Padmaperuma said PIA has always made prompt payments and expressed optimism on the early settlement of dues.Commenting on the abolishing the Paris and Frankfurt sector he said it was the right decision because Paris and London were leisure markets and there were no businesses for the French of Germans to come here. So the business class never fills and as a result the airline loses. Moreover, the average ticket price we get to Paris is about US$ 200 per passenger. When you multiply 200 in to 200 it is US$ 40,000 which is not enough to sometimes fuel the airline to go to Paris, he said.

State reforms
Earlier this week, Parliament debated, on an adjournment motion by the TNA, the unresolved issues of the North and East, namely dealing with the effects and the causes of the war. The former requiring specific reconciliation measures and the latter reforms of the Sri Lankan state which enables the state to accommodate the full diversity of her society.
The attention of the Sri Lankan polity will also be focused internationally at the UNHRC in Geneva, where at its general sessions the resolution on Sri Lanka, dealing with our reconciliation and democratization processes, would be on the agenda. Various reports in the popular press have a range of views on the reconciliation process and the current state of play, which broadly divide into two camps.
In the south, opposition forces are agitating that the proposed reforms are a sell out and have consequently largely resigned from the steering committee of the Constitutional Assembly, but after having served on the sub committees during deliberations and the submission of their reports. In the North, opposition to the TNA leadership, paradoxically, largely from within its own ranks would claim that little or no progress on reconciliation has occurred.
Current tasks and challenges
The context for the current state of play, is the momentous elections of 2015, which abruptly ended what had seemed an invincible Rajapaksa Administration and its policy direction of creeping authoritarianism and an entrenching of social divisions and ethnic polarizations. The elections of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, opened a new chapter, in post war Sri Lanka, a government committed to the three pillars of democratization, reconciliation and sustainable economic development. The one hundred (100) day programme of the new government succeeded in achieving the early wins and the easy tasks and the 19th Amendment to the constitution, was the landmark achievement of that first flush of victory. The current tasks and challenges are now the harder tasks of state reform and it is important to bear in mind, why we should reform.
Earlier in this month of February, we celebrated our 69th anniversary of independence and casting our minds back to 1948, Ceylon as we were then called was a land of rich promise. Looking back nearly seven decades later, we realize that our inability to deal with our diversity led us spending about three decades fighting a ruinous civil war, which eroded our democracy, polarized our society, stunted our economic growth and warped our social progress. It is not in the interest of any section of Sri Lankan society, that we live our next three decades, like we did in the last three.
Militarys defeat of the LTTE
The end of the war and the destruction of the armed capability of the LTTE in 2009, provided a unique second chance for us to recreate a united and tolerant Sri Lanka, accommodative of diversity and fulfilling the aspirations of all her peoples. Unfortunately, the Rajapaksa administration, which had provided the political oversight for the militarys defeat of the LTTE, seemed both unwilling and unable to chart a new course to provide either a peace dividend or a sustainable peace.
It was amazing that in a short span of four to five years, it moved from an overwhelming victory to an ignominious defeat. The broad rainbow coalition of the Yahapalanya administration was elected on a good governance and reform agenda, which would seek to utilize the window of opportunity we have for real and needed state reform.
The most important aspect of reform required by the general public is economic reform, for a dynamic and growing economy which fulfills the economic aspirations of all our peoples, including both urban and rural, young and old, professionals and entrepreneurs, the educated and the less well educated.
The economic management leadership of the current administration would clearly articulate that they inherited an economy hobbled with excessive foreign debt spent on projects of dubious value at exorbitant and inflated costs, which in an unfavourable external environment has been a near insurmountable challenge to overcome. Well knowing though that the next election would all be about how economic benefits were delivered to the people.
Democratic processes
The other aspect of needed reform is in the area of reconciliation and the government is moving in the right direction, though arguably at a pace slower than that wished by the people of the North and East and their elected representatives. However, the important fact is that the Government is on the right path, even if it has not progressed down that path, at quite the pace wishes by some. Even government leaders may well be frustrated by the pace of reform, but politics and policy reform is also the art of the possible, exploiting existing spaces complemented with comprehensive dialogue among stakeholders and such democratic processes take time and as the old adage goes, Rome was not built in a day and societies being complex, change slowly and incrementally.
Sri Lanka actually achieved a quiet people revolution through the ballot box in 2015 and started off on a new journey, which has perhaps passed its one third mark, but not yet reached even the half way stage. It must be provided the time, space and support, both locally and internationally to proceed down the path of reforms in democracy, reconciliation and sustainable economic development, to fulfil the clear mandates of the sovereign people of Sri Lanka given in January and August 2015.

TAT, Singapore Airlines sign MoU to boost travel to Thailand
The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) and Singapore Airlines (SIA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Tourism Cooperation to jointly promote travel to Thailand from priority markets including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa.
Yuthasak Supasorn, TAT Governor, said: This MoU signing ceremony marks a major new drive on tourism cooperation between TAT and strategic partners in key source tourist markets from around the world, all of which are under the objective of promoting travel to Thailand.
This MoU with Singapore Airlines in particular, will allow us to strategically attract more travellers from the four specific markets to enjoy the unique Thai local experiences here in Amazing Thailand.
Effective from today until 31 March 2019, the MOU between TAT and SIA will cover a series of joint activities including brand advertising and promotional campaigns, tactical and digital marketing, familiarisation trips, joint road shows and product development. The joint activities are expected to help boost visitor numbers from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Singapore to Thailand.
Yuthasak said, Australia and New Zealand markets have long been important source markets for Thailand while the South Africa market has been growing in recent years, so this strategic MOU will certainly help boost visitor numbers to Thailand.
SIA and its subsidiary SilkAir currently operate 89 flights per week to Thailand. SIA operates 35 weekly flights to Bangkok, while SilkAir operates 35 weekly flights to Phuket, 14 weekly flights to KohSamui and five weekly flights to Chiang Mai.
Yuthasak added, Singapore Airlines offers high-quality service and with their help under this mutually-beneficial MOU, we look forward to welcoming their passengers with impressive Thai hospitality.
Gohhoonhong, Singapore Airlines CEO, said, We look forward to working with TAT on many exciting activities to promote Thailand as an attractive tourist and business destination to the world. Combined with Singapore Airlines wide global network and dedication to excellent customer service, we are confident we can increase visitor arrivals into Thailand.
In 2017, TAT has set a target of 34.5 million international visitors, generating an estimated 1.81 trillion Baht (US$50 billion) a 10 per cent year-on-year increase  in international tourism receipts.

Trumps colonial pendulum hanging low hanging free
Why do we have a fixation over old colonial sartorial legacies, such as complete Western attire, that makes no sense for dressing in comfort in our tropical climate It would certainly be a smart and sagacious accessory for cooler climes or for a more formal occasion such as a wedding or black tie dinners held in air-conditioned surroundings. Perhaps its time to examine our mindless adoption of this relic of western dress code. And yes, lets talk about the necktie, that suffocating hangover from our colonial past.
Yes, I am at the end of my tether with all these boring formal accoutrements. So much so, in fact, that they make me feel suicidal. Its only natural with so many frayed knots and a surfeit of tidy ropes waiting to be strung around my neck. Which brings me to the pertinent question, that you dont have to be tongue-tied while answering.
Whoever swore allegiance to the necktie in a country where average summer temperatures are 38 Celsius plus, deserves to choke. Of course, necktie aficionados who are legion will essay a strangled cry. The tie, they will protest, is as much part of western attire as pants and shirts, and havent the latter been absorbed into the Sri Lankan wardrobe Yes, but then we are all addicted to pants these days and feel vulnerable without them in public places.
But that was before politicos and their sycophants, no doubt, at first squirmed into sarongs and sherwani-like bat-winged tops to endear themselves to the masses, at a time when screeching nationalistic fervour rode the country like a tidal wave. But in the sweltering tropics, how intelligent is it to start the day by tying a noose around your neck and then allowing a woman to tighten it There is an obvious catch to it.
A woman giving a man a tie hopes shell eventually be able to tie him up in nuptial knots. But even then he is almost certain to receive the tie she thinks he should be wearing. So it seems as if its curtains for all sensible dressers with the drapery running down their shirtfronts. I for one think its time to loosen the colonial ties or discard them altogether. Besides, neckties strangle clear thinking. Evidence of that is clearly endorsed by the fall of the British Empire.
Talk of the Lady High Executioners. The official Hangman appears to be hanging around cooling his heels. That is because we have ceased to be a swinging society as far as criminal elements are concerned. Necktie parties have been banned although capital punishment is legal in Sri Lanka. However, since June 23, 1976, there have been no executions, although death sentences were handed down continuously by the High and Supreme Courts for murder and drug trafficking convictions.
I must concede I was required to wear a tie often in my long career as journalist, impresario and university lecturer. But I could not quite get the hang of tying it. You ask me whether I could manage the perfect loop Im afraid knot. But I am no quitter and if at first I dont succeed I tie and tie again. Then at the most inopportune moment the blasted phone decides to ring. I grab it with one hand while trying to loop the knot with the other. And I yell into the phone: Sorry, youll have to ring later. Im tied up at the moment.
What I usually have trouble with is the end of the tie that hangs from the knot - the part in front that gets gradually wider. There seems to be some trick to getting the tie, after pulling it through whatever knot youve fashioned, so that the part directly below the knot has a symmetrical little dimple in the centre where the knot cinches it. Ive even seen these beautifully sculpted visions that had two or even three dimples, again symmetrically placed. Breath-taking!
My own efforts, however, always produce a misplaced, off-to-one-side dimple, so that the tie wont stay centred. As the day progresses the back part starts to peek around the corner as the front part shifts to one side. I complain its lop-sided and the family members say: No leave it as it is. It matches your grin!
But I am certain I am not the only one afflicted with this predicament. There are several far more powerful men who imagine they can run the world who make a mish-mash of tie knotting. There are style lessons tied up with Donald Trumps ridiculously long necktie as well.
Unless you have been living under a rock, you know the US has just sworn in its 45th president. But this is not about that. Agreed that Trumps thali of troubles brimmeth over but theres one problem that he could have solved by now but hasnt. That is his ridiculously long necktie.
Sartorial experts claim that long neckties look sloppy and spoil the shape of the suit. In an article American style guru Patrick Grant asserts: Donald Trumps preposterous crotch-skimming ties are a deliberate crime against fashion. According to Grant, a mans choice of neckwear says a lot about him. After all, its a very visible statement. Trump may be using his ties to send the message that hes different, and not cut from the same mould. Its his way of cocking a snook at sartorial rules  with his style modus operandi.
Can you break the style rules If you are not Trump, then no! Then maybe still stick to the conventions. Like him or not President Trump is a unique personality and dresses up to reflect it. Its a cultivated look. As the witty Mark Twain once said: Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.
Any man worth his Windsor knows that the end of the tie is supposed to hit right at the middle of your belt. And yet when Trump made his appearance with his wife at his side his tie was hanging a good three to four inches below his waistline. Definitely the type of territory to put him in danger of splash-back or something suggestively worse.
Ok then what is the right tie length to educate Trump on The golden rule for tie wearing is that it should reach the belt buckle or the waistband of the trousers. Any shorter and you will look like a Cub Scout. Any longer and you are in danger of getting it stuck in your fly. Worse still is the physical danger of an accidental zipper accident while using the Executive loo.

Trump lays out hike in military spending

US President Donald Trump is seeking to boost defence spending by 10% in his proposed budget plan for 2018.
The blueprint will increase defence spending by $54bn (43bn) but seeks to recoup that sum through deep cuts elsewhere, including to foreign aid.
Trump's plan leaves large welfare programmes untouched, despite Republican calls for reform.
The president has consulted government agencies about his plans and will present his budget to Congress in May.
Between now and then, he needs to identify where the agencies can make savings and work out what he does with tax reform.
Republican John McCain said the $603bn defence budget - which was outlined by White House officials - would be insufficient.
Speaking at the White House during a meeting with state governors on Monday morning, Trump said: "We're going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable."
The president, who vowed to increase military spending and preserve welfare programmes during his campaign, said the budget will focus on "military, safety, economic development".
"It will include an historic increase in defence spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it," he said.
Military spending has declined in recent years due to budgetary battles in Congress that led to a spending freeze on defence.
However, it is still not uncommon for Congress to approve procurement of tanks, aircraft and ships that the Pentagon says it doesn't even need.
Trump's proposal would return the US closer to wartime spending.
He also said he would spend "big" on infrastructure like roads and rails, but he has not yet revealed his tax plans.
Trump pledged to cut taxes during his presidential campaign, which would probably add to the national debt, a figure that could hit $20 trillion on his watch.
Keeping both of his campaign promises - boosting the military and protecting welfare - will put the president in a tough bind.
If he wants to boost the defence budget by $54bn without adding to the deficit, that money will have to come from somewhere - and mandatory spending on welfare and debt interest takes nearly 70% of the budget off the table.
Early reports are that the Environmental Protection Agency is facing sharp cuts, but its total annual budget is just over $8bn - a drop in the bucket.
The State Department has also been singled out as a source for the needed funds, and its $50bn annually (including $22bn in direct aid) makes it a fatter target.
The lion's share of humanitarian assistance goes to rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan and Aids treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, which will be difficult to touch. Also unlikely to get the axe is military support, dominated by $3.1bn annually to Israel.
There's a reason the Trump administration announced the military budget number before revealing where the money will come from. Spending is easy; cutting is hard.
The White House sent Trump's 2018 budget blueprint, which begins on 1 October, to federal agencies on Monday.
The agencies will then review the plan and propose changes to the cuts as the White House prepares for negotiations with Congress.
The Republican-controlled Congress must approve any federal spending.
Trump's plan is expected to face backlash from Democrats and some Republicans over the planned cuts to domestic programmes.
Congresswoman Nita Lowey, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Trump's plan is harmful to working families.
"We will fight tooth and nail to protect services and investments that are critical to hardworking American families and communities across the country," she said.

Williams drugs charge harms All Blacks legacy
Wellington: New Zealand media Monday accused Ali Williams of tarnishing the image of the All Blacks after French police charged the World Cup-winning former international with buying cocaine.
Williams and ex-Wallaby James O'Connor were arrested outside a Paris nightspot over the weekend after allegedly being caught with 2.4 grams (0.08 ounces) of the drug. Fairfax New Zealand sports columnist Kevin Norquay said such behaviour was unacceptable for a former All Black, let alone one who once led the team's fabled haka war dance.
"Ali Williams has hauled the proud black name through the white powder dirt," he wrote.
"He's not just a silly boy with money having a bit of a lark outside a Paris nightclub.
"He's Ali Williams, All Black lock, 77 Test caps, World Cup winner in 2011. Wearer of the Silver Fern, dispenser of the haka."
Norquay said Williams' status as an All Black was the reason he was in France playing for Racing 92, the defending Top 14 champions who have suspended the 35-year-old indefinitely over the incident.
"Williams' allegedly illegal act did not hurt only himself, or those close to him -- such as his wife and small children. He harmed the All Black legacy," he added.
Williams is the second ex-All Black at Racing 92 to face trouble with the law after the legendary Dan Carter was caught drink-driving in Paris earlier this month. Newstalk ZB's France correspondent Catherine Field said Racing 92 promoted itself as a family club and would have expected better from its high-profile recruits.
"It's not just a glamour club, it's a club that's really based around family... it's really something that goes against the ethics of this particular club," she said.
"On top of that, there's always a lot of interest in what the former All Blacks are doing here in France."
However, there was also some sympathy for Williams, with the New Zealand Herald's Chris Rattue saying the lock was a "victim" in the war on drugs.
"I wish Williams and O'Connor well," he wrote, arguing that prohibition of drugs had created a disaster. AFP

Zidane hails impact subs in Madrid comeback
MADRID: Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane hailed the impact of Isco and Alvaro Morata off the bench as the European champions came from 2-0 down at Villarreal on Sunday to win 3-2.
Morata completed the comeback after Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo had hauled Madrid level to ensure Zidane's men move back ahead of Barcelona at the top of La Liga.
Real hold a one-point lead over their title rivals, who won 2-1 at Atletico Madrid on Sunday, but also have a game in hand.
They deserve (to play) more for sure, Zidane said of the Spanish international duo.
The did very well, they changed the game. In any case we will need every player between now and the end of the season.
They are all up for it. It is a long season, but this shows that everyone is ready when they are called upon.
With everything that happened today it was vitally important to get the three points. Real had suffered just their second league defeat of the season at Valencia in midweek.
And Zidane's men looked well on course to suffer another reversal when Villarreal struck twice in six minutes early in the second-half through Manu Trigueros and Cedric Bakambu.
However, Zidane reacted immediately by introducing Isco for the more defensively minded Casemiro.
Having been outplayed for the opening hour, Madrid forced Villarreal onto the back foot and were rewarded when Bale's header halved the arrears 25 minutes from time.
Ronaldo then smashed home a controversial penalty after Villarreal captain Bruno Soriano was harshly adjudged to have handled inside his own box.
And the comeback was complete when Morata, who only replaced Karim Benzema 13 minutes from time, powered home Marcelo's cross six minutes later.
At 2-0 down you have to change something, added Zidane.
It worked out well for us. It allowed us to camp much more in their half. Bale was making his first start for three months and was forced to play almost the full 90 minutes given the circumstances before hobbling off to be replaced by Lucas Vazquez a minute from time.
However, Zidane said the Welshman suffered just a knock and should be fine to feature against Las Palmas on Wednesday.
Villarreal 'keeper Sergio Asenjo was not so fortunate as he appears to have suffered a fourth cruciate knee ligament injury of his career.
Asenjo, who has presided over La Liga's best defence, went down after turning Benzema's header to safety midway through the first-half.
Asenjo seems to have torn his ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) in his left knee. It's a real shame, said Villarreal coach Fran Escriba.
His absence proved vital as back-up 'keeper Andres Fernandez let Morata's header slip under his body for the winner.
Escriba had to watch that goal from the stands after being dismissed from the touchline for taking his protests over the penalty too far.
The match was over for us after the penalty, added Escriba.
We lost our focus.
