Chandimal to lead depleted Sri Lanka squad in India


Dinesh Chandimal will be leading Sri Lanka against India in the three-match T20I series next month. Many a first choice player has missed out due to injuries, namely Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath and Nuwan Pradeep.

The squad also sees the return of pacer Dilhara Fernando to the national team after a gap of four years.

Malinga missed Sri Lanka's recent tour of New Zealand tour due to a knee injury and will be needing another two weeks to regain full fitness. Mathews is nursing a groin strain but is likely to be available for the Asia Cup that begins soon after the series against India. Herath is recovering from a pulled side muscle and Pradeep is out of action due to a hamstring injury.

Sri Lanka squad: Dinesh Chandimal (c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Seekuge Prasanna, Milinda Siriwardana, Danushka Gunathilaka, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Asela Gunaratne, Chamara Kapugedera, Dushmantha Chameera, Dilhara Fernando, Kasun Rajitha, Binura Fernando, Sachithra Senanayake, Jeffrey Vandersay.

Division savours the rival - SLFPers
When considering the behaviour of Sri Lankan politics, it can be analyzed in such a way that the benefit of dividing a major political party goes to the major rival political party, Ministers Anura Priyadarshna Yapa and Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
The ministers were addressing the weekly media briefing of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
Minister Yapa highlighting the political history of the country pointed out that at every time when a major political party was divided, the other rival party got the benefit of that division.
He said the SLFP was divided by various people from 1977 to 1994 resulting in a severe impact to the party. In certain occasions, several SLFPers formed other parties.
For instance, Peoples Party (Mahajana Pakshaya) was formed under the leadership of Vijaya Kumaratunga, Chandrika Kumaratunga and T. B. Illangaratne in 1984. However, Chandrika Kumaratunga returned to the party and became the President and the leader of the SLFP. Similar to this incident, a new party was formed by several frontline UNPers such as Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, etc., he said.
If the SLFP is divided, the UNP will definitely be benefited at the forthcoming local government election, Minister Yapa added.
When the minister was asked by the media about the outcome of the recently held Executive Meeting of the SLFP, he said that no idea came up regarding forming a new political party.
At the meeting nine proposals were tabled to be presented to the Constitutional Council. The President said that Geneva issue will be addressed under local legal provisions, Yapa said.
All members should abide by the decisions of party leadership, Central or Executive Committees. The SLFP has engaged in a coalition government on a decision by the Central Committee, he said.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the SLFP will be defeated at elections if it is divided. Whatever party is formed, the UNP and the SLFP will rule the country at least for the next 40 - 50 years.
Many parties were formed time and again by many persons. Except for a few parties, all others have ceased to exist. If an SLFPer formed a new party dividing the SLFP, it can be considered that the particular member is ruining the SLFP. Therefore work with the head but not with heart, he said.
When he was questioned about allegations leveled by SLFP Parliamentarian Dullas Allahapperuma that President Maithripala Sirisena removed the bra of the SLFP and throw it to the UNP by forming a coalition government with the UNP, the minister said that Allahapperuma also expressed his concerns at the Central Committee to go for coalition government with the UNP.
If it is so, it indicates that Allahapperuma has also joined in removing the bra, he said.
Parliamentarian Lakshman Senevirathne said that UNP had been in the opposition for 20 years as a result of the internal disputes. Therefore all SLFP members should be in brotherly manner with the aim of achieving common goals.

Govt urged to honour promises
National Movement for Social Justice members said they will give the government two weeks to change its current path and keep the promises made to the people prior to coming into power.
Addressing the media in Colombo on Tuesday, Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya said offenders responsible for corruption, malpractice and murder are still not being investigated and punished as promised.
"In the past, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa intervened and now certain ministers are doing the same to prevent justice being meted out. Well disciplined officers have done their duties. Something or someone is blocking the process. The government should act according to the results of investigations. The order of the law and the independence of the judiciary should be protected," Prof. Wijesuriya said.
People's Collective Movement joint convenor Saman Ratnapriya said the government was not productive enough.
"Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe was still holding on to his position after safeguarding Avant Garde while the IGP was still in office despite his connections with the 'Sil Redi issue' and the Embilipitiya incident. The Attorney General had gone on leave prior to his retirement purposely avoiding his duties," he said.

Homagama incident shows need for Bikkhu Kathikawatha Bill - Prelate
The unruly behaviour displayed by a group of Bhikkhus opposite the Homagama Courts Complex highlighted the urgent need for the adoption of the Theravada Bhikkhu Kathikawatha Bill, said History Lecturer at the Peradeniya University Ven. Prof. Hanguranketha
Dheerananda Thera, He said according to our cherished cultural values, Buddhists acted in accordance with the examples set by the Maha Sangha. Therefore, the unruly action by a group of Bhikkhus who had a duty to be an example to others could never be condoned. He said violence was not the means to settle problems and issues. All religions for that matter abhorred violence. Since the country was peaceful there was ample opportunities available to settle problems through discussion. Bhikkhus would not have misbehaved in this manner if a Bhkkhu Kathikawatha had been in force.

Injury stricken Sri Lanka likely to send depleted squad
With several key players carrying injuries Sri Lanka are likely to send a depleted squad for the three-match T20 international series to India next month.
Both countries are set to play a series of three matches prior to the Asia Cup as they look ahead to the World T20 in March.
The matches in India are scheduled at Pune on February 9, Delhi on February 12 and Visakhapatnam on February 14.
T20 captain Lasith Malinga is still recovering from a knee injury that kept him out of the tour to New Zealand. It is learnt that he will require another fortnight to regain full fitness.
Meanwhile Test and ODI skipper Angelo Mathews is nursing a thigh strain that prevented him from bowling in New Zealand.
Fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep and left-arm spinner Rangana Herath are also struggling to get fit - both having picked up injuries during the Premier T20 tournament playing for their respective clubs.
Pradeep is being treated for a hamstring and Herath for a pulled side muscle, the Daily News learns.
All four players are unlikely to figure in the squad that will be picked for the short series in India and their places are likely to be filled by young players who have performed well in the recently concluded Premier T20 tournament.
With Malinga's fitness still under a cloud Dinesh Chandimal who led Sri Lanka in the two T20 internationals in New Zealand will most probably continue as captain.
It is learnt that a provisional squad of 30 players will be picked before February 1 for the ICC World T20 that will be held in India in March. The squad will be pruned down to the final 15 by February 15. The performances in the ongoing Super T20 provincial tournament will also be taken into consideration with experience and current form being the criteria.
It is learnt that the squad that is picked for the Asia Cup in Bangladesh will virtually be the same side that will defend the World T20 title in India.
The Asia Cup is scheduled from February 24 to March 6 and the World T20 from March 8 to April 3. The Asia Cup for the first time is being shifted from ODI format to T20 format taking the T20 World Cup into account.
Sri Lanka are the defending champions in both tournaments - Asia Cup and World T20.

Politically bankrupt trying to divide SLFP - Fowzie
Senior President of SLFP and National Integration and Reforms State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie yesterday said that a group of persons who have been politically stranded are trying to divide the party by forming a new political party.
He said that these persons who do not have a popular base, are trying to create rifts within the SLFP using former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a cat's paw. "Such a new party will not last long," he said.
The minister was addressing the media after calling on Mahanayake Theras of Asgiriya and Malwatte chapters in Kandy yesterday.
Minister Fowzie said that he witnessed how politicians who had betrayed the SLFP and formed various other parties faced their destruction politically.
"Any political party involved with Bodu Bala Sena organisation are tend to lose at elections. The Sinhalese Buddhists are not chauvinistic. But a handful of persons are trying to do politics by fanning communalism," he said.
Fowzie said that the clash that took place between the police and a group of monks at Homagama court premises was an unfortunate incident and a balanced media coverage is needed.
