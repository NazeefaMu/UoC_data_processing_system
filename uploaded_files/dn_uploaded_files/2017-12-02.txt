Thousands in Sri Lanka suffer from hearing difficulties
"Over 0.3 million people in the island, especially schoolchildren, suffer from hearing difficulties and the National Council for the Deaf (NCD) provides a commendable service to help them," Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Ministry Secretary Shirani Weerakoon said.
She was speaking at the Annual General Meeting of the NCD in Colombo. NCD Senior Director Maud Senaratne and Director Shirani Dissanayaka were present.
Weerakoon said the Ministry was conducting programmes to improve persons with hearing disabilities by organising sports festivals and aesthetic programmes.
"Disability is a physical or a mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities," she said.
"The people are suffering from 10 types of disabilities and the difficulty in hearing is one," she said.
"The Ministry takes action to safeguard the rights of persons with disabilities following the international convention of United Nations. "Providing special entry facilities required for the persons with disabilities in public buildings, sign language as a recognized language, forwarding cabinet papers to establish the sign language are some of them," she said.
The Ministry offer medical equipment since even a small device could change the whole life of persons with disabilities, she said.
She said people with disabilities like to live without being a burden to society. "Many with disabilities used to engage in economic activities," she said.
Persons with auditory disabilities have a vocal code disability as well. Therefore, offering them hearing aids will help them talk as well, she said.
Weeerakoon said popular writers created fantastic stories while sitting on wheelchairs looking at the sea. "Thousands of melodies were composed by those who could recognise the world only in black; millions of arts and crafts were created by people with disabilities," she said.
She said they were rich and brave to travel but waiting till the world was opened for them to step in and explore its beauty. NCD Senior Director Maud Senaratne said the Council was managing a school for deaf children of low income groups and its students were directed to job-orientation programmes.

AG to attend international asset recovery forum
A high level delegation from Sri Lanka, led by Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, will travel to Washington, D.C., next week to headline a conference on global asset recovery.Asset recovery is the process of recovering funds that were taken through corruption or graft and hidden in offshore bank accounts.
Though Sri Lanka has never completed a high-level asset recovery case, countries like Nigeria and the Philippines have successfully recovered millions of dollars that were stolen by corrupt public officials.The Sri Lankan government will have several bilateral meetings, and it will be essential to see what the outcome of the (forum) will be, said Asoka Obeyesekere, the executive director of Transparency International Sri Lanka, at a press conference Thursday.
Its encouraging to see they are working with experts in this area, he added. However, as for the progress on all of this, theres a question mark there.Under the current laws in Sri Lanka, the state needs a criminal conviction in order to start the asset recovery process, Obeyesekere said.
This could slow the recovery process down in a majority of cases, and Sri Lanka should look at reforming its laws. The important message to get through on this point is that we dont need to depend on criminal justice proceedings to ensure that assets can be recovered and returned to Sri Lanka, he said.Although there is no official estimate of how much public money has been hidden overseas, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne in 2015 said that a minimum of USD$ 10 billion had been deposited in foreign accounts by Sri Lankans, including USD$ 3 billion at the National Bank of Dubai.
These are things that belong to the citizens of this country, Obeyesekere said Thursday. So the return of these assets is essential.A delegation of Sri Lankan government officials, along with civil society groups like Transparency International, will attend the Global Forum on Asset Recovery in Washington from December 4-6.
The event is hosted by the US and UK, and will highlight the cases of Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and Ukraine.

Anderson 'bullies' rant a bit rich, says Aussie captain
Adelaide: Steve Smith returned fire Friday after a taunt by James Anderson that Australia are bullies, calling the England paceman one of the biggest sledgers in cricket as insults flew ahead of the second Test.
Smith also denied laughing at England over the Jonny Bairstow headbutt incident in what has become a fiery build-up to the first day-night Ashes Test, at Adelaide Oval from Saturday.
Fast bowler Anderson called the Australian team "bullies" in a newspaper column as the tourists fume over the reaction to the Bairstow controversy, following their 10-wicket defeat in Brisbane.
The Australians used the incident, described by Bancroft as "weird" greeting by Bairstow, to get under the wicketkeeper's skin as England collapsed in their second innings.
Anderson declared in his column: "A bully waits until they are in the ascendancy to pounce on people. That is what Australian teams do."
Smith didn't hold back when asked for his response to England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker.
"I read the article. I think it's interesting coming from Jimmy calling us bullies and big sledgers," Smith told reporters.
"I think he's one of the biggest sledgers in the game to be perfectly honest with you."Smith recounted times in his career when he was targeted by Anderson.
"I remember back in 2010 when I first started and wasn't any good, he was pretty happy to get stuck into me then," he said. "Interesting coming from Jimmy."
Smith also said he wasn't mocking the England team when he laughed along as Bancroft recounted Bairstow's headbutt in a Perth bar earlier in the tour.
England skipper Joe Root on Friday said he was "very disappointed" at Smith's reaction and that his team would use it as motivation.
"I certainly wasn't mocking his team. I was laughing at Cameron and the way he delivered the events of what had happened," Smith said.
"He was very dry and different in the way things came across. You guys got a good laugh out of it as much as I did.
"I'm happy to clarify that with Joe Root, no problem there at all."
Smith, who announced an unchanged team, said despite all the noise he didn't believe the Ashes series would boil over.
"I don't think so. It's an Ashes series, there's always that banter on and off the field," he said.
"I think it's just about playing the game, getting out there and playing cricket and getting on with it."
The Australia skipper said it was up to the umpires and match referee to keep a lid on things on the field.
"From my point of view it's about playing good, hard, aggressive cricket," he said.
Smith said he "out-performed" England's bowlers in Brisbane, but expected them to come back hard under the Adelaide lights.
"You're only as good as your last game. I out-performed them last game, there's no doubt they'll come out hard again," he said.
"They're good bowlers, they've got good skills. As a collective batting group we'll have to be at our best to score runs against them." Smith was the point of difference in the Brisbane Test victory with his match-turning unbeaten 141 off a marathon 326 balls.
He said he was prepared to do it all over again in Adelaide.
"That's cool. I'm happy with that, I love batting so I'm happy to stay out there for as long as I can to be perfectly honest," he said.
"If it takes me 300 balls to get a 100, then it'll take me 300 balls.
"That'll also tire the bowlers quite a bit too, so it's a bit of a win-win, if that's the case."

Courtroom dramatics support politics of progress
Much of the interest in politics this week moved to the courts, with important decisions being taken in the judiciary on issues that have been the subject of public interest and political rivalry. The matter that stood out was the petitioners in the Local Government Polls case, the subject of heavy and angry political debate, deciding to withdraw their petitions, which will enable the proposed Local Government to be held with no further delay.
This was a key political issue with allegations that the petitions were filed by six supporters of leading SLFP members in government, and it was a ruse adopted by the SLFPers to postpone the LG polls, now nearly two years late. The situation has led to two motions of No Confidence in the Minister of Local Government & Provincial Councils, Faiszer Musthapha, being submitted in Parliament by the Joint Opposition (JO) and the JVP.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha
The petitions filed in the Court of Appeal (CA) requested the gazette notification issued by the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, on recommendations of the demarcation of wards in certain local bodies, to be considered as illegal, and declared null and void through a writ of mandamus. Minister Faiszer Musthapha came in for heavy criticism on this matter, from both the Opposition and Government benches, including the JO, JVP, UNP backbenchers, with many allegations that these petitions were a move to further delay the local polls, due to be held in early 2018.
There was much relief for Minister Musthapha when able to inform Parliament that discussions held with the petitioners, after the intervention of the Prime Minister and other party leaders; they had agreed to withdraw the petitions. The Minister said the complaints and the concerns of the petitions would be addressed in the best possible manner. Earlier the CA had issued a stay order on implementing the provisions of the related Gazette notification, and had observed the action taken in issuing the Gazette had been ultra vires. The CA had also decided against taking up the writ petition on November 30, as requested by the Attorney General the previous day (29th), as a matter of urgency, instead of the earlier scheduled date of December 4, 2017.
Meanwhile, the Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, had already made arrangements to hold the election to 133 local bodies, not covered by the subject of the petitions in court. The situation is now clear for elections to be held to all local bodies.
The path seems clear, for the LG polls to be held in January next year, which would see the rivalries between the UNP, SLFP, and the JO and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) seek the support of voters. This remains a matter of much political debate and disagreement, with moves still being made to arrive at some understanding between the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena and the SLPP informally led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The likelihood of a good understanding being reached is now most unlikely, with Mahinda Rajapaksas demand that the SLFP give up all relations with the UNP. But the stuff of politics is such, and the possibility of unprincipled arrangements is not ruled out, and the politics of the gallery remains a strong reality.
Gotabhaya and Medamulana Museum
The Courts came into focus again with the CA upholding the petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa seeking an interim order preventing the police from acting against him under the Public Property Act. The CA did giver an interim order effective till December 06, preventing the Police from acting under the Public Property Act against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, related to a Magisterial Inquiry with regard to a complaint relating to the D. A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial at Medamulana, Hambantota. DA Rajapaksa was the father of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
The CA upheld petitioner Rajapaksas position that the charge of any offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or a violation of his legitimate expectations.
The Additional Solicitor General Dilrukshi Dias Wickremasinghe, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, did raise objections to the ex parte order by the CA, stating that no notice had been given to the respondents, prior to delivering an interim order. She said she was appearing in court only after reading a report on the case, and the Attorney General would make submissions on the next date, seeking a vacation of this interim order.
The case echoes a matter of much public interest, with Rajapaksa seeking to avoid arrest on the alleged charges relating to the DA Rajapaksa Museum, possibly seeking to show an alleged involvement in money laundering, stating that there is no related offence whatever.
The interim order of the CA, which is certainly beneficial to the petitioner Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, raises other matters outside the Court, which have been the subject of much political interest in recent weeks. This goes back to the discussions that a group of the Sangha had with President Sirisena about a possible arrest of Rajapaksa, and opposing it.
It also related to the statement by Ven Prof Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera that they had urged President Sirisena to settle the case in Court without resorting to wholly unnecessary exercise meant to harass one of those who had served the country risking his life, in the battle to defeat the LTTE. The Thera was speaking at an Eliya meeting addressing the media held at the National Library and Documentation Services Board, Colombo. The Ven Thera said Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was being hounded for building a memorial to his father, whereas the government was turning a blind eye to the LTTE celebrations in the North. The Thera warned the government of dire consequences if it demoralized the armed forces.
There have also been other warnings by members of the Sangha that they would launch a protest if any move is made to arrest Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Also, there is a new organisation of leading personnel of the military involved in the battle against the LTTE has been formed, which also opposes any move to arrest Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. This is the politics of the Rajapaksa Drive, a new political initiative that has the support of intellectuals, former military personnel, and the Sangha, moving towards a new opposition to the goals in a new constitution.
What is important in the Interim Order of the Court of Appeal in the Gotabhaya Rajapaksa petition is that there is hardly any need for a major public protest or threat of action against any move to arrest this Rajapaksa; because the matter could very well be resolved in the Courts, on the basis of legality. This shows there is a definite improvement in the independence of the judiciary as seen in the past two years, and it would be best for the progress of society in the legal process being adhered to, rather than threats of varying types. There was also another group that said the President should pardon Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for any mistakes he made. Very good. But a pardon requires being found guilty first, which is a legal process.
Namal case
While the two above matters were taken up at the Court of Appeal, the Colombo High Court also saw an important case taken up, with the case against Namal Rajapaksa and five others for their alleged involvement in laundering Rs. 30 million through Gowers Corporate Services being fixed for trial on December 13.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Gower Corporate Services on 11 counts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs. 30 million in Gowers Corporate Services Pvt. Ltd, owned by Namal Rajapaksa, between 2013 and 2014. It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services provided coordination services to Sri Lankan Airlines. The complaint in this regard alleged that Namal Rajapaksa an MP, had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and later set up Gowers Corporate Services, while being an MP, from Rs. 125 million earned through illegal means.
This is a case that has been investigated by the FCID and is among several matters that were highlighted in the early days of the UNP-SLFP coalition, and is now coming up for judicial action, in what is believed to be the coming to reality of the pledge to fight corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime, which was a key policy of President Sirisenas campaign for election.
It is certainly welcome to see such matters come before the courts, with the anticipation that the setting up of three new High Courts to hear the lined up cases of fraud and corruption, would lead to a welcome change in the governments implementing of the pledges to fight corruption, both then and now.

Dhananjaya de Silva ready for the challenge
DELHI, Friday  Dhananjaya de Silva said that he was ready for the challenge to take up the number three position or to open the batting for his country after being named as replacement to Lahiru Thirimanne for the third and final Test against India starting at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Saturday.
I have opened in international matches in T20s and ODIs. In Tests I have not opened so far. First time it could happen in a Test, said De Silva.
I played as an opener for Sri Lanka Under-19 and I am opening the innings for Tamil Union in domestic cricket. It will be a big challenge opening in a Test match, but I am looking forward to the challenge.
If Sri Lanka opts for seven batsmen De Silva could be asked to turn his arm around bowling his off-breaks but he doesnt mind that.
I will be playing like an all-rounder doing lots of bowling as well. My role will be as a batsman. Mostly I will have to bowl about ten overs or so and I will have to focus more on my batting, said De Silva.
De Silva began his Test career on a high note with his first two Test series against Australia and Zimbabwe producing 550 runs at an average of 61 with two centuries and two fifties before he suffered a slump in South Africa that continued into the series against Bangladesh and India.
De Silva was sent to West Indies in October to lead the Sri Lanka A side and regain his batting form. He returned on a high with an average of 52 inclusive of one century and two fifties in the three-match unofficial test series against West Indies A that Sri Lanka A won 2-1. This performance won him a place in the Sri Lanka Test side to India where he is now on the verge of making a comeback to the Test team.
Theres a time you score runs and then you go through a tough period. I didnt do anything special. Wanted to score some runs and just keep to the basics and things started going my way during the West Indies tour, said De Silva.
Avishka Gunawardene the coach with the A team gave advice to do simple things like watch the ball closely and play. That has been helpful for me. I have done that and I am glad to be back among the runs. I have worked hard to get back into the side and I am looking forward to make the most of the opportunity. I have got my rhythm back and I will try to continue it here, he said.

Djokovic brings Stepanek into coaching team
Paris: Former world number one Novak Djokovic said Thursday Radek Stepanek was joining his coaching team to complement Andre Agassi. Agassi and former doubles specialist Stepanek will replace the Serbs former coaching duo of Boris Becker and Marian Vajda.
He parted company with Becker last year and ended a seven-year association with Vajda in May after seven years working together.
Not long ago, @radek_stepanek and I were on the opposite sides of the net. Now we are teaming up to chase new goals together and share the love for the game. What exciting times we have ahead of us! Djokovic said in an Instagram post.
Stepanek, a 39-year-old Czech, ended his career two weeks ago after 21 years on the circuit during which he won two doubles titles at Grand Slams.
Djokovic has slipped to 12th in the world since an elbow injury forced him to end his season in July.
He is expected to return to action at an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi on 28-30 December. AFP

Edgbaston 1981  the forgotten miracle
[Continuing our series]
Edgbaston 1981 will always be the Salieri Test, an overshadowed masterpiece due to its proximity to the greatest of all time, a Magical Mystery Tour too often swamped by the wake of Headingleys Sgt Pepper. Yet in truth it is part of a double-header, two stunning Tests that serve to embellish the other, part of a pair of symbiotic matches central to the almost mythical aura of the 1981 Ashes.
With England having levelled the series at 1-1 in Leeds the nine days between Tests had not been quite as smooth as might be imagined. After arguably the greatest victory in Ashes history it seems almost perverse that England opted to drop a player and rejig the batting lineup but that they did.
Graham Dilley, despite his heroics with the bat in the third Test, was axed and John Emburey brought into the side. Indeed with the Edgbaston pitch expected to turn the prospect of playing two spinners was discussed, but squeezing Derek Underwood into the XI would have meant leaving out Chris Old and going into the Test with only two seamers or dropping a batsman and moving Emburey higher than his capabilities to No7 in the order.
The tinkering compulsion that once infected English cricket did lead to one other change though, with Graham Gooch, who scored nought and two opening at Headingley, moved down to four in the order. Mike Brearley shifted up from No3 to open with Geoff Boycott, with David Gower also moving from No4 to first wicket down, much to his chagrin, though probably not to his great surprise  even after victory at Edgbaston England opted to make a further three changes for the fifth Test.
The squad  in particular Bob Willis and Ian Botham  had been engaged in a standoff with the media, the smoothing over of which took up a fair chunk of Brearleys pre-match time. Still, the royal wedding of Charles and Diana on Wednesday 29 July had helped stoke the fires of national fervour ignited by victory in the third Test and plenty of flag-waving could be seen on the Edgbaston terraces the following morning as England won the toss and opted to bat.
Dennis Lillee at first struggled to extract anything from the pitch, but Terry Alderman bowled with the nagging line, length and movement that was to cause so many problems to Englands batsman on a more successful tour for Australia eight years later and finished with five for 43 as England, throwing bat at ball with success-addled abandon, were bowled out for 189.
Half-consciously, we may have wanted to produce carnival cricket to match the flag-waving post-nuptial atmosphere of the day, wrote Brearley in Phoenix from the Ashes, his account of the series. We threw away wickets gratuitously. By the end of the first day, on a flat pitch, 12 wickets had fallen for 208 runs, with John Dyson and Allan Border falling to Old before stumps.
As it had done for much of the series, the game ebbed and flowed wildly on the Friday. Despite English aggression Australia reached 203 for five, but then the home side struck back taking the last five wickets for 53 runs. Still, Australia had amassed 258, a useful lead of 69, and England had been left with an awkward hour to bat until the close. Brearley could not survive but Boycott and Gower saw the home side reach 49 for one.
The following day Boycott (29 from 136 balls) and Gooch (21 from 93) occupied the crease without too often troubling the scorers but when Ray Bright did for them both, Peter Willey and Botham soon followed back to the pavilion leaving England 115 for six and only 47 runs ahead. Old and Mike Gatting took the attack to the Australians and put on what would prove to be a crucial 39 before Old fell to Alderman and Gatting was bowled round his legs by Bright, leaving England eight wickets down and only 99 runs ahead.
Emburey, with only Bob Taylor and Willis for support, was sent out after tea to attack. An hour later he and the wicketkeeper had put on 50 for the ninth wicket and although the final two wickets fell quickly after that, leaving Emburey 37 not out, England had reached 219, leaving Australia 151 to win.
Their batsmens nerves were clearly jangling as they tried to survive that unpleasant 40 minutes before the close of play, reckoned Brearley, whose side winkled out Graeme Wood before stumps. But he struggled to share the optimism of the crowd of victory-expectant punters for whom he signed autographs outside the dressing room that evening: I was more doubtful; lightning doesnt, does it, strike twice
This, after all, was a good batting pitch, not the occasional fruit machine of Headingley. Brearley believed the chase an even easier target (given the conditions) than in the previous match. On Saturday evening Englands refuelling for the big day ahead went well, though - Brearley returned to the team hotel to find that Botham had persuaded Mike Gatting into going out for a Chinese takeaway.
The following morning Willis, as he had at Headingley, thundered in like a man possessed and removed Dyson and Kim Hughes leaving Australia 29 for three but Border and Graham Yallop took the tourists to 62 for three at lunch.
Yallop was bowled by Emburey with the score on 87 but it was the fall of Borders wicket, with Australia still 46 runs shy of the target, that changed the day. The future Australian captains 175-ball 40 was only the fourth-highest score of the match but certainly the most dogged. Border had woken up on the Saturday morning so ill that Hughes had asked Brearley if England wouldnt mind waiting for his return should the batsman be caught short at the crease. Brearley refused and in the end it took a remarkable ball from Emburey rather than a dash to the toilet to remove the Australian No3.
At that point the score was 105-5, writes Brearley. I had been uncertain who to bowl at the other end from Emburey. Botham was strangely diffident. He felt that others should bowl before him; the ball was not swinging or bouncing  he wondered how he would get anyone out on this pitch.
But with Border back in the hutch Brearley felt it was time for Botham to enter the attack. Just keep it tight for Embers, the captain told his bowler. Following his captains orders he kept it incredibly tight, conceding just one run from his 30 deliveries. And from nowhere he cleaned up the remaining five Australian wickets in the space of 28 remarkable balls.
Having rediscovered his mojo at Headingley, Botham had gone back into his shell at Edgbaston. A 43-ball 26 and an 11-ball three had sandwiched a largely fruitless spell of one for 64 in the Australian first innings. His nine overs in his first spell in the second had been frugal, with just 10 runs conceded, but wicketless.
With the third ball of his new spell that changed. Rodney Marsh swung across the line and lost his middle stump. The crowd has gone noisily berserk, noted Richie Benaud on the TV commentary. And the 10,000 in Birmingham were still roaring as Botham charged in and trapped Bright lbw with the next delivery. Lillee jabbed and missed at the hat-trick ball but was soon caught behind by a juggling Taylor. Martin Kent was bowled off his pads attempting an ill-advised hoick to leg and Alderman played and missed at three balls, the last of which saw him castled. Bothams figures for the spell read 5-4-1-5 and Australia had crumbed from 105 for four to 121 all out.
I had bowled well  fast and straight  but on that wicket it should not have been enough to make the Aussies crumble that way, reckoned Botham. The only explanation I could find was that they had bottled out. The psychological edge that we  and I  had got over them at Headingley was proving an insuperable barrier for them.
From the brink of defeat England had once more snatched victory and Botham and Brearley had conjured a sequel up there with The Godfather: Part II.  theguardian

Five good qualities that we can learn from cricketers
Cricketers have always been role models for many youngsters. It is not just their batting, bowling or fielding that the fans admire, but it is also their attitude on and off the field that inspires one and all to be like them. Cricket has seen many iconic players over the years with every player exhibiting a unique set of qualities for fans to inculcate.
Let us have a look at 5 such qualities that can help us become a better person and excel in our careers.

#1 FOCUS 
- RAHUL DRAVID
The wall of Indian cricket Rahul Dravid is the epitome of the quality of focus. Dravid never lost focus from his goal of scoring runs and helping the team win matches. A rabid crowd, media pressure and opposition team's sledging never distracted him.
In one such incident when India was playing Australia in Mumbai (Border-Gavaskar trophy 2001), Dravid was supposedly caught by Michael Slater. On referring it to the third umpire it was given not out as the ball had fallen just short of Slater, as per replays.
Annoyed at the decision, Slater tried sledging Dravid and hurled abuses at him. But even after all this Dravid did not lose his cool and was extremely focused on the all-important game. After the match Slater quoted :
"Sledging Rahul Dravid was one the mistakes of my life. He did not lose his cool even when I was hurling abuses at him. I could not stomach the fact that he was single-handedly demolishing the best team in the world. When the rage wore out on me, I realised that I was an animal and he was a gentleman. He won my heart instantly."
Learn to stay focused - from Rahul Dravid, have a target in mind, focus on it and walk straight towards it, not getting bogged down by other factors.

#2 CHANNELING AGGRESSION 
- VIRAT KOHLI
Youth icon and star of Indian cricket, Virat Kohli is aggression personified. Very few bowlers in world cricket can resist Virat's fire and brimstone. Aggression is a double-edged sword, if not channeled correctly can go wrong.
In his early days, Virat too had this issue of demonstrating his aggression at the wrong place and time. One such instance was him showing the middle finger to the spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a Test match between India and Australia (January 2012).
But over the years, it has been correctly channelized - now the Indian skipper prepares aggressively, bats aggressively, runs aggressively between the wickets and thinks aggressively as a captain. His personal milestones and India's success prove how this has worked wonders. This is what former Australian captain Michael Clarke said in a press conference about Kohli:
Virat's aggression is one of his greatest strengths, that's the way he likes to play and that's how he has had success, and that is the way he will continue to play.
Learn to channelize your aggression from Virat Kohli. Put aggression into the task you are performing.

#3 PERSISTENCE 
- STUART MACGILL
Stuart MacGill is a former Australian leg-spinner who played 44 Tests and 3 ODIs for Australia between 1998 and 2008. In his 44 matches, he picked up 208 wickets at a staggering average of 29.02.
He is largely considered to be one of the most ill-fated cricketers. This is because he played in an era when another Australian leggie - Shane Warne - ruled the world when it came to spin bowling. Warne played between 1992 and 2007.
Competing against the spin wizard for selection, MacGill's place in the side always remained uncertain. But he did not give up or blame it on his fate. He persisted. He kept performing in first class cricket, piling up wickets.
He has an astonishing first-class record with 774 wickets in 184 matches. As a result of his persistence, he ended up playing 44 Tests for Australia, making a significant impact.
This is what he said about Shane Warne in an interview to ESPN Cricinfo -
"A lot of people ask me about Shane Warne but let me tell you, I never competed with another player - it's not massively helpful"
Stuart MacGill's persistence fetched him the baggy green
Learn to be persistent - from Stuart MacGill. Never give up on something just because you saw someone else doing it better than you.

#4 Self-belief 
- Sir Viv Richards
Walking like a don, crushing the gum between his teeth, Sir Viv Richards had a swagger about
him. Confidence can be seen in his walk, his batting stance, and his eyes. That body language intimidated the best of the bowlers. He is the epitome of self-belief. This quality of his helped him rip apart any bowling line-up.
Scyld Berry, cricket correspondent at The Telegraph, once said -
"Nobody has walked to the crease as Richards did. No choreographer, equipped with spotlights and sound effects, could have improved upon his natural entrance."
Learn Self-belief from Sir Viv Richards - having faith in your skill-set is a must to achieve success.

#5 Willpower 
- Yuvraj Singh
The six-sixes man, king Yuvraj Singh has an unwavering mind. A dogged Yuvraj battled cancer and also made a comeback to the national side in April 2012. Battling such a life-threatening disease requires resolute self-belief, which Yuvraj exhibited.
It was during the 2011 World Cup that Yuvraj started facing difficulty in breathing. After a thorough examination, it was found out that Yuvraj was carrying a malignant tumour about 14 cm in size between his chest and left lung.
It was his willpower through the treatment that got him through the terrifying situation and play the rest of the World Cup.
He didn't just play the World Cup but literally won it for the country. He was adjudged man of the tournament. Yuvraj is purported to not have informed the BCCI or the team management about his condition till the World Cup ended.
"I did not inform about it to the BCCI, team management or teammates. The World Cup was in India and was also Sachin's last chance to lift the trophy. So I overcame my fear and focused on winning the cup," he said at a press conference.
Although he recently failed the Yo-Yo fitness test - a new prerequisite for selection in the Indian team, given his willpower, he can surely make a comeback.
Learn willpower from Yuvraj Singh - having a strong mind very important to snap out of your funk.  Newsrepublic

Honduras elections: Controversial results spark mass protests
With no official results of last Sundays Presidential election being announced even by yesterday controversy over the winner has made Opposition supporters take to the streets in a mass protest alleging vote rigging and computer glitches.
Though President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the ruling National Party claimed victory, the first result of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) of Honduras released Thursday (27) stated that the presidential candidate of the Opposition Alliance, Salvador Nasralla, is ahead by almost five points.
Judge David Matamoros said that Nasralla adds 855,847 votes, representing 45.17 percent, with 57 percent of the polling stations counted. Hernandez, on the other hand, accumulates 761,872 votes, equivalent to 40.21 percent of the tables, he added.
However, 36 hours later the tribunals latest tally showed that with 92.62 percent of ballots counted, the center-right Hernandez had secured 42.92 percent of the vote, with Nasralla on 41.43 percent.
Although the Constitution of Honduras prohibits an incumbent President to run for office for a Second term, a controversial Court ruling which said that clause violates the fundamental rights of the President allowed Hernandez to contest the Presidency again. He came to power after elections held following a Washington inspired military coup against elected President Manuel Zelaya in 2009. He was accused of being a dictator.
On November 25th The Economist published an article suggesting that Hondurass ruling party may have had plans to distort the results of a general election to be held the next day. It presented excerpts and transcripts from a tape of what appears to be a training session for National Party poll workers, on which the article was based.
In addition to the presidency of the country, Hondurans voted for some 3,000 public offices, including the 128 deputies to the National Congress and 20 to the Central American Parliament, as well as the municipal councils of 298 mayoralties.
Columbian Congress approves peace accord
Columbian Congress approved a revised peace accord with the FARC rebel group on Wednesday night, a vote that was most likely the final hurdle in ratifying the troubled agreement whose earlier version had been rejected in a referendum earlier on October 2.
Both the Senate and House of Representatives, controlled by President Juan Manuel Santoss governing coalition, voted overwhelmingly for the agreement. But congressional opponents of the deal had walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote took place.
After years of talks in Havana, rebel and government negotiators announced in August they had reached a deal to end a half century of war which left more than 200,000 people dead. The next month, the rebels arrived to the port city of Cartagena, where the signing ceremony was held before world leaders and televised to the nation.
The agreement also guarantees former rebels representation in Congress, but it bans them from running in newly created districts in former conflict zones.
The two sides have said in coming weeks the rebels will leave their camps, relocating to a set number of sites throughout the country.
Brexit financial deal nearly completed
Reports from Britain confirm that the British Government has offered an improved financial compensation package to the European Union which would perhaps find approval at the next round of Brexit negotiations between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker scheduled for December 4.
The BBC, The Financial Times, The Guardian and several other British newspapers and media outlets are reporting that following a UK government Cabinet meeting last week, the British significantly upped their offer to Brussels, coming much closer than they previously had to the EUs estimate of the UKs financial obligations.
When May and Juncker meet in five days time, all three of the big issues will be on the table, namely: the divorce bill, EU citizens rights and the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
If the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier is satisfied that sufficient progress to have been made on all three issues talks may progress the Brexit talks into the next stage, with the final decision on that to be made at a European council meeting of the blocs leaders on December 14 and 15.
As the Irish Government is unhappy with the way the British Government has handled the border issue it may use its veto further stalling the negotiations.
China proposes three-stage solution to Rohingyan issue
Xinhua news agency reported that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has proposed a three-stage solution to help resolve the Rakhine, Myanmar issue.
China believes that the Rakhine issue can be addressed with an acceptable solution for both Myanmar and Bangladesh through consultations between the two neighbouring countries, Wang said at a press conference with the State Councillor and Myanmars Foreign Minister, Aung San Suu Kyi.
The international community and the UN Security Council should encourage such efforts by creating conditions and a good atmosphere for consultations, he added.
The Chinese proposal envisages, first, to reach a ceasefire so that local residents are no longer displaced.
Second, the international community should encourage Myanmar and Bangladesh to maintain communication to find a viable solution to the issue. The two countries reached an initial agreement to repatriate refugees who fled Myanmar to Bangladesh.
The third stage is to find a long-term solution. The Chinese minister stressed that poverty is the root cause of the conflict and called on the international community to support poverty alleviation efforts in Rakhine, Myanmar.

ICSE 2017 Conference begins in Colombo
The Second International Conference on 'Social Entrepreneurship'-Innovations in Social Enterprise for Development (ICSE 2017) was inaugurated at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute yesterday.
The Colombo School of Business and Management (CSBM) has organised the conference partnering with the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Bangkok and the Colombo Plan. India's High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu was the chief guest at ICSE 2017.
Colombo Plan Secretary General Kinley Dorji,Colombo School of Business and Management Chairman,Dian Gomes,Colombo School of Business and Management Head, Prof. Ranjith Bandara, Yunus Centre and Asian Institute of Technology Bangkok Director Dr. Faiz Shah and Sarvodaya Development Finance Chairman Channa De Silva were present at the inaugural session.
High Commissioner Sandhu spoke about the several initiatives and policy measures instituted by the Indian Government to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in India.
He said Sri Lanka also has a strong tradition of innovation, and that there is a lot that we can learn from each other. He also spoke about technology as a great leveller, and social entrepreneur has the potential to offer small solutions to big problems. He noted that innovation and entrepreneurship are critical for development, not just because they enhance productivity but they also address social issues in a novel manner. He urged Sri Lankan youth to make use of the varied learning opportunities provided by Government of India under Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, various scholarship programmes and S&T research innovation programmes.
"Innovation and entrepreneurship are critical for development. They enhance productivity by leaps and bounds. Thats not the only reason why it is important. They address social issues in a novel manner. They have the prowess to make societies more inclusive. They craft social empowerment. The theme of this years Conference, 'Building an Intellectual Economy to Foster Socially Innovative Enterprise Development' is apt in every sense.
"In todays day and age, technology is a great leveller. As Prime Minister Modi has said, today there is an "app" for filling every gap! A farmer can today find out the best farming methods, thanks to his mobile phone. A fisherman can tie up the best price for his days catch while still at sea. Students can access online courses from the best Institutes in the world, sitting in the comfort of their homes. Today, we see and speak with friends and relatives spread across continents almost daily, that too almost free. Behind all these sea changes, is not just technology, it is someone who found out the best use of technology to contribute to the society, a social entrepreneur who thinks differently.
"As human life expectancy increases, we may not be able to survive with learning just one trade to last a lifetime. We need to learn multiple trades spread over our life cycle. We need to learn, unlearn and relearn. Some of the trades which were relevant perhaps till yesterday are no longer relevant today. Wikipedia replaced Encyclopaedia Britannica. A Smart phone has replaced calculator, camera, computer and what not! Disruptive innovations have forced us to rethink on existing strategies and business models.
As you may be aware, the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) which India co-hosted with the United States concluded just yesterday in our tech-capital, Hyderabad. The US delegation was led by Advisor to the US President, Ivanka Trump. Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi spoke at the inaugural session. This was the first time GES was hosted in South Asia. This years theme was Women First, Prosperity for All. The event highlighted Indias enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship. There have been participants from over 150 countries at the conference, including Sri Lanka. Interestingly, over 31 percent of entrepreneurs at GES were 30 years old or younger. The youngest entrepreneur was just 13.
The Tech start ups in Bengaluru and Hyderabad have changed the face of modern India.
Sri Lanka also has a strong tradition of innovation. The magnificent rock fortress in Sigiriya is a stellar example of this tradition. The traditional irrigation systems in Sri Lanka are another example. Basawakkulama reservoir, which is used even now, was built as early as fifth century BC by King Pandukabhaya. It is also interesting to note that futurists like Arthur C.Clarke made Sri Lanka their home. There is a lot that we can achieve from each other.
India and Sri Lanka have been jointly funding S&T research and innovation programmes. This has further strengthened innovation and techno-commercial partnerships. In addition, India has been providing fully-funded training opportunities to Sri Lanka, under Indian Technical & Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme over the last several decades. A large number of ITEC slots are for entrepreneurship and innovation related subjects. The conference concludes tomorrow.

It will be interesting to see whether both sides are capable of playing open rugby, in todays game. Both teams are famous for playing good qu ality rugby and should give the large crowd something to cheer about.
Red shirts will hope to play their best available side as they are hampered and will play without some of the key players who were side lined due to injuries and thus far not recovered, hence will not play in todays match.
This season CRs plus point is their mobile pack, which is about the best equipped with some top class players in the calibre of Omalka Gunaratne, rolling maul pilot Supun Warnakulasooriya, Shemal Weerasekara, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Udara Gayn, Wageesha Weerasinghe and Sashika Fernando should deliver the goods together with the rest to grab ball position in the set pieces.
But in today's game CR and FC will rely more on their speedy three quarters. Their new halves combination of Kavindu De Costa and Chanaka Chandimal who paired off well in the last couple of games, should give their best.
Kavindu is an intelligent player, and has class written in his play, as he often draws the opposition defence and finds the gaps with his clever foot movements for the fast moving three quarter line to do the scoring.
Mean while the Kandy SC who thrashed Air Force SC last week in their own den at Nittawela will be fielding the same victorious team which did duty for them and will be at full strength. One can easily expect a thrilling game from their playing fifteen.
Kandy SC coach, Sean Wijesinghe a former Sri Lanka national captain who is a master tactician will be out to guide his side to another win in this match. Wijesinghe is confident that his team would deliver the goods today.
But, one should keep in mind the CR side who has a superb three quarter line and if they play their usual brand of rugby under Fijian coach Fereti Verabula then they can pierce any team defence as their ball handling as they showed against the formidable Navy SC is the best seen this season against top opponents.
CR and FC (Probable XV)
Udara Gayan, Supun Warnakulasooriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Shemal Weerasekara, Charana Chamikara, Sashika Fernando, Vageesha Weerasinghe, Omalka Gunaratne, Kavindu De Costa and Chanaka Chandimal, Reeza Rafaideen, Kushan Indunil, Tharinda Ratwatte, Kavindu Perera (Captain),Rehan Silva
Kandy SC (Probable XV):
Ganuka Dissanayaka, Damith Dissanayaka, Ashan Darling, Dimithri Wijethunga, Soyuru Anthony, Asitha Wijesinghe, Jason Dissanayake, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratne and Fazil Marija or Nigel Ratwatte, Richard Dharmapala, Danushka Ranjan, Gayan Weeraratne (Captain), Anurudda Wilwara, Thilina Wijesinghe
Havies -Army should be a close game
The battle between two top rugby sides in Havelocks SC and the Army SC in their Dialog 'A' Division inter-club league rugby first round match for the 2017/18 season at Ratmalana today should turn out to be a close game. The match will kick off at 4.00 pm.
Havelocs have been training really hard under their new captain and Sri Lanka national player Jason Melder during this week and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Army SC on the other hand trained really hard this week under the watchful eyes of their new head Coach Veteran Nilfer Ibrahim who is also a former Sri Lanka national sevens and the present St.Joseph college 1st XV rugby team head coach.
Soldiers will have to be at their level best if they are to beat the Havies outfit at Ratmalana.
But looking at the two teams, Havelocks will definitely go out as the favourites to clinch this contest.

Mayweather adopts panda, names it after himself
Shanghai: He hardly has a reputation as the cuddly type, but Floyd Mayweather displayed his softer side as he adopted a baby giant panda in China -- and promptly renamed it TMT Floyd Mayweather.
The 40-year-old American boxing star will, however, have to leave the panda at its home in southwest China and the 100,000 yuan ($15,000) adoption fee paid by him and another sponsor will go to the research centre where it lives.
TMT is Mayweathers brand, short for The Money Team, a nod to the vast wealth he accrued boxing and now regularly flaunts.
Mayweather retired for a second time this year after stopping MMA star Conor McGregor to improve his record to 50-0.
Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding showed pictures of the visiting Mayweather admiring and feeding his panda an apple and taking a selfie.
His adopted panda was born in July 2016 and was previously called Maodou, or soy bean.
Mayweathers donation allows him to visit the panda and have it called by the name he wishes for a year, as well as receive greeting cards from the animal.
Mayweather is on a tour of China that is taking in Beijing, Chengdu, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau.
He has not made clear the trips purpose but implied on Instagram that he was being paid.
Coming here with 23 people has been a great experience and it doesnt hurt to get paid $3,000,000 to simply visit and vacation here in luxury for a few days, Mayweather said in a posting this week that accompanied a photo of him on the Great Wall. AFP

New heart valves, tissue bank at LRH opened
The new bank of heart valves and tissues constructed at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children at Borella at a cost of Rs. 100 million was opened by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne recently.
Minister Senaratne speaking at the ceremony thanked the Rotary Club for assisting the project. Heart surgeries at the hospital commenced in 2007 but the hospital faced difficulties in finding heart valves to carry out transplants and an artificial heart valve cost it Rs. 300,000.
Minister Senaratne said the tissue bank was proposed to construct in 2012 but it did not happen due to lack of funds. In 2014, the Cabinet approval was granted to build the tissue bank.
Now children undergoing heart surgeries at the hospital would receive human heart valves free of charge. Ven. Bandagiriye Somawansha Thera, officials from the Rotary Club, Health Ministry and others were present.

No Indian cricketer can wear Tendulkars No 10 jersey
Sachin Tendulkars iconic no. 10 jersey will never be worn by any cricketer during a senior international match. Sachin Tendulkar is regarded as the best batsman to have ever played for India, and his 34,000 plus runs in international cricket is testimonial to the fact.
While wearing the India blue in ODIs, Tendulkar, most of the times, used to wear No 10 jersey, which has become an iconic number too, and the BCCI has retired that number. The BCCI seems to have followed on the path of Mumbai Indians, who had already retired the number for the franchise.
Cricketers too have refrained from using Tendulkars jersey number while playing for India.
However, pacer Shardul Thakur, while playing for the senior team recently, was spotted with the number 10 jersey and the 26-year-old became a target of trolls on the internet with fans taking a dig at the bowler for wearing the iconic number. The unnecessary controversy over Thakur wearing that jersey this might have prompted the board to decided to retire the number officially. It also means that Thakur was the last person to wear that jersey in India colours.
However, one has to understand that cricketers, who are involved in other matches like India A or at the junior level can wear the jersey number. It is only at the international level that the number has been retired.
It unnecessarily creates controversy and players get criticised. So its better to retire the number unofficially. Players, though, can wear it when they play for India A or for say a non-international list A match but not during an international, The Indian Express quoted a BCCI official as saying.
The BCCI retiring number 10 jersey is another way to pay tribute to Tendulkar, who served India cricket for more than two decades.

Obama to work for better US-China ties
CHINA: Former US President Barack Obama has met President Xi Jinping, with the former US president hoping to improve ties between their two countries, China's state media said, as relations between Beijing and Washington are tested over North Korea.
Obama met Xi on Wednesday in Beijng at Diaoyutai Guest House, a sprawling complex frequently used to house visiting leaders. Obama was in China as part of a world speaking tour.
Obama told Xi he was willing to continue to play a positive role in enhancing mutual understanding and cooperative exchange between the US and China, according to state broadcaster China Central Television, which featured the meeting in its prime-time news show.
Obama said it was in the interest of both countries to develop a constructive relationship, according to CCTV.
Xi said that China and the US share a common interest and responsiblity in safeguarding world peace and stability.
The meeting came not long after North Korea conducted its latest ballistic missile test.
In response the United States warned North Korea's leadership that it will be utterly destroyed if war breaks out, but its call for nations to cut ties with Pyongyang was rejected by Moscow while Beijing sidestepped talk of an oil embargo.
Chinese state media did not say if the topic was discussed by Xi and Obama.
The state broadcaster said Xi told Obama about the achievements of China's recently concluded 19th Communist Party Congress when he was installed for another five year term.
Obama began his trip to China on Tuesday with a speech to the Global Alliance of SMEs Summit in Shanghai, a non-government organisation promoting small business interests.
He also met Liu Cixin, a prolific Chinese science fiction writer and author of the award-winning The Three Body Problem series.
Obama was set to leave China on Thursday for India where he is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Prophet Mohamed led path of peace: Palestine Ambassador
Prophet Mohamed practised a religious path of peace and encouraged his adherents to do the same, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine M. Fawzan Anwer states in a message to mark the birthday of Prophet Mohamed.
Prophet Mohamed epitomised unity and brotherhood in his life, and he taught the importance of compassion, tolerance and equality. The Holy Prophet throughout his life practised what he preached and he espoused an ordinary and simple life. In his teachings, he never failed to emphasise the values of truth and justice in a society and the importance of building a disciplined community of people. Prophet Mohameds profound teachings are vital in building and fostering reconciliation and unity among different communities, the statement says.
A Muslim respects and accepts the opinions of different juristic schools. He should never fight or quarrel with anyone, even those who are different from him in stances and conduct. He lives in peace, leaves others to enjoy peace, and trains himself to be peaceful and forgiving, the Ambassador in his statement says.
The celebration of the Holy Prophets birthday is therefore an occasion to recall the spirit of peace and harmony that the Prophet preached for 23 years. Today, it inspires Muslims and others towards living the kind of lives that honour Islams principles of communion and love towards fellow mankind. Let me take this occasion to wish all Muslims a peace filled Milad-un-Nabi, he states.

On the road to unity
Some say that the Lankan government emerged victorious in the war against Tamil rebels but failed to win the hearts and minds of the Tamil population; however the truth is that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tried to settle the issue without bloodshed but both Prabhakaran and Mahinda Rajapaksa together did not allow that to happen. Not long after the end of the war began the attack on the Muslims under the fascistic regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Revolutionary masses got together and defeated the fascistic regime expecting democracy and justice.
However the present yahapalana government has so far miserably failed in creating an environment facilitating co-existence for its minority citizens. This is an indictment on the President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Both of them singularly and collectively lacked the political will to take affirmative action in the matter of race relations, says one analyst.
The Prime Ministers frequent emphasis on the drive towards development, luring foreign direct investors etc. is doomed without the national problem being adequately addressed. No foreign investor will be willing to park his funds in a country overshadowed by chronic national racial tension. Even the local investors are looking elsewhere. Insecurity of communal clashes is a major factor among all, which would remain a threat to stability and growth prospects of any economy.
Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR)
Ensuring law and order by ordering the police and military to a trouble spot is simply treating the symptom; not the solution to the fundamental problem faced by the country. What the country needs is a solution based on equality, autonomy and the right of self determination.
The creation of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and the establishment of a separate Ministry for National Integration and Reconciliation are steps in the right direction. The vision statement, To build a strong integrated Sri Lankan Community whilst protecting socio-cultural value system . of the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation is indeed encouraging. So is the thematic focus of ONUR, Build an inclusive society by promoting social integration. Support the healing process within communities. Bring youth and children to the forefront in building national unity and reconciliation.
Then came, the bad news. The discussion to work together with the Mahinda group started within the SLFP led by the President; because of the desperation of President Sirisena to make the SLFP significant for the coming elections.
President wants to go out of politics with the honour of recreating SLFP as a party of the common man. This is a populist dream, connected to probably insufficient understanding of the degeneration of the SLFP, during the last few decades. They want to close their eyes to the blatant fascistic decadence in the party and wanted unity of all factions of the SLFP, to make it popular among rural masses and a strong election machine.
Hence, some of the SLFP Ministers were seen recently making desperate attempts to get a conciliatory word from the former President or anyone of his close subordinates. Minister Susil Premajayanth, who never really broke from the fascistic politics and has always been with Mahinda Rajapaksa even after he joined the Yahapalanaya Government, had recently gone to meet his former boss with reported blessings of President Sirisena, while the Parliamentary group of the Joint Opposition was in session.
It is nice to hear that his frantic efforts had gone down the drain. There were reports several weeks ago that Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya who is a close ally of President Sirisena had unsuccessfully approached leader of the Joint Opposition and the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Dinesh Gunawardena with a suggestion to contest the local polls jointly in their area, in the Colombo district; apparently without much success. On the other hand Minister Vijitha Wijayamuni Soysa has jubilantly declared that the SLFP would face the elections with Mahinda Rajapaksa and his gang.
His statement of course was ridiculed as it was Wijayamuni who once, soon after Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated at the Presidential election, said that his father is now dead hence he will pay respect but leave to do politics with living relations. Now he also had tried his hand in reconciliation with the same deceased father. The allegation that the SLFP led by President Sirisenas attempts to delay the Local Government elections announced by the Election Commission to be held in January came because of hurried attempt to cook up a joint election front with the enemy who was accused of sinister political activities.
Mahinda faction and fascistic politics
However, Mahinda faction has developed their style of fascistic politics with racist pundits and bigoted intellectuals, and organised sections in many cities in the south. During the last few months they experimented with creating racist and anti-yahapalana violence. They are probably satisfied and that has made them to make up their minds to go solo at the forthcoming elections.
They appear to be firm in their demand that the SLFP group in the Government should sever links with the United National Party (UNP), if the two factions were to jointly face the polls. It is typical for a fascistic political leadership. This is a demand that will make the Maithri faction surrender completely. Many analysts say that it is impossible for the Maithri faction to meet this demand, as they know, that it would be suicidal for them, especially for the President, not only politically but also literally.
The President would be forced to grant some drastic concessions if this coalition with Mahinda faction will take place. Withdrawal of major legal actions taken against the leaders of the Joint Opposition, especially those against the members of the Rajapaksa family; in particular cases against Gotabhaya are on line. Such an event will be a blow to those reformists left and minority national organisations that still want to go along with the SLFP in the coming elections. Also, it will break the trust given by yahapalana to the minority nationalities; particularly to the Tamil national leaders.
Reconciliation between the two factions
According to reports, both the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the JO have appointed high-level representatives to hold talks in a bid to bring about reconciliation between the two factions, but former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has made some tough demands. Whatever happen, it appears highly improbable that President Maithripala Sirisena would agree to any move that severs links with the United National Party (UNP); So, no break-up of the National Unity Government.
After the general elections in August 2015, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga worked out a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the UNP and the SLFP to work together to bring about national and religious reconciliation and build a peaceful, just and all-inclusive society.
Whatever the disputes over economic issues such as the Hambantota Port and the Trincomalee oil farm projects, the overall strategies outlined in the Vision 2025 sustainable economic development goals are far more important than any policy disputes to the liberals. Therefore, the two main parties sans fascism -working together for the first time since independence may continue.

Root seeks to score heavily at cricketing alma mater
Adelaide: Joe Root said he hoped to contribute heavily with the bat as England seek to bounce back in the second Ashes Test in Adelaide, where he played as a teenager and trained under Australia coach Darren Lehmann.
Root scored 15 and 51 as holders England crashed to a 10-wicket defeat in Brisbane, stacking the odds of victory against them in the five-Test series.
The tourists head into the day-night game knowing that after losing the first Test, England have been beaten in every Ashes series in Australia since 1954-1955.
Adelaide has special resonance for Root, the 26-year-old Yorkshireman, who spent formative time as a cricketer in the South Australia city.
Much depends on Root scoring runs to bring home the Ashes urn, and he said it would be his greatest achievement to lead England to a series victory.
More than anything I am desperate to win this series, as a batter I want to contribute heavily in this series, said Root, who lies third in the Test batting rankings.
Individual stuff, Ill worry about that when Ive stopped playing, when Im sat commentating on England teams of the future and I can tell everyone how good I was.
For now, its just about doing everything I can to win this series, ultimately Ive just got to do whatever I can to win games of cricket in the next four games.
Personally, this would be the biggest achievement of my career so far.
If England win the series, Root will join illustrious post-World War II England skippers Len Hutton, Ray Illingworth, Mike Brearley, Mike Gatting and Andrew Strauss in leading a side to Ashes glory in Australia.
Root comes full circle in Adelaide, where he nurtured his game as a teenager. He spent five months in the city when 19 playing at the Prospect club.
I really enjoyed the city and working very hard at the Darren Lehmann Academy, he recalled. I think its quite funny how things work out, isnt it
At 19 years old I was working at his academy and now were in an Ashes series where he is the coach of the opposition side.
Off the back of his time in Adelaide, Root made his County Championship debut the following season.
So the work I did over the year and all the stuff that winter set me up for the following summer, it was instrumental in my development, he said. AFP

Russia calls doping allegation axis of evil plot
Moscow: Doping allegations against Russia are an attempt to brand Moscow part of an axis of evil, Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Friday ahead of his countrys possible expulsion from the Winter Olympic Games.
This is an attempt to create an image of an axis of evil. But this is all because we are such a great sport superpower, said Mutko, who was barred from attending the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio over the drug cheating scandal.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will meet on Tuesday to decide whether to ban Russia from the 2018 Winter Games in South Koreas Pyeongchang over allegations that it ran a state-sponsored doping programme for years.
Russia has already lost its top ranking in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games after being stripped of 11 medals for cheating.
Mutko, who served as sport minister from 2008 to 2016, also chairs Russias 2018 World Cup organising committee and was speaking at a press conference ahead of Fridays draw in the Kremlin for the group stage of the showpiece June 14-July 15 competition.
Dominating a press conference held jointly with the FIFA president Gianni Infantino, he said Russia played by the rules and added that he expected the IOC to presume Russias innocence going into Tuesdays meetings.
He said the government would defend its athletes to the last bullet. AFP

Russia ready for World Cup draw with Spain, the team to avoid
Moscow: The real countdown to the 2018 World Cup in Russia begins on Friday as the draw for the tournament is held at a star-studded ceremony in the Kremlin.
President Vladimir Putin is expected to address the footballing world that has descended upon Moscow, in the midst of a freezing Russian winter, to find out who will play who, when and where at the competition next year.
Putin and Russia will hope to make the draw itself a memorable occasion and turn the focus firmly to football, and the chosen setting, by Red Square and St Basils Cathedral, could scarcely be grander.
The build-up to Russia 2018 has been overshadowed by talk of the controversial awarding of the tournament in the first place, of the friction between Putins regime and the West, and of fears over terrorism and hooliganism. Russias sporting reputation has also taken a battering after investigations into widespread doping by its athletes, including at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.
But now footballs biggest superstars, from Lionel Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, will find out who stands between them and World Cup glory as the draw begins at 6:00 pm local time (1500 GMT) inside the State Kremlin Palace.
The draw is a historic event, an emotional stage of the preparations for the World Cup, said Vitaly Mutko, Russias Deputy Prime Minister and chairman of the World Cup organising committee who has also been implicated in the doping scandal, at a press conference on Friday.
The moment has come for Germany to discover who they will meet as they look to become the first nation to successfully defend the title since Brazil in 1962.
Messi and Ronaldo, the two players who have dominated the games biggest individual accolades over the last decade, will hope to avoid tough draws for Argentina and Portugal respectively in what will surely be their final opportunity to lift the trophy.
Germany, Brazil and Argentina are all in the first pot along with France, European champions Portugal, Belgium, Poland and the hosts.
But if those nations are certain of avoiding each other, danger lurks in pot two, where the Spanish -- the 2010 winners rebuilt into a formidable force by Julen Lopetegui -- lie along with England. Whatever happens we will accept it gladly and sportingly. I dont waste energy thinking about who I prefer and who I dont, said Lopetegui, but Spain and England must be crossing their fingers in the hope of being paired with Poland or the Russians.
FIFA will keep apart sides from the same continent with the exception of Europe, which has 14 representatives to go into eight groups.
Most sections will therefore contain two European nations, raising the prospect of England or Spain meeting Germany or France in heavyweight contests right away. France and Spain were even drawn together during one practice run of the draw, while alternatively, there is the possibility of England being drawn with Iceland, who humiliated them at Euro 2016.
Our mindset has to be that every opponent at this tournament is a team that can beat you. Equally, every opponent is a team we can beat, England manager Southgate told reporters on Thursday.AFP

Samurdhi Officers should be able to understand villagers: S.B.
"Samurdhi Officers work along with villagers who suffer many problems and the officers have to understand the problems and resolve them compassionately, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
The Minister was addressing the gathering at a meeting of newly appointed Samurdhi Officers in the Leadership Training programme carried out at the Sri Lanka Army Womens Centre at Sandunpura, Dehiaththakandiya on November 30.
Minister Dissanayake said the officers should be mentally strong to reach out to villagers and resolve their problems. "We decided to train Samurdhi officers by providing them with a counselling course to address this issue. If they were mentally strong, they could find solutions and guide people to change their lifestyles," he said.
"We introduced a new sign language course to educate disable students. With the School of Social Services under the ministry, we started a diploma course in sign language for students from Samurdhi families. First batch have passed out recently, and they would be appointed to schools and hospitals among others. to teach and serve disable people. As we all know, people with disabilities have extraordinary skills. We must identify them and use them to develop the country," the Minister said.
The Minister said the Samurdhi Campaign faced a setback during the last decade. "We lost at least Rs. 200 billion. The Samurdhi Campaign and its bank system collapsed. Innocent villagers got caught in micro finance mafia lending. If the former administration invested the money in reputed banks, we would have earned a big sum by now. We found that they have provided loans at 2 to 3 percent interest rate and sometimes interest free loans," Minister Dissanayake said.
The Minister said the system was now strengthened and was in a better position under the present government. "We have plans with a vision and are implementing one by one. Since we are strong economically, we can provide loans for poor people with good development plans," the Minister said.
"We decided to allocate Rs. 300 lakhs to update the Samurdhi Bank system. The banks will be digitalised soon so the people could repay via SMS being at their homes. We provide Rs. 1,500 for A/L students of Samurdhi families. They receive the money by 5th of each month until they finish their studies. "You have to keep in mind that you are not just doing a job but a service for the people of your country, the Minister reminded the Samurdhi Officers. "It is your duty to improve living standards of the poor." he said.

Three more Russians banned for Sochi doping
LAUSANNE Dec1: Three more Russian athletes were suspended for life on Friday by the International Olympic Committee for doping at the Sochi Winter Games in 2014.
The Oswald Commission, which is investigating allegations from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) of systematic state-sponsored doping by the Russians at the Games they hosted, announced that it had banned two cross-country skiers and a biathlete.
The only one of the trio to win a medal in Sochi was biathlete Olga Zaitseva who was part of the team that came second in the relay.
That medal had already been stripped after the Commissions ruling on Olga Vilukhina on Wednesday.
Zaitseva also won golds in the relay in Turin in 2006 and Vancouver four years later and silver in the mass start event in 2010. Zaitseva, who is 39, retired early in 2015.
The two cross-country skiers are Yulia Chekaleva and Anastasia Dotsenko. Chekaleva was in the Russian team that came sixth in the 4x5 kilometer relay. Dotsenko was part of the duo that also finished sixth in the team sprint.
The two results had already been rubbed out after the Commission banned Yulia Ivanova, who was on both teams, in November.
The IOC said in a press release that the Commission is still investigating 36 possible doping cases using additional findings from the re-analysis of tests and the forensic examination of sample bottles, which WADA said had been manipulated by the Russians.
The statement added that the Oswald Commission plans to complete all the hearings on athletes who are still competing and could qualify for Pyeongchang, before the Games start. AFP

We havent given up hopes of beating India - Chandimal
DELHI, Friday  Theres not much you can do to a team when it is down and out, the only way out of it is up and captain Dinesh Chandimal is hoping the change will at least come in the third and final cricket Test against India starting at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Saturday.
We have never won a Test match in India and I still have hopes that we can win this game. But as a team we need to do well on the day. If we can do that, definitely we can compete with the Indians. Thats what we are looking forward to, said Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal at the pre-match press conference.
In our life also we have ups and downs the thing is if you are losing and if you are going down you learn so many things how to come out of it. Ive learnt a lot of things in the past also when I was captain in 2014 and have executed them till now. Its a hard time for the team but I have a really good feeling we can change these things going forward, he said.
For Sri Lanka to make the captains dream a reality their top order batsmen must deliver. It has been the core problem in the past two years or so leading to Sri Lanka suffering two 3-0 whitewashes at the hands of South Africa and India this year.
They are already 1-0 down in the current three-match series and in danger of losing 2-0 unless they come up with a noteworthy batting performance which they have not produced against Virat Kohlis side in the last five Tests.
Thats a problem we have over the last 1 years especially the top five batsmen have to play long innings. We talk a lot about a lot of things at meetings. The problem is in the middle, where we are not executing them well according to the situation. Sometimes we dont realise the situations, sometimes the conditions. We need to first assess them thats the problem we have, said Chandimal.
As batters when you are in the middle, you need to execute team plans and your plans. Thats what we lost in the last one year or so and I am sure the guys will have different plans in the tomorrows game and they will do their best. The last game the batting let us down we had a really good chat after that and good meetings. As a team we have something up our sleeve I am sure the batsmen will come up with different ideas.
For the record Rangana Heraths innings of 67 he scored in the drawn first Test at Kolkata stands as the highest individual score made by a Lankan batsman so far in the series. That alone sums up how badly the top order batters have fared.
Chandimal took some pressure off former captain Angelo Mathews who has been targetted as one of the reasons for Sri Lankas poor scores as he has failed to deliver being the most experienced batter in the line-up with 71 Test caps.
Mathews is the senior batsman we have got in our batting line up but not only him there are other senior batsmen as well. Even the youngsters they have to take the responsibility when they are in the middle. So its not only about Angelo but others too have to stand up and perform in the middle, said Chandimal.
Mathews is averaging 21 with one fifty in the current series and has not made a Test hundred since August 2015 against India in 19 Tests.
India has not lost a Test match at this venue for 30 years the last defeat coming in 1987 at the hands of West Indies when Viv Richards hit an unbeaten century to steer his side home by five wickets.
THIRIMANNE OUT
As expected Lahiru Thirimanne has been left out of the squad of 12 named for todays Test with Dhananjaya de Silva coming into replace him. Thirimanne who made a return to the Test side against Pakistan in August has failed to fulfill the role he was expected to and has in the ongoing series been dismissed playing some rather bad shots.
However the big question is whether De Silva will bat at number 3 or as an opener because the team management are of the view that Sadeera Samarawickrama who has opened in the 3 Tests he has played so far is better equipped to play in that vital position. If that happens, then De Silva will be asked to open the batting with Dimuth Karunaratne. Its not that De Silva has not performed the role of opener before he has done so on a number of occasions in domestic cricket.
Also in the 12 is middle-order bat Roshen Silva whose inclusion will depend on what combination Sri Lankas wants to go with for the Test 6-5 or 7-4. In the first two Tests they had gone with six batsmen and five bowlers. The question is by going with seven batsmen whether they would risk putting extra burden on the bowlers knowing Indias batting strength where in the Nagpur Test they ran up a total in excess of 600 with four batsmen scoring hundreds.
With veteran spinner Rangana Herath out of the Test with a stiff back Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman will replace him. From their 15-member squad Sri Lanka have left out Thirimanne, Dasun Shanaka and Jeffrey Vandersay (who came as replacement for Herath).
LANKAN 12: Dimuth Karunaratne, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Dhananjaya de Silva, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal (captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Roshen Silva, Dilruwan Perera, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Gamage, Lakshan Sandakan, Vishwa Fernando.

A welcome move
One of the main pledges of the Rainbow Coalition at the Presidential and General Elections of 2015 was that all corruption cases would be investigated regardless of the political affiliations of the persons involved. When the National Unity Government was established in August 2015, there was a popular clamour for the investigation of acts of corruption committed during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime from 2005 to 2014 and the Government did indeed commence several probes into these alleged acts, some of which are still going on.
However, both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made it very clear that any acts of corruption or irregularity committed by those in the ranks of the two ruling parties will also not be tolerated in the same vein. True to their word, a number of high-profile ministers had to resign over certain allegations which have not even been proved yet.
It was also on this basis that the Government appointed a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the issuance of Treasury Bonds from January 2015 onwards. The Commission ended its proceedings after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave evidence  which was itself a historic first, as a sitting Prime Minister has never been previously called to appear before a Presidential Commission of Inquiry or other such body. Such an occurrence would have been unthinkable under any other administration in any case. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, the transparent mechanisms put in place by the Government have paved the way for credible investigations by various agencies of the Government.
While one can indeed comprehend the need for proving the post-2015 bond issues in the light of the facts that have come to light, many independent observers had questioned why the Treasury Bonds issuances from 2008 to 2014 are not being subjected to the same scrutiny by the investigating agencies as well as by the media. According to available evidence, these are much more problematic than the post-2015 issuances.
Now Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has rightly declared that these bond transactions will also be investigated once the on-going Presidential Commission probe into the Bonds issue concludes its work. Though belated, this is a welcome move. Making a special statement in the House on Thursday, the Prime Minister likened the method followed in Treasury Bonds issuances till 2015, to a pyramid scam.
Tabling a report obtained from the Central Bank on Treasury Bonds issuances from 2008-2014, the PM said the overwhelming majority of Bonds had been issued on direct private placements and that the process seriously lacked transparency. During the said period, Rs.5,147 billion worth of Bonds had been issued and out of that, Rs 4,702 billion had been direct private placements. Thus direct private placements accounted for 90 per cent of the total Bond issuances and the total value of Bonds issued from the public auction method stood at only Rs 435.5 billion. On the other hand, the present Government had only raised Rs.157.5 billion through direct private placements on four occasions since 2015.
It is clear that the bonds had been issued to a few selected primary dealers at arbitrarily decided interest rates without Monetary Board approval from 2008-2014. There is no doubt that the direct private placement method had been heavily misused under the previous regime. This must be investigated with the same vigor and speed exhibited by the relevant authorities which probed the post-2015 bond issues. Needless to say, this is only the tip of the iceberg as far as irregularities committed by the previous regime are concerned.
The present Government deserves plaudits for opting to shift to public auctioning, which is much more transparent and effective. US experts will help streamline this process. This is essential as the Government will have to raise more money through bonds in the future to meet development and economic targets aligned with the Vision 2025 plan. Moreover, a stronger economy will be a prerequisite to erase the debt burden that has primarily resulted from an uncontrolled borrowing spree by the previous regime.
It was also well known that the Colombo Stock Exchange was propped up during the previous regime through various scams to show some really amazing statistics found nowhere else in the world. The Prime Minister has also pledged to probe these large scale scams in the Stock Market, which is now performing well without any such artificial boost.
The Good Governance (Yahapalanaya) Government has ushered in a new political culture that aims to tackle corruption and malpractices at multiple levels without any fear or favour. As the Premier noted, this is a new experience of consensual governance and a complicated process. The road ahead is long and hard and the Government will have to negotiate the occasional traps and mistakes in this mission.
These can happen in the process of governance, but it is important to go forward after rectifying them. Significantly, the Government has promised not to cover up any wrong doing, trample the supremacy of the law and bury social justice in doing so. The voters who placed their confidence in the Rainbow Coalition deserve nothing less.

Windies reeling from Wagners seven-wicket barrage
Wellington: Neil Wagners career best seven-wicket haul saw New Zealand seize the honours on day one of the first Test against the West Indies in Wellington on Friday.
The South African-born left-armer, a fiery short-ball specialist, claimed seven for 39 as the West Indies crumbled to be all out for 134 in a first innings that lasted a mere 45.4 overs.
In reply, New Zealand were 85 for two at the close of play with Jeet Raval on 29 and Ross Taylor on 12.

Tom Latham (37) and Kane Williamson (one) fell in quick succession before Raval and Taylor cautiously added 17 in 8.3 overs through to stumps.
Although Williamsons batting skills deserted him, he did have luck on his side at the start of the day when he won the toss and put the West Indies into bat on a green wicket.
After the tourists safely progressed to 59 without loss, Wagner engineered a collapse that saw all 10 wickets fall in 22 overs for only 75 runs.
He was twice on a hat-trick as he posted his first seven-wicket haul and bettered his previous best of six for 41 against Zimbabwe last year.
The West Indies were full of confidence going into the match on the back of a recent series win over Zimbabwe and a Test victory against England, and the confidence grew as openers Kieran Powell and Kraigg Brathwaite progressed steadily passed the half-century mark.
But while New Zealands new-ball pair Trent Boult and Matt Henry were unable to generate swing or seam movement on a cloudless summers day, Wagner found bounce in the ripe conditions.
By digging the ball in short and angling it towards the rib cage he had his first success in his third over when Brathwaite went for 24.
Two overs before lunch, when the tourists looked to be recovering at 75 for one, Boult took a leaf out of Wagners book, using a short-ball to account for the West Indies top scorer Powell who made 42.
Wagner then hit a purple patch as he ripped through the West Indies new generation of specialist batsmen in the space of four balls.
Shimron Hetmyer went for 13 in the last ball before lunch, rising star Shai Hope fell on Wagners second ball after play resumed and debutant Sunil Ambris stepped back on his stumps with the first ball he faced in Test cricket.Roston Chase and Shane Dowrich mounted a short-lived revival with a 17-run partnership before Wagner was back in the action again with a rising delivery to Chase (five) that was steered to Jeet Raval at leg slip.
With Wagners first five wickets all from short deliveries, new batsman Holder stood tall for the first ball he faced, only for Wagner to switch to a yorker which bowled him, and 59 without loss had become 97 for seven.
Dowrich was run out at the non-strikers end for 18 and Boult bowled Miguel Cummins for one.
Kemar Roach (not out 14) put on 29 for the last wicket with Shannon Gabriel (10) before Wagner had Gabriel caught in slips to wrap up the innings. AFP

Woods happy after solid return in Bahamas
Miami: Former world number one Tiger Woods made a satisfying return in his latest comeback after a 10-month layoff punctuated by back surgery and personal problems. Woods fired a three-under-par 69 in the opening round of the Hero World Challenge at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas. The 41-year-old 14-time major champion carded five birdies and two bogeys in an encouraging first outing since injury forced his withdrawal at the Dubai Desert Classic in February. I thought I did great, said Woods, who is three shots back from leader Tommy Fleetwood, who posted a six-under-par 66. I hadnt played in a while after some difficulties, so to come out here and score like I did was nice, Woods added. Woods underwent back surgery in April.AFP
