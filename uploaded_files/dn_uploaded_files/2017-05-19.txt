Sri Lanka never failed to appreciate Saudi assistance:Muslim Affairs Minister
Sri Lanka never hesitated to appreciate the cordial assistance of the Saudi Government, Post and Muslim Affairs Minister M.H.A. Haleem said. He said so while accepting a 150 MT consignment of dates from the Saudi Government. The consignment was granted to be used during the Ramazan period of the Muslim people. The Minister said that it was a highly appreciate move of the Saudi Government to offers dates for the use of Sri Lankan Muslims annually.
The Minister added that there is a slight decrease of the volume of the consignment when compared with the previous years. Anyhow, the Sri Lankan Government highly appreciates the move of the Saudi Government and Saudi King to offer dates annually. When I asked the Saudi authorities about the reduction, they told me that there was a slight decrease in the harvest. However, they told me that the consignment would be increased when they receive a better harvest, he added. The Minister further said that Saudi and Sri Lanka have been maintaining a better rapport for decades. Owing to the strong bilateral ties, the Saudi Government is assisting in various sectors including development activities of Sri Lanka. The Secretary to the Post and Muslim Affairs Ministry Wasantha Hapuarchchi and a team representing the Saudi Government, participated on the occasion.

Study on promoting awareness on Intellectual Property
A study on promoting awareness on the role of Intellectual Property (IP) in promoting tourism-related economic activities and culture is underway in consultation with the National Steering Committee chaired by the Tourism Ministry Secretary and WIPO experts.
Last year, Sri Lanka was selected as one of 4 pilot countries - the others being Ecuador, Egypt and Namibia for the WIPO pilot project on Intellectual Property, Tourism and Culture.
Addressing the 19th Session of the Committee on Development and Intellectual Property (CDIP) held at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recently, Sri Lanka Permanent Mission Second Secretary in Geneva Dilini Gunasekera, outlining the progress achieved said, as part of future activities under the project, Sri Lanka looks forward to contributing to the development of teaching materials on IP related to tourism and promoting the inclusion of specialised curricula in tourism management schools and in national IP academies.
Areas such as Ayurveda, eco-tourism and agro-tourism may be considered for further cooperation through the project.
She said Marcelo Di Pietro, Director of Special Projects and South-South Corporation Division of WIPO who visited Sri Lanka last week to assess the progress achieved in implementing this project, held discussions with Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga, the Ministry Secretary, senior officials of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) which is the coordinating agency and other stakeholders from the private sector.

Sudu Nelum Movement boosted reconciliation move: Chandrika
A survey by a French company on Sri Lankan Buddhis before the Sudu Nelum Movement found that only 22.3 percent Buddhists wanted reconciliation, Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairperson and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said.
Addressing a workshop on National Unity and Reconciliation through Higher Education at the University Grant Commission Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, she said after implementing the Sudu Nelum Movement in two years, the percentage increased up to 68 percent. Political, religious and community leaders of Sri Lanka did not speak the language of peace to the people before, he said.
According to the former President, surveys showed a small number of people in Sri Lanka were interested in reconciliation. The majority of them asked the government to reduce the Cost of Living, increase salaries and give employment. There is no point in preaching Bana to the starving people. But we have to make them realise that the root cause of all types of sufferings is not having reconciliation and having an unresolved conflict since Independence.
Former President Kumaratunga said: "When unprincipled people become leaders, they can do what they want, govern the country as they wish, they can rob, they can kill whoever. This is the moment of good governance," she said.
University Grant Commission (UGC) Chairma Prof.Mohan de Silva said the experience he received during the war made him realise the importance of reconciliation.
"The life stories related by patients with painful injuries made me realise the importance of reconciliation," he said.

Tasteful words
A student has been diagnosed with a condition that causes her to taste different food every time she hears certain words.
Kathryn Jackson, 22, tastes carrots when she hears the name Rory and stuffing every time someone says impossible.
The 22-year-old, from Nottingham, has an extremely rare condition called lexical-gustatory synaesthesia. Spoken or written language causes sufferers to experience a robust smell and taste of items they associate the word with.
As a result Kathryn is distracted by her ever-changing taste buds during every conversation she has.
Other words cause her to taste or smell foods including marshmallows, apples and custard.
The student not only tastes the flavour but can also feel its textures and smell its scent.
She said: I can taste words when I hear or see them. Sometimes a word sounds like a food item, which can trigger me to taste it.
So for example when I hear the name Lola I can taste lollypops.
The name Ella makes me taste jelly beans because Ella and jella rhyme.
My friend Rorys name makes me taste carrots, because it sounds like raw which makes me think of carrots.
Synaesthesia is a common condition in which many people associate certain numbers and letters with colours.
But lexical-gustatory synaesthesia is a rare form of it. Mirror

They still live on
A soldier never really dies. He lives on in our hearts. A soldiers mission never ends, not even in death. One of my favourite war anecdotes has a 10-year-old boy asking a World War II veteran how does it feel to be a hero. His reply: Oh, son, I am not a hero. We buried all the heroes, I am just a survivor.
No surviving soldier can ever forget his or her comrades in arms who perhaps died right next to them. Their devotion to friends and colleagues who made the Supreme Sacrifice is simply indescribable. Yet, soldiers fall in every battle. Others make sure that their sacrifice is not in vain. They charge ahead and win the battle. They do not seek glory, nor do they seek fame.
Eight years ago, our own valiant sons of the soil defeated the enemy on the battlefield. The enemy was, in the words of the FBI, the most ruthless terrorist group in the world, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. It was a hard-won victory.
As a nation, we can never forget those who sacrificed the prime of their youth and of course, their lives, for liberating the Nation from terrorism. Yes, we do have memorials for them, but the best memorial they can have is our heart. They will live on in our hearts, never to be forgotten. Apart from those who died in combat, there are those who are still missing. There are those who lost their eyes, limbs and other organs. We have to be grateful to them till the end of time.
Peace and reconciliation
In the end, their efforts will be successful only if we have permanent peace. This cannot necessarily come from a triumphant attitude. We must cast aside the war mentality and embrace peace and reconciliation. The enemy combatants were our own brothers and sisters who were misguided by a megalomaniac and ruthless leader into carrying out various acts of terror in the name of liberation.
This is indeed why the State has rehabilitated thousands of former Tiger combatants and turned them into useful citizens. I read a heartwarming story in a recent issue of the Daily News, where a group of female soldiers had visited several former women LTTE combatants after the Sinhala sand Hindu New Year to inquire into their well-being. There was also another story of a soldier marrying a former LTTE woman cadre. If the combatants themselves can forget the past and become firm friends and even partners for life, why cannot we do the same
They say that the past is a different country. Those does not mean that we should forget the past, but rather that we should live in the present and embrace the future. It is essential that we come to terms with what happened in the conflict. Even more important, we should examine how we got to the battlefield in the first place, pitting brother against brother. We, or rather our politicians, made a series of serious mistakes that led to this situation. We have to learn from such experiences so that a conflict may never ever arise again in or country.
This is part of the healing and reconciliation process. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) recommended a series of steps that should be taken to foster harmony among the various communities. This Government has followed up with an Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and a plan to set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) possibly on the lines of the one in South Africa but with local ideas and inputs.
But the biggest initiative is formulating an all-new Constitution that takes into account the changing post-conflict needs and aspirations. The people will get an opportunity to give their verdict on this exercise through a referendum. The final aim of the new Constitution should be enabling an environment to create a truly Sri Lankan identity. Even in official forms and documents, we are still asked what our race (ethnicity) is. If you go to a Police station to lodge a complaint, they will ask what your religion is. Most people will not hesitate to ask you whether you are Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or Burgher. Clearly, we have not learned any hard lessons even after a 30-year war that tore us apart.
Sri Lankans
An Indian will not identify himself or herself as Hindu, Muslim or Sikh. A Singaporean will not call himself or herself Chinese, Malay, Tamil or Eurasian. Regardless of your ethnic background, you are an Indian or a Singaporean as the case may be. Likewise, a day will dawn when we will call ourselves Sri Lankans without a seconds hesitation. This does not mean that traditions and languages of each ethnic community should fade away. On the other hand, those traditions will be reinforced if all other communities understand and appreciate them. Today, all schoolchildren are learning Sinhala and Tamil, so eventually everyone in the island will be able to talk and understand both languages.
We have a generation that knows nothing but war. However, having gone through and suffered from the horrors of conflict, they will not want to be part of it again.
Then we have a generation born just before and after the conclusion of hostilities who will know nothing about the brutality of strife. It is these two generations that we must protect and veer away from any thoughts of conflict. Together, these two generations have the power to take Sri Lanka to greater heights sans any thoughts of animosity against one another. As they say, to err is human but to forgive is divine.
Even as we march towards peace and prosperity, the very people who made it all possible should not be forgotten. The role of the Armed Forces will evolve over time in peacetime commensurate with regional and global challenges. For example, the Forces, especially the Navy, has been doing a remarkable job to nab narcotics traffickers on the high seas. It was the Army which did most of the rescue operations in the recent Meethotamulla tragedy. The Sri Lanka Air Force took the lead in dousing a fire aboard one of the biggest container vessels in the world recently. They will continue to defend the Motherland whilst expanding their role in accordance with local and international challenges. International cooperation among Security Forces and intelligence agencies has become vital in the face of increased human trafficking and human smuggling, drug trafficking, piracy, international terrorism and even climate change. These need truly global responses.
Today, we can think of a peaceful tomorrow because thousands of Forces personnel laid down their lives to secure a brighter future for their fellow countrymen and women. On this day, and every day, they deserve our honour and gratitude. As I said at the beginning of this article, they still live on. Mary Elizabeth Frye captured this very feeling in her mesmerizing poem which can be regarded as a tribute to all who have perished in the line of duty.

Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints on snow
I am the sunlight on ripened grain
I am the gentle autumn rain
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight
I am the soft stars that shine at night
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there. I did not die.

Threatening SLMC would not fulfil anybody's objectives:Prof. Carlo Fonseka
Politicians or not, no one would be able to fulfil their objectives by threatening the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The SLMC is not scared of anything or anyone accept the religion of justice, SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka said.
Addressing a press conference held at the SLMC Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that nothing could be done by the SLMC by making its members scared. The recent bomb attack was the seventh such attack launched on the SLMC since 2002. The SLMC ensures the safety of its patients through quality medical education and maintaning the discipline of doctors.
According to Prof. Fonseka, the Western medical practice came to Sri Lanka in 1870 and the SLMC was established in 1925. But various attacks on the SLMC commenced in the 21st century. SLMC is the highest authority in Sri Lanka which could access and decide technical matters in connection with higher education in medicine. Nothing or no one is above the SLMC in connection with the subject. The SLMC sent a team of 10 experts to SAITM in 2015 and compiled a complete report on it even though SAITM's legality is questionable. Former Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura Prof. Narada Warnasuriya said that SAITM did not follow relevant rules, regulations and the process to obtain degree awarding status. The degree awarding status was offered to SAITM through `other' means. But the Kotelawala Defence Academy Medical Collage did not do so. It is the National Defence Academy in Sri Lanka which followed all relevant rules, regulations, procedures and systems that apply to all other state medical faculties in order to become a Medical faculty.
All medical students who pay for their education in these institutions are foreigners or dual citizenship holders. This medical faculty functions just as any other state medical faculty in Sri Lanka. It offers clinical training for its medical students through leading State Teaching Hospitals such as Sri Jayewardenepura Teaching hospital, Colombo South (Kalubowila) Teaching Hospital, etc. Therefore it cannot be compared with a private medical faculty, he said.

Twin Peaks: Mystery town returns to TV
Twin Peaks. I have always thought that these two words sounds surreal, perhaps depicting a place shrouded in mist - and mystery. I knew it was not a real place, but my wife knew better. She is a huge fan of Twin Peaks, that cult TV hit from the 1990s and whenever we talk about nostalgic TV shows, she would mention Twin Peaks. She had patiently sat through all the 29 episodes when it was shown here in Sri Lanka more than 20 years ago. Being a schoolgirl at the time, she had not understood some parts of the story (with David Lynchs stories, that is a problem everyone has), but she remembered enough to tell me that it was TV at its finest. Nothing she had seen ever since comes close to it, she says.
So, on my travels, I picked up Twin Peaks: The Entire Mystery Blu Ray Box Set a couple of years ago, but we could not find a proper time (or excuse) to watch it. The she found the perfect excuse: Twin Peaks is returning to TV with a brand new series from today (May 21), first in the US (Showtime) and UK (Sky Atlantic) and an Asian release is not far away. What better time than this to catch up with the intricacies of Twin Peaks 
We watched the first and second series, all 29 episodes, almost back to back over just 10 days and what an outstanding experience it was. Having gone in as a Twin Peaks virgin, I emerged as a total addict who would give an arm and a leg to watch the third series, like already. First, let me get one thing out of the way. Twin Peaks first hooks you in with that theme music by Angelo Badalamenti. No other TV series has such creepingly haunting opening music and it sets the tone for every episode, naturally full of intrigue.
The one name that runs like a thread throughout Twin Peaks is Laura Palmer and she is not even alive when the first episode begins. She is very dead, wrapped in polythene, her face still serene despite the obvious horrors she has been subjected to. The initial premise of Twin Peaks is the investigation launched by the FBI and local police to track down the killer, who may have murdered another girl in another State as well (hence the FBI involvement). The rape and murder of Laura Palmer shatters the serenity of the close-knit village, whose residents gather to discuss the local gossip at the R&R Diner and the all-wood Great Northern Hotel by the waterfall that is featured so prominently in Twin Peaks. If you watch even a single episode of Twin Peaks, you will immediately realize one thing. Everyone in the village, alive or dead, is impossibly beautiful, from Laura Palmer to local mogul Ben Hornes flirtatious daughter Audrey. And even the outsiders are really cute, from FBI man Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan) to his boss Cole, played by Lynch himself. But this very beauty can often be fatal in Twin Peaks, which in itself is impossibly beautiful. By the time you quit watching Twin Peaks, you will have gained an intimate knowledge about everyone in the village, back-stabbing, two-timing affairs, hot gossip and all.
Although Lynch never wanted to reveal Laura Palmers killer, the studio (ABC) put pressure on him to do just that as the ratings went through the roof. However, Lynch never does straight whodunits and the viewers eventually get to know the murderer, but not until they have gone through a fair but of horror, occult and ESP, apart from the usual police procedurals. It is this unique blend of detective and horror genres that sets Twin Peaks apart.
Beware that the Twin Peaks Season 2 finale leaves more questions than answers. The episode and the entire series ends with Dale Cooper seeing another mans reflection in the mirror as he brushes his teeth after recovering from a journey to the other side. Of course, by this time we know Laura Palmers killer, so Lynch had to invent a whole lot of other shenanigans to keep the viewers glued. He has succeeded in this endeavour to a great extent, though viewer interest did slide after the grand reveal.
There are so many loose ends that Lynch could not tie up, but it remains to be seen whether he can do so after a huge gap of 25 years. After all, everyone in the series (most of the original cast will feature in Series 3) has aged 25 years and may not have the same appeal to viewers unless the storyline is really, really good. Lynch has also got the services of many A-list actors including Naomi Watts to light up the new Twin Peaks. Original cast members Mdchen Amick (Shelly Johnson), Dana Ashbrook (Bobby Briggs) and Peggy Lipton (Norma Jennings) are among those making a return.
Remember that Twin Peaks was shown at a time when the Internet practically did not exist except at military level. There was no Twitter or Facebook to instantly dissect each episode. Thus Twin Peaks easily conquered television and the viewers minds. It will not be so easy today, but Twin Peaks is a phenomenon that will almost certainly give television a boost again.
What do we know about the return of Twin Peaks, which was perhaps coincidentally predicted by Laura Palmers apparition seen by Agent Dale Cooper with the chilling line see you in 25 years  It was filmed in the same area, for starters. Badalamenti will do the music again. Kyle Maclachchan will still be the lead actor. Lynch and co-writer Mark Frost have again written the entire story, but unlike during series 2, Lynch is directing all the 18 episodes (there is no word yet on a fourth season).
The pilot episode will run for two hours. Details of the plot are still largely unknown but according to Frosts new book  The Secret History Of Twin Peaks  after Dale Coopers investigation of the Palmer murder, the FBI comes across a a huge dossier and a female FBI agent begins to analyse the documents inside. Everything is apparently related to the strange town of Twin Peaks. Frost says the new series is not a remake or a reboot but a continuation of the series set in the present day. Thus the passage of 25 years is very important in that context. But one thing is certain  Twin Peaks has changed television forever. It has influenced and spawned a good number of films and TV series and third season will do exactly that  again. Pass me that black coffee and cherry pie from the R&R please.

Two Credits, one Pass enough for SLMC registration
The minimum basic educational qualification required to register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a MBBS doctor in Sri Lanka is to have passed the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination with two Credit (C) passes and one Simple (S) pass in the Science Stream or have equal qualifications.
SLMC Vice President Prof. Nilanthi De Silva said that even though a medical degree holder possesses all the required standards of education, clinical training etc he/she must have basic minimum educational qualifications mentioned above to receive SLMC registration.
Addressing a press conference held at the SLMC Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka said that in the United States, the third commonest reason for death is medical error and in 2013, a total of 240,000 US citizens died due to medical errors. Even in 1875, Sri Lankan doctors were allowed to practice anywhere in the United Kingdom and this high standard has been followed by Sri Lankan doctors since then.
The SLMC was established by Medical Council Ordinance Number 24 of 1924 (an Act passed in the Sri Lanka Parliament) and the main task of the Council is protecting patients rights, especially their right to life. Therefore, standards in medical education is a must to protect patientslives, SLMC sources said.

University of Moratuwa launches SL Design Code 2017 Exhibition
The University of Moratuwa's Department of Integrated Design announced the launch of the Sri Lanka Design Code 2017 exhibition, to be held on May 20 and 21, catering to the emerging design economy in Sri Lanka.
The exhibition will be held at Trace Expert City, Maradana.
It is a well-known fact that the University of Moratuwa is the most sought after technological university in Sri Lanka. The Department of Integrated Design stands as the peerless government university specialized in the field of design in Sri Lanka.
Addressing the necessities of the Sri Lankan design industry through a unique learning process, it acts as the integrated solution in design innovations.
Design Code 2017 Exhibition is part of the Department's mission. The announcement was made at a media conference held on May 17 at the National Library Auditorium.
The creativity of students, which is challenged by the conventional method of university entry based on the Advanced Level examinations, is to be preserved as a national responsibility.
In the Department of Integrated Design studies are conducted via three streams: Media and Communication Design, Product Design, and Fashion and Lifestyle Design.
Continuous assessments based on modules are used to assess the students, which are supported by field visits, and workshops. Building connections between foreign and local universities and so widening the exposure of students in the design industry has been identified as a social and an economical need.
The exhibition is a step in fulfilling this need and will include talks, a series of discussions by industry experts and foreign designers, and workshops focused on school students to enhance their creative abilities.
The design executions of students in every academic year will be exhibited. Products developed by using bamboo as a raw material, empowering young design entrepreneurship and the local craft economy will be presented by second year students to fulfill an academic and national need.
As the climax of the event, avant garde and graduation collections will be exhibited on an outdoor fashion ramp. This exhibition will open up new opportunities for the Sri Lankan design community.

EU bound export basket must increase soon to exploit GSP+
Sri Lanka will have to work hard to reap full benefits of the GSP+ concession that was re awarded by the European Union to Sri Lanka.
Speaking to Daily News Business former President of the International Chamber of Commerce, Tissa Jayaweera said that its sad to note that although the GSP+ plus concession is extended to 1,600 export products Sri Lankan only exports 12 products in the area of apparel, fish, rubber, coconut, tires, cinnamon and few other products.
The EU bound export basket must increase soon to exploit the benefits of GSP+, he cautioned. Sri Lanka is a lower middle-income country with a per capita income of USD 3,924 in 2015.
Jayaweera said that when Sri Lanka moves to an upper middle income level country in less than two years it would lose the GSP+ and hence the country should act fast.
He also said that GSP+ would not have a monetary gain to Sri Lanka exports but the orders would increase since the removal of duty would help to increase Sri Lankas competitiveness.
I think it would also lead to more investors coming back to Sri Lanka to invest and enjoy GSP benefits when they re export.
GSP+ concessions were initially granted to Sri Lanka in 2005, after the tsunami. However, in 2010, the EU withdrew Sri Lankas preferential access under GSP+ to the European market due to the governments failures in adhering to human rights standards set under the provisions of the scheme. Between 2005 and 2010, under GSP+ access, Sri Lankan exports to the EU grew on average by 7.96%, notably amid a decline in consumer demand in Europe due to the financial crisis during 2009 and 2010.
Contrastingly, during the 2010-15 period, Sri Lankan exports to the EU grew by a mere 1.02%.
Meanwhile Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrm recently in Colombo said granting GSP+ to Sri Lanka aims to provide the opportunity to develop further economically, including creating more and better jobs for all Sri Lankans, on a sound foundation that advances human and labour rights, and in a manner that is environmentally sustainable. It is also a vote of confidence from the European Union that the Sri Lankan Government will maintain the progress it has made in implementing the international conventions, she said.
Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said that from tomorrow, apparel importers from EU buying products from Sri Lanka will enjoy an exemption of 9.6 % duty on apparel, fisheries importers 18% of duty, coconut 14% and many such advantages. This also fulfills another election pledge made by the government and there will be a US$ 400 million benefit and the government can generate 20,000 new jobs, Dr. de Silva added.
The EU is expected to publish the restoration of trade benefits today.
Niranjan de S Deva Aditya, the European Parliament Member and Senior Advisor to Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe said that regaining GSP+ would help to generate 100,000 new jobs and 500,000 associated jobs.
It will also be bringing export earnings up by over 2 billion dollars per year to the Sri Lankan economy if the business community and investors grasp the challenge and set up to fulfil their part in creating wealth for the masses.
Now the challenge is to use this opportunity to access the largest market in the world which the EU is, without barriers experienced by our neighbours and promote investors from the whole of Asia to use Sri Lanka and her skilled and educated labour to export to Europe.We need to launch a massive inward investment programme that brings in billions of dollars of Foreign Direct Investment which will increase our manufacturing, agricultural, horticultural and service exports to Europe, he added.

Excellency collapses
Cracks on building ignored by administrators:
The six storey Excellency Reception Hall, sandwiched among the high risers of Wellawatte, collapsed at 11am yesterday. Around twenty five workers were suspected to have been working inside the building, undertaking construction work on one side of it.
The six storey building includes an underground parking level and four of the floors initially collapsed, with the ground floor threatening to follow. At the time of writing, the building was shaking, threatening to collapse further.
The Wellawatte Police reported that 28 were hospitalised; with nine being admitted to the Colombo National hospital and 19 to the Kalubowila Hospital. Six were reported to be missing with two others known to be trapped inside the rubble.
Director Colombo South Teaching Hospital Asela Gunawardane said one individual was left with a serious rib injury, the rest were left with minor leg and hand fractures and no death was reported.
Deputy Director, Colombo National Hospital Dr. Cyril de Silva also assured that the workers had only minor injuries and there were no life threatening injuries.
The Sri Lanka Army (SLA) had deployed 148 personnel from the 14th Battalion of the Western Commanding Unit to assist in rescue operations, while the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) has deployed 22 personnel for assistance.
According to one of the workers, the first two floors of the building were already in use and the rest were under construction . It was reported that a wedding was also supposed to be held yesterday. The police however, are yet to find the reason for the collapse of the building.
One of the police officials said that they could hear a few people screaming and added that rescue operations are underway.
Wellawatte Police said the side which was being constructed, as well as the portion of the building adjacent to the construction site has collapsed. Residential buildings surrounding it have been damaged as well. There is a parking area attached to the building, the vehicles have been removed but some have been damaged as well.
Supun Perera from EAP Films and Theatres said around 25 people work there but only nine people were recovered and admitted to hospital. The remaining workers must be inside, he said.
The construction of that building has been going on for the last five years, I do not know who the contractor is. The vehicles from Savoy were also parked there and they have been damaged.
A worker from Savoy said there were cracks that had appeared on that building for some time now. The administration was informed of the cracks but they did not take notice of it.
That function hall is always full; there would be a function there almost every day. People are lucky there was no function today.
Construction worker Sasi said the building collapsed in a split second but most of us escaped through a little opening while some of us jumped through the window to save ourselves.
The workers speaking to Daily News said that they only knew that the contractor was known to be a man called Samantha and that he was from Kaluthara.
Sasi added that their supervisor had come to check up on them in the morning and then left. However, he was not aware of the number of people who were working in the building at the time.

Floral Magic to enchant flower enthusiasts
Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Art Society celebrates 25 glorious years of friendship and harmony through flowers by holding a exhibition of flowers. Titled Floral Magic the public can expect fascinating floral displays by members using fresh or dried flowers, foliage, wood, and even untraditional materials like plastics, pipes, iron etc. There will be about 40 exhibits which will be categorized under Western style and Ikebana style.
Floral Magic will be held at Winchester Hall, The Kingsbury Hotel, on May 20 from 9.30 am to 7 pm.
There will be a demonstration by Harijanto Setiawan at 4 pm on the same day.
When we think about arranging flowers - placing flowers in a vase comes to mind and sometimes we can get intimidated quickly. Arranging and designing flowers should be fun. Many of the members of the Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Art Society (SIFAS) are ladies who loved flowers and joined SIFAS to interact with others who enjoyed flowers too. Floral Magic is one of their efforts. The standards of the exhibitions have improved since the society held their first exhibition 25 years ago.
The Society brings down experts in western floral arranging and also Ikebana, the Japanese art of floral arrangement, to help members improve their skills in this delightful and pleasurable activity.
Floral Magic is an exhibition for all ages. A lot of people think flower arrangements are confined to older women with time on their hands but this is a misconception. Busy young executives can relax and unwind by taking time to beautify their homes by doing a floral arrangement. Enjoying nature is an ideal way of de-stressing after a hard days work.
The clubs adviser Harijanto Setiawan, is an acclaimed floral designer who had won numerous international awards. He is also a trained architect. Harijantos experience and expertise in structural and floral designs implies that he is capable of transforming ideas into ambitious reality. He will be here to assist the members to design high standard exhibits.
The Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Art Society held their 25th anniversary last year, with an extravagant Floral Fashion Show titled Silver Dazzle produced by Harijanto. Equipment and drugs were purchased for the Thalassaemia Unit of the Kurunegala General Hospital from the proceeds of this event. Proceeds from this exhibition too will be used to help children suffering from Thalassaemia. A visit to the floral exhibition will not only be a feast for the eyes but will also help towards purchasing equipment and drugs for children with Thalassaemia.

No Provincial Council will be allowed to be toppled
The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) would not allow anyone to topple any Provincial Council let alone the North Central Provincial Council, UPFA Secretary General and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was speaking at a press conference at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry auditorium yesterday.
He further said that the UPFA or the SLFP does not need to change heads for money and President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed them to put a full stop to the concept of buying over members. On the other hand we are so stable that we dont need to buy members, Minister Amaraweera added. But there was a period where members were bought for money.
He also refuted the statement that the Provincial Councils would not be dissolved until September 2019 and said they would be dissolved at the due date. Minister Amaraweera also asserted that nobody would be allowed to topple the provincial councils. Chief Ministers of the Provincial Councils are appointed by way of a letter issued by me in my capacity as the Secretary General of UPFA, he noted.
What happened to those who crossed over at the North Central Provincial Council, questioned Minister Amaraweera. Today they regret their decision. They had reached those decisions after being misled by certain persons. We home they would orrect themselves and rejoin us.
Questioned by media personnel on statements by several UNP ministers, Minister Amaraweera said that their frustrations are over personal matters. He added that those members had not had any discussions with SLFP to join with them. However the SLFP is more democratic now. It is no more a party that has to say Yes Sir or Yes Madam.
He also said that he was ready to accept any post in a cabinet reshuffle. I am even ready to become a mere member of parliament. However no portfolio is permanent, Minister Amaraweera observed. But, I would work hard in any Ministry, he added.

SL govt should lead the way in resolving SAARC issues
The Sri Lanka government should take the leadership on behalf of the SAARC private sector to discuss major issues that hamper the economic prosperity in the region with other member countries urged SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Suraj Vaidya.
Also relevant authorities should be persuaded to allow at least two years of business visas for the business leaders of the region to promote trade and investment in the region.
Noting that Sri Lanka as a forward looking and private sector friendly government which has tremendous respect in South Asia, Vidaya said that as SAARC private sector is keen to grow as a fraternity, the private sector expects Sri Lankan government to take the leadership on behalf of the private sector to address issues with other governments that hamper the growth of the region to a greater extent.
He was speaking at the SAARC Investment Forum and Trade Fair Press conference held in Colombo yesterday.
Terming SAARC as an extremely complex animal and difficult regional body, Vaidya said it is high time to show the world that the region is capable of achieving bigger things as it moves forward.
I think this is where smaller countries need to bring about the harmony and the unity among the fraternity of south Asia,he said.
According to Vaidya, SAARC is being looked at as a entity and is the faster growing economic bloc with an annual growth rate about 7% in GDP when compared with other regional blocs such as European Union, ASEAN and NAFTA.
If we dont appreciate the numbers that are coming out; we will have serious problems.It is really up to us to show how we want to be a part of that growth and how much we can deliver to the business community by moving forward. In reality in South Asia, most of our young , healthy intellectuals have left their countries and are working in other parts of the world, so the remittance becomes an important part of our economy.
The annual SAARC Trade Fair and Investment geared to pave way for economic and social cooperation between its member countries will be held in Colombo and the trade fair is scheduled to take place from September 7-9 while the investment forum will take place on September 6.

Eight student activists including a Buddhist monk attached to the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) were remanded by Colombo Chief Magistrate till today (19).
They were arrested for allegedly violating and defying a Court order while engaged in a protest held in Colombo last Wednesday (17) demanding to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
The Cinnamon Gardens police complained that the protestors disregarded the Court Order and attempted to proceed towards Viharamaha Devi Park despite the Court order being read out to them, urging not to proceed with the procession causing disturbance to public peace and obstructing the regular traffic flow. Police said the protestors refused to accept the Court order.
On May 17, the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court had issued an order preventing the protesters from being a nuisance to the public during a street protest that was to be held in the Colombo city against the SAITM.

Beyond excellence
Tribute to Ernest Corea:
Journalists rarely make good diplomats, but Deshabandu Ernest Corea who passed away in the USA last week, was an exception to the norm in every way. A former editor of both flagships of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited, the Daily News and the Sunday Observer, Corea later served as Sri Lankas envoy to the US and its northern neighbour Canada. This is a singular feat that no other journalist has accomplished and it is no secret that his excellent journalistic and English language skills came in handy in his career as a top diplomat.
Corea was one of the finest journalists to have helmed the CDN editors chair and was very much a part of the golden age of local journalism in which the likes of Tarzie Vittachi, Cecil Graham, Denzil Peiris, Harold Peiris and Mervyn de Silva shone with their dedication to uncovering and reporting the truth.
Born in Katunayake in 1932 to a family hailing from Chilaw and educated at Royal College, Colombo and the University of Ceylon (Peradeniya), Ernest joined the editorial staff of the Daily News right after university, eventually becoming its Chief Editor in 1966. He held this post until 1970, when he went on to become the editor of the Sunday Observer for one year. He also held the post of Chief Administrative Officer of the ANCL Editorial Departments.
After leaving Lake House, he worked for the prestigious Straits Times in Singapore published by Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) as Features Editor, Columnist and Editorial Writer. He also worked as a director of the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa, Canada. He was Chairman of the Commonwealth Select Committee on the Media and Development, and was a life-member of the Asia Societys advisory group in Washington DC. He also worked as Senior Consultant at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Secretariat affiliated to the World Bank.
Career diplomats
He ventured into diplomacy on the invitation of President J.R. Jayewardene in 1978, as High Commissioner to Canada. Subsequently, he was Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the USA, Cuba and Mexico. (Incidentally, J.R., whose critics labelleled him as a friend of the USA, had a very close relationship with Cuban leader Fidel Castro). Ernest was a very good negotiator for trade and other deals  perhaps his journalistic background made him check and verify all the fine print in such agreements. Ernest is regarded as one of the finest non-career diplomats Sri Lanka has ever produced and all the career diplomats held him in high esteem.
It was during his tenure as Ambassador to the US that President Jayewardene made an official State visit to the US in June 1984, which included a Rose Garden reception by President Ronald Reagan. Ernest worked hard behind the scenes to make it happen and no other Sri Lankan President has had this honour. President Jayewardene also gifted a baby elephant (incidentally the symbol of Reagan's Republican Party) to the people of USA during this event, which was telecast live via a special satellite feed on Rupavahini. Organising this State visit was the highlight of Ernests diplomatic career of which eight years were spent as Ambassador to the US.
Journalism in his blood
At this time, LTTE separatism was raising its head in Sri Lanka and elsewhere and Ernest battled with lobby groups which were advancing that cause in Washington DC. In July 1983, Ernest convinced the US State Department to disassociate itself from a resolution passed by the Massachusetts House of Representatives calling for the divestment and withdrawal of all public funds and pension revenues from American business organisations in Sri Lanka. He is known to have uttered the famous remark even rabbits dont produce that fast referring to a HR report by Amnesty International on Sri Lanka that was produced within just 10 days.
Ernest wrote two books Non-Alignment  the dynamics of a movement, and North-South: Beyond Dialogue which were regarded as definitive works on these subjects. He also authored a book on Sri Lanka titled Beyond Conflict.
But journalism was always in Ernests blood and immediately after his retirement from the diplomatic service, he joined In Depth News Analysis (IDN) as its Global Editor and a member of its editorial board. He was also a columnist and Co-editor of IDNs current affairs magazine, Global Perspectives. He had a short stint as President of the Media Task Force of the Berlin-based Global Co-operation Council.
Another little known fact is that a young Ernest covered the first and last appearance of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike at the United Nations in 1956, soon after Sri Lanka joined the UN. Tragically, SWRD was assassinated three years later.
Ernest leaves behind his wife Indra and two sons Lester and Andy and four grandchildren. His equally famous elder brother Vernon, a veteran Radio Ceylon and BBC broadcaster, passed away in the UK in 2002 at age 75.

Blessed with the best!
Ladies College is the undisputed queen, when it comes to drama. From producing some extra ordinary musicals to winning Best Stage Craft with mere cardboards, the girls have always left the audience spellbound with their noteworthy concepts. Drama is a tradition at the college and the girls are introduced to Drama from a very young age. The dramas and musicals produced are usually staged under the English Literary Society.
We believe in giving a chance to every single girl. When you have a separate club for Drama, only the pupils who are a part of it get the opportunity to take part in productions and competitions. Here at Ladies college we make it a point to introduce a fresh set of girls every time we produce a Drama .We dont repeat the same set of girls. We give an opportunity to everyone because every girl is blessed with a unique talent. , said teacher in charge Shani Almeida.
Ladies College is blessed with the best talent.
A high standard
Drama is all about talent and we are blessed with the best. Weve had some wonderful actors in the past as well as in the present. Its been only a couple of years since I took over Drama.
When I came in I was left with a handful of raw talent , together we molded the raw talent into master pieces and went on stage for the Shakespeare Drama competition in 2015.
Not only did we win, but we also bagged the Best Stage Craft award and ShaliniCorea won the Best Actress Award. It truly was a triumphant moment for the school as we took part in the competition after five long years. stated Almeida.
Almeida stressed that the girls parents are extremely supportive.
The parents are very supportive. The girls stay until late to practice, some even take part while sitting for their Ordinary level or Advanced level examinations. However the parents are very understanding and mindful. If we are at a high standard today it is only because of the tremendous effort the girls have put in. They pour in their heart and soul. For example we had our girls acting as tables and chairs with cardboards attached to them for the 2015 Shakespeare Dram Comp.
It is not an easy task to balance someones weight or to pretend to be a property. Both the cast and crew practiced it over and over again to make it perfect as we cant afford to make any mistakes on stage.
The girls along with the choreographer, Jhannieque De Silva worked so hard and thankfully nothing went wrong on Stage during all three rounds and a special thanks must go to Adamaly the Director. It was entirely his idea, pointed out Almeida.
The crowning glory
If winning the all Island Shakespeare Drama competition is the crowning glory for schools, then Ladies College is the queen of all queens as theyve won the competition ten times! They have emerged as runners up twice and have had seven of their actresses winning the Best Actress Award till date.
Winning or losing doesnt matter, because ultimately it is what you take out of the competition and how that molds your character.
Winning or losing doesnt really matter. What matters the most is what the child learns from the whole experience. After taking control, the girls persuaded me to let them take part in the Interact Dram comp. Initially I was uncertain, but in the end I was glad that I let them take part, as I saw a girl grow from a silent individual into a confident and strong girl.
A student feels free and uninhibited on stage and could discover her strengths while acting. Thats why I feel drama is an important aspect of school life. You also get to experience a character and story through drama, elucidated Almeida.
Almeida emphasized on the fact that she wants the very best for her young thespians.
As the Teacher in Charge, the challenges I would face is that I want all my students to be able to have the opportunity to take part in drama competitions. And when some are not able to, I feel disheartened for them.
I also feel that picking a script and finding the best Director who blends in with the school is a tough challenge that I have to face. I also want to ensure that whatever we do, we do it for the love of drama and acting and bringing honor to the school is of utmost priority for me, said Almeida.
The art of multi-tasking
Drama helped Dulinika Bullumulla to learn the art of multi-tasking and juggling different tasks efficiently.
Ive been acting from a very young age and the most important lesson I learned from drama is the art of multi-tasking. I never neglect my studies because of drama and vice versa.
It so hard to juggle, but as you grow you learn to find room to fit everything in. Itll be my debut performance at Shakespeare this year and Im looking forward to it, said Bullumulla.
Understanding the characters
Thisaakhya Jayakody feels that drama more than anything else helps you to discover the true you.
We are introduced to drama at a young age. We are seen on stage more often than in classrooms! We were able to lose our stage fright at a very early stage and now we portray an array of characters.
Ive never been a woman on stage, Ive always been a man. I feel in drama, you discover the true you but the best part is, along the way you get to know your peers well. You learn to be tolerant and be comfortable with each other and thats very important because at the end of the day you share your space on stage with them.
When it comes to understanding the characters and the script, we do quite a lot of homework. For Lavinia we went and visited the Mount Lavinia Hotel to get a clear picture of the colonial period .For inter-house, we write the script ourselves. We know the character in and out. If its a production, our teachers help us out and they usually have a vast knowledge on the subject, said Jayakody .
A lot more to learn
Kesara Gunawardene called Drama a Serendipity.
Drama is a serendipity to me. I came in as an ensemble and I ended up winning Best Supporting Actress last year at the Interact Drama Comp. Im still young and I have a lot more to learn and experience, Im enthusiastic and I feel that every role Ive played is memorable, said Gunawardene.


The real star
Shalini Corea believes in gathering memories more than trophies.
The weird thing is, when someone asks me, whats your most unforgettable drama experience, the first thing that comes to my mind are the fun times we had at practice and not the winning moments .
I remember every practice session so vividly in my mind. From sharing food to sharing the stage, every memory remains fresh in my mind.
The best thing about drama is you become the person you portray. The traits of a character will never leave you, it stays with you forever. Once I played a sophisticated English lady and a male director taught me to walk in high heels and act like a lady. The Director takes you through various dimensions and angles of the character and it helps you understand the character better.
For Shakespeare, Adamaly and RuwindiWakwella, helped us with developing all the character traits paying attention to every minute detail.
But the real star of the show has to be Ms. Shani, because she makes our lives easier by having everything under control.
I wouldnt say that weve ventured into every genre. There is still so much to explore and learn. In drama you learn something new every day, said Corea.
Building a good bond
Nimaya Harris firmly believes in team work.
In Drama its hard for me to pick one incident or experience as most memorable .Every step I took in drama is unforgettable. What I like about drama is that you move around with people whom you wouldnt otherwise. You have the chance to develop something deeper than a friendship with your seniors and juniors.
When you enact a relationship on stage you gain a better understanding of the thespian you enact that relationship with. You might be impeccable when it comes to your role but that alone wont help. Building a good bond with your fellow actress through understanding is whats important.
What I like about Ladies College is that everyone gets a chance. Every girl gets the liberty to explore the world of drama, said Harris.
An unspoken chemistry
Akasha Jirasinghe felt that the family element is what she cherishes.
In Drama we are a family, one family unbroken. We are all united and this reflects on stage. What we have is an unspoken chemistry with each other, which helps us onstage.
The three wise men is close to my heart, as I broke out of my shell to portray the role, said Jirasinghe .

British tip-off led to PSL scandal - ICC
LAHORE, Thursday: Britain's National Crime Agency provided the initial intelligence that helped uncover a major spot-fixing scandal in the Pakistan Super League, a leading official from world cricket's governing body said Thursday.
Sir Ronnie Flanagan, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption and safety unit (ACSU) was speaking to reporters in Lahore after testifying in a case against opening batsman Sharjeel Khan, who has been provisionally suspended by his board since the scandal erupted in February.
Fast bowler Mohammad Irfan and spinner Mohammad Nawaz have already been banned for six months with six suspended, and one month with one suspended, respectively after confessing to failing to report offers to fix matches.
Opening batsmen Khalid Latif, Shahzaib Hasan and Nasir Jamshed, who did not feature in the tournament, have been charged with more serious offences, and face bans ranging from five years to life if found guilty.
Flanagan, head of the ACSU since 2010, said: "The inquiry was absolutely led by the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) throughout and our role was simply that before the PSL match we received intelligence that was passed to us by the British National Crime Agency."
Sharjeel was charged for failing to report an offer to fix and for playing two 'dot balls' (balls from which a batsman does not score) in exchange for money.
Latif, whose proceedings will begin later, was charged for luring others to spot fixing.
Flanagan added: "As chairman of the ICC's ACSU and I work very closely with the domestic anti-corruption units across the world, whatever is the outcome of this case, I would say that the PCB and its unit in this entire process have demonstrated a great determination to keep cricket clean."
Sharjeel's lawyer said Islamabad United coach Dean Jones, a former Australian batsman, former Pakistan captain Mohammad Yousuf and former Pakistan opener Sadiq Mohammad will appear as witnesses for his defence next week.
The ICC formed the ACSU in 2001 following life bans on South African captain Hansie Cronje, Pakistan's Salim Malik and India's Mohammad Azharuddin after fixing inquiries by their respective countries. - AFP

Calling all virgins  its time for White Tea!
That is easy, for in this mysterious teardrop island in the middle of the Indian Ocean with some 7,000 miles of open ocean to its south, there lies Handunagoda, perhaps the most southern and coastal of plantations. Meet Herman Gunaratne, the owner and manager with a lifetime of rich experience, lives by such initiatives as teas without tears, demonstrating his commitment to his staff and recognition that they are the key to the on-going success of this wonderful business. He started his life as a plucker, working his way through the ranks at a number of different estates, to become manager of the most prestigious plantations, a grand master of the tea industry if you like. He has seen and done it all, including things you would not believe.
Nationalisation
On our way up the hill from the entrance we pass a putting green, This is so I can beat my grandchildren at golf, Gunaratne says with a smile, explaining that they can hit the ball too far for him on a golf course but are no match for him on the putting green. This is perhaps a prelude to the story he now tells about running his 200 acre estate that was once 2,200 acres and how one must look for the niche advantage when faced with much larger competition.
Herman will show you many tea bushes and talk you through the many challenges of good tea husbandry, from the optimum time to pluck the tea, through to the finely nuanced withering, rolling and fermenting processes. Ever concerned with giving credit where its due, especially when it comes to the important job of plucking and the unjust stigma associated with pluckers, he says, We owe a great debt of gratitude to the Tamil workers who have been the backbone of this great industry, plucking around an acre a day each over the centuries. He then shows us the little succulent leaves that are ready to be plucked and the order in which the growing shoots are plucked to maintain the quality of tea and longevity of the bushes, which he says will generally last for 30 years but can, in some cases, such as with a seven acre plantation near Kandy, last for 150 years. However, such is the fertility of his lowland plantation, Gunaratne reckons to get the equivalent of 100 years highland/medium land production in 30 years.
Gunaratnes Handunugoda estate is 200 acres but he explains to us and in his book The Suicide Club,how it was once 2,200 acres before nationalisation saw the government taking 1,000 acres and a rather risky bet on the part of his grandfather saw another 1,000 acres going west at his grand gambling club nicknamed the Suicide Club, of which he was the president at the time. Gunaratne is particularly fond of the poem If by Rudyard Kipling, as it has helped him come to terms with what his grandfather did:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
.Youll be a Man, my son.
The not-so-healthy habits
When asked what makes his white tea unique, Gunaratne tells you, in inimitable style, a great story about the Chinese emperor of an ancient dynasty and how he would be given, as a tribute to his lofty position, tea that was untouched by human hands and plucked by virgins with golden scissors. Realising that getting proof of such plucker credentials would be tough and that there was no obvious benefit from untouched tea, Gunaratne wanted more to the story and his diligent search was rewarded with another remarkable tale about a perfume maker he met in Drasse, France, who sourced jasmine flowers from 12 different countries and who could identify each country by the sweat on the hands of the flower pickers. The third and final major point about his Virgin White tea is that it has the highest naturally occurring content of immunity boosting antioxidants of any beverage, at 10.11%.
It is clear Gunaratne drinks a great deal of his own products, maybe 20 cups a day and who wouldnt, but the secret to his exceptional health is also in his lifestyle: though a lover of some of the not-so-healthy habits, too, he has a strict routine of getting up at 4.30 am (even after the launch of his latest book where he was up until very late drinking with the best of them), then taking a five mile walk, talking with people along the way, followed by the business of the day and a five mile walk at the end before bed at 8.30 pm, unless invited out, of course.
As we move into the factory, the aroma of wilting and fermenting tea wafts about, reminding me of bonfires and exotic sweet smells that enhanced my youth. The wilting process seems simple enough, withering through ventilation that reduces the weight by half, but when we move into the next area we find the most extraordinary looking machines, which were seriously made to last back in the days of the industrial revolution.
Beautifully decorated
The Rolling machine was a wonderful 150 year old hunk of gyrating thick metal doing a finely nuanced job of rolling but not ripping or crushing the tea  sadly no virgin Cuban thighs rolling the tea here, it would take too long and be too distracting. The even bigger and older Sirocco machine from Belfast, Ireland, named Endless Chain Pressure Drier had so far lived up to its name with its staggering record of having operated for around 6 hours every single day for the last 160 years! They dont make em like they used to.
Gunaratne, despite his very busy life, has written five books, mostly centring around the tea industry but his latest offering, Gods Secret Agent, is as unique as his Virgin White tea and will have you mesmerised with its Blues Brothers type storyline involving the battles between the powers of darkness in Sri Lanka and a Buddhist exorcist and his mate, casting out demons with Christ and the Holy Spirit and digging up buried evil-charmed bottles all over the island, sometimes to help out presidents and prime ministers.
At the end of this magnificent tour, we walked into the shop, something I usually find tricky as, normally, I have children in tow who want to be spoiled but more often because I dont usually like to buy things before researching and meditating about them first. This is different as you are treated to a beautifully decorated room with about 50 teas to taste in an ingenious way. You are given a spoon to dip into teacups with the teas and put in your small tasting cup and left to your own devices, to taste teas to your hearts content without contaminating them  please dont lick the spoon! It was a delicious experience, even without the tour, and I really got to realise the breadth and diversity of tea  it really is a whole world in itself. Each tea is named and described and you are left unhurried to get on with it. I tasted every single tea and what a joy. I was slightly embarrassed to admit that my favourite was the Suicide Club tea, as I felt this must be a bit of a gimmick, but later I learned it was a bestseller, like the book, and had been blended by, Gunaratne with a cheeky addition of cognac.

Ceylinco Life breaks ground with Retirement Resort
Ceylinco Life Insurance opened the countrys first retirement resort at Uswetakeiya. The resorts aims to cater to active retirees.
Ceylinco Life has invested 40 million rupees to build La Serena a medium sized resort hotel build on three acres of beachfront land at Uswetakeiya, just 14 km North of Colombo, the resort comprises of 28 single bedroom units and 16 two-bedroom units, built around common facilities including a swimming pool, mini gym, restaurant, library and reading room, entertainment lounge and beach terrace.
This is a ground-breaking concept for Sri Lanka, but one that has been quite successful in other parts of the world, Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan told journalists hosted to a tour of the facility just days after it opened for public viewing. La Serena caters to a segment that is looking for the perfect mix of privacy and companionship in an extremely convenient environment that facilitates an active and healthy retirement.
As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ceylinco Life, the managing company Serene Resorts Limited has the benefit of the strength and expertise of the countrys biggest and most successful life insurance company, and is intended to be the forerunner of further investments in retirement living, Renganathan disclosed. Every residential unit is fully furnished with living room, dining room and bedroom furniture, LED TV, refrigerator, induction cooker, microwave oven, electric kettle, telephone, ceiling fans and safe deposit box. All units have air-conditioning.
Available at a daily rental for short stays of two weeks to one month or at a monthly rental for stays of a year or more.
We see this retirement resort catering to the needs of several customer segments, Renganathan said. La Serena could also be a solution for children seeking a secure, managed environment for parents, without the stigma associated with elders homes. Older people visiting family or friends in Sri Lanka will also find our short term rentals a great alternative to staying in a hotel.

Chamath Palihapitiyas Social Capital hires Marc Mezvinsky
Social Capital, the Silicon Valley investment firm founded by Chamath Palihapitiya, has hired Marc Mezvinsky as its vice chairman. The hiring of the investment banker and hedge fund founder is part of a wider effort by Social Capital to morph itself well beyond its venture roots.
Currently, Social Capital has been making venture and seed investments, as well as some public ones, and also has a unit devoted to incubating startups. It has also been developing a software-based product-market fit platform called 8-ball, to do the quantitative part of due diligence for possible investments.
But, as part of a longer-term master plan, it has been exploring a wide range of other financial products to support its companies across their life cycle, said Palihapitiya in an interview with Mezvinsky earlier this week.
Venture is good, but venture firms are not really well built to make successful companies, he said. We want to look less like an investment firm and more like a company with capital as a service.
Thus, enter Mezvinsky, who has a deep background in the financial arena. In his new job, he will quarterback the coordination of changes at Social Capital and also focus it more on its new capital efforts.
A derivatives specialist who has been focused on emerging markets strategies, Mezvinsky has been a longtime investment exec, working at Goldman Sachs, 3G Capital and as founder of Eaglevale Partners. (And, yes, he's the Marc Mezvinsky who is married to Chelsea Clinton, which means, Hillary Clinton is indeed his mother-in-law.)
Mezvinsky said that while he liked working in the broader market, he also felt that it was time to shift toward a focus on tech and its possibilities as its impact continues to grow.
I wanted to be on the right side of history, said Mezvinsky, talking about the efforts to create at Social Capital a kind of California version of Blackstone, the New York private equity firm that has vast efforts all over the capital landscape. We can plant a stake on the west coast that understands the giant opportunity ahead.
Mega-scale is a word that Palihapitiya used a lot in the interview, although he declined to comment on the kind of fundraising such an endeavor needed to succeed. Its a lot, obviously  tens of billions, really. He also added that venture ambitions need to grow, as there is more opportunity in using machine learning and other computing to make investing decisions better.
I know everyone here talks about reinventing venture capital, but it never really happens, said Palihapitiya, the former Facebook exec, who is well known in tech for his outspoken views on, well, just about everything (see below!). Why not do exactly what we tell our startups to do and disrupt and innovate
Mezvinsky will work out of a new office in New York, but will be in Silicon Valley regularly, where there are about 40 employees in Palo Alto. There are also plans to open a unit in London.

Chinese jets intercept US aircraft over East China Sea, US says

Two Chinese Sukhoi Su-30 jets have conducted an "unprofessional" intercept of a US aircraft, the US military said.
One of the Chinese jets came as close as 150ft (45m) to the US WC-135 plane and flew upside down above it, according to US officials cited by CNN.
The US says the plane was on a mission to detect radiation in international airspace over the East China Sea.
Tensions have repeatedly risen over US activity near the resource-rich international waters off China's coast.
The intercept, which took place on Wednesday, was deemed unprofessional "due to the manoeuvres by the Chinese pilot, as well as the speeds and proximity of both aircraft," Air Force spokesman Lt Col Lori Hodge said.
He said the issue was "being addressed with China through appropriate diplomatic and military channels", and a military investigation was under way.
China has not commented on the incident, but it accuses the US of carrying out reconnaissance flights over Chinese coastal waters and regularly calls on the US to reduce patrols in the area.
China claims sovereignty over almost all of the disputed territory in the South and East China seas, though several other countries in the region have competing claims.
China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols.
The US sniffer aircraft has previously been used to detect evidence of possible nuclear tests by North Korea.
'Routine operations'
Separately, China and South East Asian countries have agreed a framework for a long-awaited code of conduct for the disputed South China Sea, China's foreign ministry said, without giving details on the content.
It will now be submitted to the foreign ministers of the countries in August.
Over the years, the US, China and several of the South East Asian countries have had disputes over rival activity in the South China Sea.
In February, a US aircraft carrier started what Washington described as"routine operations" in the South China Sea, with a fleet of supporting warships.
The deployment came despite Chinese warnings against challenging Beijing's sovereignty in the region.
In May 2016, two Chinese fighters carried out asimilar intercept of a US military aircraftover the South China Sea.
At the time, the US military said its maritime reconnaissance aircraft was carrying out a routine patrol in the area.
In 2001, a Chinese jet and a US Navy surveillance aircraftcollided off Hainan Island, killing the Chinese pilot.
The US spy plane was forced to make an emergency landing on the island and China held the crew members for 11 days, sparking a major diplomatic standoff.

Citizens' Mail
Utility bills gone electric
Consumers of water and electricity have to pay their utility bills to the respective agencies i.e; Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and The National Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB) on a monthly basis. The procedure that is being followed by these two agencies to submit the bills to the consumers seems to be a very inefficient one.
The meter readers of these two agencies visit each consumer unit, i.e; residence or business place, on a certain date in every month and submit the bills after reading the meters and calculation of the fees.
I have found in so many times that these meter readers have visited on days that we were not in the house and have submitted a bill calculated on the basis of average monthly usage of the last few months.
These meter readers also must be having a very hard time since they have to go to each and every house/business place and ask the owners of them to open the gate for them to come in to read the meters. In some places the meters are located in places where access is not easy and as such they have to undergo lot of difficulties. Instances have also been reported by some meter readers that they have been bitten by the dogs that are being reared by the house owners.
Wouldnt it be much more efficient and convenient if consumers themselves read the meter at the end of every month and visit the office of the CEB or NWSDB and report to them and pay the bills The meters can be checked by the officers of the respective agencies at the end of every year to check whether meter reading by the consumers have been correct. This will also save the money that is being spent by these agencies as salaries to meter readers which I guess to be a quite a huge amount.

Dont take away SVAT, say FTZ manufacturers
Doing away with the SVAT (Simplified Value-Added Tax) system and replacing it with another system would be a major burden on the export sector, said the President, Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association (FTZMA) and Director, ATG Ceylon, Fazal Abdeen.
Speaking at their 37th annual general meeting where Abdeen was re-elected, he said that under the proposed new system it takes a longer time to recall VAT and the additional paperwork is really discouraging.
Due to this exporters face tremendous hardships and we have to keep aside around 16% of earnings with the Inland Revenue for almost four months.
According to an official from the Finance Ministry they are yet to take a decision on the termination of SVAT. The move followed joint submissions made by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Joint Apparel Association Forum, Exporters Association of Sri Lanka, Lanka Fruit and Vegetable Producers, Processors and Exporters Association, National Chamber of Exporters, National Chamber of Commerce and Sri Lanka Shippers' Council.
However Abdeen said that fresh moves are being taken to re-implement a new system.
He also said that the zone has an acute employment shortage and youth do not like to work in the free trade zones. The teledramas have demeaned the FTZ worker and they too are responsible for this.
Meanwhile Secretary of the FTZMA Dhammika Fernando said that the high-tech waste, sludge, oil waste management and clearing and disposal is still a major issue at the Katunayake Export Processing Zone.
There is a dumping yard but not for dumping high tech waste and this issue has to be addressed soon.

A collective of education sector trade unions, including the Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) urged the Education Ministry to take action to fill vacancies of the Principals Service.
The collective of education sector trade unions, while holding a media conference yesterday alleged that the authorities are delaying the appointment of qualified principals for vacancies.
Ceylon Teachers' Union Chief Secretary Joseph Stalin addressing the media said that selected persons for Grade 3 and 2 of the principals service have not been inducted to needy schools.
Two recruitment examinations for the Principals service have been held in 2009 and 2015 aiming to fill vacancies in schools.
Base on the result of the examinations, qualified persons were absorbed to the Principals Service after a training.
But the Education Ministry has failed to give schools to these selected persons since acting principals are performing at school, where there are vacancies.
Stalin requested speedy appointments for those who passed principal grade examinations.
He said the authorities are delaying the appointments in support of acting principals who have not passed any principal grade examinations.
According to him, most acting principals are henchmen and supporters of the henchmen and supporters of Provincial level politicians.
Most acting principals are henchmen and supporters of national and provincial level politicians.
Politicians are safeguarding these acting principals instead of appointing the qualified persons, who have been absorbed to the Principals service, he said.
It is up to the Education Ministry to take action to appoint the qualified principals, he said.

Eight years on
Today marks 8 years since the official declaration of the end to the 30 year Eelam war, with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attending the main commemorative event opposite the War Heroes monument at the parliament grounds. Significantly, the day, while giving pride of place to the war heroes, has also been declared as one commemorating all those who died as a result of the war, removing from the event the vestiges of triumphalism of the earlier years. However, the day, no doubt, would be fittingly dedicated to the members of the armed forces, both living and dead, who valiantly fought to preserve unity and territorial integrity of the country. To them will go the tribute of a grateful nation.
Over 100,000 persons, both combatants and civilians, died in the brutal civil war that not only ravaged the country physically but also destroyed its vital economic resources and infrastructure. As a result, the country's development and progress was pushed back several decades, forcing it to start again from the ashes of war. Had the war continued with the same intensity there is no knowing what the future of the country would have been or if there would have been a country at all left for us Sri Lankans. In that context the credit for presiding over the defeat of terrorism should ungrudgingly go to Mahinda Rajapaksa, a sentiment that was expressed by even Prime Minister Wickremesinghe upon being sworn into office in January 2015.
There is no doubt that MR gave the political leadership that brought the war to successful conclusion, but this is not to detract from the role played by the military leadership which successfully marshaled the forces on the battlefield that eventually annihilated the enemy. In that context the contribution made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, the wartime commander of the military, cannot be overemphasized, nor that of the other service commanders. This is not to ignore the contribution made by all past service chiefs and men on the battlefield, during the height of the war years, leading to the eventual victory. A standout among them no doubt is the gallant warrior Denzil Kobbekaduwa who paid the supreme price in harness. It was the cumulative contribution of military leaders of his ilk in the early war years that paved the way for the gradual decimation of the LTTE, leaving the rest to add the finishing touches.
There was also the political leadership that made a not inconsiderable contribution towards the final victory, such as the roles played by Ranjan Wijeratne and General Anurudhdha Ratwatte. Many would agree, though, that it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's masterstroke of indirectly engineering the defection of Karuna Amman, the LTTE leader of the eastern theatre of war, when he was Premier from 2001- 2004, that made the war victory that much easier for the leaders that followed.
For all that, the golden opportunity for forging lasting peace that presented itself soon after the end to the war was squandered by the Rajapaksa regime which went on a frenzy of triumphalism. The Tamil community were made to feel a conquered race by the utterances of the former President and his cohorts. This rather than uniting the communities led to further estrangement.
Be that as it may, eight years down the road there is still a lot to be done to erase the scars of war. The fallout of the conflict has been as difficult to handle as it was during the war years, with trenchant positions adopted by both sides of the divide. The formulation of a new constitution to address the impasse too is proving difficult with radical elements on both sides putting the spoke in the wheel. The causes that gave rise to the conflict is still very much there and although satisfactory advances have been made in the reconciliation process things appear deadlocked. The appointment of a northern political leader as the Leader of the Opposition too has not brought the desired results. There is no doubt that the Yahapalanaya regime is under pressure to reach a compromise leading towards a durable peace. It has taken several positive steps in this direction such as the setting up of a Missing Persons Commission and other reparation mechanisms. The government is also launched on a gradual demilitarization of the North, with the army vacating from civilians land enabling the original owners to resettle in their habitats. The President himself has undertaken several visits to the North and closely interacted with the people.
The war had taken a heavy toll of lives and resources, but with the dawn of peace, new opportunities have presented themselves to heal the wounds and for co-existence in a spirit of compromise. The leaders of the Tamil political parties should act with circumspection giving a thought to the sentiments of the majority community and desist from making unreasonable demands that would place the government in an awkward position. They should not play into the hands of the extremist elements, in the South.

Email, Snailmail and Ransomware..!
All over the world people look at their computer screens waiting for Ransomware or some cyber terrorware to pop out and devour them and their computers. In a home one evening, a father looked at his two children and sighed, I guess well have to go back to the postmen age! he said.
Whats a postman dadaskedhis little daughter, sounds like postmortem
Or posthumous giggled her brother.
Postmen, continued the father seriously, delivered mail!
Like email Press enter and off it went
Well not exactly, sighed the father, Postmen picked up mail from post offices, got onto cycles, then went from home to home delivering the letters!
You mean there was no need to open the computer No need to look into your mailbox asked both the children with excitement.
When there was mail, the doorbell rang and it was delivered in your hands! said the father proudly.
Why ever did we get out of such a cozy system asked his son. Imagine, all we needed to do was answer the door!
What a nice place the world was! sighed both the children, No hackers, no spyware, no ransomware!
And how was mail sent dad
Well you wrote it, stuck the sides of the envelope then walked to a postbox and dropped it in! said the dad warming up into a nostalgic mood.
I dont understand! said his daughter, Why would you drop it in a box
Ah, well a postman took those letters to a post office, sorted all of them out and sent them to railway stations where mail trains took those letters to places where other post men picked them up and delivered them home!
Wow! said both the children.
And how long did all this take dad asked the daughter.
It was supposed to take a day or two, but most often took a week, sometimes a month, and in a few instances a letter was delivered decades later!
The children gaped at their dad in disbelief.
And, continued their dad happily, The postmen were reliable men, so reliable, that on Christmas, New Year and other festivals, they came to your doorstep, asking to be rewarded for being so trustworthy. They came with big grins and open palms and you always put something in them!
And if you didnt asked his daughter.
Then you would find your letters dropped all over the road, or find them reaching you after a year, or not at all! smiled the father, But we all paid the postman!
Dad! said his son slowly, So whats the difference between todays ransomware and yesterdays open palms Both extort money, dont they
And, said his daughter, I would rather face a cyberattack, then have mail delivered after two weeks!
Thats true, said the father slowly, Nothings changed! Snailmail might have evolved into email, but human natures still the same..!

FITIS to promote ICTs for inclusive growth
The Federation of Information Technology Industries in Sri Lanka (FITIS), the apex body that plays a pivotal role in the development of the ICT industry in the country, appointed Dr. Kithsiri Manchanayake as its new Chairman at the Executive Council meeting held on March 28 at the Hilton Colombo Residence.
Expressing his thanks to the members of FITIS for their endorsement and trust, Dr. Manchanayake said he will look to carry on the good work of his predecessor, Wasantha Weerakoon, while bringing fresh perspectives and new ideas to complement the existing initiatives and strategies of FITIS.
I am honoured to have been given the opportunity to lead FITIS, said Dr. Manchanayake. He added that he wished to thank his predecessor for the strong foundation he has left behind.
Dr. Manchanayake promised to continue building on the good work achieved thus far. Certainly, we will continue playing an active role as the voice of the ICT industry. Given the dynamic, rapidly evolving technological environment permeating all sectors, including the battle against poverty, there is plenty to cover and FITIS will hit the ground running, he said.
Key to its efforts would be continued dialogue and partnership with key stakeholders that include the government, industry and users, with a view to harnessing the potential of ICT for promoting and supporting inclusive growth.
ICTs are considered the conveyor belt of globalisation and have tremendous influence on the functioning of global and national economies.
The role that ICT plays is for the benefit and betterment of our citizens. They help find innovative solutions to address the daily challenges we face; poverty, unemployment, lack of access to quality education and health care, and climate change, to name but a few. We look to bringing new ideas to the table in this regard and also continuing to push the Federation's existing causes. We are conscious that unless Sri Lanka comes to grips with the challenges of ICTs, we may be left behind in the ICT revolution, said Dr. Manchanayake.
FITIS recognises that although the ICT revolution is well underway in some parts of the country, many of those who stand to gain from it are not yet connected. While certain segments of the population are benefitting from ICTs, many are left behind because of their age, limited digital literacy, lack of access, or remoteness.
Dr. Manchanayake said that in order to better leverage ICTs for development, a higher level of preparedness and better infrastructure access are needed.
In this context, government leadership and vision are critical. ICTs have the potential of opening up new digital divides. In the absence of corrective mechanisms, ICTs could indeed contribute to a non-inclusive type of growth, thus exacerbating the problem rather than mitigating it. However, if harnessed properly, ICTs can create economic opportunities and foster social and political inclusion, ultimately contributing to shared prosperity.
FITIS, under the leadership of Dr. Manchanayake, is also keen to move the debate away from the issue of merely ensuring access, to the question of how to make the best use of ICTs to improve business innovation, governance, citizens political participation, and social cohesion.
We cannot underestimate the pivotal role ICTs play in enhancing competitiveness, enabling development, and bringing progress to all levels of society, he said.
Expressing his confidence in his successor, Weerakoon said FITIS has in place a capable and experienced leader to helm the Federation to achieve its many goals and aspirations.
FITIS, established in 1996 to utilize the synergy of the different ICT players under one umbrella needed to take the ICT industry forward, has over 180 members and comprises five chapters; Hardware Chapter, Software Chapter, Education and Training Chapter, Professional Chapter, and Communication Chapter.
Dr. Manchanayake is a founder member of FITIS and has served as its Vice Chairman. He is the Chairman of the AIMS Group of Companies serving different sectors of the IT industry in Sri Lanka.
He received his undergraduate degree in BSc (IT) from the University of Colombo and received his MBA from University of Wales. He completed his doctoral work at Temple University, Denver, Colorado.
Dr. Manchanayake holds the FACSM and FIIM professional designation from professional bodies in the UK and is also a member of the Australian Computer Society, British Computer Society, and Sri Lanka Computer Society.
Dr. Manchanayake has served numerous local and international organizations and has served as an expert witness and a consultant to the government and many public and private sector organisations.
He is a keen entrepreneur and his name is synonymous with quality, but affordable education. He has demonstrated strong commitment to the development of education by pioneering the establishment of educational institutions in urban and rural Sri Lanka, thus contributing to the growth of the private education sector in the country.
Since 1992, Dr. Manchanayake has been a part of many missions and delegations to USA, Europe and Asian countries to promote IT and communication infrastructure related business opportunities. He serves as the Vice Chairman of ASOCIO (Asian-Oceanian Computing Industry Organisation), a group of IT industry associations from economies in the Asia and Oceania regions.

The petitioner stated that consequent to being elected in September 2015, the Parliament of Sri Lanka had appointed the members of COPE to conduct an investigation into certain Central Bank auctions of Treasury Bonds which occurred in February 2015 and March 2016.
The members of COPE have submitted their final report to Parliament on or about October 28, 2016.
The said COPE report maintains that; the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th 18th, 21st, 22nd, 24th and 26th Respondents had agreed to the said COPE report in general, without the footnotes. The 6th,7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 20th, 23rd and 25th Respondents had agreed to the said COPE report with footnotes.
All other members of the Committee (i.e. the 1st to 26th Respondents) had unanimously agreed to the recommendations given at the end of the report.
The Petitioner expressly pleaded that notwithstanding that the said COPE report was presented to Parliament on or about October 28, 2016, the same remained inaccessible to the general public and the Petitioner for some time. The Petitioner pleaded that the said COPE report only became accessible to the Petitioner on or about November 24, 2016.
In such circumstances, the Petitioner pleaded that the Petitioner could not file the said application sooner, as the COPE report was inaccessible to him and he was not aware of the contents of the same, until November 24, 2016. The Petitioner further stated that in any event, the continuous reliance or circulation or actions of the said COPE report as it presently stands, amounts to a continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and also amounts to a cause which enables the Petitioner to prefer this application in the public interest.
The Petitioner pleaded that through the said COPE report, the Petitioner and the general public have been misinformed and misled.
The Petitioner said that in the event that the CBSL was not properly or officially or lawfully issuing of Treasury Bonds viz the direct/private placement from the month of January 2009, the proper procedure that ought to have been followed from January 2009 was the Central Bank Treasury bond auction process.

Government will not take over PC powers: PM
The government will neither take over the powers vested in Provincial Councils by the Constitution nor hand over any of its powers to the Provincial Councils, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Wickremesinghe was addressing the gathering after opening an educational exhibition held at the Bandarawela S. Thomas College to mark the schools 75th anniversary celebrations on May 18.
He said the government will formulate a national policy to develop education and allocate adequate funds to recruit new teachers. The practice of recruiting teachers and providing them with training would be done away with and a system to recruit teachers after proper training would be implemented in its place, he said.
Wickremesinghe said teachers would be recruited on a school basis in future rather than for provincial or government service. This system would help boost education. A progress review methodology would be introduced in respect of teachers and schools. Steps would also be taken to update the knowledge of teachers regularly.
Emphasising that success of education depended on quality teachers, the Prime Minister said the educational re-organisation would be carried out within the next five years.

Govt provides fertilizer subsidy assistance to agricultural development
Today the government's assistance to agricultural development is confined mainly to a massive fertilizer subsidy of Rs. 45 billion per annum. However, the figure has come down to 15 billion last year with the change in the scheme, said Wicky Wickramatunga, Managing Director, Agri world (Pvt) Ltd at the Challenges in Agriculture - The Way Forward workshop, organized by The National Agribusiness Council recently.
The National Agribusiness Council which is the apex body of the Agriculture Sector, with the involvement and participation of all stakeholders with a view to address the specific issue, a workshop and a media briefing was held recently at The Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo under the patronage of the National Agribusiness Council and participation of key stakeholders in the agriculture sub sectors. Explaining the objectives of this initiative, Chairman of the National Agribusiness Council, Rizvi Zaheed said this initiative seeks to disseminate the extensive knowledge and experience available in Sri Lanka and communicate this in an effective and participative way so that action could be taken and co-ordinated in a holistic manner. The ideas and insights have provided a strong foundation for required action to take agriculture in Sri Lanka to a new level.
Agriculture stands at the core of the Sri Lankan society and economy with 30% of the population involved in agriculture. Though GDP contribution from Agriculture hovers at around 10%, the influence of Agriculture on every fabric of Sri Lankan life is very significant. Successive governments have made substantial investments and implemented various programs to develop the national agriculture sector. In spite of all these efforts the county annually spends over 200 billion to import food, he said.
Immediate Past Chairman Weerakoon said that productivity is the key to propel agriculture development in the country which prompted the NAC to select the theme of the event as Challenges in Agriculture. The seminar focused on identifying various impediments and to see ways and means in increasing the productivity levels in the entire agriculture sector.
Sri Lanka's agricultural productivity is surprisingly low and this vital sector cannot create new jobs to attract youth, while services and industry are five to six times more productive. The country needs almost to double the present agricultural productivity levels including the plantation sector as well, he said.
The productivity levels of most of the sub sectors in agriculture are much below than potentials and one of the top priorities of the government is to address this crucial issue without any further delay. Sri Lanka at various times over the years has tried to address the issue of food security and food nutrition while ensuring sustainable incomes to farmers and ensuring returns to all stakeholders.
The focus on sustainability and innovation in agriculture too hasn't achieved traction. Hence, sadly, agriculture has not taken off to the levels required, given the opportunities and potential to develop this important sector. The time is therefore opportune and urgent to put every effort to increase productivity in the entire agriculture sector and thought leadership at a new level is now required to propel agriculture into a new paradigm.
Irrespective of the sector contribution to the GDP, the agricultural sector's mobilization to Sri Lanka's employment is still quite significant despite a decline in its share with the expansion of the Industrial and services sectors in recent years.
Export earnings from agricultural products from Sri Lanka have been increasing in value terms, with the share of agricultural exports in total exports hovering around 25 percent. Domestic agriculture still provides approximately 80 percent of Sri Lanka's food requirement in value terms. (DJ)

The GSP+ facility will bring benefits directly to the fisheries industry and exports, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He said there is a high tendency to increase fish prices now due to the increase in fish exports with the GSP+ facility taking effect from today. He said in that case low price fish imports will also increase.

If you use Google Photos, youve probably experienced the apps assistant feature taking the liberty of creating suggested collages, stories or mini-movies out of your pictures.
If youre like most people, you usually ignore these suggestions.
If youre a cat lover, however, you may be getting a suggestion soon that you definitely wont want to ignore. Thats because Google may be making you a Meow Movie.
I got a notification on my phone last night, writer Courtney Gillette told HuffPost in an email. It was from my Google Photos app, and it said, Your Meow Movie is ready. The notification included a happy cat face emoji, she said.
A Meow Movie is, well, what you might expect. And the soundtrack is pretty top-notch, so turn up the volume.
Gillette was psyched. Who doesnt like an excuse to look at a digital flipbook of photos of their cat she said.
The star of Gillettes video is Sappho, who as a kitten was abandoned on the eve of Hurricane Sandy and rescued by a saintly woman. Gillette later adopted Sappho through Facebook. The two supporting feline cast members, Rufus and Domino, were abandoned in a flower bed and adopted by Gillettes partner, Emily.
Gillettes not the only person to receive a Meow Movie in the past day.
The movies are part of a new Google initiative to highlight the importance of pets in peoples lives, a company spokesperson told HuffPost in an email.
Beginning this week, if you take lots of photos of your dog or cat, you may get a movie celebrating your pet in all their paw-some-ness, the spokesperson said. Additionally, users will be able to use the apps movie editor feature to choose from six different pet-themed songs.

Kolkata to face Mumbai for IPL final berth
Bangalore: Kolkata Knight Riders face Mumbai Indians for a shot at a final berth in the Indian Premier League after Gautam Gambhir powered his team to a win over Sunrisers Hyderabad early Thursday.
Rain reduced the second innings of the eliminator match to six overs, with KKR given a 48-run target under the Duckworth-Lewis method.
Gambhir remained unbeaten with a top-score of 32, leading his team to a seven-wicket victory with four balls to spare.
Australian Nathan Coulter-Nile won man of the match award for three wickets earlier on Wednesday in an inspired bowling performance against the Sunrisers.
Nile and other KKR bowlers, particularly Sunil Narine and Umesh Yadav, restricted Hyderabad to 128-7 in their 20 overs on a seemingly slow track.
Hyderabad skipper David Warner top-scored with 37 runs but all Hyderabad batsmen struggled to get quick runs against KKRs measured performance on the field.
Showers interrupted even before KKR could begin their reply, shortening the second innings which only started past midnight, early Thursday.
Sunrisers began their bowling performance on a high, with Indian seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar taking two wickets, including a run out, in the very first over of KKRs reply.
Kolkata also lost Robin Uthappa in the next over before Gambhir, one of the most consistent performers this IPL season, took charge of the teams run chase. KKR face Mumbai on Friday for a chance to play Rising Pune Supergiant.
Since its debut in 2008 the shorter-format league has evolved into Indias most popular sporting event, filling stadiums and attracting TV audiences well beyond that enjoyed by Test and one-day competitions in the cricket-mad country. AFP

Lehmann plays down Ashes strike threat
SYDNEY Monday : National coach Darren Lehmann admitted Thursday a bitter pay dispute will be a distraction for Australia at next month's ICC Champions Trophy, but played down a boycott of this year's Ashes series.
Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association are locked in a tense stand-off over the long-running talks, with vice-captain David Warner warning of a strike during the showpiece series against England, starting in November.
Lehmann conceded the players' full focus wasn't on the Champions Trophy in England and Wales, but said he was confident there would be no Ashes disruption.
I'd hope not as a fan. I'm sure that won't happen, he told reporters in Brisbane, adding that he was in regular contact about the issue with Australian captain Steve Smith, currently playing for Rising Pune Supergiant in the Indian Premier League.
We've spoken quite a lot, on many issues at the moment, Lehmann said.
He's really looking forward to getting the lads back together. There's been a lot of emails and text messages around the place.
He is (in good spirits). He's been there (in India) for four months and hasn't been home. But he's ready to go. Warner said this week players would not back down from their demand that CA keep its current revenue-sharing pay arrangement and cautioned they might walk out on the Ashes if relations became strained further.
Lehmann said he would address the matter once the entire squad for the Champions Trophy was together.
You have to do that. You have to keep communication open so we know what direction everyone's going, he said.
It is going to be a bit of a distraction, there's no doubt about that.
Just getting together and working it out is the way to go. There's no panic, it's just about the two parties getting together. CA chairman David Peever has rejected the ACA's request for the bodies to try mediation. While CA absolutely shares your stated desire for a new agreement ... it seems extraordinary to be considering the involvement of a mediator before the ACA has attempted to negotiate, Peever said in correspondence to the ACA.
The approach the ACA has taken in demanding certain preconditions be met before it is prepared to begin negotiations is the fundamental reason why no progress has been made to date. The two bodies have been at loggerheads for more than six months.
CA is determined to scrap revenue-sharing after 20 years, saying more funds were needed for the game's grassroots, and that its offer provided handsomely for players.
The ACA is equally resolved to keep revenue-sharing, saying the system was not broken and did not need fixing.
The notional deadline is June 30, when the current memorandum of understanding expires.

Let the cat out of the bag
For some time the government has been mulling a draft Counter-Terrorism Act (CTA) to replace the Prevention of Terrorism (Special Provisions) Act, commonly known as the PTA. It was a sequel to a pledge given by Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. In addition civil society activists, academics and other intellectuals too have been long agitating for the repeal of the PTA. The draft, in fact, was presented to Parliament but was referred back to the Cabinet for revision.
Unfortunately the government has been totally secretive in dealing with the matter and was rather keen on preventing a public debate on the pros and cons of such legislation. To be more exact the domestic demand was for the abolition of the PTA and some Emergency Regulations (ER) made under the Public Security Act which were used concurrently or in parallel with the PTA.
National question
While there is no opposition to framing legislation against terrorism or updating the domestic law to meet international standards there is much ambiguity in defining what terrorism is.
Moreover, experience of the application of the PTA and ER during the past four decades raises serious apprehensions concerning their possible use for acts of political vendetta against activists of the Opposition. The provisions of the PTA and ER were so broadly defined that they often transgressed on the freedom of the citizens. For example it would be an offence for any person to campaign for a revision of government policy on matters relating to defense, national security, territorial integrity, sovereignty of Sri Lanka.
This would make it an offence to campaign for going beyond the 13th Amendment as a solution to the national question or to campaign for a separate state as the later repealed Sixth Amendment to the Constitution did.
It would also criminalize any agitation by the dispossessed for return of their original land held by the State or the Security Forces. Any agitation for a new policy on education or health too would be no different.
According to information leaked to the media the draft Act not only retains most obnoxious features of the PTA and has even strengthened their repressive nature. One serious drawback in the PTA was the admissibility of confessions made before the police as evidence against the accused. In the context of third degree methods used by law enforcement officials such confessions are often under duress or even torture.
Moreover, under the PTA it is the defendant that has to prove his innocence and the state need not prove the accused guilty. Once a victim is under detention for long periods without access to lawyers and information proving ones innocence is not so easy, especially since ones own statements are taken as evidence against him or her.
Under the PTA the Minister in charge could detain a suspect in any place at his discretion. It need not be a prison or any other recognized detention centre. Suspects were kept in police lock-ups at police stations, security forces camps or other places which resembled dungeons rather than a living space for humans. Some remained chained for months. The CTA has retained this provision.
PTA and the ER
As a result of continuous extension of the period of detention, suspects were kept in detention for years and years.
The alternate application of the provisions of the PTA and the ER resulted in suspects being detained for years and years. The same facility is also retained in the CTA.
It is not only a travesty of justice but a serious breach of human rights.
The language of the CTA is so vague and general that it many legitimate actions of the public would fall into the category of offences.
For example illegally or unlawfully compelling the Government of Sri Lanka or the government of any other sovereign nation, to reverse, vary or change a policy decision or to do or abstain from doing any act relating to the defence, national security, territorial integrity, sovereignty of Sri Lanka or any other sovereign nation (as the case may be), and the protection of the people of Sri Lanka or the people of any other sovereign nation (as the case may be) is an offence under the draft CTA. Thus the media could fall a victim if it criticizes any policy of any government, e.g. the United States Government policy of overt and covert support for Israels expansionist drive.
Knowingly or unknowingly Sri Lanka would then be a bulwark of defence not against but for imperialism, and colonialism despite the rhetoric to the contrary. Also academic discussions on such policies local or foreign would qualify for punishment under the CTA. Even a cartoon in the media could be an offence.
Similarly legitimate trade union activities could become offences under another clause which says causing obstruction or damage to essential services or supplies. This would make any trade union action in spheres which the government may consider essential. In effect it would undermine the peoples right of association and expression.
Some of these provisions actually contravene the Right to Information (RTI) Act and fundamental freedoms entrenched in the Constitution.
The irony of the situation stands clear when we consider the reasons for the enactment of the PTA. The PTA was named the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 78 of 1979 and was the successor to the Proscribing of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and Other Similar Organizations Law, No 16 of 1978. The Act was enacted temporary for three years and was later its validity extended in 1982.
This shows that even the architects of the PTA were aware of its repressive nature and enacted it in view of the threat from the LTTE, amidst opposition from the Opposition including the SLFP.
It was a developing war situation that existed then. Now that the war is over and there are no definitive signs of a possible resurgence of the LTTE it is ironic that present rulers who are committed to peace and reconciliation should resort to even more repressive legislation in the guise of the CTA.
The draft CTA should be made public and open for public discussion. It should no longer be kept as a secret and thrust upon the people like stabbing them in the back. That is the democratic way, the yahaplana way. Sorry to remind the powers that be of their own prophesied policies and practices.

Minister Ganesan says he was happy for progress made towards reconciliation
Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan said he was happy with the progress towards reconciliation made in the last two years though many gaps still remain to be filled.
The war ended in 2009, but the government at the time did not make use of the golden opportunity that opened up after the war to seek reconciliation. It was only on January 8, 2015, that we took steps towards reconciliation, he said.
The minister who recently together with the President who is also the Minister of Reconciliation had the National Policy on Reconciliation and Co-existence approved by the Cabinet, said he believed that they had come far during the last two years.
The journey towards reconciliation and co-existence are like two parallel tracks on a railway line. On the one hand, we need to deal with humanitarian issues such as resettlement and rehabilitation, while on the other hand we need to have a political solution which is linked to the new Constitution, language and other cultural rights, the Minister explained.
The incumbent government took steps to release a portion of the military held private land back to the people, released almost half of the political prisoners who were held in custody and passed the Act for Office of Missing Persons to investigate into the whereabouts of those missing, said Ganesan, while in the political arena, he noted that the Steering Committee had developed a draft Constitution and the draft would be finalized by the end of this month, consisting of three segments: unanimous, majority and minority viewpoints. This would be submitted to the Constitutional Assembly and from there, we will come up with a new Constitution which would be agreeable to all, he said.
Amidst such achievements however, the Minister is acutely aware of the shortcomings in their policies.
The OMP is yet to be set up and the Police this year too sought a Court order to prevent those in the North commemorating their dead.
We have many regrets and as the Minister of National Co-existence, I regret the Police action to prevent those in the North from commemorating their dead. Nobody is commemorating the LTTE, which was a terrorist outfit, but these people have the right to remember their dead, a large number of Sri Lankans died due to the war and they have to be remembered, he said.
The JVP and FSP are allowed to commemorate their dead cadres. These are people who took up arms against the State, so you cannot have one law for the South and another for the North, he added.
On Wednesday morning, the General Secretary of the Bodu Bala Sena, Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera broke into the Ministers office to discuss improving relations among the different communities.
Gnanasara Thera broke into my office with much noise, but I conducted myself with much dignity, according to the teachings of Lord Buddha, said Minister Ganesan and observed that such incidents on the ground hampered reconciliation.
They are dismissing the concept of diversity, they are trying to impress upon us that we are second and third class citizens of this country and if this is reconciliation, we will never agree to it.This country belongs to all; we have three languages, four religions and 19 registered ethnic groups. Diversity is our strength and Gnanasara Thera cannot dismiss that, Ganesan said.

Muslim Ministers and MPs to stand independently in Parliament

Muslim Ministers and MPs who met this morning to discuss a 'common strategy' to 'approach the President and Prime Minister' on the recent attacks faced by the Muslim community, warn that they choose to sit independently in Parliament if the Leaders do not take action to rein in extremist groups in the country. 
According to a post shared on the Minister of Muslim Affairs and Postal Services, Abdul Haleem's Facebook profile, the Muslim legislators met at his ministry. Their focus has been the recent increase in activity by the Buddhist group; Bodu Bala Sena (BBS).
Over the last week, a series of incidents such as the attack on the Kohilawatte mosque in Sedawatte by an unidentified gang have led the MPs to believe that the BBS might be involved though the attackers are yet to be identified and apprehended.
A source at the meeting speaking to Daily News said that they have sent a letter requesting for a meeting with the President and they hoped that they will get an appointment before the President leaves the country on Tuesday.

NCcsl seminar on converting waste plastic into petroleum fuel on May 30
The National Chamber of Commerce in association with Polipto Lanka, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development, will conduct an awareness seminar for converting waste plastic and polythene into petroleum fuel that can be developed as an alternative to crude oil.
The seminar will be held on Tuesday, May 30, from 3.00 pm to 4.30 pm at the Chamber Auditorium , No. 450 D.R. Wijewardene Mawatha, Colombo 10.
The objective of the seminar is for the prevention of environmental pollution arising from haphazard dumping of plastic waste and to build up a polythene-free environment in the country.
The local government authorities collect nearly 3,500 MT of garbage daily. Nearly 245 MT of plastic disposed daily as garbage causes massive environmental damage unfavorably affecting land, waterways, oceans, and especially marine animals.
The seminar will highlight the dangers of dumping plastic waste and causing environmental damage and point the way forward for a polythene-free environment.
The seminar will be conducted by senior officials from Polipto Lanka headed by the Chairman, Dr Lionel Pinto, and followed by a panel discussion.
The seminar will be beneficial for waste plastic dealers and waste plastic collectors (especially of water bottles and shopping bags), establishments using boilers, furnace oil, and thermal energy.
The resource persons are Dr. Lionel Pinto, Chairman, Polipto Private Lanka, Udeni Wickramasinghe, CEO, Saman S. Senaweera, DGM (R.D.), Ananda Withanage, Director/Inventor and Prof. Rahal Attanage, Deputy Vice Chancellor, University of Moratuwa.

One-eyed wonder
A one-eyed goat born in Assam, India, is being seen as a blessing by its owner. The kid was born May 10 with only one eye, one ear and barely a nose, thanks to a condition called cyclopia that occurs in the womb when the brains two hemisphere do not separate.
Usually animals with the condition die within hours after being born, but this goat has defied expectations, according to Barcroft TV.
The one-eyed goat is attracting a lot of attention to the farm where it was born, and that pleases Mukhuri Das, the goats owner.
I was shocked. Its like a miracle and people have been coming to our place to see this baby goat, he told Barcroft TV. It might be something from God that the baby goat was born in our house.
Das believes the one-eyed animal is bringing luck to his family and hes not kidding around.
So many people are coming to our place to see this baby goat, he said. We are happy that its making us famous.
Das said he has been feeding the one-eyed goat like a normal animal, even though it has shorter than normal upper jaw and is missing some teeth.

Outstanding Contribution to the Legal Profession
New Presidents Counsel:
The appointing of Presidents Counsel recognise the work of prominent lawyers who have made their mark in the legal field. They also reflect notable achievements over the years including outstanding work, impressive strategic growth and excellence within the legal system.
Presidents Counsel is a professional rank and status, conferred by the President under Article 33 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which is recognised by courts. It does not entail the title holder to be a state prosecutor or employed by the state or part of the office of the President. Appointments are made from Attorneys-at-Law who have practised as counsel in original and appellate courts for many years either in the official or unofficial bar.

Anura B. Meddegoda
Anura Bandara Meddegodas career as an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court spans 34 years. He took Oaths on October 2, 1981.
Prior to being called to the Bar, Meddegoda apprenticed in the Chambers of Faisz Musthapha, Presidents Counsel, late Presidents Counsel Nehru Goonetilleke, and late Presidents Counsel Tivanka Wickremesinghe, .
Shortly after his Call to the Bar, on January 1, 1982, Meddegoda joined the Department of the Attorney General as a State Counsel. In 1993, he was appointed a Senior State Counsel. During the course of his legal career in Sri Lanka, as Counsel for the State, he has appeared in major criminal prosecutions in the High Court and the Magistrates Courts of Sri Lanka and also appeared in the Superior Courts.
In 1994 Meddegoda joined the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal where he worked in the Office of the Prosecutor as a prosecuting Trial Attorney/Legal Adviser. He has acquired wide and varied experience in international law and relations, particularly in the investigation and prosecution of serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and has also been actively involved with maintaining peace and security and working towards reconciliation amongst communities in strife torn countries in the former Yugoslavia.
In cases before the International Criminal Tribunal, Meddegoda has appeared as Counsel in trials as well as appeals before both the Trial and Appellate Chambers of the Tribunal. Whilst working in the International Criminal Tribunal, he has had nearly 10 years experience in negotiations between the Office of the Prosecutor and the Government of the Republic of Croatia (GRC) and the FRY. These negotiations at meetings with Prime Ministers, Ministers of government, Ambassadors, Judges, Prosecutors and other law enforcement officials have resulted in improved relations between the International Criminal Tribunal and the relevant States, particularly in the areas of State co-operation and support in the flow of information and evidence, establishing protocols and modalities for such purpose, enacting new legal instruments and proactive support in the arrest and surrender of fugitives.
In a letter addressed to the then Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs about his work in the International Criminal Tribunal, the then Prosecutor Justice Louise Arbour has stressed upon the important role Meddegoda has played in the Office of the Prosecutor in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia and commended him as an outstanding lawyer performing work of the highest professional standard and that the Government of Sri Lanka and the Department of the Attorney General has every right to be proud of the contribution made by him.
Upon his return to Sri Lanka in 2005, Meddegoda reverted to active legal practice and has developed an extensive and successful practice appearing in a very large number of cases, in both the original and appellate courts in the areas of Fundamental Rights, Criminal Law, Commercial Law, Matrimonial Law, Industrial and Labour Law, Testamentary Law, and Intellectual Property Law. He hs also been retained in particular cases to appear as Junior Counsel to eminent senior lawyers namely, Faisz Musthapha PC, Romesh de Silva PC, Shibly Aziz, PC, Gamini Marapana PC, S. Sivarasa PC, M. M. Zuhair PC, Dr. B. J. P. De Almeida Gunaratne PC, and the late C. R. de Silva PC.
He has also been retained to appear on behalf of, and also provided advice on Sri Lankan legal issues to, several foreign governments and Law Firms.
Meddegoda has also had the opportunity to address judicial and law enforcement agencies in the former Yugoslavia and public fora including the Asian Society of International Law and the International Committee of the Red Cross on a variety of legal issues pertaining to international humanitarian law. He possesses an Honours degree in International Law from Kings College University of London.
He has been a Lecturer in the law of Criminal Procedure at the Sri Lanka Law College and been a visiting lecturer in International Humanitarian Law in the University of Colombo. He has also lectured and made presentations at a number of Seminars including Seminars organized by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and the Colombo Law Society.
Meddegoda has been actively involved with the activities of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) having served in the Executive Committee of BASL during the stewardship of Presidents Counsel Shibly Aziz, and Presidents Counsel. Upul Jaysuriya, .
He has served on numerous committees of BASL including being Chair of the Public Interest Litigation Committee, Continuing Legal Education Committee, Police-Bar Relations Committee and the Overseas Relations Committee. As Chair of the Public Interest Litigation Committee, Meddegoda appeared in support of several public interest litigation cases including the Pasyala Police shooting case in the Court of Appeal, Matale mass grave exhumation case in the Matale Magistrates Court, Rathupaswala incident in the Magistrates Court Gampaha, Beruwela communal violence case in the Magistrates Court Kalutara.
Meddegoda who has an unblemished record as an Attorney-at-Law has consistently maintained the highest standards of integrity, conduct and professional rectitude.
In April 2004, Meddegoda was appointed as Secretary Ministry of Justice and Judicial Reform by Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge which appointment he could not take up due to his ongoing commitments at the time with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.
Karunaratne Herath
Karunaratne Herath has known many ups and down in his career spanning over 37 years and has overcome them all with great commitment and forbearance to become the first Attorney from the North Central Province to be appointed as Presidents Counsel.

The Princess and the Photographer
On May 6, 1960, the sun too gave a wedding present to the couple getting married that day. He gave them clear, blue skies.
From the flagpoles along the streets of London hung white silk banners with the initials of the bride and groom entwined on red Tudor roses. There was a grandstand outside Westminster Abbey and discreetly hidden television cameras inside (it was the first royal wedding to be televised).
Among the 2,000 guests were not only the expected array of statesmen, peers, ministers, and close friends of the couple, but also the three living wives of the bridegrooms father. Other guests included the grooms housekeeper and the postman from his fathers village in Wales.
The bride who looked exquisite in what Life magazine later called the simplest royal wedding gown in history, was Queen Elizabeths sister, Princess Margaret. She was 28, at the height of her beauty and charisma, poised, stylish, and groomed to perfection. Yet, often imperious - if she was bored, she showed itat one small supper dance given in her honor, when her host asked her, Maam, will you start the dancing she replied, Yesbut not with you.
As fate would have it, all this changed in the spring of 1958, when one of Margarets dazzled admirers asked her if she would sit for a photograph. He said he knew just the right photographer. She agreed.
The chosen photographer was Antony Tony Armstrong-Jones. According to Vanity magazine Tony took charge of the sitting in his usual way. With the utmost politeness, he made her change her clothes, her jewelry, and her pose as if she were any other sitter.
Princess Margaret, accustomed to unquestioning deference, had never met anyone like him. She decided that she wanted Tony in her circle, and after a while his face could be seen among the parties of six or eight people in which the Princess went to the theater or dined out.
Nobody knew about their relationship, there wasnt a whisper about it,  says Anne de Courcy, in her biography of Tony. She would see him in secret at his studio and yes, he would join her at parties, but no one could pinpoint which man she was interested in. The press focused more on the ones who were seen to be eligible. They didnt think of Tony who was often in the background.
For Tony it was all overwhelming. He was used to pretty girls, from unsophisticated dbutantes to models and actresses, but Margaret was something different. She was gilded with the mysterious, mythic aura of royalty. Everything around her spoke of this. For example, at every meal the Princess was served first, and no one could speak to her without first being addressed by her. In some houses, if she did not help herself to, say, potatoes, no one else could.
Unlike with her sister, Elizabeth, Tony was not Margarets first love. She had been linked to several beaus in the past, most notably her fathers and sisters former equerry, Peter Townsend. After a tumultuous period of will-they-wont-they, their relationship ended on 31 October 1955. Wishing to show the public she had moved on from Townsend, on February 26, 1960, her engagement to her new love interest, Tony the photographer, was announced. The news came as a surprise to many, and it didnt go over well with everyone, particularly royal courtiers who would have preferred Margaret to marry a wealthy aristocrat. When Noel Coward, a fervent royalist, heard the news he wrote in his diary, He [Tony] looks quite pretty but whether or not the marriage is entirely suitable remains to be seen. When Lord Pembroke heard of the engagement, he exclaimed, Then Ill go and live in Tibet!
But love endured, mainly because in spite of the objections, the royal family was delighted with the match. They all liked him very muchTony had great charm, very good manners and he knew exactly how to behave, de Courcy explains. He felt devotion to the royal family, to the Queen, who he admired immensely. He got on very well with Prince Charles and he adored the Queen Mother.
On her wedding day Princess Margaret made an exquisite bride. Her dress, designed largely by Tony, though ostensibly by Norman Hartnell, had three layers of organza over tulle. The St. Cyr of Paris veil was also tulle bound. The overall effect prompted The Times to write of Margaret, it was as though she moved in a soft white cloud.
The simplicity of the dress allowed for some statement accessories: a diamond necklace from her grandmother Queen Mary and the large Poltimore Tiara acquired specially for her. The wedding ring was of Welsh goldsome of the gold from which the Queens wedding ring was made had been set aside for Margarether high-heeled shoes were white, and she carried a bouquet of white orchids.
Tony was a slight, elegant figure in his wedding morning coat, designed by the tailors who had made suits for him since he was an Eton schoolboy, Denman & Goddard. As he proceeded carefully down the aisle, his slight limp from his childhood bout with polio was barely noticeable.
After the wedding ceremony, as Tony, the first commoner to wed a kings daughter in over 400 years, led Margaret onto the Buckingham Palace balcony, to stand there with the Queen, Prince Philip, and the royal children, the cheering rose to a crescendo.
Another fairy tale wedding had reached an end proving love knows no barriers. No mountain could be too high, no ocean too deep when it comes to sharing your life with the one you love.

Rubber and Cocoa plantations for Ampara
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage yesterday said he plans to introduce rubber and cocoa plantations in 250,000 hectares of land coming under the Forest Conservation Department in Ampara.
The minister, addressing a press conference at Sirikotha, said the land would still belong to the Forest Conservation Department after the cultivations. Even though you say it is a forest, the trees in it had been felled during the time of the previous regime. Now it is like a desert, but despite that the Forest Conservation Department still retains it. I intend growing rubber and cocoa in it. This will be done jointly with the Environment Ministry. This will generate about 30,000-40,000 jobs the minister stated.
Dwelling on a long list of activities carried out by his ministry, Gamage said a programme to support local entrepreneurs has been initiated with World Bank assistance. Transfer of technology and financial assistance are given under this programme to project proposals that generate job opportunities or that significantly benefit the country.
Under this programme, if an entrepreneur has Rs 1 million in hand, he can opt for an investment worth of Rs 24 million. The Ministry gives a grant of Rs 5 million and another Rs 4 million will be facilitated as a bank loan under concessionary interest rates. When it is at the implementation stage, another loan of Rs 14 million will be facilitated he explained. Gamage said the Government hopes to create 130,000- 150,000 jobs under this programme. He said so far 1,200 applications have been received . The minister also spoke of his ministrys plans to increase the production of local spices, herbal plants, milk, honey and aquaculture.
The minister, replying to a question by a journalist on the colossal amounts of money spent on vehicles for ministers, said that he had neither bought new vehicles nor hold a duty free permit. I use my private vehicle and helicopter for travelling he said while also justifying his colleagues move to sell the duty free vehicle permits saying that, given the colossal amount of money needed for election campaigns under the existing electoral system such moves are not unexpected.
He went on to say that the real value of vehicles imported by the ministers is Rs 7.5 million though it is claimed as Rs 45 million, adding that the rest of the Rs 37.5 goes back to the Treasury as tax.

SAARC business visa hurdle bane to inter-regional trade and investment
Obtaining long term business visa for interregional travel in the SAARC region is still an issue, said SAARC Chamber of Commerce Chairman, Suraj Vaidya.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said that although businessmen promoted inter regional trade and created investment and employment opportunities he or she is only given a one or two year visa. However if I apply to USA I can get 5 years and EU even a visa for 10 years. This is very sad since the region does not recognize businessmen. According to the World Bank, South Asia is now the fastest growing region in the world. Its 7.1% growth in 2016 is expected to rise to 7.3% in 2017. South Asia  is yet to be ignited to sustain and further increase economic growth. He said that security is a issue for the region. But sadly terrorists dont need long term visas, he quipped.
Asked to comment on a single currency to the region like Euro he said it still remains a dream. These usually take decades globally.
Meanwhile several business leaders in Sri Lanka are asking as to why the Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry is taking Rs, 200,000 to assist local businessmen to obtain business visa for the SAARC region.
When contacted, new President, Ruwan Edirisinghe said that FCCSL too has to do a lot of ground work and also the chamber needs fiancs. He however said that this is not a fee and the money is not being misused.
SAARC Chamber of Commerce Chairman, Suraj Vaidya said that in Nepal they only take an annual membership.

Sharapova granted Birmingham wildcard
London: Maria Sharapova has been granted a wildcard for next month's WTA grasscourt event in Birmingham, a key Wimbledon warm-up, organisers said Thursday.
It comes two days after the Russian former world number one was refused a wildcard for the French Open following her 15-month ban for doping.
Next month will see 2004 Wimbledon champion Sharapova, 30, play the Birmingham event for the first time in seven years. She is guaranteed a spot in qualifying for Wimbledon but still hopes to get into the main draw for the Grand Slam with a wildcard.
Wimbledon chiefs will wait until June 20, just days ahead of the qualifying event, before deciding whether to give her a wildcard. Lawn Tennis Association chief executive Michael Downey accepted "not everyone will agree" with the decision to give Sharapova a wildcard for Birmingham.
"We have received a two-year commitment from one of the most famous athletes in the world, Maria Sharapova, to play the Aegon Classic Birmingham," he said, after the Russian said she would play there in 2017 and 2018.
"In return we are providing Maria with a main draw wildcard for this year.
"This wasnt a decision we took lightly and we recognise not everyone will agree with it, however Maria has served her ban in full and is now back playing high-quality tennis."
He added: "Theres always a lot of debate about who we give wildcards to. Now that Maria has earned direct entry into Wimbledon qualifying, we want to give British tennis fans the chance to see her compete on grass here in Britain beforehand."
The Birmingham event at the Edgbaston Priory club runs June 17-25, with Wimbledon commencing on July 3. AFP

SL backs Indias concern over Kashmir in Chinas OBOR project
Sri Lanka, which attended the just concluded Belt and Road Forum here, has backed Indias concern over the Kashmir issue, saying it is difficult for New Delhi to accept the USD 50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it goes through the heart of Indian interests.
India, which skipped the high-profile meeting, would have joined very happily in the One Belt and One Road (OBOR) initiative of China, said Sarath Amanugama, Sri Lankas Minister on Special Assignment.
Unfortunately, the issue is going through the heart of Indian interests. If it is some uncontested region, India would have negotiated its way out. Here especially the Kashmir issue getting dragged into it, makes it difficult for India to be flexible, Amanugama, who accompanied Lankan Prime Minister Wickramasinghe to the two-day forum here, told PTI.
He said India, China and Sri Lanka were very much part of the ancient Silk Road route as the Chinese Buddhist scholars like Faxian visited both India and Sri Lanka leading to big discoveries of Buddhist relics in the island nation.
(Chinese) President Xi Jinping has emphasised connectivity. These countries were connected many centuries ago. This will link up these countries on certain rational basis. Once the regional problems are resolved, then India has to play big role in the initiative, he said, adding that India anyway has to play big role because you cannot think of a belt and road without going over and close to India.
India skipped the meeting due to its sovereignty concerns over the USD 50 billion CPEC, which goes through Pakistan- occupied Kashmir. The two-day conference in Beijing brought together leaders from 29 countries.
Besides Wickramasinghe, the summit was attended by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and several other leaders, heads of UN, World Bank and IMF.
Wickaramasinghe, who arrived here a day after he hosted Prime Minister Narandra Modi in Sri Lanka, had a low-key presence at the high-profile summit.
While Sharif and many other leaders spoke at the inaugural ceremony, the Sri Lankan leader reportedly took part in the discussions in the round table meeting yesterday.
Amunagama said that Sri Lanka will not permit any foreign military operations in its port by any country including China, in an effort to reassure Indias security concerns over Chinese military activity.
Sri Lanka has an estimated debt of USD eight billion to China. The loans were taken for different mega projects.

The Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCISL) with the concurrence of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will shortly introduce a nationwide programme to bring all micro, small and medium scale businesses to a mainstream platform with the objective of lending support and guidance for a productive and improved overall performance by this sector.
We will support those engaged in any formal or informal business or trading that provides a service to the community and contributes towards strengthening of this sector, said Sarath Kahapalarachchi, Chairman of the Federation.
The FCCISL together with CH17 Loyalty have mapped out a programme that will identify micro and SMEs, formally recognise them, incorporate them to the national network and reward and recognise them for their service to the community, said Jumar Preena, CEO, CH17 Loyalty and architect of the programme.
"We also have a very strong partnership with Commercial Bank and MasterCard who will also join this programme and chip in with their expertise, services and facilities exclusively for this sector. For the first time a SME branded Privilege MasterCard Debit/Credit Card will be issued to a registered member, Preena said.
CH17 Loyalty will play a vital role in facilitating privileges and benefits to registered SMEs from their own network of merchants and retailers of consumer products.All these facilities and services will be at very nominal cost and concessionary terms, Preena said.
Primary among them will be the concessions extended to the programme by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) whose services form the backbone of any commercial business. SLT has been very generous in offering up to 60% in discounts on a number of their products.
In addition, the Enterprise Solution Division of SLT will also assist in providing a combination of enterprise solutions at a concessionary rate.
We want to extend our support to MSMEs to grow and develop their business, which in the long run will help the country to have a strong and robust GDP, said Prabath Dahanayake, GM Product Development Management, SLT.
Our unmatched technology and resources in the field of telecommunications and the strength of our superior and reliable services would be an added benefit to this sector. We have the most talented and dedicated team of professionals who can advise on any business solutions whether they are large or small projects," Sanjeewa Jayamaha, DGM Product Development and Management, SLT, said.
Secretary General of FCCISL Ajith Perera said the Federation would welcome any individual or partnerships engaged in any regular business to register and avail themselves of the great benefits that are in store for them through this programme.
