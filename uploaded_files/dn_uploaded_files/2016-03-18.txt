Corrupt politicos building separate camp: Anura

Politicians who were involved in corruption, waste and murder seem to be building a separate political camp so that they will not be punished, JVP leader and parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the chairmenship of the SLFP to President Maithripala Sirisena and came back to politics to protect his family, Dissanayake said at a press conference at the JVP Head Office auditorium at Pelawatta, Battaramulla. He said when there was terrorism, the TID was set up while the FCID was set up to investigate the massive corruption and waste.
"So far 193 complaints have been filed before the FCID and reports of 34 investigations on those complaints have been sent to the Attorney General's Department," MP Dissanayake said. "Charges have been filed against four accused in four such incidents."
Dissanayake said those against whom complaints have been made before the FCID would be seen at Thursday's Joint Opposition stage at Hyde Park grounds.

LG polls in Mullaitivu: CaFFE calls for conducive environment

Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) on March yesterday, sent a letter to the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Faiszer Musthapha calling for elections pertaining to two local Government institutions in the Mullaitivu District to be held and calling for the creation of an environment conducive for political parties to be registered.
The letter also mentions that due to the postponement of Local Government elections in Muhudubadapaththu and Pudukuduirippu in the Mullaitivu District, even though it is nearing seven years since the war ended, a Local Government by people's representatives had not been established. Since the end of the war, these two pradeshiya sabha jurisdictions remain the only ones where Local Government had not been put in place.
It is in no way a democratic practice to hold a Local Government election based on nomination lists accepted over five years back.
On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that related court proceedings were a tactic by a pradeshiya politician to prevent the Tamil National Alliance from gaining power owing to the political environment prevalent at that time.
Elections could be held under new nominations in the aforementioned Local Government authorities through an Act of Parliament.
Even though various parties on many occasions have highlighted the need for a draft of a Bill with regard to this, nothing has taken place yet in this regard.
Due to various elections being held at various times, as of present for over 10 years now, no new political parties have being registered.
This has resulted in the creation of a wholly unhealthy environment for multiparty politics.
This situation has curtailed the ability for many groups who conduct themselves with a genuine political identity to act as a political party.
The responsibility of formulation of the laws necessary to solve both these issues fall on the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government. The said Ministry led by the Minister has to take the responsibility for not only holding the elections on time, but also providing the facilities required to hold elections.
This is because Sri Lanka's State accepts multiparty democracy and also holds free and fair elections.
CaFFE requests that the drafts of Bills essential for the holding of the Local Government elections in Muhudubadapaththu and Pudukuduirippu, be presented to Parliament without further delay and steps be taken to present to the Parliament the suitable legal amendments which would allow for new political parties to be registered.

No finality on increasing MPs' allowances: Gayantha

No discussion was held at the House Committee to increase the salaries of parliamentarians except to revise the allowances, being paid to them, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said.
However, certain elements were leveling baseless allegations that the discussion was based on a salary hike for parliamentarians.
All parties represented in Parliament were at the discussion, but no objection was raised by any party. However, no final decision has been taken to increase the allowances of parliamentarians.
Minister Karunathilaka added that allowances of parliamentarians have not been increased for nine years as the final allowance hike was made in 2007. "This is the very reason to increase the allowances of Parliamentarian. The present allowance paid for maintaining an office is not sufficient" he said. The Minister stressed that no final decision was taken on the increase of allowance and the proposal will be subjected to further discussions.However, if a decision is taken to increase the allowances, only the suitable persons will be entitled to receive it. He further added that a form should be filled to claim the increased allowances by parliamentarians.
Then both the public and journalists,who are keen on this, can be made aware who are eligible and who are not not(to get the increased allowances).

Tamara adjudged Best athletic coach of Kandy

Tamara Padmini Wickremasinghe presently with Pushpadana Girls College, Kandy, was presented with the award as the Best Athletic Coach of the Kandy Education Zone by the Chief Minister of the Central Province Sarath Ekanayake at a ceremony held at the auditorium of St. Sylvester's College.
Tamara Padmini Wickremasinghe counts over 25 years experience as an athletic coach and 24 of them being in the Kandy Education Zone. She coached Mahamaya Girls College for 21 years and before she was transferred to her present school Pushpadana Girls College, Kandy three years.
Tamara Padmini Wickremasinghe is an athlete of repute and has many records to her credit. She has one national record which can never be broken or equalled which is she is the first women athlete to run the marathon in Sri Lanka. Before this ladies running in marathons were unknown and in 1984 a a girl just out of her teens she stunned the athletic world when she ran the marathon along with men in the event organised by the Ministry of Sports. The route was along the rugged road from Torrington Square to Maharagama and back and this is something shunned by the ladies at that time.
She hails from the village of Alawwa and at school she excelled in many sports but track and field was her forte. Her winning performance at District, provincial and national level are too numerous to mention here. She also ran the marathon in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan with international though not winning she came in for a lot of recognition. Those were days the days she said that were no supplementary food, vitamins or performance enhancing exercises. We had to train all by ourselves and there was hardly anyone to tells how to start or finish and adjust ourselves while the race was in progress so that we could be in line to win.
She held the national record for 1500 metres in 1982. She also kept a record for 10 kilometres walking. Thus displaying that she could not only run but also walk faster than the others. The walking race 82.84 minutes. This was not a fun race witnessed at village new year festivals but an all island competition organised by Bata and the Ministry of Sports to decide on the Walking Champion.
After bidding adieu at the national level she moved into veterans events at International Level where she excelled in an amazing manner.
She struck gold at the veterans meets held in Singapore, Japan and Malaysia in 1500 metres, 800 metres and 3000 metres in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
She said that one of the main essentials in maintaining the winning spirit is to do regular exercises and keep fit without which your muscles get hardened and loses its power and flexibility and you limp off in pain while running.
