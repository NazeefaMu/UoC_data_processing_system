Silent Night: from village ditty to global Christmas hit
AUSTRIA: When Silent Night was born in Austria almost 200 years ago, those present had little idea that the Christmas carol would one day be sung the world over, including this year by Miley Cyrus and some Swedish goats.
Such though was the destiny of Stille Nacht, premiered to a modest church congregation of ship labourers and their families in this small town in Austria on Christmas Eve, 1818. The words, since translated into more than 300 languages and dialects -- including Japanese, Welsh and Farsi -- had been written as a poem by a priest, Joseph Mohr, in 1816, a time of great suffering in the wake of Europes Napoleonic wars.
Two years later, Mohr asked his friend stationed in a nearby village, the organist, choirmaster and schoolteacher Franz Xaver Gruber, to compose a tune.
When Gruber duly obliged on December 24, the two men decided to sing it together that very evening at mass in Oberndorf church.
The organ was broken, according to legend because of nibbling mice, so Mohr played guitar.
Many years later in his 1854 Authentic Account of the Origin of the Christmas Carol, Silent Night, Holy Night!, Gruber recalled there was general approval by all.
This approval would snowball, although it is a bit of a mystery how exactly the song then spread.
It is thought that a key role was played by one Carl Mauracher, a master organ builder and repair man, who took the song back home to the Zillertal valley in the Tyrol region.
There it was adopted by two travelling singing groups, the Rainer Singers and the Strasser Siblings, who performed around Europe and beyond -- including in the Rainers case in the United States.
They were the pop stars of the time, said Anna Holzner from the Silent Night museum -- home today to Mohrs guitar -- in Hallein, where Gruber lived until his death in 1863.
An English version of the German original soon followed, and by the end of the 19th century it was being sung on all continents, its spread helped by Christian missionaries.
During World War I, legend has it that German and British soldiers in opposing trenches sang it at Christmas 1914, its call for peace sounding out over no mans land during a famous truce.
Since then the song has been recorded many hundreds of times by the likes of Bing Crosby -- to huge success -- and Elvis Presley, without forgetting John Denver with the Muppets and gravel-voiced satanic German rockers Erloesung.
This year, along with Cyrus, comes a new version bleated by goats released by the Swedish branch of charity Action Aid -- part of an album entitled All I want for Christmas is a Goat.
Today, Mohr and Gruber are honoured in around a dozen sites locally, including in Oberndorf and in Hochburg-Ach, Grubers birthplace where for the past 10 years locals have performed a special play every Christmas.
In my country this song is sung in 20 or 30 different languages, Sally, 45, a bus driver in Salzburg originally from Ghana, told AFP, one of several people performing the song in different languages in the play. The original Oberndorf church -- along with its pesky mice -- was demolished at the beginning of the 20th century after being damaged by floods. Today in its place stands a small chapel. With stained glass windows depicting Mohr and Gruber, every December 24 thousands of people gather outside for a Christmas ceremony, including of course a rendition of Silent Night.

Black Box from warplane downed by Turkey unreadable-Russia
RUSSIA: Investigators in Moscow said on Monday they were unable to retrieve information from the damaged black box of a Russian warplane shot down by Turkey last month, data the Kremlin hoped would support its version of what happened.
Russia's Defence Ministry publicly opened the recorder last week, hoping its contents would confirm Moscow's assertions that the bomber did not stray into Turkish air space and was maliciously downed.
"Retrieving the information and a read out of flight data ... has proven to be impossible because of internal damage," said Sergei Bainetov, the Russian Air Force's deputy head of flight safety. Bainetov said 13 of the flight recorder's 16 microchips had been destroyed and that those remaining were damaged.
The damage was so severe, he said, because of the sheer force with which the plane had hit the ground after being struck by an air-to-air missile, severing a cord that connected the black box and the jet's avionics.
The defence ministry would now turn to specialised scientific institutions in the hope that they could get something from the damaged chips, he said, saying it was an uncertain process that was likely to take "a lot of time." The downing of the Russian SU-24 fighter-bomber by Turkish jets on Nov. 24 was the most serious confrontation between Moscow and a NATO member state in the last 50 years.
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Turkey of "stabbing Russia in the back" and ordered a raft of retaliatory economic sanctions against Ankara. Turkey says the warplane, part of Russia's Syria-based strike force, strayed into its airspace and ignored repeated warnings to leave. Russia says the plane did not leave Syria and posed no threat to Turkey.

Development brought to the doorstep of the masses - Sajith
The country is undergoing political and social and transformation under the leadership of the Maithri-Ranil duo, with development being brought to the doorstep of the masses, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He said bags of cement would be given to 75, 000 low-income families in Lunugamvehera to mark President Sirisena's first year in office.
Minister Premadasa was addressing a gathering in Lunugamvehera to mark the provision of low-interest housing loans among 700 families in the area. The families would be provided with low-interest loans of Rs. 50, 000 each under the 'Samata Sevana' programme, to enable them repair their houses. The loan would be given in two installments Minister Premadasa said.
The first installment would be of Rs. 30,000, and the balance Rs. 20,000 would be given once the first stage of the work is completed by January 15, 2016.
He said the repayment of the loans would begin after the full loan is released completely to the householder.
The repayment period will be ten years on the basis of Rs. 500 a month. The beneficiary could repay the loan in five years in he wished. Then the monthly installment will be Rs. 915. Another 1000 families in Lunugamvehera would receive the Rs. 50,000 loan within the next three months, the Minister said.
Minister Premadasa said that under the programme initiated by his Ministry, Rs. 10,000 would be released to another 2000 households in Lunugamvehera to plaster their houses with. Under the programme, 1080 households in each district would be benefited by the end of 2015, the Minister said.
The programme would be extended further over the coming year to benefit 75,000 families by providing cement to 3000 families in each of the 25 districts January 8 next year, to mark the first anniversary of President Maithripala Sirisena installation in office. He also said 12 model villages have been selected for development in the Tissamaharama electorate, under the 'Uda Gammana' programme.

Hillary Clinton's missing moments during Democratic debate
US: Hillary Clinton went missing during the Democratic debate and her absence did not go unnoticed.
After the first commercial break - almost an hour into the third Democratic debate on Saturday night, the debate returned to the screen with two candidates at the podium, Senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley.
The former Secretary of State was missing.
Rather than waiting, moderator David Muir moved forward, asking Mr Sanders a question. Mrs Clinton came walking in, and said "sorry" into the microphone.
The reason why she was late hasn't been disclosed, but her calm apology was received with laughter and cheers by the audience.
It was likely just a matter of timing. She had exactly one minute and 45 seconds to walk out of the gymnasium at St Anselm College to the ladies' restroom and one minute and 45 seconds to return to her place on stage.
With the men's room significantly closer to the debate stage, Mrs Clinton's male opponents, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley, made it back more quickly.
Aides said they had been concerned during the walk through before the debate that the ladies room was such a schlep. The campaign's vice chairwoman, Huma Abedin, had timed the distance to and from the podium and expressed concerns to organisers, but the gymnasium setting meant there were no closer options. She relayed to Mrs Clinton that she would have to be speedy, said several aides involved in debate planning.
In the end, the moment became one of the most talked about of what seemed an otherwise low-impact debate. The momentarily empty podium prompted jokes that Mrs Clinton, so focused on defeating the Republicans, had, perhaps, decided to watch the primary debate from a Manchester bar, with a row of glistening ladies' rooms nearby.
In the first Democratic debate in October, Mrs Clinton was also late to return to the stage after a break, and said, "You know, it does take me a little longer", a comment referencing that it can take women longer to use the bathroom.
Some on Twitter blamed the ABC television network for coming back from the commercial break too early. Others said that the campaigns should have negotiated with the network to not return until all candidates were back on stage.

Polish professor jailed over plot to blow up Parliament
POLAND: A Polish court on Monday sentenced a former chemistry professor to 13 years in prison over a plot to blow up parliament with a massive car-load of explosives.
Brunon Kwiecien, 48, who was said to have had a fascination with Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, was convicted of planning to assassinate the President, Prime Minister and lawmakers in 2012. The former professor at Krakow's University of Agriculture in southern Poland had hidden four tonnes of explosives in a car which he planned to use during a parliamentary debate to be attended by then-president Bronislaw Komorowski among others.
If Brunon Kwiecien hadn't been stopped, we would be talking amid the ruins of the state today, said judge Aleksandra Almert as she delivered the verdict in a Krakow court. All steps taken by Brunon Kwiecien related to the attack on parliament were driven by his wish to lead a revolution, to kill the president, Cabinet ministers and lawmakers. Donald Tusk, then prime minister and now EU chief, said at that time that Kwiecien did not conceal his fascination with Breivik, the right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a bombing and shooting rampage in Norway in July 2011.
Kwiecien, a nationalist without any obvious links to any political groups or extremists, was arrested in November 2012 after what the media said was a tip-off by his wife.
He was found to be in possession of TNT, gunpowder and other explosives as well as firearms, military helmets, bullet proof vests and fake drivers licences.
Throughout the hearing, Kwiecien insisted he had fallen victim to provocation by Polish intelligence agents who had forced him to act. But Kwiecien, who has the right to appeal the verdict, never denied having planned the attack, for which he tried to recruit two of his students.
We cannot speak about provocation. It's enough to hear the accused and collect evidence. He was the mastermind behind every element of the attack, said Almert.
The case -- reminiscent of a plot to blow up parliament in Britain in 1605 -- was the first of its kind in ex-communist Poland.

We restored subsidies to the new Budget proposals - Nimal
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said that certain subsidies pruned in the original budget proposals by the Finance Minister were restored after pressure was exerted at the Cabinet meeting. Accordingly the fertilizer subsidy; the Rs. 80 per kilo guaranteed price for green tea; the stable price for paddy and for rubber remain unchanged, he said.
He said their action also forced the Finance Minister to drop the proposal to amalgamate the Samurdhi fund with the National Savings Bank, and enabled state banks to continue providing leasing facilities. He said both the President and the Prime Minister, as pragmatic and democratic leaders, had responded positively to the representations made by them.
The Minister, addressing a 'Jana Hamuwa', in Welimada, December 20, said certain people had thought the present government would fall within a few weeks.
"This government cannot be defeated for another four and a half years. According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, not even the President has the power to dissolve the government for four and a half years," he said.
The Minster also said it was the bounden duty of the SLFP to capture power at the forthcoming local government elections.
