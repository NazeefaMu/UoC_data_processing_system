Enterprising Sri Lanka with Peoples Bank
The government expects the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) sector to be the backbone of the economy.
However, the lack of capital or the difficulty in accessing capital due to both the cost of capital and the requirement of collateral have been the main impediments in the development of SMEs and start ups.
Debt capital has been always an issue for many entrepreneurs. Therefore, they were lagging behind on new investments and expansions. Enterprising Sri Lanka focuses on access to finance with low cost of funding with fixed terms enabling the entrepreneurs to take a long term view in their investments. While Peoples Bank empowers such entrepreneurs in nurturing through a dedicated customer relationship management model.
One of the main proposals of the Government budget, Enterprising Sri Lanka is a programme to empower the entrepreneurship in Sri Lankan entrepreneurs is already in process. Among various initiatives under Enterprising Sri Lanka, loans with interest concessions are the key proposal where there are more than 15 such loans schemes with different categories of interest subsidies.
Peoples Bank, being the Peoples service brand of the year for12 consecutive years, happily joins with the Government of Sri Lanka in implementing these schemes across the country with its enormous strengths and competencies.
Peoples Bank, being the pioneer in SME Lending since its inception in 1961, has assisted Micro and SMEs not only facilitating debt capital, but also inculcating savings habits, developing financial discipline, establishing good governance and improving managerial competencies of the targeted SMEs.
The strategy of the Bank is to develop and maintain a very strong customer relationship through a dedicated branch network across the country. This endeavor very well backed up by the dedicated SME centers established covering all administrative districts in the country.
The role of the SME center is to identify, nurture and develop potential business customers whose contribution to the GDP is immense and essential. Despite the risk in startups, Bank has the passion of identifying and nurturing them almost similar to the role of incubators.
The advantages of getting into a relationship with Peoples Bank are many. Among them, availability of any type of credit facilities, flexible terms and conditions, competitive or concessional rates of interests, structuring facilities on the need basis of customers, no hidden charges, state-of-the-art technology for banking transactions, very efficient foreign trade and trade finance facilities, having very friendly relationship and many more. Recently, bank digitalized most of its operations into virtual banking.
We have proven evidences of some young enthusiastic and energetic entrepreneurs identified from all corners of the country. Having identified at micro levels, they were methodically migrated to upper levels of their businesses through meticulous customer relationship management.
P.G. Chaminda, the sole proprietor of Orian Terra Lak Steel in Habarana was employed in a steel factory in South Korea. Upon his return to motherland, he has started a small scale steel doors assembling plant.
Then he was approached by our Habarana Branch and scaled up to a medium size steel door manufacturer with latest technology supplying job opportunities for more than 25 employees. This factory is environment friendly and saves lot of trees since the product is a substitute of wood based doors. His competitive advantage is the pioneer in adaptation to latest technology.
Manjuala Nishantha, Managing Director of Malindu Dairies Pvt Ltd is young entrepreneur who won the best Eco Friendly Entrepreneur of Southern Province  2018. He started his business with Rs. 5000 from Peoples Bank in 1992 and now is a popular dairy brand in the southern province.
His factory not only procures 4000 liters of fresh milk on a daily basis form the farmers in the area for processing, but also has provided more than 220 employment opportunities. He has gradually diversified into other businesses like processing spices and recent diversification is the bakery products.
D. Sampath Perera, sole proprietor of Deshakthi E Solutions is another young entrepreneur who has initiated a totally environmental friendly polythene factory in Dankotuwa. He recycles used polythene and manufacture bio-degradable polythene as a solid solution for the crying polythene issue in the country.

Financial aid, vocational training for youths keen on self employment - PM
The government will provide financial aid for youths along with vocational training who prefer self employment, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
Premier Wickremesinghe also said that the government cannot revive the country and its economy without a major contribution on the part of the countrys youths. The Prime Minister was speaking at the Youth with Talent 2017-Gamata Kotiyak awards ceremony held at Temple Trees yesterday morning.
Certificates and awards were presented to selected projects among 3,000 community based projects lead by youth participants of this programme.
The Youth With Talent 2017  Gamata Kotiyak programme organised by the Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Ministry, National Youth Services Council, the Sri Lanka Federation of Youth Clubs, Youth Parliament and Independent Television Network implemented 3,000 community based projects around the island.
The programme was allocated Rs.4500 million where each project was funded with Rs. 150,000. However, the project participants have added more financial value to these projects, making most projects worth more than Rs. 300,000.
Accordingly, the Youth With Talent 2017  Gamata Kotiyak programme records a grand value of Rs. 12,000 million. The Sinhale Api Youth Society in Galgamuwa, Kurunegala won the first place for their water supply project worth nearly Rs.960,000.
The second place was won by the Nuwara Eliya, Walapane Brave Hearts Youth Society and the third place went to Matale Wilgamuwa Sathsara Youth Society. Around 3000 youths participated in the event. Addressing the gathering, Premier Wickremesinghe further said the Youth with Talent programme will move to provide vocational training to youths who participate in the programme.
We will provide the much needed vocational training to these youths with the cooperation of the Government and Private Sector. When the training period is over, we will look into the possibility of creating space for these youths in these sectors, the Prime Minister said.
While pointing out the importance of industry based development, Prime Minister Wicikremesinghe said the government will especially focus on youths who want to be self employed following this training programme.
There would be youths who want to start their own businesses. The government will provide financial or other aid to these youths to set up their businesses. This is the way we can promote industry based economic development in the country, the Prime Minister said.
Speaking on the governments development plan, the Premier pointed out that the public will reap the benefits of the initiatives taken by the government in its first three years in service.
When you received financial aid for your community based projects, you must have taken some time to plan and collect more funds for your task. It is the same with the government. We took over a country burdened with debts. Therefore, we had to plan ways to get out of the debt crisis and initiate development plans. When we had the opportunity to expedite development projects, we have done so. There were times we had to move slowly, which we did. Whatever the approach it may be, our ultimate goal is to give you an economically strong country, the Prime Minister said.
Meanwhile, Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes vision is similar to that of the youths as it was 30 or so years ago, when he started the National Youth Services Council as the then Youth Affairs Minister.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe always worked for the betterment of the youth is Sri Lanka. He is dedicated to make a brighter future for our younger generation. We are looking forward to provide interest free or low interest loan facilities to youth, to start up their own businesses. We will provide them with skills and knowledge to start these businesses. I have requested the National Youth Club Committee members to assist these entrepreneurs by recommending them to local banks emphasising on their skills and attributes, Minister Ratnayaka added.

GMOA happy that PM concerned about SL doctors staying here
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is happy that the Prime Minister and the government are concerned about keeping Sri Lankan doctors in the country, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that there are certain things that need to be done in order to keep Sri Lankan doctors in the island, as stated by the Prime Minister during his recent speech at the World Health Day celebration.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the former Health Minister and current President did a significant service towards doctors and as a result, the number of consultants (specialists) increased threefold, while the total number of doctors doubled. The situation improved after the previous government ended the war in 2009. But under the current government, a hostile environment has been created in Sri Lanka for doctors.
Dr. Aluthge pointed out that certain things such as not signing the ECTA without a national policy on foreign trade agreements, not letting provincial health conventions destroy island-wide health service, stopping the creation of unqualified doctors through fraudulent companies such as SAITM, offering tax relief for doctors, not violating the National Wages Policy, making sure that doctors children get suitable schools and stopping all interference in granting duty free vehicle permits to doctors, should be looked into in order to encourage Sri Lankan doctors to remain in the country without migrating.

Hakeem leads team to SAARC sanitation confab
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem will lead a delegation of 35 Sri Lankans representing key stakeholders engaged in improving sanitation in Sri Lanka including government, civil society, donors, national experts and community organizations, to participate in the SACOSAN VII in Pakistan.
The conference will begin today and go on till April 14. Sri Lankan professionals will conduct a technical session on financing sanitation. The session will be chaired by Minister Hakeem during which four research papers on financing sanitation will be presented for discussion.
SACOSAN (South Asian Conference on Sanitation) is a government-led biennial convention held on a rotational basis in each SAARC country and provides a platform for interaction on sanitation. SACOSANs are intended to develop a regional agenda on sanitation, enabling learning from past experiences and setting actions for the future. The SACOSAN process is instrumental in generating the political will for better sanitation in the region.
Pakistans Climate Change Ministry has made arrangements to host the 7th South Asian Conference on Sanitation and it will be attended by governments of the SAARC regions along with the donor community, development partners, civil society, private sector, community-based organisations, researchers, professionals, schoolchildren and grassroots activists.
New challenges have emerged in the financing of sanitation with the commitment to achieve universal access to safely-managed sanitation under the Sustainable Development Goals. Investment decisions on sanitation have to depend on many factors as there is no clear picture on the existing situation unlike water supply.
On April 13, a ministerial summit with the participation of sector ministers of the SAARC region will be held to sign the Islamabad declaration on agreed commitments based on the outcomes of the conference deliberation over the previous three days.
The South Asian countries take every effort to implement the commitments made at the conference in the next few years until the next SACOSAN conference at which progress on implementation will be reviewed by all stakeholders.
Sanitation has become the most challenging social service priority in the South Asian region. One in three people worldwide lacks adequate sanitation facilities. The total population practising open defection in Asia exceeds 700 million. In 2003, South Asian countries met in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for the first-ever major conference on sanitation.

HRC alleges, Army breached UN peacekeeping protocol
In a letter addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena during last week, the Human Rights Commission (HRC) said the Army had breached an agreement to vet military personnel being sent for UN peacekeeper positions around the world.
HRC Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama said the commission and the tri-forces had jointly agreed to a vetting process for Sri Lankan troops being sent abroad.
They saw the vetting process as important, because the UN had previously accused a number of Sri Lankan forces on a peacekeeping mission to Haiti, of sex crimes.
However, Dr. Udagama said she and other commissioners were appalled to discover that 49 soldiers had been deployed to Lebanon in February, before their vetting was finalised.
We were astonished in this regard, since the Army was clearly aware that no Army personnel could be deployed for UN peacekeeping operations without being subjected to vetting by the Human Rights Commission, she wrote.
Deploying soldiers who have not undergone the vetting process is a violation of the agreement made with the Human Rights Commission, she added.
Reached by phone Monday, Army spokesperson Brigadier Sumith Atapattu declined to comment, except that the military believed it had followed the proper procedures.

JO wants Sampanthan out as Opposition Leader
The Joint Opposition has decided to submit a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya demanding that Tamil National Alliance Leader R.Sampanthan be removed as the Opposition Leader of Parliament.
If the Speaker does not respond positively, the JO is even prepared to submit a No-Confidence Motion against the Opposition Leader, a senior JO member said. MP Dinesh Gunawardene said, the JO will agitate both nationally and international for the removal of Sampanthan as he has failed to exercise his duties properly as the Opposition Leader.
Citing Sampanthans latest decision to vote against the JO sponsored No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, Gunawardene charged that Sampanthan continues to back the government and especially the Premier blindly in order to save his own position. Gunawardene said that Sampanthan has failed to galvanise the Opposition in a constructive manner in order to fight the shortcomings of the government. He said the Joint Opposition should be granted the post of Opposition Leader without delay as it had the required numbers in Parliament and the will to fight against the governments flaws. Meanwhile, former Minister Prof; Tissa Vitharana told Journalists in Colombo that Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan should be removed with a no-confidence motion (NCM).
Addressing a press conference organized by Joint Opposition at the N.M. Perera Memorial Center in Borella yesterday, Vitarana said it was high time that Samapnthan is replaced with a JO member to have a more vibrant and productive Opposition in parliament.
Sampanthan was designated as the Opposition Leader of the eighth parliament in 2015 after the present government came to power.
Following the decision taken by the Opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the main constituent party of the UPFA, to join the majority United National Party (UNP) to form a National Government, the TNA with its 16 seats in Parliament became the majority.

Languages Call Center established
The National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry has established the Languages Call Center, hotline (1956), for the public to inform the government of religious and ethnic violence.
The Ministry will also establish village level reconciliation committees to identify potential conflicts and report them.
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said the biggest issue was the lack of communication between the State and the grassroots. It results in the government not responding fast enough to quell such situations.
He said, many in the Digana area knew that the situation was getting out of control, but they did not inform it to the decision makers. The Ministry has taken steps to hold discussions with religious leaders, youth groups, government officials, artistes, women representatives and marginalised communities to identify the structure of the reconciliation committees and where they should be established first.
The government in keeping with its tri-lingual policy is to take steps to attach officials who can work in Sinhala and Tamil to government institutions, the Minister said.

Lanka's health service among world's best - WHO Director General
Sri Lankas health service is one of the best not only in Asia but in the world, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
Dr. Ghebreyesus had stated that the reason behind the high quality of Sri Lankas health service is because it is freely available. Sri Lankas political leadership gives a clear guidance to the Sri Lankan Health Service.
The WHO Director-General was addressing the World Health Day celebration in Colombo recently.
According to Dr. Ghebreyesus, Sri Lanka which was earlier a low income country is now a middle income country. Theres an excellent health service available in Sri Lanka under this situation. This is a good example even for high income countries.
WHO Regional Director for South - East Asia Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh said that the Health Ministry will have enemies everywhere because it has reduced the prices of drugs which is very admirable. Measures taken by the Sri Lankan Government to control tobacco are very admirable.
The WHO has planned to achieve sustainable development goals by 2030 but Sri Lanka has already achieved some of them. The steps taken by the Sri Lankan Government to control Non Communicable Diseases provide a good example for other countries, Dr. Singh said.

Main suspect, five accomplices in land racket arrested
Kelaniya Police arrested the key suspect and five others involved in large scale land frauds running into millions yesterday.
The Police Media Spokesman addressing a press briefing at the Peliyagoda SPs Office yesterday said the main suspect, Muthuthanthri Bastiange Lasith Brian Nishantha Fernando, a resident of Kanatta Road Batuwatte, Ragama, was arrested yesterday by a police team from the Kelaniya Police under the directions of SP Upali Jayasinghe.
The suspect marks plots of land advertised in newspapers for sale and obtains documents of the lands from the Land Registrars Office and changes the information on the documents. He changes names and other details on the land deeds. He then meets a landowner and keeps in mind his appearance. Thereafter, he uses an accomplice similar to the landowner and makes a forged ID with the impersonators photograph under the modified name on the deeds and other documents.
He then sells the land to an interested party. When the potential buyers peruse the documents via their lawyers, the information tallies, SP Jayasinghe said explaining the suspects modus operandi.
Police said the suspect could not have engaged in the racket without the assistance of state officials. Generally, the Land Registry does not allow anyone to bring in pens to check such documents and lawyers can use only a pencil in this regard. But all modifications on these documents were done with a pen. It suggests that the suspect got inside help to carry out the racket.
The lands are then sold at lower prices than that of the market value to attract buyers for them fast. Police said the suspects use different mobile phones and SIM cards for each deal, so that they cannot be traced.
So far, around 11 complaints about land frauds were made, while around Rs. 40 million was cheated through the frauds. Police arrested five accomplices of the main suspect. He had paid very well to impostors and others who supported him in forging the identity cards and other documents, police said..
Police had taken into custody forged deeds, identity cards, rubber stamps of several government institutions, mobile phones and SIM cards and several other items buried at the suspects house.
The suspects are to be produced before the Mahara Magistrates Court today (10).
The police warns land buyers to first confirm the identities of the land sellers before purchasing any land by checking relevant deeds and land documents.
The scam was revealed when a real owner of a land bought by a buyer came to know the deal and lodged a complaint to police.

Many governments taking steps to improve womens economic inclusion
Governments in 65 economies took steps to improve womens economic inclusion, enacting 87 legal reforms in the past two years, says the World Bank Groups Women, Business and Law 2018 report, released today.
However, women continue to face widespread barriers, entrenched in laws, that keep them out of jobs and prevent them from owning a business by restricting their access to credit or control over marital property, says the biennial report, which now monitors 189 economies. For example, it finds that in 104 economies women are barred from working at night or in certain jobs in many areas, including manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture, water and transportation. This negatively affects the choices of more than 2.7 billion women.
No economy can grow to its full potential unless women and men participate fully, said World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva. Yet in more than half the world women are still prevented from working in certain jobs simply because of their gender. The report finds that where there is gender equality in labor laws, more women work and earn more relative to men. Women should have the same equality of opportunity as men to provide for themselves, and to give their children the best start in life possible.
Now in its 5th edition, the report introduces, for the first time, a scoring system of 0 to 100, to better inform the reform agenda. Scores are assigned to every monitored economy on each of the reports seven indicators: accessing institutions, using property, getting a job, providing incentives to work, going to court, building credit, and protecting women from violence.
While no economy gets the perfect score of 100 in all seven indicators, economies that perform well across the indicators include the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Spain. OECD high-income economies generally have the highest average score across most indicators. Protecting women against violence, through laws against domestic violence and sexual harassment at work or in educational facilities, remains an area where much work is needed. Of the 189 economies examined, 45 do not have laws on domestic violence and 59 do not have laws against sexual harassment in employment. Overall, 21 economies receive a score of 0 in the protecting women from violence indicator. Many of these economies are located in Sub-Saharan Africa and in the Middle East and North Africa.
Although the vast majority of the economies monitored have laws establishing non-discrimination in employment based on gender, only 76 mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value and 37 economies have no laws protecting pregnant workers from dismissal.
In the area of building credit as well there is much room for improvement. Legislation prohibiting gender-based discrimination in financial services exists in only 72 economies, with 79 economies scoring 0 on this measure. Low income economies perform particularly poorly, with an average score of eight.
Giving women equal opportunity is a moral and economic imperative and rescinding discriminatory laws is an important first step. We hope the Women, Business and the Law data, which is publicly available, will be used to make the much-needed changes to enable women to make the choices that are best for them, their families and their communities, said Shanta Devarajan, the World Banks Senior Director for Development Economics.
The report cites research that shows that gender gaps cause an average income loss of 15 percent in the OECD economies, 40 percent of which is due to entrepreneurship gaps. Losses are estimated to be significantly higher in developing countries. Gender discrimination by law is also estimated to decrease female labor force participation and undermine economic growth. Research estimates that for some economies, a large fraction of country differences in output per capita can be attributed to gender inequality, and many countries can increase output per capita by discouraging gender barriers in the labor market.
Unfortunately, laws are a straight line for men and a maze for many women around the world. And that needs to change. There is no reason to keep women out of certain jobs or prevent them from owning a business. Our message is simple: no women, no growth, said Sarah Iqbal, Program Manager of the Women, Business and the Law project.
This years report includes a case study on womens financial inclusion, examining how discriminatory laws can affect womens demand for financial services. For example, limited access to and control over property constrain womens ability to provide collateral for loans.
The report records multiple reforms in some developing countries. These include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia.
By region, economies in East Asia and the Pacific implemented 11 of the 87 reforms carried out globally in the past two years. Highlights of reforms in the region included China, which expanded paid maternity for women under 25 years of age to equalize this benefit for all women; Kiribati, where a new labor code has lifted all restrictions on womens employment; and Malaysia, which now allows victims of sexual harassment to seek civil remedies.
The region generally performs well on the accessing institutions indicator, with an average score of 95, as most economies do not differentiate between women and men in a range of public interactions, such as registering a business, opening a bank account or obtaining a national identification. The region also performs well in the using property indicator, averaging a score of 83, with marital property regimes that empower women. However, East Asia and the Pacific economies average a score of only 19 in the area of building credit, which constrains womens access to finance, with 13 of the regions 25 economies scoring 0 on this indicator.
The region also performs poorly in protecting women against violence, with an average score of 44.
Fifteen of the past two years reforms were carried out in the Europe and Central Asia region. Highlights of reforms included Bosnia and Herzegovina, which eliminated several restrictions on womens employment, including in jobs deemed arduous, hazardous and underwater work; Bulgaria, where all restrictions on womens employment were removed; and Tajikistan, which abolished a restriction on womens night work.
The regions 25 economies generally perform well across most indicators, averaging a perfect score of 100 in the using property indicator and 99 on accessing institutions.
However, widespread gender-based job restrictions continue to prevail in the region, which earns an average score of 77 on the getting a job indicator, with only Latvia and Lithuania earning a perfect score on this indicator. The regions poorest performance is in the area of building credit, with an average score of 33; seven economies receive 0 and only two receive 100 on this indicator.
Another underperforming area is protecting women against violence, on which the region receives a score of 59, with almost a quarter of the regions economies lacking workplace harassment laws.
Economies in Latin America and the Caribbean carried out 8 reforms in the past two years. Highlights of reforms include Colombia, where the Constitutional Court struck down job restrictions on womens employment; and Ecuador, which equalized mens and womens property rights by no longer allowing a husbands decisions to prevail when spouses disagree on how to administer assets.
The regions strengths lie in the areas of using property and accessing institutions, with an average score of 98 and 97, respectively. On both indicators, all economies on the Latin America continent score a perfect 100 and varying scores in the Caribbean Islands. The region could improve on the getting a job indicator. Of the 32 economies covered in the region, less than half meet the International Labor Organization standard of 14 weeks or more of maternity leave.
Economies in the Middle East and North Africa carried out 10 reforms in the past two years. Iraq, with four reforms, earned a spot amongst the worlds top five economies with the most reforms. Iraqs reforms covered the areas of accessing institutions, getting a job, providing incentives to work, and protecting women against violence. In the area of getting a job, Iraq increased the length of paid maternity leave from 72 to 98 days and its new labor code prohibits discrimination based on gender. However, the new labor code also allows employers to terminate workers contracts when they reach retirement age, which is lower by five years for women.
In fact, 58 percent of the regions 20 economies have gender-differentiated retirement ages. The region also has the fewest protections for violence against women, with more than one-third of the economies scoring 0 on this indicator. Seventy percent of economies have no legislation on sexual harassment at work. Overall, the region has the worlds lowest average scores on four indicators.
In South Asia, four reforms were implemented in the past two years. Highlights of reforms included Afghanistan, where sexual harassment in employment and education are now prohibited and criminal penalties and civil remedies for sexual harassment in employment established. In India, the length of paid maternity leave was increased from 84 to 182 days. However, as employers bear the full cost of maternity leave, this could have a negative impact on the hiring of women of childbearing age. Bangladesh, on the other hand, introduced new restrictions on the work women can do by prohibiting women from carrying or lifting heavy goods.
With an average score of 39, South Asia has the lowest score in the world on the getting a job indicator. The region also has the poorest performance in the building credit indicator, with an average score of only nine. South Asias eight economies perform well in the area of protecting women against violence, with average score 85, besting even high-income OECDs average score of 75. Every economy in South Asia now has laws prohibiting sexual harassment in employment.
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to four of the worlds five economies which implemented the most reforms in the past two years. With 13 reforms collectively implemented by the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia, the region accounted for a total of 34 reforms. Nearly a third of these reforms were in the area of building credit, a weak point around the world, including in high-income OECD. With an average score of 19, Sub-Saharan Africa is on par with East Asia and Pacific on this indicator.
The region also carried out almost half of the worlds 13 reforms to protect women against violence. However, of the worlds 45 economies with no laws against domestic violence, 19 are in Sub-Saharan Africa, earning the region an average score of 46 on this indicator.
The region performs well in the areas of accessing institutions, with an average score of 87. In fact, 20 of the regions 47 monitored economies receive 100 on this indicator, with not a single economy earning 0. Using property is another area of relative strength for the region, with an average score of 76, and 16 economies with a perfect score.

More domestic airports to promote tourism Minister pins hope on 3 mn tourists by year end
Tourism and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga expressed hope that Sri Lanka could get as much as three million tourist arrivals by the end of this year.
By end of March, tourist arrivals grew by 25% despite the communal clashes, which took place in several places in the country.
The Minister made these comments speaking at a ceremony to award certificates for 18 tourist friendly eating places in Galle. The event was held at Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management, Colombo. Noting that sustainability of the industry is high unlike any other industry in the country, the Minister stressed the need to maximize the income from the tourism industry and to increase the number of tourist arrivals .To this end, the Minister pointed out that it is essential to offer quality services and products to cater to the needs of both local and foreign tourists.
Furthermore, the Minister stated that to facilitate and attract more tourists into the country, domestic airports are also being opened up and renovated. Meanwhile, Kavan Ratnayake, Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority speaking at the event stated that plans are underway to introduce a tourism friendly scheme initially for major categories such as Tuk Tuk drivers, tourist friendly eating places and home stay accommodation. It has also been proposed to introduce a common logo to tourist friendly places to create awareness among the tourists from the airport itself. Were trying to introduce a logo which tourists will become familiar from the time, they apply for the visa. We will start communications with them and start branding this logo right from the airport.
People will automatically look at this logo, as a safety mark and tourists will be naturally attracted to places with this mark. Ratnayake stated. Tourism Development Authority commenced the fourth phase of the project called, Certification scheme for tourist friendly easting places in Galle to recongise , upgrade the quality standards of eating places and to provide clean , safe and hygienic food for foreign and local tourists. Under the first phase of the project, Sri Lanka tourism has certified 66 eating places in Colombo Municipal council area and under the second phase of the project, 18 eating places in Kandy Municipal area were received certifications.
According to Sri Lanka Tourism, the main objectives of the project include upgrading the basic standards of eating places in tourist zones, make awareness regarding the necessity of providing standard food, services in all eating places in the country and to encourage them to upgrade the service standards of all eating places in the country in par with international standards and to create competition among similar eating places in selected areas and encouraging them to upgrade and to obtain the certification.
Under this project, two types of certification are granted in these places with A and B grades.

NCM against all SLFP MPs who voted against PM, if wont quit
UNP backbenchers have decided to bring in a No-confidence motion (NCM) against all 16 SLFP MPs who voted against the Prime Minister, if they fail to resign or are not removed from the ruling coalition.
On the night of April 4, a victorious UNP had 33 UNP backbenchers handing over a letter to the Prime Minister, asking that SLFP Ministers who voted against him be removed from the Cabinet.
On April 7, they handed over a No-Confidence Motion against the six SLFP Cabinet ministers and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
The Department of Government Information thereafter in a statement clarified that the Prime Minister had asked that the backbenchers withdraw their NCM against the SLFPers as it was not a party decision. The statement further noted that a decision on it would be made at the UNP Group meeting.
At the UNP Working Group and Parliamentary Group meeting, we all decided that we should bring in the NCM against all 16 SLFPers together, UNP MP Ashu Marasinghe said speaking to the Daily News yesterday.
He added that the Premier had only asked that they hold back on the NCM and that he did not ask them to withdraw it.
We hear that the 16 SLFPers want to resign from the government and that the decision will be made at their Central Committee meeting today (9). So if that happens, we will not need to bring in a NCM, the MP further explained.
The SLFPers who voted against the PM are; Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, John Seneviratne, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr.Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Anura Yapa, S B Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne, T.B Ekanayake and Sumedha Jayasena.

New tax law to support govts revenue generation - Moodys
The new Inland Revenue Act which took effect will build on international best practices, rationalize the existing income tax structure and help broaden the income tax base by removing exemptions, Moodys Investors Service said in a statement.
With a very large debt burden and weak debt affordability weighing on its credit profile, successful implementation of revenue reforms will help foster fiscal consolidation. Sri Lanka is currently in an International Monetary Fund (IMF) program in which reforms that contribute to fiscal consolidation are central to meeting IMF program targets.
The government expects the removal of tax exemptions and the introduction of new taxes, including a capital gains tax, to increase government revenue by 0.5% of GDP in 2019 following its first full year of implementation. Moodys considers this target to be achievable. In addition, tax revenue will be strengthened by improved administration through the rollout of Sri Lankas new technology systems and value-added tax compliance strategies.
Moodys expects that these measures will strengthen Sri Lankas fiscal metrics, which are weak compared with many similarly rated sovereigns. In particular, Sri Lankas government revenue as a share of GDP is lower than many peers, while the government debt-to-GDP ratio is much higher, weighing on its sovereign credit profile.
We expect government revenue to rise 0.4 percentage point to 15.2% of GDP in 2018 and increase a further 0.8 percentage point to 16% of GDP in 2019. Meanwhile, we expect government expenditures to remain flat at 20% of GDP.
As a result, we forecast the fiscal deficit to narrow to 4.8% of GDP this year and shrink to 4.0% of GDP in 2019, from 5.2% in 2017, the statement said. Along with the Inland Revenue Act, Sri Lanka will introduce a new Taxpayer Identification Number system. In conjunction with an automation of tax administrative efforts, such initiatives will help to raise tax compliance, broaden the current narrow tax base and improve the composition of the revenue base by raising the share of direct taxes. The government aims to raise the proportion of direct taxes to 40% of total revenue over what the government describes as the medium term from 20% currently.
We expect the cumulative revenue gains from the Inland Revenue Act and other revenue-enhancing measures, along with improved tax administration, to gradually reduce Sri Lankas debt burden to about 74% by 2021 from 79.3% of GDP in 2017. Still, government debt will remain well above the median of about 55% of GDP for B-rated sovereigns and will remain high for an economy of Sri Lankas size and income level.
A sustainable rebound in real GDP growth will be essential to help support future revenue gains. We expect real GDP to grow about 4.7% in 2018, up from 3.1% in 2017, which was one of the weakest years on record because bad weather hindered agricultural output.

New Zealand businesses keen to invest in local healthcare
Three New Zealand medical technology companies in Colombo last week as part of the New Zealand business delegation met with Deputy Minister, Faizal Cassim and Janaka Sugathadasa, Secretary of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine.

Non-display of pandals on Vesak only a request: Minister
The Buddha Sasana Ministry has not banned the display of Vesak pandals altogether but has only requested not to display them on Vesak Full Moon Poya Day, said Buddha Sasana and Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, yesterday.
He said Vesak pandals can be displayed from the day following Vesak Poya Day. He added that these are only requests and not orders. The requests are applicable to Poson Full Moon Poya Day and Poson pandals as well, he said.
Minister Perera added that he made the request based on the wishes of the Venerable Maha Sangha in order to direct more Buddhist devotees towards Prathipatti Pooja (practices) in temples.
The Minister made these observations during a ceremony to launch the commemorative issue of the First Day Cover and three stamps to mark the 2,562 Vesak Full Moon Poya Day, at the Buddha Sasana Ministry auditorium in Colombo.
He said he included the proposals made by the Venerable Maha Sangha in a report he tabled in Parliament during his Budget speech for 2018, in which the Ven Sanghas proposal not to display pandals on Vesak and Poson Full Moon Poya Days is envisaged.
He added that there had been instances when the display of Vesak pandals was banned through circulars. He pointed out that it had happened in 2002 when W. J. M. Lokubandara was the Buddha Sasana Minister.
Sri Lanka is the only country that postponed May Day due to Vesak Full Moon Poya Day, which falls a day before May Day, Minister Perera. He said based on the request of the Mahanayake Theras, the government decided to postpone May Day and rallies.
We are planning to formulate a three-year national policy for the development of Buddhist culture and temples in the country. This would be presented for Cabinet approval. We have categorized the temples in the country as A, B, C and D of which the latter two are those that have minimal facilities, Minister Perera said. We have planned to provide basic facilities to these temples within three years. A Cabinet paper in this regard will be presented soon.
He said an insurance policy would also be introduced to Buddhist monks for their education and to cover health expenses. He added that the Ministry would take measures to conduct meditation programmes in government institutions at district level.
Buddha Sasana Ministry Secretary Chandrapema Gamage also spoke on the occasion and Buddhist Affairs Commissioner General Nimal Kotawelagedara was present.

Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the amendment will be made as the 21st Amendment since the JVP is currently working on the 20th Amendment for the purpose of abolishing the Executive Presidency.
He said the existing Official Languages clause states (Chapter 4, Clause 18): The Official Language of Sri Lanka shall be Sinhala. Tamil shall also be an official language. English shall be the link language. This clause will be amended as Sinhala and Tamil shall be the official languages.
The minister said all parties are in agreement with the proposed amendment, adding that he decided to present it as a separate amendment since the new Constitution still stands as a distant reality. He said he made the same proposal to the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly as well.

Port City for sustainable living
The master plan of the Colombo Port City development project was presented to the Urban Development Authority at a special gathering of over 200 UDA officials and other industry specialists.
Since the projects physical construction on reclaimed land is now in progress, the Project Company requested for the current updated plan to be presented to the UDAs Planning Committee.
However, the UDA Chairman requested the Project Company to present the revised plan not only to the planning committee but all relevant officials including, town planners, architects and a number of other professionals who are involved in UDA planning, so that all parties would be on the same page in sanctioning the revised plan.
The Master Plan for Port City was done by SWECO, a Swedish-based planning consultant. Surbana Jurong was brought on board to prepare Development Control Regulations (DCR) for Port City.
The DCR provides a clear mechanism for the implementation of the Master Plan and directs both public and private sector developments with a set of development objectives, definitions and regulations. The regulations are essential to enforce the vision and objectives of the Master Plan in a transparent manner.
Surbana Jurong took the key essence of the previous Master Plan and refined it further through urban design guidelines. The soul of the project is sustainability and quality lifestyle.
The urban structure of Port City is designed for liveability, social security, tolerance and inclusion, thereby contributing to a higher quality of life.
It emphasises a well-balanced relationship between the public, semi-public and private realms, where different kinds of spaces give rise to a wide range of uses and activities.
The presentation was made by Executive Urban Planner Preethi Reddy of Surbana Jurong, one of Asias largest urban, industrial and infrastructure consulting firms based in Singapore; offering architecture, master planning, engineering and related services. Surbana Jurong is also drawing up the Megapolis plan and Trincomalee Master Plan.
Dr. Jagath Munasinghe, Chairman of the Urban Development Authority addressing the large gathering of officials, members of the architects and engineering associations, planning and land selection committees, said that it was time to read and understand what was happening elsewhere in the world and how international organisations plan their activities. He added that this knowledge would give UDA officials the exposure they needed on the new methods and modern ways of doing things.
The presentation was followed by a Q&A session at which a number of queries were fielded by the Project Company team, Preethi Reddy, the UDA Chairman, Nihal Fernando, Project Director for Port City Colombo appointed by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development and Nihal Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development.
President of the Institute of Architects Sri Lanka, D.H. Wijewardene who said the plans drawn up seemed easy to control once the systems were in place, asked if there would be a role in the project for local architects in terms of designing buildings in Port City. He said that in order for the development to benefit local experts (architects and engineers) there should be a regulatory process for knowledge transfer.
The UDA Chairman said that the UDA would be asking for qualified persons such as engineers, architects and town planners to participate in an approval process.
Answering for the Project Company, Managing Director of Port City Colombo Jiang Houliang said that 70 percent of their employees were locals. We have probably 15 percent Chinese and another 15 percent foreigners, but 70 percent of our colleagues are local and we work with a number of local architects and landscapers.
Project Director Nihal Fernando responding to a question on municipal council ordinance and if there would be a separate council to govern the Port City, said as per the tripartite agreement signed between the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and the Project Company, provision for the management of the International Financial City has been made via a joint venture company formed between the government and the Project Company, of which the government will own 49% and the Project Company 51%. This is in order to have a smooth administrative process that allows for ease of doing business, where developers would be provided with necessary facilities, he further explained.
Other questions asked included the soil requirement for the park land and green areas within the Port City; what impact it will have on the environment if the soil was being obtained locally.
Port Citys Environment team leader W.A.D.D. Wijesooriya, addressed the soil requirement, saying that the Project Company was already in discussions with other development projects which were removing soil to begin their projects. The project aims to use soil that is disposed of by these projects instead of digging for soil which would cause an environmental problem; therefore, it would be a win-win situation for all.
Nihal Fernando said that apart from that, the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation was in the process of doing research on the supply of a special compost and experiments are already being carried out. He says around 30 trees were being planted within the Port City with different soil samples and a system where they could mix the sand with compost and other materials to make a suitable planting ground was being looked at.

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said that if he had voted in favour of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM), he would have not remained in the government, even if the President requested him to.
He was responding to a query that was raised by a journalist at the Welagedara Stadium in Kurunegala, recently.
He further said, The Joint Opposition brought up the NCM and it was defeated. I would not have had any moral ground to remain in the government as a minister, if I had voted in favour of it; I would have resigned before receiving a response from President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The President and the Prime Minister will take the necessary decisions regarding this matter in the near future. I will raise my voice as well, if the need arises.Certain Sri Lanka Freedom Party ministers voted in favour of the NCM under the assumption that it would weaken the government, but the result was the opposite. The President and the Prime Minister will contribute for the development of the country. As Politicians, we should follow the proper procedures without taking the law into our own hands, Minister Ranatunga added.
He said the upcoming provincial election would be held at a proper time and that the government would be able to secure a win.

Public warned of team promoting stem cell therapy for autism
The Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians (SLCP) has come to know of the presence of an overseas medical team which is unethically, unscientifically and unlawfully promoting stem cell therapy for Neuro Developmental Disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder, in Sri Lanka, during the first week of April, SLCP Secretary Dr. P. W. Prasad Chathuranga said in a statement.
According to Dr. Chathuranga, Autism Spectrum Disorder contains social communication deficiencies and interaction impairments together with repetitive and restricted behaviour patterns. Improvement of this condition is assessed by the progressive acquisition of skills.
Dr. Chathuranga said in his statement that the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians wishes to inform the public that the only internationally accepted and scientifically proven therapy for autism is intensive intervention, based on communication and behavioural principles that will result in the improvement of the above clinical features.
Stem cell therapy for these conditions is only used at an experimental level at research laboratories and is currently not recommended to be used for any of the Neuro-Developmental Disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder. This is because positive outcomes from stem cell therapy have not been scientifically proven internationally. Also, it is not licensed to be used in Sri Lanka by the medicinal and health control authorities of Sri Lanka, he said.
Therefore, the public is warned not to become prey to these parties who extol the virtues of unproven therapies and to those who are likely to exploit them and their families, he added.
