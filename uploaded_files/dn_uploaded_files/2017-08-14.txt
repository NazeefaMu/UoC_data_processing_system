UNP will not bring no-confidence motion against Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe: Kiriella

The United National Party (UNP) does not intend to bring a no-confidence motion against Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Addressing the media at a function held at the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy yesterday to mark the 40th anniversary of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's political career he said the UNP Working Committee would discuss the matter at length at its meeting onAugust 17.
It is accepted that neither Members of Parliament or the ordinary people can intervene in a case that is heard in the court but everyone have the right to comment on the shortcomings of the administration of justice, he said.
He said that while the files on fraud and corruption conducted by the previous government had been handed over to the Attorney Generals Department more than a year ago, there was a planned programme to delay the court hearings regarding those cases.
The people of the country have given the jurisdiction to the courts and to the Attorney Generals Department through Parliament, and these people are what the reason for delaying the cases is, the Minister said.

Usain Bolt in quotes
LONDON, Saturday: Athletics superstar Usain Bolt's last championship race ended in dramatic fashion as he collapsed injured on the track anchoring Jamaica's 4x100 metres relay in the world championship final.
Here AFP Sports picks out five of his best quotes and five about him since he first light up the championship track at the 2008 Beijing Olympics:
- What they said about him -
There is no athlete that can compete with him... he's a global superstar.  Bolt's predecessor as an athletics superstar, Michael Johnson, whose 200 metres world record Bolt broke in the 2008 Olympic final.
You can compare us as sprinters, but the thing I am most proud of is that I did multiple events and I long-jumped.  Damned with faint and grudging praise by American legend Carl Lewis who also cast aspersions as to the Jamaican doping system to which Bolt retorted: Carl Lewis, I have no respect for him.
He is an icon. He is the best sprinter of all time.  Former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge, who was chided at the 2012 London Olympics for refusing to say he was a legend. Former Olympic yachtsman Rogge instead opted to nominate British yachting icon Ben Ainslie as his star of the Games.
Nobodys ever been faster than this guy! Ever! Of all the billions of people. - Then-US President Barack Obama reflects on the global nature of Bolt's stardom after meeting with him in Jamaica and then performing the lightning bolt pose with him.
Usain Bolt is now Jamaica's biggest ambassador. His personality, his ability to draw people to him (and) his showmanship have really given a boost to Brand Jamaica. - Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness neatly sums up Bolt's gift to the Caribbean island.
- Bolt on himself -
I am Lightning Bolt! I am not Flash Gordon or anybody. My name is Bolt, Lightning Bolt. - Bolt after smashing Michael Johnson's 200m world record in the 2008 Beijing Olympic final to complete his first of three individual Olympic sprint doubles.
Manners is the key thing. Say for instance when you're growing up you're walking down the street you've got to tell everybody good morning. Everybody. You can't pass one person. - Bolt displaying why he has charmed everyone along the way, never forgetting the strict but grounded way he was brought up by his parents, father Wellesley and mother Jennifer.
People come to see you run fast, but they also come to see a show, a performance... that's what I give them. - Bolt savvy as ever and why athletics will miss him so much: not just for his jaw-dropping brilliance but also his ability to entertain.
I'm now a legend, I'm also the greatest athlete to live. I am in the same category as Michael Johnson. - Bolt after winning the 2012 Olympic 200m title to complete the individual sprint double double.
If Queen Elizabeth knighthooded me and I would get the title Sir Usain Bolt. That would sound very nice. - Bolt on the possibility of joining Mo Farah as a knight of the Realm. Not wholly implausible as he has been athletics knight in shining armour for nearly a decade.

Ven. Dammananda commends Ravis decision
Asgiriya Chapter Chief Secretary Ven. Medagama Dammananda Thera yesterday commended the decision of former Foreign Ravi Karunanayake to step down even though he was not found guilty of any wrongdoing.
Dammananda Thera told MP Karunanayake that the decision he made was an example and added that an independent investigation would finally reveal who was right and who was wrong. Former Minister MP Karunanayake called on the Chief Prelate of the Asgiriya chapter at Kandy yesterday.
Dammananda Thera said it was important to allow the investigation into the bond issue to continue without any interference. The Thera said that if politicians were taken to task due to personal animosities and petty political agendas, it could not be condoned.
MP Karunanayake said he hoped his decision would pave way for a new political culture in the country. The former minister said he made the decision to ensure the unhindered progress of the unity government under the guidance of the President and the Prime Minister. He said the truth would be revealed in the near future.

We need someone to do a miracle  Hashan
Sri Lankas batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne whilst admitting that his team batted poorly yesterday was hopeful they would come up with a much better performance in the second innings today, the third day of the third Test against India at the Pallekele International Stadium.
Sri Lanka were shot out for a disappointing 135 in their first innings in reply to Indias score of 487 and after being forced to follow-on 352 runs in arrears were 19 for one at close in their second innings.
Its a disappointing day we batted so poorly I am sure the boys have realised where they went wrong and I am sure they will come up with a better plan tomorrow, said Tillakaratne at the end of the day. There are so many things that you can say when the team is not doing too well this is the time we must back these guys and give them the confidence.
At this stage Sri Lanka can do with a Hashan Tillakaratne in their side. The obdurate left-hander was a solid rock in the Lankan team of the past and if some of the present batsmen can bat as half as good as he was they could get somewhere towards avoiding an innings defeat.
We thought after the second innings of the second Test that we had laid a very good platform but we couldnt box on after that, we need to be patient with them, said Tillakaratne who played in 63 Tests and scored 11 Test hundreds for his country.
We won 3-0 against Australia with the same side but we are a little down in confidence just that we need one or two guys to put up their hands and do a miracle. I am sure the boys are very much confident and they want to do something.
Tillakaratne explained the lack of confidence came from their ability to play spin.
Even in the Zimbabwe series we couldnt cope with spin but in the second innings of the Zimbabwe Test and the second innings of the SSC Test against India the boys played really well but there was no continuity, said Tillakaratne.
We are playing against the no 1 side in the world and I am not seeking for any excuses. These boys are well experienced but they do a lot of mistakes while batting. If we can forget what has happened and look for the future, dig deep and bat long thats what we are planning to do. We always talk positive things in the dressing room but the only thing is that we cant execute our plans in the middle, he said.
Tillakaratne said that it was hurting to see the team fold up for such small totals and that they were working hard towards better performance.
The boys are doing their level best, their work ethics are brilliant its just that we need to be a little patient, Tillakaratne said. The players who are playing today are the best we have at the moment we must give them the fullest support and they will bring results. Everyone makes mistakes and what we are trying to do is to reduce the number of mistakes.
From here we cannot go down any further but only up. As the support staff we are giving every bit of backing to the players they are the ones who go out in the middle and perform. We are doing what we can to help them. We need to give them a little more time to get the desired results.

When the Going Gets Tough...
Recently, I saw a friend for the first time in a couple of years. We caught up over tea at her place and talked a lot. During our conversation, I realized I was telling her the same kind of stories about my life as I had in a totally different period, four years ago. I had lived in a different place then, wrote to a magazine and not the newspapers, but the issues I faced were more or less identical.
My problems tend to revolve around a lack of direction. Im passionate about my work, but writing and supporting the causes close to my heart doesnt feel enough. No matter what Im doing, the sense that I could be doing more, creeps back up.
In discussing this with some of my other friends, I learned Im not alone. They might not struggle with an abstract problem like mine, but, they have problems too; financial difficulties, finding the perfect home, or a great partner. Apparently, we all have challenges in our lives that we could not overcome.
Of course, as all positive thinking gurus say, theres no version of life in which we are not struggling with something daily. A productive, progressive life involves conquering the challenges the universe sends our way, and always being ready to embrace and learn from the next one.
It was Billy Ocean who immortalized the proverb, When the going gets tough, the tough get going through his song, in 1985. This may be true for some of us but, for others, hardship can be too much to overcome. When the going gets tough, we simply let our life fall apart. What is it exactly that separates those of us who thrive regardless of adversity and those of us who dont Is it genetics, luck, or pure willpower
Consider that Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison before he became the first democratically elected president in South Africa. Abraham Lincoln failed in business, had a nervous breakdown, and was defeated eight times in elections before becoming president. The opposite happened to Charles Manson. As a boy born to a teenage alcoholic and an absentee father, Mason found himself in trouble throughout his childhood, and grew up to be an American criminal.
Granted these examples are extreme, they yet demonstrate the different routes people may choose when facing major obstacles in their lives.
As Justin Harmon says in his article How to Endure and Overcome the Worst of Lifes Hardships, maybe your job doesnt bring in the kind of money you need to do anything more than survive, so when you suffer a setback, you really struggle. You not only struggle with the financial issues, but you also struggle with your emotions. Not having the amount of money you need to live without the fear that comes along with being broke, is hard indeed.
Harmon also says, you can be feeling great mentally and physically and able to perform at your best, but if you are struggling financially, theres a good chance youre causing more harm to your body with the stress, worry, and anger that comes along with it. This also plays a role in your personal life as well, doesnt it
When faced with difficulties like financial frustrations that affect ourselves and the personal relationships around us, Harmon suggests we are left with two options. One is change: we can change our circumstances to get out of our unwanted situation. It can be difficult to do this, especially when nothing but negativity surrounds us, but if we decide willingly to change your circumstances, we can. Its just a matter of knowing how.
The second option is to force ourselves to change. Its human nature to need to be constantly growing, evolving, and changing. So, if we were to learn the process a little better, we could really help ourselves when it comes to understanding how to endure and overcome the very worst of our lifes hardships. Knowing that there is a specific reason we are in a hardship will help us to learn how to get through it in a positive way vs. a negative one.
So whats the process for being able to endure and overcome, you might ask Well, as you probably already know, no one process will work for everyone, just as there is (usually) no quick-fix solution for the various hardships that come into our lives. There are, however, certain ways we can choose to perceive the realities we are hit with, he advises.
One thing we can do is change our perception. Perception is in the eye of the beholder, so if we are perceiving our life in a negative way, we are more than likely going to be dealing with all the emotions and thoughts that come from that perception. In other words, thinking negative thoughtsin any situationis going to bring out negative emotions. This can get us stuck in a tailspin, and we will find it very difficult to get past emotions such as anger, sadness, and low self-esteem, which go along with negative perceptions.
This, however, doesnt mean that we shouldnt want to feel these negative emotionsthey are a valuable part of progressing and moving forward in our life. The negative emotions are there so we can overcome them.
We can change our feelings of suffering when hardships hit into a new perspective on our life, which will allow us to endure when there is suffering, and overcome when its time by doing the following: Accepting. It is very important to accept what is, both in terms of the external reality and your internal reality, with thoughts, emotions, etc. Next is feeling. Allowing ourselves to feel, and also allowing ourselves to listen to what comes through while we are allowing our emotions to go through their natural process. The third is listening.When was the last time you truly sat down with no distractions, (cell phone,Facebook, e-mail, television, etc.) and listened Take a moment each day to look inside yourself and hear what your higher consciousness has to say. Dont think, dont wonderjust listen.
After youve taken the time to sit back, reflect, and gain clarity on your current circumstances, its time to start moving forward. You can do this by finding inspiration in your life Inspiration brings hope and desire, which also bring positivity. Once you have a positive attitude and desire inside you, its the perfect time to come up with an escape plan from your current situation. When you see the vision of where you want to be, you can start to fill in the details with a direction to start moving in.
Finally, if you really want to overcome your problems, not just endure, you need to start changing. Discover and pursue a life that brings progress and positive changes to your world. Surround yourself with people who care about you, want the best for you, and believe in you.
Remember, life isnt about waiting for the storm to pass, its learning to dance in the rain.
Next time it rains, come, lets dance.

Tips to achieving a positive mindset
1.Start the day with positive affirmation.
How you start the morning sets the tone for the rest of the day. Have you ever woken up late, panicked, and then felt like nothing good happened the rest of the day This is likely because you started out the day with a negative emotion. Instead of letting this dominate you, start your day with positive affirmations. Talk to yourself in the mirror, even if you feel silly, with statements like, Today will be a good day or Im going to be awesome today. Youll be amazed how much your day improves.
2. Focus on the good things, however small.
Almost invariably, youre going to encounter obstacles throughout the daytheres no such thing as a perfect day. When you encounter such a challenge, focus on the benefits, no matter how slight or unimportant they seem.
3.Find humor in bad situations.
Allow yourself to experience humour in even the darkest or most trying situations. Remind yourself that this situation will probably make for a good story later and try to crack a joke about it.
4.Turn failures into lessons.
You arent perfect. Youre going to make mistakes and experience failure in multiple contexts, at multiple jobs and with multiple people. Instead of focusing on how you failed, think about what youre going to do next time.
5. Transform negative self-talk into positive self-talk.
For example, let, Im so bad at this become Once I get more practice, Ill be way better at this. I shouldnt have tried should become That didnt work out as plannedmaybe next time.
6.Focus on the present.
Most sources of negativity stem from a memory of a recent event or the exaggerated imagination of a potential future event. Stay in the present moment.

A World XI T20 match to raise funds for Cricket Aid
Sri Lanka Cricket announced yesterday that they have plans to play a T20 match between a World XI and a Sri Lanka XI comprising present and past cricketers at the R Premadasa Stadium on September 8 to raise funds for its Cricket Aid program.
This event has been organised in order to support the disaster affected children. It is the brainchild of SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala who initiated it about two months ago, said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva at a press conference held at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday to launch the event.
The process started prior to the CEOs Board meeting of the ICC where we briefed the member countries of the event in order to procure support from them. It was very encouraging to note that all the CEOs agreed to support this noble cause, he said.
Subsequently after this event was sanctioned by the ICC we wrote to all the member countries and we asked them whether their players could be released to support this cause.
We have received names of players both past and present from 6-7 countries including India but we cannot release the names until we have picked the 13 players from both sides. The names will be released during the course of the week, De Silva said.
Among the local stars that are likely to play are Tillakaratne Dilshan and Sanath Jayasuriya.
We wrote to Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene as well. Kumar has indicated that he is unavailable because of his county commitments. Mahela has a prior commitment which he has already confirmed but he has also given us an indication that he might try to adjust and participate but so far we have not got a confirmation, said de Silva.
De Silva also revealed that each of the players participating in the charity match would be paid although he didnt reveal the figures.
As national cricketers they are an asset to any country and they have commitments. We have to pay them for participating according to their levels.
Cricket Aid is our charity organisation and all the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) projects have been carried through the Cricket Aid which was established in 2004 and subsequently was revamped after the newly elected committee took over 1 years ago, said De Silva.
All the funds which would be raised from this event will be channelled through Cricket Aid in order to support not only the disaster affected children but other areas affected by floods and droughts in the recent past. We have also been supporting a lot of our former cricketers and commentators who are in a financially crisis. This is a CSR project which we intend taking forward, he said.
De Silva said that SLC were working on a budget of around Rs. 35-40 million to host the match which will be telecast live worldwide by Sony.

Alert on potential tsunami threat bares lapses in early warning mechanism
A 6.4 magnitude undersea earthquake near Southern Sumatra, Indonesia triggered the local Meteorology and Disaster Management authorities to issue an alert on potential tsunami threat last morning.
The DMC followed it up with another alert in 55 minutes declaring all coastal areas in Sri Lanka safe and that there was no Tsunami threat. The first message issued at 10.15 a.m .read, all coastal communities need to be alert as a 6.5 magnitude earthquake occurred in Sumatra. Potential Tsunami exists.
The second alert issued at 11.10 a.m. read, No Tsunami threat to Sri Lanka. The coastal areas in Sri Lanka are declared as safe. Public further informed that the earthquake alert will be cancelled.
Several lapses in the countrys communication and early warning mechanism came to light in the way these alerts were given out and received.
The Daily News spoke to DMC Media Spokesman Pradeep Kodippili seeking a clarification as to why they revoked an earthquake alert. He argued what was initially issued was an earth quake alert and not a tsunami alert. He also stressed that it was not a warning but an alert issued for public awareness.
Then the Daily News asked as to why the first message took about one and half hours since the earth quake occurred. (The origin time of the earth quake was 8.38am in Sri Lankan time. The Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre had issued three bulletins by 9.40 am in Sri Lankan time.)
We issued the alert no sooner the Met Department informed us. We follow their instructions. The Met Department is the authority responsible in issuing early warnings, replied Kodippili.
Kodippili further said the early warning message was communicated to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, Media and fisheries harbours as soon as the DMC was informed by the Met Department. All 77 tsunami towers were ready to be used, but we did not activate the sirens in them as there was no evacuation order. We knew the risk was low. We should not agitate the people unnecessarily, he added.
The Daily News also spoke to the duty officer at the Met Department and posed the question on the time gap in early warning communication. As the magnitude of earthquake was below 6.5 and depth was 40 km, we knew the tsunami risk was low. We usually follow Early Warning Centres of India, Australia and Indonesia. The Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre throughout the period said that there was no Tsunami threat. However, the Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre in its second bulletin issued at 9.04 am in Sri Lankan time stated that there is a potential tsunami threat to countries in the Indian Ocean. We informed this to the DMC, but did not immediately inform the public as the people could panic. If we were sure of the threat, we would have communicated it to all relevant bodies within 10 minutes, the officer explained.
Neither the Met Departments official website nor its twitter account was updated about the yesterdays early warning alert. The Met Departments last web announcement related to Tsunami warning was on June 7 and its last weather-related post in the Official Twitter account was on April 17.
Asked as to why these online platforms were not updated, the duty officer commented, Today is a Sunday. Only two of us are at work. We have to respond to the calls of three to four phones. At the same time we have to search for international updates time to time and analyze them. It is with difficulty we find time to update the website.

SL needs to become attractive for global outsourcing services
Professor of Economics Gamini Gunawardane said that the countrys services sector is the largest contributor to the Sri Lankan economy; 61.7 percent of the GDP is attributable to services and this sector employs 45 percent of labour compared to 26.5 percent in the industry sector and 28.5 in the agriculture sector.
A lecturer at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Prof. Gunawardane made these remarks to a group of intellectuals at a seminar in Colombo to educate economists on the importance of developing the Sri Lankan service sector.
He said Sri Lanka needs to become an attractive country for global outsourcing services for the business as well as tourism sectors and it is essential to improve tourism, travel, hotels and other hospitality services, communications and information systems.
Referring to the book, 'Service Management: Concepts, Principles and Applications for Sri Lanka', written by him focusing on the countrys service sector, Prof Gunawardane said it covers most important service management concepts and principles practised in Sri Lanka and many other Asian countries.
The book will be launched on August 25 at 5.30 pm at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.
Colombo University Vice Chancellor Professor Lakshman Dissanayake will be the chief guest while Dr. Sunil Jayantha Navaratne, Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare will make the keynote speech. Prof. Gunawardane mentioned that the government has emphasized the need to improve public services for the benefit of the citizen and also highlighted the need to improve service management.
Quoting recent research, Prof Gunawardanae said the largest subsectors within the service sector in a country are wholesale and retail trade, transportation, public services, health services, educational services and tourism and hospitality services.
He also said that the education, training and research in service management in our country should be improved to a greater extent and said his book is the first truly international comparative study on service management.
Prof. Gunawardane said Sri Lanka is seeking to become a partner with foreign investors and businesses to expand the sector globally.
Such firms need highly efficient financial, communication, information technology and other business services, he said
A product of Ananda College, Colombo and St. Thomas College (Matara), Prof. Gunawardane completed his university education at the University of Ceylon receiving a BSc (First Class) degree and at the Vidyodaya University receiving an MBA (Distinction Pass).
He was also graduated from University of Chicago, USA and received his MBA and PhD specializing in Operations Research and Operations Management. Prof. Gunawardane is also recognized as an international scholar in service management.
He has over 25 publications in international peer-reviewed scholarly journals, many of which have been cited by other scholars in their work.

Abandoned UFO village
These creepy images show an abandoned UFO village where wacky spaceship-style homes have been left to rot and grow mouldy.
The yellow and green flying-saucer homes are elevated above ground, with all the amenities of a regular home designed in a circular pod.
Once filled with the hustle and bustle of family life and tourists on holiday , the homes, officially knows as Futuro houses, grew incredibly popular in the 1960s.
Now, images from the village in the Wanli district of Taiwan show crumbling exteriors, cracked windows and mouldy carpets after decades of decay.
While considered the perfect living space by many, the spaceship homes designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen were thought to be an horrendous eye sore by others.
The pods were originally designed as ski chalets, made from lightweight material so they could be transported between various locations.
Resembling something from a sci-fi film, doors and windows of the alternative properties are based on the design of an aircraft and the indoor living spaces are made up of a kitchen, bedroom and bathroom.
But as oil prices soared, the once-fashionable homes and holiday cabins became unaffordable and were left to crumble and rot to the ground.
Along with the Futuro homes, Matti Suuronen also designed a series of Venturo pre-fab houses.
While Suuronen is best known for his futuristic homes, he has also designed petrol stations, kiosks, detached and terraced homes as well as public buildings.

[APPRECIATIONS - (14-08-2017)]
Chandrakala Ratnayake
She was a strong-willed woman
Three months ago, on May 12, at around 1.05 pm, my beloved mother departed this world after fighting an ailment that persisted for three months. Even after three months of her passing, her abrupt leave-taking from life continues to be an unacceptable, indescribable, atypical feeling in my life. The only consolation of my mothers unanticipated demise that I bear in my heart is the fact that the duration of her anguish was minimal.
Over the last three months of ammis life, the extent of emotional suffering my father Ananda Ratnayake and I underwent, along with my mothers closest relatives, cannot be woven into mere words. Likewise, it was even the more startling to witness such a strong-willed woman, who was once robust, courageous and good-looking, bearing void of complaint, all the complications involved with an ailment of the nature. Yet, what amazed me the most was the fact that she did not give up until her very last breath, in the Kurunegala hospitals coronary care unit. That was after undergoing treatment in the hospitals oncology unit for two months. The last two beings her deteriorating eyes perceived from her deathbed merely before her very last breath, were that of mine; her only child and that of her much-adored brother Harischandra. Life breaks everyone, but some people heal stronger in the breaks, they say and my mother was one of those who healed stronger in the breaks.
My mother lived a complete and dynamic life. Amongst the seven siblings of the Senanayake family from Kurunegala, she was the fourth. Having obtained her education from Maliyadeva Girls College in Kurunegala, she joined the Hayleys Group back in the 1960s, where she served for nine years. While in school and in later years, she played basketball under the guidance of All-India Basketball Coach P. Chelladurai, and also represented St. Annes College, Kurunegala in a trainee camp held in St. Anthonys College Courts in Katugastota back in the 1960s. After tying the knot with my father in 1973, she pursued a career at Marhaba Travels in Sharjah, U.A.E., where she served for several years before returning to Sri Lanka. Later in her life, she lived with me in California, U.S.A. and in Sri Lanka until her passing.
Ammi was divergent in every possible way from her siblings and all others in her family circle and friends. When her three sisters who served as teachers wore sarees, ammi chose mini-skirts and slacks over the traditional Sri Lankan attire. She always pursued for the finest, even in trivial entities. Having been the detailed, oriented person she was, everything had to be well-defined and clear-cut to earn her acceptance, or else, entities were rejected unswervingly. She dressed uniquely and matching jewellery was a key. All her jewellery sets, handbags and shoes that matched her elegant attire, now deposited in her almirah brings back memories of her unique attendances and unforgettable appearances during her life and times. She always kept the ball rolling and at functions, she illuminated the table with her chuckle and adorable smile.
She loved me dearly, regardless of the mother-daughter disagreements in various matters; a common domestic scenario. Even all the lovely verses in the entire universe knitted into a single tapestry shall still not explain the boundless feeling I hold in my chest, with every passing day of her absenteeism. Ammi, I love you and I always will!

Peter Casie Chetty
A loveable rogue
It is with sadness that I report the passing away of Peter Casie Chetty aka Peter Christie. He had not answered his phone for a couple of days when his sister Rachel had rung him. So she had a friend check up on him and found that Peter had passed away in his sleep. Peter rang me on Wednesday, this week at about 11:30 am Melbourne time, which came as a surprise as it was 3:30 am in Manchester, UK. His death comes as quite a shock to me though I am grateful he passed away in his sleep and his soul is resting peacefully.
We had a long chat and he told me that recently he had been having a number of falls due to his neuropathy in his feet due to Diabetes. He was also labouring in his speech and rang me to apologise for the recent spate of emails on the subject of 'Blazer fabric.'
Peter was a loveable rogue who expressed his views without fear or fervour in a colourful language unbecoming of a gentleman. But that was Peter. Love him or hate him for his caustic views on the Church, religion and the pretentious people in our society, he always spoke his mind.
Some of us were offended by his commentary on various subjects and elected to reject his emails. But I know that deep within his soul was a kind and generous person; but a troubled man whose character had been moulded by his life experiences.
The voice of the Wesleyite alumni community is finally silent. He will be missed. His body will be cremated in the UK and his ashes will be interred in Sri Lanka.
May the road rise up to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine warm upon your face,
The rain fall soft upon your fields.
And until we meet again,
May God hold you in the palm of his hand.
Rest peacefully my dear friend.
Ora et Labora

Prof. Piyadasa Ranasinghe
He provided an exemplary service
Professor Piyadasa Ranasinghe, who served as a Senior Professor in the Department of Library and Information Science at the University of Kelaniya, passed away on August 4, 2016 and this small comment is given in memory of his enormous academic and personal contribution to society. The demise of this learnt gentleman is a great loss for the country, especially for the Library and Information Science community of Sri Lanka. His contribution to society can be illustrated in many ways.
On October 10, 1949, he was born in Tabbowa, Puttalam, a typical village. There, he grew up and learnt not only his primary education, but eco-friendly living as well. Once he said that he assigned particular names for the trees and animals living in the suburban jungles whenever he used to visit. This particular behaviour must have supported Professor Ranasinghe to have a balanced education and growth during his life. Behaviour and habitation in such type of a natural environment must have nourished his competence in languages like Sinhala, English, Pali and Sanskrit. He received his primary education at Tambapanni Vidyalaya, Tabbowa, in 1953 and his secondary education at Delgoda Kalyana Pradeepa Pirivena in 1965. In 1967, he entered Vidyalankara University and earned a BA honours degree in Sinhala and received his Master's Degree in Library and Information Science at the University of New South Wales, Australia in 1994.
He then join as an Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Sinhala at the University of Kelaniya in 1971. Later, he served as an assistant editor at the office of Sinhala Dictionary, where he associated with people like Prof. D.E. Hettiarachchi. Later, him joining the university library service as an Assistant Librarian at Sri Jayawardenepura University in 1979, was a milestone in his life.
He made an exemplary contribution in serving as an acting Librarian at the University of Kelaniya, the founder Librarian at the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka, Head of the Department of Library and Information Science and its Professor, Senior Professor, former President of Sri Lanka Library Association, ex-Director of Yakkala Ayurveda Institute attached to University of Kelaniya and founder director of Palm Leaf Manuscript Study and Research Library at the University of Kelaniya. Prof. Piyadasa Ranasinghe has authored several comprehensive books on library and information science and they are used as masterpieces of the subject by many students as well as scholars. We appreciate his family by remembering and honouring their very closest relative, erudite scholar, teacher for a many like us, beloved brother and sincere colleague of all.
May he attain Nibbana!

D.I.G. Lalith Gunasekera
A pragmatic officer
I first met Lalith Gunasekera in 1965 when I was serving at the Badulla Police Headquarters as a young Sub-Inspector just passed out from the Police College at Kalutara. He was two batches senior to me enlisted in 1963, albeit we both were Probationary Sub-Inspectors attached to the Crime Branch. This was the beginning of our friendship. We developed a very close friendship which lasted up to the time of his passing away on the night of August 5, after a brief illness.
In 1967, I succeeded him at the Lunugala Police station as the Officer-in-charge and he was transferred to the Wellawaya Police Station which was graded higher than Lunugala. He got married to Dayanthie in 1969 whilst serving at Wellawaya and I was his best man. He always professed that his best man was not confined to the wedding photograph as that of many people. I was with him during his bad and the good times and was not a fair-weather friend.
Having served as the officer-in-charge of several police stations, he was promoted to the rank of A.S.P. in 1983, S.P. in 1989, Senior S.P. in 1994, and D.I.G. in 2002. During his tenure of office as Director at the Police College in Kalutara, he extended his fullest cooperation to me to train a batch of Sub-Inspectors and Police Constables directly recruited to the National Intelligence Bureau(NIB) presently known as the State Intelligence Service. I was the Director of the NIB, functioning under Secretary/Ministry of Defence.
He was a strict disciplinarian best-suited for the post of Director at the Police College responsible for the training and moulding recruits for all ranks before they are passed out to maintain law and order in the country. He was also the Chief Lecturer at the Police College before he was appointed as the Director. It was a charming and winsome sight to see him on horseback, taking the salute at the Aluwihare Parade ground at the Police College.
He always maintained humane qualities like simplicity and humility and was constantly and consistently pragmatic and practical in his approach to the problems he faced with during his Police career. He was willing to seek out and accept solutions whenever they could be found, even from his subordinates. He could think clearly, logically and incisively.
He was one of the polished, persuasive and hard-working police officers whose methodical and meticulous preparation of the work or task entrusted to him, was an exercise in unbounded patience, total dedication and maximum assistance to people, his subordinates and friends. In fact, he discharged his duties and responsibilities with unsurpassed distinction and unsullied honour.
He was, by any standard, an exceptional Police Officer. An attribute he realised in ample measure throughout his career was a sense of absolute commitment to any task he was entrusted with. He was content with nothing less than perfection and devoted himself in his own quiet and unobtrusive way to attain that standard.
His time was spent generously at the disposal of any friend who stood in need of his help or support. This was one constant characteristic which was shown through the whole of his career in the Police and in his personal life. The courage of his conviction and the firm refusal to compromise on what he believed in, was an area in which Lalith showed unremitting rigour.
In the year 2000, he was selected for an assignment to serve in East Timor for the United Nations peacekeeping force as Head of Academics for the East Timor Lorosae Police Training College. He significantly contributed to the United Nations Transitional Administrations mandate in East Timor.
Police Commissioner in East Timor commended his Law Enforcement Management skills and his efforts produced the finest and most disciplined officers in East Timor.
Lalith always professed with great pride that ours is among the noblest professions. It had always been regarded with great respect and even reverence. But, we have to note with sadness that this one-time revered image of the Police Force is today much tarnished with the arrests of Police officers, including Senior D.I.G. , D.I.G.G. , Senior Officers, for grave crimes.
It must therefore, be the responsibility of the I.G.P. and all Senior Officers to purify the image of the Police Force of whatever blemishes that have tarnished the one-time glorious image.
He liked spending his weekends and holidays whenever he could, joining our family and our close friends on trips to Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Nuwara Eliya, Wakarai and Beruwela. We enjoyed his company and interesting stories during his days as the OIC of Police Stations. During one of our visits to Nuwara Eliya, he held the floor from the time we left Colombo, relating stories up until we reached NuwaraEliya. One of our friends asked me whether Lalith had swallowed a tape-recorder and come.
My two sons Suren and Sajith are great admirers of Lalith and they treated him like our own family member. Sajith, who was a State Counsel at the Attorney Generals Department, wrote an essay on Lalith when he was in Grade 5, as he was a legend to him. Laliths wife Danyathie always calls me the twin brother of Lalith; our two families maintained a very close relationship and my wife Kamani treats Dayanthis as her own sister. The Ceremonial Police Funeral accorded to Rtd. D.I.G. Lalith Gunasekera by the Police Force with the presence of the I.G.P. Pujith Jayasundara, was a fitting tribute to the honourable Police Officer who brought so much credit and honour to the Police Force. I, with several serving and retired Senior Police Officers, went up to the IGP after the funeral and expressed our gratitude and thanked him for the inclusion of a firing party and the full Police band for the ceremony.
The large gathering at Borella cemetery on August 9 was a clear testimony of the respect given to late D.I.G. Lalith Gunasekera by all Police officers both serving and retired, Senior Government Officials, his friends and relations.
In the midst of lifes challenges and upheavals, Laliths close friendship will ever remain for me and my family, a shining memory.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

Former D.I.G., C.I.D. andDirector, National Intelligence Bureau
Commander Suraj Ahamed
A committed man
The late Commander Suraj Ahamed (Retd. SLN), endearingly known as 'Bunny' amongst family and friends, left us all grieving on August 16, last year. A much-loved, adored and admired personality, he was the fifth in a family of seven siblings (a sister died very young), but was the first to go to that land beyond. This Maristonian was the holder of a B.Sc degree from the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya Campus. He and my spouse Anver, who did a Chemistry honours degree, passed-out together in the same year.
Immediately after graduation, he had a short spell teaching at my old school Ave Maria Convent, Negombo. The handsome guy that he was, he was quite a 'heart-throb' and had many silent admirers. He subsequently joined the Sri Lanka Navy as a Commissioned Officer and was sent to Valsura, India, for intensive training in Electrical Engineering.
The Naval Headquarters in Dockyard, Trincomalee, where his wife Rehanie and he moved to after marriage, had an excellent ambiance and was a popular holiday home for us. Bunny and Rehanie's warm hospitality was legendary and we always had an open invitation to their beautiful bungalow overlooking the ocean.
Many still recall the wonderful times they had. He retired prematurely to take a posting at the American Naval Base in Midway Islands. On his return to the island, the Navy recalled him to revamp and strengthen the Artificer Training course, which bears testimony to his dedication and commitment.
Bunny was a voracious reader, a lover of music and had a good singing voice. He was passionate about gardening and kept an immaculate lawn. Even during his illness, he derived a lot of joy spending hours tending to his plants. As kids, the three youngest siblings; he, Ronnie and myself, got on famously and were up to all kinds of mischief.
Although the Doctors gave him only six months, for five long years he fought a tough battle with courage and determination. His dedicated wife Rehanie stood beside him like a rock, nursing him and showering a lot of love. His illness drew me very close to him.
Whenever he visited the doctor, he would always keep me updated, giving even the minutest detail, and discussing the pros and cons of the course of treatment.
Together, the family fought a trying battle and finally had to let go with wrenching hearts. When he finally breathed his last, his older brothers Aniff and Selwyn were by his side, praying and easing his departure.
He leaves his beloved wife Rehanie, loving sons Nirfaan and Imraan, daughters-in-law Krisha and Sabeena and an adorable grand daughter, Alina.

Beyond the fast track
Her name is synonymous in the Sri Lankan track and field history. She was the first Sri Lankan woman athlete to clinch an Asian Games gold medal. Though she bid adieu to her athletic career in 2007, she still holds five international records to her name: two South Asian Games records, two Asian Championship records and one Asian Games record. Eranda Siriwardene, Damayanthi Dharshas husband, unfurls his thoughts on life off the tracks with the Sprint Queen.
The athlete
Damayanthi used to practice for two and a half hours in the morning and two and a half hours in the afternoon during week days. She also had a practice session on Saturday morning which involved weight lifting and speed practice. They also got a one and a half month training program to attend out of Colombo at the beginning of the year. She could not afford to miss any of these sessions because that would affect her career greatly as she is most likely to lose speed. Meeting all these requirements was very demanding and shows that life of an athlete is not rosy. Many sweat and tears are shed to get to the top of the ladder.
Damayanthi has quite a strong mindset. Her determination cannot be wavered easily. Her goal was to win rather than defeat another runner. Victory was what she focused on solely rather than trying to find out who her opponents are and working towards defeating any one of them in perticular.
The wife and mother
We got married in 2003 and since she was still in the field Damayanthi was mostly focused on her athletic career. She did perform the role of a wife well with the little time she could spare. However after calling it quits she had more time to focus on her role as a wife and mother. She is currently employed at MAS Holdings but still balances her career and family life well. Our first child, Esandi, was born in 2007. She is nine years now and is a student of Ladies College, Colombo. Our second child, Disandu, was born in 2010. Our youngest, Vinuth, was born in 2015. Damayanthis mother stays with us and helps out.
I manage my own business. Therefore my working hours are quite flexible. We manage our duties as parents between us without any hassle. I used to drop Esandi to school for five continuous years because we both left the house at around the same time. Now she travels by a school van. Since Damayanthi works all five days of the week she has reserved the weekends for cleaning and engaging in household chores.
First meeting
I hail from Badulla and I schooled at Meegaha Kivula Junior School and Central College, Badulla. After sitting for my G C E Advanced Level examinations from the commerce stream I came to Colombo to stay with my sister. She was married to the 400 meter record holder Harijan Ratnayaka. He used to train and coach at the Torrington Grounds and we joined him there most of the time. This paved way for my meeting with Damayanthi.
Though I did not pursue a career in sports, I was a good sportsman during my school days. Volleyball was my forte. I have also taken part in the all island 200m running events. As we started chatting we both realized that our ideas were similar. We had a relationship for about two years which ended in marriage on June 28, 2003.
The marriage function
Damayanthis parents were aware of our relationship. They discussed with my party and finally set a date for the wedding. Our wedding was not a grand occasion especially because we were short of time to plan anything elaborate. Damayanthi had to attend the Asian Championship Meet for which she won a gold medal later. We had a small function with our families at our house in Battaramulla. That was the first event we had in the house after the house warming ceremony.
Calling it a day
I believe that Damayanthi has had a fruitful sports career. Though she has not won an Olympic medal she has reached fourth place at the Commonwealth Games and she is the only one Sri Lankan to win three gold medals in the Asian Games. She has seven international records to her name and all of them are unbroken. She has won 15 SAARC gold medals. She is content with those achievements. She retired after 16 years in the track and field. There was a period that Damayanthi missed her career in the track and field soon after retirement. She would have made a good coach or instructor. She could have rendered her assistance to the field in many ways if she had been given the chance. They recently established the Sri Lanka Olympian Association in which Sriyani Kulawansha is the president. Damayanthi is the secretary. Anurudda Rathnayake is the treasurer while Sugath Thilakarathne is the vice president. Susanthika Jayasinghe is the patron. It also includes four committee members: Julian Bolling, Ruwini Abeymanna, Harijan Rathnayaka and Mahesh Perera.
Pros
Damayathi does not get overexcited in matters. She knows how to keep her cool and ponder over a matter before taking a decision. She also has a lot of determination. She would give her maximum to attain her goal. She is not lethargic by nature.
Cons
I am not indicating that Damayanthi is a perfect person sans weaknesses, but she has always been an example to other people. The only weakness that I can think of is that she is a bit idle to study when an examination draws near. As a Senior HR Executive she has to sit for exams which are connected with her work to reach the next grade. She needs to complete her degree as well but she is not bothered much about it.
Happiest moments in life
Damayanthi values the gold medals she won at the Asian Games in 1998. She was the first Sri Lankan female athlete to win a gold medal. She also broke the Asian world record during this event.On a more personal note one of the happiest days in our life is when our first child was born. Esandi was born at the Joseph Fraser Memorial Hospital, Colombo, on December 22, 2007. Though we did not particularly vie for a daughter we both had predicted that our first child will be a daughter.
Foodwise
Damayanthi had to eat according to a special diet when she was still engaged in track and field. She was required to eat beef which she did not enjoy at all. She gave up consuming beef soon after retiring. Her favourite food is fish eggs curry. Its one of our family favourites now.
Free time
We hardly have any free time as we are always engaged in something during the week days. However we have developed a habit if going out for a meal during the weekend as it is a refreshing change from our daily lifestyle. If there is a long weekend around the corner we venture out of Colombo. We visit different locations. Kandy is a place we visit often. We love to go to Nuwara Eliya but since the kids are still very young it is a bit difficult to travel far. Our recent trip was to Anuradhapura. We would go for a holiday abroad if the kids are up to it. We both have gone to a number of foreign countries before having children. We love going to Italy with the kids since Damayanthis sister lives there.
One little known fact
Since Damayanthi could not miss out on any of her practice sessions we could not attend most of our friends functions. So the initial stages of our life have been full of sacrifices. We had to give the gatherings a miss especially if they clashed with the times when Damayanthis training sessions were on. We could not attend events which demanded us to go outstation in particular because that means she has to sacrifice one day of training.

Billion rupee startup PAYable draws  in major investment
Building on the success of its growing network of merchants and customers, Sri Lankas fast-growing startup, PAYable, announced the successful completion of a round of funding that will set the pace for a new wave of credit and debit card usage and e-commerce-led growth in the Sri Lankan economy.
The revolutionary PAYable cashless mobile payments platform has gained the trust and support of a diverse cross-section of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and entrepreneurs and has become the leading choice for major banks.
PAYable is a free mobile app paired with a free Bluetooth card reader that enables merchants to accept credit and debit card payments from their customers. A highly reliable, durable and compact card reader, PAYable can be paired with any Android or iOS smart phone or tablet to effectively convert it into a secure, flexible and simple to use mobile point-of-sale (POS) solution.
Built on the inspirational and visionary leadership of Sujith Subasinghe, PAYables late Co-Founder and CEO together with Co-Founder and incoming CEO, Yohan Wijesiriwardane, the platform is now enjoying rapid growth across Sri Lanka.
We are committed to driving a revolution in cashless payments. We believe that the future includes a balance between older methods of payment such as cash and cheques, rapidly evolving forms of well-accepted methods such as cards, and emerging methods comprising wallets and other modes of peer-to-peer online (card-less) payments. Our technology and business strategy encompasses thoughtful considerations of all these factors, as well as what top fintechs are doing to digitally transform banking and payments, Wijesiriwardane said.
PAYable which launched its first devices in June 2016 has since grown the number of Sri Lankan merchants accepting card payments by 25% and has directly facilitated transactions in excess of Rs. 750 million.
This rapid growth was driven by PAYables growing acceptance as the partner of choice by leading banks with others lined up in various stages of testing. The technical strength of PAYables platform has resulted in flawless performance when validated by the banks.
Having partnered with three of Sri Lankas largest private sector commercial banks and backed by substantial investments from Clarkeview Investments Limited, PAYable is now implementing a fully market-tested plan to expand its network of merchants to 20,000 by the end of 2018 and 100,000 by 2020.
PAYable was incubated out of Ceylon Business Appliances Ltd (CBA), a 47-year old office technology company. CBAs trusted relationships with banks and expertise in banking systems helped build the foundation of PAYables relationships with banks.
PAYable uses the industrys best-in-class security protocols, such as the PCI DSS Guidelines, a global security standard developed by VISA, MasterCard, and other major card providers.
It operates within a secure network that is comprehensively monitored and pressure-tested to maintain the highest standards of security for transaction and cardholder data protection.

Budget 2018 on performance basis
As Budget 2018 will be prepared on the performance basis, all the proposals by the line ministries, provincial ministries and the heads of departments should clearly indicate the details of the output of such projects accompanied with the Key Performance Indicators (KPI), informs the Secretary to Treasury and Secretary to Ministry of Finance and Mass Media Dr. R.H.S Samaratunga.
Detailing out the process of the preparation of Performance budget from next year, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said that priority would be given to ongoing and foreign funded projects where KPI based measurable outcomes are identified for each project.
Further, the Minister said that capital expenditure projects that have been earmarked for implementation by the National Planning Dept for each ministry would also be given priority provided the plans for such projects carry KPIs.
The medium term macro-fiscal framework for 2018-2020 approved by the Cabinet of Ministers for the Performance based budget preparation from the year 2018 include the rationalization of recurrent expenditure and prioritisation of capital expenditure while enhancing the government revenue mobilisation and public investment and reducing the budget deficit and the outstanding government debt.
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the government expects such improvements in the performance of the public finance management that would augur well the realization of medium  term economic growth of around 6 to 7 percent.
In 2018, major macroeconomic assumptions include, real GDP growth of 6 percent, inflation to stabilize at 5 percent level, and overall budget deficit contained at 4.3 percent of GDP.
Formulation of Performance Based Budget (PBB) from 2018 has been built on the experience of implementing the zero-based budgeting approach adopted in the preceding years. Therefore, identifying the scope of the projects, defining the intended measurable outcomes and assessing the socio-economic impact on the projects, comprise the major elements of the performance based budget preparations approach.
These days feasibility assessments of the projects forwarded by various ministries are being conducted at the finance ministry with the participation of the secretaries of the respective ministries and the secretary to Treasury and Secretary to Finance Ministry Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga requested all the line Ministry Secretaries and the Provincial Secretaries and the Head of Departments and the Heads of State Own Enterprises to submit their proposal without further delay.

Business Chamber of Commerce eager  to capitalize on GSP+
The Business Chamber of Commerce (BCC), the Colombo North based TPO (trade promotion organization), fully supports the fresh endeavour made by the government to promote the growth and diversification of the countrys exports.
A significant boost to such endeavour follows the restoration of GSP+ which will certainly help increase export revenue by at least US$ 800 million annually. This is a conservative estimate since exports of garments alone are expected to generate US$ 500 million.
We could just visualise how much this nation lost in terms of foreign exchange earnings as a result of not having the GSP+ advantage since 2010, the Chamber says.
The Chamber believes that GSP+ will not only boost our exports, but will also make a substantial contribution to the Gross National Product.
The EU nations like the UK, France and Germany form the core component of the overall export market for Sri Lanka.
Besides this, the entirety of the EU is a means of Sri Lanka achieving deeper integration with affluent markets which is a vital element of external trade, besides foreign investment.
With regard to direct foreign investment, Sri Lanka is quite a way behind targets and the withdrawal of GSP+ and the perception of the ease with which business could be conducted in this country remains major constraints.
However, the current administration, despite political hiccups, did conduct strenuous campaign to regain GSP+. This is a commendable achievement.
The Business Chamber of Commerce is gearing itself to support the overall export endeavour now being made by improving our services to exporters.
BCCs main services to the export community are as follows:
Registration of Certificates of Origin (COs), commercial invoices, agency agreements, quality certificates, phytosanitary certificates and certification of exports by the Atomic Energy Authority. Most of these certificates are forwarded to the Chamber by the exporters for counter registration and many of them are issued by either government agencies or private sector certifying institutions.
Whilst the BCC is the only Chamber of Commerce in North Colombo engaged in this service, there are six other Chambers in the city which are also officially entitled to register these documents.
However, it is important to state two special features that highlight BCC's certification scheme: the first is designed to assist exporters by registering documents on the spot and the other is in respect of the fees levied which is amongst the lowest charged by any Chamber of Commerce.
BCC also recommends visa applications made by members to foreign embassies for overseas business travel on request.
Further, the BCC disseminates and updates trade information.
Another regular service of the BCC is the transmission of trade information both foreign and local to members. The local information pertains to Customs tariff, taxes and duties besides other relevant data and commercial news updates. For example, seminars, discussions, foreign delegations visiting the country and trade fairs and exhibitions. The BCC is gearing itself to also transmit the latest information and regulations covering GSP+; for example, specific information on fish exports could be accessed by members on request.
The BCC channels foreign trade inquiries investment opportunities sought by foreign companies for joint ventures or trade tie-ups to members.Whilst taking up with the relevant government authorities, issues and problems of members a particularly noteworthy service it renders on behalf of the entire business community is its annual representations on the national budget.
More information on the BCCs services could be obtained directly from the Secretary General, Business Chamber of Commerce, by e-mailing [emailprotected].

Calculated risks paid off - Pandya
PALLEKELE: Indias man of the hour Hardik Pandya said that he took a calculated risk when he saw that Sri Lanka had spread the field for him and it paid off handsomely as he lifted his team to a position from which they could pressure on the Sri Lankan batsmen.
Pandya scored a calculated century off 86 balls pummelling the Lankan bowlers for seven sixes and equal number of fours to lift India from 339-7 to 487 all out.
Could there have been a bigger opportunity than that Nine wickets were already down and I knew, if stay in the crease and connect the ball well, it would go for six. Even if I were to mishit, I had to. I had no choice, said Pandya at the end of the second day. It was an ideal opportunity and obviously there was a teams goal which was a 400-run target and we scored close to 490.
In one over of Malinda Pushpakumara, Pandya slammed him for 26 runs the most by an Indian in the Test cricket.
It just happened, honestly I didnt want to go all over in that over but I dont know what happened. Maybe I was connecting pretty well, let me try this over and scored 26 runs, feels obviously good, said Pandya. From there I saw the scoreboard and I was batting on 80 and I was like, wow! Then I noticed I was in the zone, I dont usually look at the scoreboard, I dont want to know whats happening around. I just focus on how I can help the innings progress.
Pandya said that he learnt from MS Dhoni the former Indian captain was to play for the team.
When I bat, I dont think about my personal scores and achievements. It has helped me enough. One thing I learned from Mahi bhai is that you always put your team ahead, see the scoreboard and play accordingly. That has helped me throughout.
Recognised for his talent as a T20 cricketer Pandya said that he was lucky to get a break in Test cricket. God has been pretty kind to me. I am pretty lucky I got things pretty quickly in life. I am just happy that way. I have worked hard enough and I am getting whatever I have worked hard for. It is not easy but I dont mind it. - ST

## Title: Can a novel be a fugue

Can a novel be a fugue
Learning to play the piano as a kid, I was not especially fond of Bach. I loved Beethoven, Schubert, Dvork, Brahms. Bach, on the other hand, hurt my head. Bach had to be practiced slowly, evenly, preferably with a metronome, and neither patience nor evenness was my strong suit.
The melody was not predictably given to the right hand but passed from the right to the left and back, split into multiple voices that straddled the staffs, so that at any moment one might simultaneously be playing four or more melodic lines. In the pricey, blue-bound Henle urtext editions she had insisted I buy, my piano teacher marked with brackets the entrance of each voice. I couldnt do it myself. If Brahms felt like poetry, Bach felt like math. It was a kind of logic puzzle that I couldnt solve.
Piano Man
I struggled with the beginnings of my first novel for several years, as many writers do. I wrote a hundred pages and threw them out, unable to find the storys shape. I tried again. The germ of the story I was trying to figure out had come to me after hearing an April 2005 NPR piece about a mysterious man who had turned up on the southern coast of England, soaking wet, dressed in a formal suit. He couldnt say who he was or where he was from, but reportedly he played the piano like a virtuoso.
Dubbed the Piano Man by the British tabloids, he seemed to be in the throes of a dissociative fugue. The image of this lost musician resonated with me, as it did with the thousands of people from around the world who called in to the missing-persons help line, thinking they recognized him, wanting to identify him, even as he so clearly seemed to want to evade identification, to escape.
The idea of a fugue state intrigued me: it spoke to migration as a flight not only from ones homeland but also from ones identity. Even though images of desperate refugees washing up on foreign shores had not yet become part of our public consciousness, the Piano Man piece got me thinking about what it meant to flee, to try to remake ones life in a new place, to forge a new identity.
My Jewish grandparents on both sides had escaped Nazi Europe in 1939, almost too late, and although my family never used the word refugee, my childhood was shadowed by the unspoken question of who, if not for the war, we might have been. I wanted the figure of the Piano Man to shadow the narrative as a reminder of the losses and transformations that border crossings bring.
Central themes
The word fugue comes from the Latin fugo, flight, as well as fugere, to flee (as do the words fugitive and refugee). Migration and flight formed my novels central themes. The novels main character, Esther, has left her failing marriage and come to London following the death of her son. Esthers elderly mother, Lonia, floating in a kind of morphine-induced fugue, returns to memories of fleeing Eastern Europe in 1939.
Esthers next-door neighbor, Javad, is a divorced neuroscientist who ran away from revolutionary Iran. And Javads teenage son, Amir, escapes daily life by exploring the citys forbidden underground spaces.

Car ramming, helicopter crash claim 3 lives at US far-right rally
US: A white nationalists rally erupted into deadly violence Saturday as a car plowed into a crowd while demonstrators and counter-protesters clashed, spurring President Donald Trump to condemn hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides. But as the death toll linked to the rally rose to three -- one in the car crash and two in a helicopter crash outside Charlottesville -- the Presidents apparent refusal to criticize far-right hate groups sparked sharp criticism, even from members of his Republican Party.
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe had already declared a state of emergency when a dark sedan surged into a crowd of what witnesses said was counter-demonstrators in the picturesque university city of Charlottesville.
A 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 were hurt in the ramming, police said, with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening.
Another 16 people were treated for other injuries linked to the rally, including from individual engagements, Charlottesville police chief Al Thomas said.
The cause of the helicopter crash, which occurred in a nearby wooded area, was under investigation, Virginia State Police said.
Authorities did not say how the crash was linked to the violence in Charlottesville, through it appeared state police were onboard, as Trump tweeted his deepest condolences to the families & fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. He later added: Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!
Hundreds had descended on Charlottesville either to march in or rail against a Unite the Right Rally. Unrest quickly flared even as riot police and national guard troops flooded the citys downtown. Many of the far-right supporters brandished Confederate battle flags, considered a symbol of racism by many Americans, while others raised their arms in Nazi salutes.
Anti-racism protesters waved flags from the Black Lives Matter movement, chanting slogans like We say no to racist fear and No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA. Ambulances quickly arrived at the scene of the car ramming, which a witness told AFP was intentional -- saying one girl got tore up after the car backed up and they hit again. He said the dark sedan raced down here, jumped over the speed bumps and it backed up and it hit everyone again. The male driver was taken into custody and police were treating the incident as a criminal homicide, the police chief said.
Trump, speaking from his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, said the hatred that erupted Saturday has existed in America for a long, long time. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides, he said. It has no place in America. The hate and the division must stop, and must stop right now.
But the President stopped short of condemning white nationalist and supremacist groups, and ignored shouted questions from journalists about the groups, which broadly supported Trump in last years election.
He was quickly criticized by liberals such as his 2016 election opponent Hillary Clinton, who did not name Trump but tweeted that Every minute we allow this to persist through tacit encouragement or inaction is a disgrace, & corrosive to our values. But a few prominent Republicans piled on and were more direct in their criticism.
Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists, Florida Senator Marco Rubio tweeted. - AFP

Champions Chelsea beaten at home in first game
LONDON, Saturday: Premier League champions Chelsea suffered an embarrassing home defeat on the first Saturday of the new season, having two men sent off as unfancied Burnley beat them 3-2 at Stamford Bridge.
Antonio Conte's disjointed side struggled from the early stages when captain Gary Cahill was dismissed for a lunging tackle and they found themselves three-nil down at halftime to a team who gained only seven points away from home all last season. Wales international Sam Vokes scored two of the goals and Stephen Ward the other.
New signing Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid came on to pull one back midway through the second half and then provided an assist for David Luiz, but in-between midfielder Cesc Fabregas was also sent off for a second yellow card.
It was a dispiriting afternoon for Conte, who won the title in his first season at the club but has complained that Chelsea have not signed enough new players while allowing several to leave.
Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp protested that Watford's stoppage-time equaliser by Manuel Britos in an entertaining 3-3 draw should have been disallowed for offside.
After the opening game of the season on Friday produced seven goals and a late winner for Arsenal, who beat Leicester City 4-3, the two teams at Vicarage Road served up more of the same entertainment for a worldwide television audience -- including some poor defending.
The home side, under new manager Marco Silva, led twice through Stefano Okaka and Abdoulaye Doucoure but Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, with a penalty, both equalised.
Debutant Mohamed Salah seemed to have won the points for the visitors before Britos's dramatic late intervention.
Promoted Huddersfield Town, playing in the top flight for the first time since 1972 and widely tipped for relegation, cruised to a 3-0 win away to Crystal Palace.
Record signing Steve Mounie, the Benin striker from Montpellier who cost 13 million euros ($15.36 million), scored once in each half after Palace's Joel Ward put through his own goal.
Wayne Rooney scored on his return to Everton from Manchester United to give the Merseysiders a 1-0 victory at home to Stoke City. It was his 199th Premier League goal and first for Everton since 2004.
Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazi, on loan to West Bromwich Albion from Al Ahly, scored on his debut in the 1-0 win at home to Bournemouth.  Agencies

Child deaths at Indian hospital reach 64
INDIA: A key ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing calls for his resignation after at least 64 children died at a government hospital in northern India that suffered oxygen shortages.
Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state where the deaths occurred, visited the hospital Sunday as angry relatives rushed to the scene demanding answers.
The deaths occurred over six days, with Indian media reporting that 30 children died Thursday and Friday because of a lack of oxygen on the children's wards.
Suppliers' bills had allegedly not been paid, leading to a shortage that saw panicked families using artificial manual breathing bags to help their loved ones.
Local officials have conceded there was a disruption to the oxygen supply at the hospital in Gorakhpur, but insist the deaths were caused by encephalitis and other illnesses, not a lack of available oxygen.
We are confident that none of the lives were lost because of this episode, a senior government health official in Gorakhpur told AFP on Sunday on condition of anonymity.
But victims' families have disputed this, describing the panic and chaos as patients began struggling from a sudden lack of oxygen.
As soon as we reached the hospital, we were handed a small pump and told to keep pumping. I did so for over three-and-a-half hours, one victim's father, Shailendra Gupta, was quoted by Sunday's Indian Express as saying.
The next day, we were informed that he was dead. - Resignation calls -
Gorakhpur's police commissioner Anil Kumar told AFP on Sunday that 11 more children had died at the hospital on Saturday.
But I reiterate, they were not due to lack of oxygen supply, he said.
Doctors admitted that the oxygen supply had been disrupted for a couple of hours late Thursday, but said no deaths had occurred at that time. The hospital's breakdown of the death toll showed a jump Thursday when 23 infants died, including 14 babies at its neo-natal unit.
The head of the hospital was stood down pending an inquiry into the oxygen shortage, which allegedly stemmed from nearly $100,000 in overdue bills, some dating back to November. As anger grew over the deaths, opposition parties and government critics led the charge for Adityanath's resignation.
The fireband Hindu priest, who won India's largest state in a landslide in March, toured the hospital wards Sunday in his signature saffron robes and a blue medical mask and cap.
This incident took place due to the laxity on the part of state government. The state government is fully responsible for it, Ghulam Nabi Azad, a senior leader of India's main opposition Congress party, said late Saturday.- AFP

Art of proper speech
It is very important to cultivate the art of speech. That will help a person to achieve his target and fulfil his ambition. It may be a political meeting or a fund raising campaign, where listeners need to be impressed.
The following are some important features:
a) Proper personality should be maintained by way of appearance, attire, behaviour etc. It will help to have a good start.
b) Subject matter has to be understood and clearly studied by adequate information collected and analysed. Clear acquaintance is important.
c) Will power should be developed.
d) Inferiority complex should be avoided.
e) Never get provoked by adverse comments made by the audience. Speech should be continued uninterrupted which will silence, the disturbing elements.
f) Without going in for a long explanatory speech, giving statistics from recognized sources will be beneficial. It will add weight to the speech.
g) A sense of humour is important. A humorous speech always attract the listeners. Short anecdotes are welcome.
h) The type of audience should be understood. They may be intellectuals, uneducated or even emotional people. Utmost care should be exercised when addressing students, minors, or even mentally retarded people.
I) Vulgar and personal attacks should be avoided.
j) Body movements should be restricted.
k) Long speeches should be avoided. It should be short like a girls miniskirt but long enough to cover the subject. Do not speak beyond authorized time and delay other speakers.
l) Allow sometime for questioning. It will help the people to understand and clear their doubts.

Concessions on loans granted  to flood affected borrowers
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has permitted licensed banks to grant concessions to their borrowers who have been affected by the recent floods, adverse weather conditions and connected circumstances with a view to facilitating the recommencement of their businesses and normalization of their activities.
Accordingly, licensed banks cangrant a concessionary period of up to three months in respect of repayment of all performing credit facilities of such borrowers as at May 25, 2017 and waive the penal interest for this period.
Based on the information received by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, many borrowers who have been affected by the recent floods are not aware of this concessionary scheme and therefore have not received these concessions.
Accordingly, such borrowers are informed to contact their bank branches in this regard.

Depression doubles coronary artery disease deaths
Depression appears to double the chance of dying in any given year for patients with coronary artery disease, according to a new study.
The researchers said such mental distress was a stronger risk factor than age, having had a heart attack, or diabetes. The effect was seen if the person was depressed before or after diagnosis of the disease.
Nearly 25,000 people with coronary artery disease were tracked over an average of 10 years and about 15 per cent of them ended up being diagnosed with depression, according to a paper published in the European Heart Journal.
A cardiovascular epidemiologist at Intermountain Medical Centre Heart Institute in Salt Lake City, Dr Heidi May said no matter how long or how short it was, patients were found to have twice the risk of dying compared to those who didnt have a follow-up diagnosis of depression.
Depression was the strongest risk factor for dying, compared to any other risk factors we evaluated. That included age, heart failure, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney failure, or having a heart attack or stroke. We have completed several depression-related studies and been looking at this connection for many years. The data just keeps building on itself, showing that if you have heart disease and depression and it is not appropriately treated in a timely fashion, it is not a good thing for your long-term wellbeing. She stated.
Of more than 2,600 patients who became clinically depressed about 27 per cent did so within a year of being diagnosed with the disease. The figure was 37 per cent after five years. While depression seems to make the condition worse, being diagnosed is also a reason why some patients become depressed.

Dining with grace and good taste!
Ive noticed a several shameless diners openly belch, talk with their mouths full and pick food from their teeth during meal times. Ive seen people with atrocious table manners shovel food into their mouths reminding one of feeding time at the zoo.
I have watched quite a few diners talking with their mouths full, belching and burping while attacking their fodder and wolfing it down in the most disgusting manner imaginable.
Finger food
Table manners play an important part in making a favourable impression. They are visible signals of the state of our manners and therefore are essential to professional success. The point of etiquette rules is to make you feel comfortable.
Whether dining with royalty, heads of state, the diplomatic corps or sitting with friends and family at a humble home repast, an understanding of dining protocol makes time spent with others around a table more enjoyable. When you know the rules there is no awkwardness or questions about how things should be done.
Instead there is only opportunity to spend quality time with the company present. I have often noticed that many of the so-called elite, or people regarded as the cream of society had never been taught proper dining etiquette. I was actually astounded that people who had spent fortunes on their education were still gobbling from their plates like horses.
Yes, some of us do have horrendously poor table manners. We slurp our soup, chomp our chocolate cake, spill our salt and belch our blessings. And while all of this slurping, chomping, spilling and belching can be seen as quaintly charming, we are no longer living in caves or little wooden shacks. You must learn about basic table manners you should use at every meal.
It may have been frowned upon for decades but eating with your hands in a restaurant is now acceptable, etiquette experts say  so long as you do not lick your fingers clean afterwards. Even then there are guidelines to modern dining manners designed to help people navigate the potentially messy minefield of finger food.
Sure, we Sri Lankan buth gottas relish out staple rice and curry above most other menus. For us sub-continentals there is no way around it. Our food tastes best when eaten with the fingers. There is a perceptible dimension added to the eating process when we do it the customary way. Besides, Sri Lankan foods are designed to be eaten by hand.
Even breads are to be torn and wrapped around foods. Rice is customarily blended with curries so each mouthful is unique. If you eat off a banana leaf trying to use a knife and fork would shred your plate.
Paying attention
Eating gracefully with your fingers is a cultural practice everyone should experience while visiting Sri Lanka. For those who might feel finicky many Sri Lankan hosts provide esoteric table items such as fingerbowls. Frankly, many Westerners almost never use those things, and even when they do, will not know how to use them either.
I remember at a large formal rice and curry luncheon where finger bowls had been placed for every diner. One of the foreign guests tried to drink it mistaking it for a kind of exotic aperitif.
If nothing else, live by these simple rules which I was tutored in when I was around six. First always pay attention to your hosts. Being an observant diner and picking up on cues from your host will enable you to avoid most of the embarrassing situations you could find yourself in.
Simple things like waiting to eat until you see others eating and using the utensils others are using will enable you to wing it, meaning to do it in an impromptu manner, improvising, with little preparation. However, this constant observing and following does not allow you to relax and enjoy the evening. So you had better become a fast learner from simple observation so that you can dine with the confidence and finesse of an aristocrat.
To start, your napkin should be spread out on your lap, never tucked into the neck of your shirt even if you want to protect your Gianni Versace tie. Sit up straight and make sure your elbows are not encroaching on your neighbours space. Do not rest your elbows on the table or lean on them when eating. If you are served a meal that is already on the plate, wait until everyone round the table has been served before starting.
Cutlery should be rested on the plate or bowl between bites. Never gesture with your cutlery, and do not scrape or clatter it noisily. Depending on the formality of the occasion, there will be varying amounts of cutlery on the table. The layout should always be the same, fork to the left, knives and spoons to the right. Work from the outside inwards, course by course. Dessert utensils usually sit above the place setting.
Awkward situations
Always eat at a relaxed pace and try to match your fellow diners. Keep your mouth closed and chewing noise to a minimum. Never smack your chops. Talking while there is food in your mouth should be avoided at all costs even when you have a conversational gem ready to pop out of your gullet. Do not drink your wine too fast or ask for a top-up unless you are in very familiar company. Do not over-indulge, there is nothing worse than a drunken diner, particularly at a formal or business dinner.
In order to recover if expected to speak, only put a single bite in your mouth at a time. The days of stuffing your mouth and with as much food as it can hold and wolfing it down are over.
Bring your food to your face, not your face to your food. You should not be leaning over your food, shovelling it into your mouth with a distance travelled of only six inches. Instead, sit straight, balance a single bite on the utensil of choice and bring it directly to your mouth.
Dress appropriately even for informal dining and make certain your attire even though relaxed and casual is clean. In both social and professional circles, demonstrating class and courtesy can open doors for you, while displaying poor manners can cause doors to shut in your face.
It only takes a bit of guidance and practice to help people sail through a wide variety of potentially awkward situations while dining with grace and poise. Moving from being clueless in such matters and becoming a class act is not a impossibility if you simply follow the right guidelines. Bon apetit!

Drink tea and wine, keep flu at bay
When youre suffering from flu  cue a sore throat, fever, cough and stuffy nose  and want to stop it in its tracks, the answer typically lies with Lemsip, a heavy dose of vitamin C and getting plenty of rest.
But, according to new research, the best remedy could be hidden in your wine rack, or be as simple as brewing a cup of tea.
The study, conducted by scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine, has found that a compound found in foods such as red wine, black tea and blueberries could help gut bacteria, fight infections and prevent severe influenza.
Published in the journal Science, in their test on mice, the researchers explained that flavonoids found in these products worked with a particular gut micriobiome  clostridum oribiscidens  to create a metabolite that boosts the immune response. As a result, flu symptoms lessen and the time it takes to return to health is reduced.
For years, flavonoids have been thought to have protective properties that help regulate the immune system to fight infections. Flavonoids are common in our diets, so it is possible that flavonoids work with gut microbes to protect humans from flu and other viral infections. The research however is yet to be carried out on humans with flu symptoms.

Elections Chief slams polls postponing
Postponement of election on whatever grounds is not a positive characteristic of democracy, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday said. He was delivering the keynote address at the inaugural ceremony of the National Diploma in Politics and Political Leaders conducted by the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.
Responsibility of not holding elections should be taken not by the Elections Commission but by Parliament where the law-makers are, Deshapriya said. Persons who are elected are responsible in making laws.
They are the very same who make laws to not hold elections, Deshapriya stated.
Dehsapriya said it was the position held by the Elections Commission, just as much as it was his personal opinion.
He said it was in the hand of the Elections Commission to make decisions on holding elections; they would have already held elections on due time. The local elections in Batticalowa has been postponed from 2013. Election in around 200 local governments has been postponed from 2015 up until now, Deshapriya said.
Drawing examples from well-known court cases, Deshapriya established that right to vote is fundamental, even though it is not included in Sri Lankas Constitution. He told that legislation has established the ground that voting is a facet of freedom of expression. Deshapriya said postponing an election was a violation of freedom of expression.
Taking a human rights case filed against the Elections Commission for the military not allowing a group of voters not given permission to enter the cleared area from the unclear area in Batticalowa in the war time, Deshapriya told the decision was that even for the reasons of security, the right to vote must not be violated.
Deshapriya said Elections Commission was not out of work just because there were no elections held in the recent times. It is not that we are like the Gypsy who lost its snake. We are continuing to raise awareness of the importance of universal franchise, sovereignty and constitution around Sri Lanka, he said.
Addressing the students who are to follow the diploma course in politics and political leadership, Deshapriya told them, if you want to become a good political leader, you should learn to take the blame and let others take the glory.

All arrangements were finalised to hold elections before the end of this year for the three provincial councils that are due to expire terms shortly, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing the inaugural meeting of the SLFP Galle District Organisation held at the Hall de Galle recently.
Minister Amaraweera said elections to the three provincial councils were most likely to be held in advance than other provincial councils that were due to expire terms later.
He said most of the SLFP candidates for Provincial Council elections were selected. He requested organisers to select candidates for vacant seats and send in their names to party headquarters.
He said many organisations and election monitoring teams had requested the government to hold all local elections on a single day according to the Ward System.
When the Cabinet approves a new bill to make this a reality, some sections accused the Government of trying to postpone elections.
Since we earned flak for trying to execute good deed, we decided to hold elections soon according to the Preferential System, he said.

Fitch upgrades Sri Lanka Insurance Corps National Ratings
Fitch Ratings has upgraded Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limiteds (SLIC) National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating and National Long-Term Rating to AA+(lka) from AA(lka) and assigned a Stable Outlook. The agency has also affirmed SLICs international IFS rating at B+ with a Stable Outlook.
The one-notch upgrade of SLICs National Long-Term Rating and National IFS rating reflects Fitchs more positive view of the states 99.9% ownership in the company following a recent proposal to exempt SLIC from the regulatory requirement that all insurers must be listed. As a result, there will be no dilution of the states ownership.
The ratings are also supported by its sound profitability and healthy capitalisation. SLICs ratings also reflect its established franchise and market position in Sri Lanka. Offsetting these strengths are significant investments in non-core subsidiaries and a high equity exposure, which weighs on its risk-based capital. The IFS rating was affirmed as the rating remains constrained by Sri Lankas sovereign rating (B+/Stable).
Fitch views SLIC as being important to the government of Sri Lanka due to its ownership and the companys strategic importance as the largest state-owned insurer. The strategic investments that SLIC undertake in line with government policy are a rating weakness. The company continues to operate as a composite insurer.
SLICs regulatory risk-based capital (RBC) ratios improved to 434% for life and 198% for non-life by end-March 2017 from 427% and 186% at end-2016, respectively. These ratios were well above the regulatory minimum of 120% for each business and compared well against those of its peers. Management expects to maintain RBC ratios above 200% in the medium to long term.
Pre-tax operating ROA including realised and unrealised gains (2016: 8.1%, 2015: 2.9%) has been consistently high even after adjusting for dividends received from subsidiaries. The combined ratio for the non-life business improved to 96% in 1H17 after worsening to around 99% in 2016 (2015: 93%) due to high competition. Losses stemming from a severe tropical storm in May 2016 were largely manageable as a result of sound reinsurance arrangements in place. The country faced a similar flood in May 2017, but losses were much lower than in 2016 because the 2016 flooding affected mainly industrial zones in the island.
SLIC has a high risk appetite, which is evident from its large equity investment that exposes the company to market volatility. SLICs total investment in equities (including non-core subsidiaries) was 93% of shareholders equity at end-2016 (end-2015: 96%). The government has announced that it plans to dispose some of these non-core investments, which were funded by profit retention, and include interests in the gas, healthcare, leisure and banking sectors.
The companys dividend payout ratio increased to 79% in 2016, largely due to a high extraordinary dividend received from SLICs subsidiary Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. However, excluding subsidiary dividends, SLICs dividend payouts have increased due to higher dividend expectations from the government.
SLIC is the oldest operating insurer in the country and is supported by an extensive network of branches and strategic business units. The companys asset base of LKR175 billion at end-2016 accounted for around 35% of the insurance sectors assets. SLIC has the second-highest market share in life and non-life businesses as measured by gross written premiums (GWP).

Children of ages, four, five, 10 and a 15-month-old baby were treated a month ago.
The children could not find a match from their own families, so we had to go for unrelated donors. The chances of getting a match from unrelated donors are only 10 percent to 15 percent, said Dr. Sunil Bhat, head of oncology and bone marrow transplant, Narayana Health City, who conducted the surgery.
He said the match for bone marrow for two of the children was found from the Indian registry of donors called Datri and the other two were from DKMS, a German registry.
The father of one of the children, who did not wish to be named, said hey struggled to find a match and since Sri Lanka did not have tie-ups with the registry, they had to look at other countries.

This years summit will feature a host of thought leaders in the international travel and tourism sphere. Sebastian Rassmann and Rene Massatti will be in Colombo sharing their insights at the Summit that will be held at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
Rassman and Massati will discuss how researching trends have become an absolute game-changer assisting marketers to identify latest innovations around the world. While observing micro-trends can be a painstaking task, Nils Mller and his team of researchers setup TRENDONE GmbH in 2003.
This years conference will have a special feature, Future Space, an interactive installation available at the summit offering the attendees the opportunity to physically try out modern, innovative and cutting edge technology with pre-built systems which can be directly implemented to existing systems.
We are convinced that small changes foreshadow big ones. We have deployed around 80 trend scouts in 22 language regions. They alert us with new trend signals everyday. The most promising trends are then filtered out and the marketable innovation which matches the specific trend is then launched in the region. Trendsetting influences are necessary in order to be able to develop ground-breaking product ideas and new business models. Reliable knowledge of upcoming technologies gives the innovation a competitive advantage. If you already know today what is going to be important tomorrow, you will have a valuable advantage for your innovation process, explained Nils Muller in a press release.

Govt. striving to create honest, patriotic politicians: President
Even though the political culture of the country is neck deep in corruption and fraud at all levels and it cannot be changed for the better from the top echelons to the lowest rungs overnight, the present government is shouldering the difficult task of creating a group of honest politicians who love the motherland, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
In the face of the all insults and accusations, my endeavour is to surmount all challenges and build a clean political culture the people desire, the President added.
The President was speaking at a meeting held at the Talawa playground to mark the presentation of land title deeds to farmers in the Mahaweli H Zone.
President Sirisena who noted that the government had performed a massive amount of work within a short period, unprecedented by any previous government, despite all criticism and allegations leveled against it, added that the governments top priority was to rebuild the national economy by strengthening the farmers economy.
He said under the Moragahakanda project which would realise the hopes and aspirations of the farmers which form the majority population into fruition, a very large number were being simultaneously rehabilitated for the first time after the period of Sinhala kings.
This process would soon bring progress and prosperity to farmers living in those areas, the President said.
The government was also in the process of finding a lasting solution to the garbage problem which past governments had miserably failed to tackle. No future government would face the garbage problem because the problem would be tackled once and for all by next year. For the first time in the country garbage will be used to generate electricity and produce carbonic fertiliser, the President said.
He said carbonic fertiliser manufactured under this project within the first and second cycles would be distributed free of charge among farmers in the country.
Land title deeds were presented to 6,200 farmer families at this ceremony. President Sirisena symbolically presented land deeds to 100 of them. The Maha Sangha, clergy of other religious, Ministers P. Harison and Chandrani Bandara, Deputy Ministers Anuradha Jayaratne, Indika Bandaranayake and Taranath Basnayake NCP Governor P. B. Dissanayake, Parliamentarian Chandima Mahindasoma and former Minister Tissa Karaliyadda were also present on the occasion.
After the ceremony, President Sirisena visited the premises of the Eppawala Co-operative Society where he had earlier worked as a supplies officer and had a chat with its employees who had been his colleagues at the institution.
The co-operative staff who gave him a rousing welcome also presented a special memento to him. Co-operative Society president Sarath Chandrasekera too presented a special memento to President Maithripala Sirisena and handed over to him the personal file that President Sirisena maintained at the Co-operative Society during his stint as supplies officer.
The President also posed for a group photograph with the Eppawala Co-operative staff.

Heart of the land
The Lion Flag that was flying over the Kandyan Provinces for many years was hauled down with the signing of the Kandyan Convention on March 2, 1815, and it had thereafter become a forgotten history. The great patriot, E. W. Perera was the pioneer to discover where the Flag was deposited. In his book on Sinhalese Banners and Standards written in the beginning of the 19th Century, he states that I discovered the missing banner at the Chelsea Hospital.
In September 1945, JR. Jayewardene was the first to raise in the State Council the question of using the Lion Flag as the Official Flag. Three years later, he drafted a Motion to the effect that: That this House is of opinion that the Royal Standard of King Sri Wickrama Raja Singhe depicting a yellow lion passant holding a sword in its right paw on a red background, which was removed to England after the Convention of 1815, should once again be adopted as the Official Flag of Free Lanka and persuaded the then M. P. for Batticaloa, A. Sinnalebbe to propose the Motion for discussion in the House of Representatives on January 16, 1948.
Prime Minister, D. S. Senanayake said on the Motion:
We claim the Flag to be a Sinhalese Flag although we inherited it from a Tamil King. By hoisting this Flag let us show Britain that they have transferred sovereignty to us, and let the people outside know about it. If we are to have a Flag hoisted on Independence Day, it must be this Flag and no other Flag.
On February 12, 1948 the Lion Flag that was hoisted by the Prime Minister in the presence of H. R. H. the Duke of Gloucester was identical with the one hauled down at the same spot on 2ND March 1815, 133 years earlier.
On March 6, 1948 the Prime Minister appointed a Committee consisting of (1) S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike (Chairman), (2) Sir John Kotelawala, (3) J. R. Jayewardene, (4) T. B. Jayah, (5) Dr. L. A. Rajapakse, K. C., (6) G. G. Ponnambalam, K. C., and (7) Senator S. Nadeson to advise him on the question of National Flag of Ceylon.
Dr. S. Paranavitane, Archaeological Commissioner, was appointed as the Secretary of the Committee and he functioned in that capacity from the second meeting held on June 12, 1948.
Amicable reconciliation
The general consensus among the members of the Committee was that the Lion Flag should be the National Flag of Ceylon with suitable modifications made therein. Though the Committee had been addressing to this task they were unable to suggest a solution as there existed no unanimity. A meeting was held for the purpose of considering a Draft Report, informing the Prime Minister that the members of the Committee were unable to agree.
The majority community was obdurate in maintaining the size of the Lion Emblem without it being reduced.
G. G. Ponnambalam brought about a last minute compromising formula to the effect that two strips of saffron and green should be adapted to the Lion Flag in the proportion of 1:1:5 and the other members readily agreed to the proposal but Senator Nadeson gave a dissenting Report.
Accordingly, the Committee has on February 13, 1950 approved the Lion Flag with certain modifications, a design of which was annexed thereto, marked Plate XV, signed by all members except Senator Nadeson. In the design, there are two vertical strips, green and saffron, of equal size, each being in the proportion of one to seven of the entire flag. Thus, the Lion Flag, with modifications as appearing in the Plate XV annexed to the Report, was adopted as the National Flag of Sri Lanka.
It is notable that Tamils were always willing and ready to come to compromise their sentiments in search of a durable solution and in the end they were exploited by manipulated mechanisms of the politics of the majority.
Many do not know that saffron and green represent the Tamils and the Muslims respectively. It is the common understanding that the Lion Flag is the National Flag.
Nadesons Report
In the dissenting Report, Nadeson stated that The suggestion I made was that the yellow border which according to the proposed flag separates the saffron strip and from red strip should be completely eliminated. In the result the flag would have been comprised of green, saffron and red strips in the proportion of 1:1:5 with the Lion on the red strip and with the yellow border surrounding the entirety of the flag and encompassing the two strips within the yellow border.
Nadson observed that In my view, this design if adopted far from being a symbol of national unity will be symbol of our disunity. Once the committee agreed that the national flag should be devised by modifying the Lion Flag, one would have thought that any strips adopted for the purpose of satisfying the minorities will be integrated with the Lion Flag and that these strips will not be an appendage to the Lion Flag. Anyone looking at the proposed Flag will see that the Lion Flag is preserved in all its integrity and outside that Flag two strips are allotted to represent the minorities.
He observed further that Neither do we desire that one community should be segregated from another. Why then do we want to segregate the saffron and green strips, which are provided to satisfy minority sentiments outside the borders of the Lion Flag In my view the suggestion that I have made does not entail the sacrifice of any vital part of the Lion Flag and thus cannot offend Sinhalese sentiments.
Four Bo-leaves
The four bo-leaves that are found in the present National Flag were not in the Original Flag that was recommended by the National Flag Committee upon meticulous examination of the public opinion and study by themselves of the various aspects and issues involved therein. The four bo-leaves were inserted in the 1978 Constitution by President JR Jayewardene, without a word of deliberation to project that Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country. By about 1976 the Flag Research Centre reported that the internal dimensions of the overall Flag and the colours therein were not properly specified and accordingly agitated for some time to rectify the alleged shortcomings in the Flag. Consequently, JR Jayewardene, as President gave mandate to the Sri Lanka Standards Institution to lay down the standard to ensure the Flag to uniform size, design and colour.
It is unfortunate that the Leaders of the majority community, who from time to time make utterances of embracing the minority, feel reticent to correct the National Flag as suggested by Senator Nadeson in his dissenting report. Would it be corrected in the New Constitution as suggested by Nadeson
Why then speaking of one country and one people without translating it into action

IAAF World Championships Day 10 highlights
LONDON, Sunday  Highlights for Day 10 -- the final day - of the IAAF World Championships on Sunday:
Women's 5,000m final
Almaz Ayana's astonishing win in the 10,000m -- burning off the opposition to win by more than 46 seconds -- makes her the hot favourite to retain the 5000m title she won in Beijing. Everything appears to be falling into place for the 25-year-old with Ethiopian compatriot Genzebe Dibaba withdrawing from the event because of back pain. Ayana finished second in her heat but not too much should be read into that given her efforts only a few days previously in what was her first race of the season. Her main opposition is likely to come from Kenya's Olympic silver medallist Hellen Obiri, the fastest in the event in the world this year, and Ethiopian team-mate Senbere Tefiri, silver medallist in 2015.
Men's 1500m final
Kenya's Benjamin Kiprop bids for a fourth successive world title and he is still only 28. He breezed through the heats and semi-finals finishing second to compatriot Elijah Manangoi, silver medallist two years ago. I have a lot of experience from World Championship races, I've been doing this for many years and I'm ready for anything, said Kiprop. Norway could enjoy more medal success after Karsten Warholm's gold in the 400m hurdles with another of their promising young athletes, European champion Filip Ingrebrigtsen.
Women's 800m final
Olympic champion Caster Semenya has shown remarkable mental strength throughout the long drawn out debate over her eligibility to run. The 26-year-old bids to add a third world 800m title to her trophy cabinet and didn't look in the heats or the semi to have suffered unduly from her efforts in winning bronze in the 1500m. It will take something special for her to be beaten for the first time in an 800m race since 2015. Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba, promising 23-year-old American Ajee Wilson and Canada's 2015 silver medallist Melissa Bishop all have the ability to medal but gold could be beyond them.
Men and women's 4x400m relay finals
Fresh from having helped the US quartet win gold in the women's 4x100m relay, Allyson Felix goes again in the 4x400m seeking a record 16th world medal. Her gold in the shorter relay saw her overtake Jamaicans Merlene Ottey and Usain Bolt as the record world medal holder. Every moment I am on these relay teams is a privilege. I have the best time and just enjoy it, said Felix.
Men's high jump final
Qatar's Mutaz Barshim has a great chance to become the first Asian to win a world high jump title.
Should he claim victory, he would join South African Jacques Freitag as the second man to win world youth, world junior and world senior titles.

Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 1.14% W-o-W (or LKR 33.90Bn) to LKR 2,944.80Bn cf. LKR 2,978.70Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 45.14% (or LKR 0.81Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 93.76% of the sectors total turnover.
The Manufacturing Sector meanwhile accounted for 26.47% (or LKR 0.48Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Chevron, Tokyo Cement and Piramal Glass which accounted for 77.81% of the sector turnover.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 15.00% (or LKR 0.27Bn) to the market driven by Sampath Bank, Commercial Bank & HNB which accounted for 49.28% of the sector turnover.

Point of view
Negative sentiment continued to cloud domestic equities, with equity markets losing steam for the 4th consecutive week as the benchmark ASPI lost ~74 points WoW (cf. ~98 point decline the previous week and the ~3 point loss the week prior).
Institutional, HNI and Foreign interest which had been supporting Index gains over Q217 also waned this week, with crossings in three stocks (JKH, GLAS & NEST) accounting for just 30% of total market turnover. Heavy trading in JKH (crossings in JKH accounted for ~82% of total crossings and 25% of total market turnover) failed to stimulate markets and average turnover levels for the week consequently fell to LKR 0.45Bn, ~36% lower than last weeks average of LKR 0.70Bn.
Foreign inflows to the Bourse also slowed this week, with net foreign flows falling ~77% over the week to record a paltry LKR198Mn.
Compared to the 11.3% gain on the Index in Q217, markets have fallen ~3.8% in the first half of Q317, halving the YTD gain on the Index to 4.8% cf. the gain of 8.9% in the H117. Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue to take cues from the incoming corporate earnings releases while some pressure from profit taking is also likely.
IMF estimates gradual recovery in 2017 GDP
In its Country report released on Thursday, the IMF forecasted a gradual recovery in 2017 GDP (to 4.7%) citing continued momentum (since H216) in the Construction and Service sectors.
The Group noted that headline inflation levels are likely to remain over 5% while the current account deficit is expected to widen slightly to 2.5% (cf. 2.4% in 2016) amid drought-driven increases in oil and food imports, and higher capital goods imports1. The IMF noted though, that medium term growth is likely to reach 5.2%, in line with the countrys potential GDP.
The IMF highlighted however, that significant external and domestic downside risks exist, with further delays in revenue mobilization and SOE reforms, as well as pressures from the GoSLs large gross financing needs remaining the main domestic risks1.
The possible resumption of capital outflows due to further strengthening of the USD, higher rates or a weaker external position meanwhile pose significant external downside risks. The Group further noted that risks to public debt sustainability continue to remain high with public debt expected to rise marginally to 85% of GDP in 2017 due to the continued large fiscal deficit and exchange rate depreciation.

If SLFP members in the Government desire forgiveness for past sins, then they should give up their positions and join the JO without further delay, he said while addressing an event to commemorate the late parliamentarian T. B. Tennekoon, the father of former minister Janaka Bandara Tennekoon in Dambulla. Rajapaksa charged that the present government had failed to deliver on its promises and as a result the country was facing a massive socio-economic crisis.

NAFLIA to enhance public awareness on insurance
The National Forum for Life Insurance Advisors (NAFLIA) will take place for the 8th consecutive year with 2017s theme being, Towards the Day All Sri Lankans are Insured- Are we ready.
The forum is anticipated to bring together top-level life insurance advisors from across the country and provide them with a platform for knowledge sharing and networking. Subjects such as new developments in the insurance industry and technological entities will become hot topics for discussion among other things.
The overall structure of the event this year has been scheduled to include an extremely informative keynote address and the participation of movers and shakers from outside the insurance industry in panel discussions will bring in thoughts and views of key personnel who are not from the insurance industry, explained IASL President Deepthi Lokuarachchi.
The Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) is a collective body representing all companies both in the life and general insurance fields. The IASL has various subcommittees that are tasked with the management of key areas such as, actuarial, finance and technical sectors, which affect the industry. As such, the Marketing and Sales Forum (MSF) is a subcommittee of the IASL represented by key personnel involved in marketing and distribution of each company. Therefore, NAFLIA is the annual coming together of life insurance advisors and distribution management, facilitated by the Marketing and Sales Forum under the guidance of the IASL.
NAFLIA is being organized by a dedicated team of like-minded individuals from the MSF and has been the focal driving force for events pertaining to both the general and life insurance sectors of the Sri Lankan insurance industry over the years. Their most recent undertaking was the General Insurance Sales Congress (GISCO), which was held for the second consecutive year with the participation of members from the general insurance fraternity, said Marketing and Sales Forum Chairman Hashra Weerawardena as he discussed the role of the MSF.
On the primary purpose of NAFLIA, Lokuarachchi said, The primary driving force in organizing NAFLIA is to provide a forum for Life Insurance advisors to share experiences and gain knowledge. Weerawardena said, Until a sudden, unforeseen and unfortunate situation takes place the general population would not think of the significance of having insurance. This is the real situation even though in today's nuclear family setup it can be a necessity. Events such as NAFLIA enable the insurance advisor to be more professional in the pre-sale approach as well as in post sale service that serves to be an integral part of a good life Insurance advisor's key role in society. These events propel the advisor to be a financial consultant, risk assessor, and more importantly a friend when in need.
The IASL through the MSF has been able to lobby the government with the help of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka and have September 1, 2017, declared as National Insurance Day along with the launch of a commemorative stamp that will be unveiled to mark the date.
Further, the month of September will be commemorated as Insurance Awareness Month, where hype will be created in the media as well as on ground level through various activations and promotions, Lokuarachchi said.
The Chairman of the MSF further emphasized aboutInsurance awareness and its penetration within Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, this is still known to be at a low level when compared with some countries in the region. Our theme this year is very apt in this regard and speaks of our vision for Sri Lanka in the not too distant future when we wait for the day when Sri Lankans will embrace the concept of Insurance. Many events are being planned for the 1st of September and throughout the month of September in order to make the public aware of the need for Insurance and to take the message of Insurance to all corners of Sri Lanka, he added.

## Title: New climate change genre

New climate change genre
On July 12, 2017, the New York Times sent subscribers a push notification that read: Maps will need to be redrawn: a massive chunk of ice had broken away from Antarctica, producing one of the largest icebergs ever recorded.
Massive chunk of ice is maybe underplaying it: the state-sized portion of the Larsen Ice Shelf was large enough to contain cities. It is also more than a broken glacier turned iceberg. Though its not yet definitive that the breakup of the Larsen-C iceberg was a direct result of human-caused climate changethe Larsen Ice Shelf has been breaking up since the 1990sit has served as a clarion message of potential climate change impacts. Its a missive made more astounding by the popular idea that the continent from which this massive chunk of ice calved is well-nigh unbreakable.
Climate fiction
Its also an event that, until recently, would not have been out of place in a science fiction novel (as something so wildly improbable that its entertaining) or a work of climate fiction (as a warning of what could happen if this all spins out of control). But now its happened, and I would argue that, in addition to being an important moment in the global conversation about climate change, it is also a definitive event for climate fiction.
For as long as there has been a name for fiction about climate change, there has been an assumption that those novels are also sci-fi. And in some ways, the distance afforded the reader by dystopian or apocalyptic settings has, for decades, made certain cli-fi novels as reassuringly unlikely as androids dreaming of electric sheep in a nuclear irradiated San Francisco. Paolo Bacigalupis 2015 cli-fi novel The Water Knife, for example, is set in a drought-ravaged Southwestern United States, where the four-corner states are at war over water. Planetary futurists (and maybe even a few climate scientists) might not think such a scenario entirely out of the realm of possibility, but the average reader could find great literary pleasure in the read without having his or her existential buttons pushed (too hard). Kim Stanley Robinsons recently published novel New York: 2140, an optimistic look at a Manhattan flooded by sea level rise, offers the reader a temporal buffer in the title itself. Plus, the water taxis are nifty and theres underwater treasure in the Bronx.
But look at what has happened with Margaret Atwoods The Handmaids Tale this year. Though it is not about climate change, it is speculative, and it is, perhaps, defining the cultural zeitgeist now. One reason for this, I believe, is that its so-called dystopian plot has, in the minds of many, left the realm of allegory; it now has a documentary feel to it. As we read Atwoods novel, or as we watch the television adaptation, we are both compelled and repulsedsome, like me, are beset by a feeling of the uncanny, which, as Jacques Lacan once wrote, makes it difficult for us to suss out bad and good, pleasure from displeasure.
Contemporary fiction
I find myself wondering if this where cli-fi as a genre is heading Will Bacigalupis state water wars soon have the feel of contemporary fiction What about Barbara Kingsolvers climate-ravaged monarchs in Flight Behavior Robinsons sunken Manhattan Or will we remain firmly entrenched in what Amitav Ghosh has termed The Great Derangement, an era of willful ignorance disguised as self-awareness (or, as I might put it, the lack of intestinal fortitude many of us experience when asked to frankly consider the profound danger climate change poses to our existence).
In a recent Burning Worlds column in the Chicago Review of Books, for which I was interviewed to discuss my recent novel South Pole Station, which features a climate-change denying scientist, Amy Brady wrote that for many years, cli-fi has concerned itself with tropes: post-apocalyptic worlds, non-human (or once-human) characters, and futuristic technology. What would happen, Brady asks, if cli-fi writers turned their attentions to the here-and-now, in worlds that arent speculative or futuristic at all, but rather unnervingly familiar
As a novelist who writes climate change into her fiction, I think this idea may be the key to helping writers emerge from their Great Derangement, where cli-fi is, in the words of writer Siddhartha Deb, concerned with what is considered the fluky and the exceptional.
I call it First Impact Fiction.
Runaway climate
First Impact is the term Ive been using in my fiction to describe our shared world as the impacts of runaway climate change begin to make themselves known. There are widespread heat waves and droughtsbut the cavernous Vegas casinos are still allowed to air condition their Parthenon-sized poker rooms. Sunny day flooding events happen ever more frequently in coastal citiesbut no floodplains or beach-adjacent neighborhoods have yet been forcibly cleared of homes.
Funky bird migration patterns have begun to emergethe scarlet tanager is spending way too much time in the Jersey Pine Barrensbut there are no South American macaws at Connecticut birdfeeders yet. Twentysomethings are grappling with the ethical dilemma of whether to bring children into a world that is quickly becoming more and more difficult to inhabit comfortably, but the Offspring Cap-and-Trade beta program has not yet been launched in Park Slope.
This is the middle ground, then: a look at what the transitional existence might look like once the climate impacts that are imminent hit us. It wont be catastrophic, except by degrees. - Lit Hub

No monkeying around
It looks like any other traditional-style Japanese sake-house but Kayabukiya Tavern is one with a difference. What sets this restaurant on the modest premises in Utsonumiya different from others is that over here, human waiters have been replaced by Macaque monkeys.
While the original Mazaque waiter of the place was Yat-chan, seventeen year olf Fuku-chan was ushered into waiting table after she delivered a napkin to a table unprompted. The restaurant owner Kaoru Otsuka then decided to pair the two and now people from all corners of the world come to be served the monkeys.
Fuku-chan can usually be seen dressed in a chequered waiters shirt and skirt, bringing guests beer and fetching napkins for diners.
If Fuku-chan and Yat-chan do a good job patrons are encouraged to leave them tip of soya beans. The owner Otsuka says that the monkeys are closer to him than his own family and he even sleeps with them around. Monkeys have been working at the bar for some 29 years. ANI

Nosy nose troubles
Your nose lets you smell and it is a big part of why you are able to taste things. The nose is also the main gate to the respiratory system, your bodys system for breathing. Consultant ENT Surgeon, Dr. Ms. Chandra Jayasuriya (MBBS Colombo), D.L.O.M.S (Otolaryngology), FRCS (Edin) the Head of the ENT Unit of the Colombo National Hospital speaks about some common issues related to nose. These are issues we face in our daily life and here are some possible solutions / treatments for such issues.
Q : What can be done if a child has something stuck in the nose
A: There is a high risk of a foreign object being pushed further into (up) the nose if you attempt to remove it. Consult an ENT surgeon as soon as possible. A failed attempt by an inexperienced doctor at removing the foreign object may also frighten the child. A powerful light source and special instruments are required. Harmless instruments like a steel ring should be used to remove this instead of forceps. The child should be held tightly and it is important to remove the object successfully at the first attempt.
An object which is stuck inside at the back of the nose should be removed under anesthesia. After inserting a tube into the windpipe, the object will be pushed to the throat (food passage), the mouth will be opened using a mouth gag, and the object will be taken out. Since the tube is being inserted into the trachea (windpipe) for anesthesia, there is no chance of the object entering it.
If the child has put something inside the nose without an adult being aware of it, a bad smell may emanate with a discharge due to the foreign object.
Q: What are the other reasons that cause bad smell from your nose
A: There are several reasons for this condition. Nasal stones formation (they can form spontaneously), catarrh leading to scab formation in the nose (atrophic rhinitis), catarrh leading to stagnated phlegm in the sinuses (sinusitis), teeth infection (specially the back teeth of the upper jaw spreading into nasal sinuses leading to sinusitis), cancer in the nose and catarrh experienced for an extended period of time may cause a dysfunction in the nerve that helps you sense scents. The nerve may be destroyed preventing the person from detecting any smell from your own nose. It is advisable to consult an ENT surgeon to treat the above nasal conditions.
Q : How does a person fail to smell anything when there is a dysfunction
A: Nerves responsible for detecting scents are situated in the upper part of the nose. Evaporative chemicals travel up the nose and dissolve in the mucous coating the nerve. These messages travel up the short nerves and are sent to the frontal lobe of the brain which will recognize the various smells.
There are several possible reasons for dysfunction of this nerve. Nasal blockage due to various reasons disturbing the evaporative chemicals reaching the smell receptor nerve can be one of the main causes. Blockages are caused by nasal growths, polyps, catarrh, cancer, common cold. Sensory nerves can also be destroyed due to head trauma, viral infection of nose (common cold), brain cancers and certain medicines or for no obvious reason. An ENT surgeon can treat some of these conditions.
Growths (polyps) can be removed surgically while catarrh will be treated with medications. If a head injury leads to nerve or brain damage, the condition could be permanent. Such persons may fall into dangers by not detecting gas leaks, stale food etc.

Pain no gain as Bolt and Farah's farewell party falls flat
LONDON, Saturday  Athletics legends Usain Bolt and Mo Farah experienced some of their greatest moments in their careers at the 2012 Olympics in London but five years on and back in the same stadium, misery replaced joy on Saturday.
Bolt, who won the individual 100 and 200m and the 4x100m relay in London in 2012, collapsed to the track injured anchoring the Jamaica 4x100 metres relay team.
Jamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered from cramp in his left hamstring.
But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race, Jones said.
The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.
The organisers brought on a wheelchair but Bolt shrugged them aside and he limped across the line, grimacing.
Jamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod and relay team-mate said nothing had changed with regard to the reputation of Bolt.
Usain Bolt's name will always live on, he said.
Briton Farah, who had won the first of his four global double doubles of 5,000m and 10,000m to deafening cheers in London in 2012, put up a spirited and courageous effort but for the first time in six years of global championship competition he had to settle for silver behind Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.
Farah, who started the championships in grand style by winning the 10,000m, had been left by Edris as the bell went and as hard as he tried he just didn't quite have the legs to pass his younger rival in the finishing straight.
It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible, said Farah who was embraced by his fans as he made his way around the stadium on a lap of honour, stopping to sign autographs and pose for selfies'.
It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it.
The despair and disappointment of Bolt and Farah was in stark contrast to another hero from 2012 -- Australia's 100m hurdling great Sally Pearson.
The 30-year-old's grit and determination to come back from two years of injury hell -- she feared that she would have to have her hand amputated when she suffered a bone explosion in her wrist in 2015 -- was rewarded with her second world title.
The Australian celebrated in exuberant style, her mouth spread in a broad grin as she charged to the stands.
She tried to find her English mother Anne McLellan -- who had taken two jobs when she was raising her daughter as a single parent so she could go to training and achieve her dream -- and husband, childhood sweetheart Kieran but without success.
Far out, that was bloody hard, gasped Pearson.
It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal.
Bolt's dramatic failure to medal permitted American great Allyson Felix to sit on top of the overall career world medals table with 15 after she was part of the women's 4x100m relay gold-winning team.
The Americans had to fight hard to edge out the British team but in Bolt's relay it was the reverse as the host nation pulled off an impressive but shock win over the United States -- for whom 100m world champion two-time drugs cheat Justin Gatlin was booed by large sections of the stadium as he had been in the 100m even after he won the gold.
Elsewhere there was a gold for Russian Maria Lasitskene, competing as a neutral, who defended the women's high jump title and extended her winning streak to 25. It was the first gold for Russian athletes competing at the championships but whose federation are still banned due to the doping scandal that affected all sports in the country. - AFP

Pakistan celebrates 70th Independence Day

Pakistan today hoisted the largest flag in the its history at Attari-Wagah border near Lahore to mark the countrys 70th Independence Day. Pakistan Army Chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa hoisted the flag at the border at 12 in the midnight, kicking off the festivities of Independence Day across the country. The flag is also reported to be the highest one in South Asia and the 8th highest in the world.
Made in Pakistan, it is 400-feet high and 120 feet by 80 feet in size. Speaking on the occasion, Gen. Bajwa said: Some 77 years ago, Pakistan resolution was passed in the same city (Lahore). Pakistan came into being on the night of 27th Ramadan  it was a blessed night.
Today, the country is progressing on the path of the law and the constitution. All institutions are working properly. We will make Pakistan the country of Quaid-e-Azam and Allama Iqbal.
Bajwa further said, We have rendered many sacrifices -we will never forget our martyrs. We will execute each and every terrorist in Pakistan. I want to tell our enemies, whether they are in the east or in the west, that your bullets will end but not the chests of our jawans [soldiers].
Acknowledging Pakistans internal and external challenges Gen. Bajwa said, I assure you that we will never let you down. Any power that will aim to weaken Pakistan, the Army and all other institutions will foil their attempts. Other speakers also paid rich tributes to those killed during migration to Pakistan.

Police detect 38,875 kgs of narcotics in 2016
The Police have seized 38,875 Kgs of narcotics in 2016, the Sri Lanka Police Performance report for the year 2016 stated.
The report, which was tabled in Parliament last week, stated that this quantity was three times greater than the quantity apprehended in 2015.
A total of 88,352 offenses related to intoxicants were reported last year, and the Police were able to solve 98 percent of those cases.
Year 2016 can be recognised as a year in which dangerous intoxicant drugs had been seized on a large scale. The continuous support of Special Task Force was one main factor to make these raids successful, the report stated.
Among the intoxicants raided were Ganja, Opium, Hashish, Heroin, Morphine and Cocaine. As per the statistics in the report, the Police had seized 36,817 Kgs of Ganja, 1,302 Kgs of Cocaine, 205 Kgs of Heroin, 27 Kgs of Hashish, 15 Kgs of Opium and 74 grams of Morphine .
The Police STF had conducted 601 successful raids related to illicit liquor and narcotics last year and arrested 651 persons.
A total of 120,105 offenses related to illicit liquor had also been reported last year, indicating an increase of 6,161 compared to 2015.
Moreover, the Performance report 2016 stated that 36,937 grave crimes have been reported in the country last year, and compared to 2015 it was a reduction by 3,251.
Crime solving percentage has been increased due to the usage of modern crime prevention methods. This had been 59 percent in the year 2015 and increased to 73 percent in the year 2016, the report analyzed.
According to the report, minor offenses against people and property have increased from 73,955 in 2015 to 78,928 in 2016. Crimes against children and women stood at 14,751 and the figure shows a marginal increase compared to 2015.

POLICE FORM HIGH-POWERED BODY TO BATTLE DRUGS, UNDERWORLD
The Police have established a high-powered body, the Organised Crimes and Narcotic Range to launch comprehensive operations against the drug menace and the underworld, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
The new body will operationally combine the Police Special Task Force, the Narcotics Bureau and the Organised Crimes Unit.
Senior DIG M.R Latheef will head the unit and he will work closely with heads of the three divisions to conduct raids and operations.
The new Range will also draw on the support of key bodies including the Sri Lanka Navy and the Customs Department to battle the drug menace.
The new Range is entrusted with the task of nabbing every party involved in the drug trade. It will not only go after the minnows in the drug trade, but also net the big fish, the Minister told the Daily News.
To achieve this task, the new Range has been given a strong mandate, which includes gathering intelligence information, making necessary decisions without delay, executing operations on the ground and apprehending culprits.
Drug trafficking is not only associated with violence and organised crime; it is, in many parts of the world, linked to terrorist activities as well. It is also linked to criminal activities such as money laundering, arms and human trafficking, and corruption. Dismantling this entire network is a daunting task and I believe the Sri Lankan Police, with the leadership of IGP Pujith Jayasundara, will eradicate this problem and rescue our country from the drug menace, he added.
The first successful operation of this unit took place in Kurana, Negombo on Saturday evening (12), where the STF launched a raid on a criminal gang heavily involved in the drug trade, robberies and other serious crimes. The gang opened fire at the STF from a van and the officers successfully countered the attack. Although two suspects were injured in the shootout,
the STF nabbed two gangsters on the spot and took a cache of arms into custody. Upon further questioning, it was revealed that they were all connected to a larger criminal network operating with strong underworld connections.

Premier promises to renovate Ran Viyana of Dalada Maligawa
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would take steps to renovate the Kandy Sri Dalada Maligawa 'Ran Viyana' (Golden Canopy) with the approval and advice of the Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates.
He was attending a religious observance held at the Sri Dalada Maligawa yesterday to mark the completion of his 40 years of political life.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the 'Ran Viyana' gifted by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was a little worn off and needing repairs. So he hoped to repair the facility soon with the advice of the two Mahananayke Theras.
It is significant that the 'Ran Viyana' damaged during the LTTE bomb attack on the Maligawa was repaired in 2001 during the time of Ranil Wickremesinghe's premiership.
He said the Sri Lanka government had promised a donation of one million US dollars to the Government of Nepal towards archeological excavations carried out in Lumbini and Kapilwastu, the two important Buddhist citadels.
After paying homage to the Sacred Tooth Relics and receiving blessings, the Prime Minister met the people who crowded round the Sri Dalada Maligawa and interacted with them. He promised to usher in a massive development programme in the Kandy city shortly.
When some people in the crowed asked the Prime Minister about delay in bringing corrupt figures in the previous regime to book, the Prime Minister said no one would be able to escape from the law because the legal activities regarding 80 incidents of fraud and corruption were now being finalised. He said work on the Colombo-Kandy Expressway would be completed soon.

Proparco (AFD Group) grants 20 mn loan to DFCC Bank
Reaffirming its credentials as a preferred partner for international credit lines, DFCC Bank has been granted a long term loan of 20 million by Proparco, a subsidiary of Agence Franaise de Dveloppement (AFD).
This organisation is devoted to private sector financing, to finance renewable energy projects and improve access to credit for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka. DFCC Bank has decades of experience in promoting development finance among the SME sector in the country, with an established record of a successful foray into the renewable energy sector.
Commenting on the new partnership Grgory Clemente, CEO of Proparco said, We are pleased to partner with DFCC Bank to strengthen the SME sector in Sri Lanka. SMEs account for 70% of all businesses, employ 26% of the active population and contribute 52% of GDP, which makes them a critical growth engine in the island. We believe that strengthening this sector represents a key growth opportunity, in line with the vision of the Sri Lankan Government which recently stressed the major role of banks in SME finance. DFCC will be able to use this 20 million loan to boost the proportion of SMEs in its portfolio, which already stands at nearly 50%. We are also pleased to support a Bank that is already active in financing renewable energy.
DFCC CEO Arjun Fernando added, DFCC Bank is pleased to be selected as the disbursement partner for Proparco, a reputed development finance body in the world. DFCC Bank is a pioneer in supporting renewable energy projects, having supported the first hydro project in 1996. Since then, we have supported many large scale renewable energy projects including wind and solar energy. As Sri Lankas pioneering development bank, DFCC has had extensive experience in financing renewable energy projects in the past and as a fully-fledged commercial bank today, we are well poised to empower more of such projects which will create greater energy security for the nation. We are proud of our past record in standing by SMEs in their early and risky stages, enabling them to eventually to become big names in their respective sectors today. The Bank also adds significant value by offering entrepreneurship training programmes and other technical and marketing support to SMEs. Long-term finance of this magnitude is difficult to obtain in the domestic market, and we believe the credit line by Proparco will empower us to propel the SME sector to the next stage of development.
DFCC Bank financed Sri Lankas first hydro power project back in 1996, the countrys first wind farm in 2010 and its first solar power plant in 2015. The bank is currently providing funding for 70 hydro power projects, 3 wind farms and 2 solar energy projects as well as a biomass project.

Ray of hope in Ravi K. saga
The Ravi Karunanayake saga has set off a chain of events that could see cases against members of the Rajapaksa regime, against whom there are serious allegations, expedited, and the wrong doers exposed. The Joint Opposition is clearly exulting in having succeeded in deflecting attention from the charges against their own members, by way of the alleged Bond scam. The resignation of Ravi Karunanayake too have given their campaign a fillip and egged them on to go all out to discredit the government. Not content with having Ravi K. removed, JO members such as Udaya Gammanpila are making a song and dance demanding that the Commission go the whole hog and expose the others involved in the episode. The fallout from the Ravi K. drama has given the worst culprits in the JO an opportunity to paint themselves as paragons of virtue. These members are hosting press conferences on a daily basis to hammer out on the subject and getting scribes from certain media to bowl full tosses in the form of slanted questions so that they could give the appropriate answers showing the government in poor light.
In a way, although Ravi K., rightly or wrongly, could consider himself a sacrificial lamb, his predicament has now given rise for investigations to be carried out in earnest against the Rajapaksas. The UNP wants a similar Presidential Commission to be appointed to probe the deeds under the Rajapaksa regime. UNP parliamentarians are naturally sore that one of their own members had been subject to much harassment when in fact the guns should be trained elsewhere. They are also not enamoured by the manner in which personnel of the Attorney Generals department subjected Ravi K. to a virtual inquisition although it is a great plus for the government in that its esteem may have risen among the public for having one of its own members subjected to such intense questioning, poor consolation though this might be for the UNPers. They naturally would ask what became of the charges against the Rajapaksas and what action has the AGs department taken in this regard. This is particularly in the light of the revelation made by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne that as much as 84 files pertaining to members of the Rajapaksa government were gathering dust at the AGs department. There is also the public opinion to consider.
Hitherto, the public has been left wondering as to what became of the allegations leveled against the Rakapaksa regime on mega corruption. This is in the light of allegations of cover-ups, with the finger being pointed at the Attorney Generals department. Worse, there are charges of collusion within the government to let the Rajapaksas off the hook, with the finger pointed at a minister, no less.
However the Ravi Karunanayake episode has now precipitated action against the financial scams under the Rajapaksa regime. The zeal with which the Attorney Generals department went about its business of subjecting the former Minister to intense grilling has clearly angered the UNP. But it has also galvanized its members to demand a similar roasting of the wrong doers of the former government. They have even called for special courts to try the swindlers. Their agitation cannot be faulted. The main plank of the Yahapalanaya platform was to bring to book all the rogues and crooks of the Rajapaksa regime. But what is happening instead is a scenario where the hunter has become the hunted. It must be galling for the UNP that those with serious allegations and court cases pending against them are today shouting horse over the Bond scam, in an obvious attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public. This is why the UNP wants investigations against the JO members, including Rajapaksa, be expedited.
Addressing the media, UNP firebrand Nalin Bandara has demanded that former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal too be summoned before the Commission together with the former President. The members ire is understandable. There were serious allegations against the former CB Governor, not least of which is that his sister had been a director in the company now embroiled in the alleged Bond scam. Cabraal was also responsible for the Greek Bond fiasco that put the country in a massive financial hole. It is on his directives that millions of dollars was paid to PR firms in the USA to promote the image of Sri Lanka when there was a paid ambassador to perform the task. It was under Cabraals watch that the hedging deal was entered into that cost the country dearly and it is he who was in the forefront to promote Hambantota as a venue for the Commonwealth Games, undertaking a trip to the Caribbean, with sportsmen and starlets in tow, at massive cost. The UNPers are naturally angry as to why such colossal financial losses were allowed to go unanswered when one of their own is being put through the mill by counsel of the Attorney Generals Department assisting the Commission set up by their own government.

Resurgent Federer advances to Montreal final
MONTREAL: Swiss superstar Roger Federer turned in a precision performance Saturday at the ATP Montreal tennis, using thundering serves and clever backhands to defeat unseeded Robin Haase for a spot in the final.
The 36-year-old Federer blasted nine aces and lost just nine points on his serve as he extended his match win streak to 16 -- his longest win streak in five years. He raised his game to another level when it mattered most, beating Netherlands Robin Haase 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) in just 75 minutes.
I'm very excited to be back in the finals, Federer said. A bit surprising, to be quite honest, because I hadn't practiced much. Federer has taken more time off this year than usual. He skipped the clay-court season from April to mid-June. - AFP

Right key to sustainable development
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, are a universal call to action to end poverty, to protect the planet and to ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs, officially known as Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are a set of seventeen aspirational Global Goals with 169 targets and 244 indicators between them to be achieved by April 2030. The SDGs were born at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.
The SDGs will guide policy and funding for the next 15 years. The 2030 agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity, strengthening peace and requiring partnership for implementation. These five elements of sustainable development are all interconnected. The SDGs focus on new areas such as economic inequality, innovation, climate change, sustainable consumption, peace and justice - among others. The SDGs are universal, inclusive and a bold commitment to people and the planet. As in many other countries, Sri Lanka too, in its development agendas is now focusing on Sustainable Development Goals and how it will improve lives while protecting the planet over the next fifteen years.
The commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) is reflected in having a separate ministry on Sustainable Development, appointing a Parliament Select Committee on SDGs, and establishing cluster committees on SDGs etc. The GOSL anticipates achieving the SDGs by 2030 by working towards the provision of basic needs of the people, progressive alleviation of poverty, elimination of all forms of discrimination and inequalities, and establishing a society based on social justice and human security. The Economic Policy of the Government outlines the vision setting the stage for a sustainable development journey. The Policy aims to develop an economy that will promote the benefits of development among all. An economy that will be friendly to all, beneficial to all. An economy that will pave the way for sustainable development.
The SDGs represent a people-driven transformative agenda built on the foundations of transparency, participation and inclusion. Achieving the SDGs will depend, among others, on the degree of ownership and engagement of people in addressing them. The SDGs matter to all of us as we have a shared responsibility for our future and that of our planet.
National Statistical System
Without clear goals and measurable targets, as well as comprehensive data sets that allow analyzing the situation, including at the local level, we risk leaving the most vulnerable behind and not properly addressing new challenges that impede development and harm our planet. This publication emphasizes the need of institutions other than DCS getting involved with producing data for SDG indicators. In Sri Lanka, What we have is a National Statistical System (NSS). The NSS consists of all statistics-producing entities functioning under the direct responsibility of the government of a country.
The NSS typically consists of the National Statistical Office (NSO) and any other institutions and administrations that produce official statistics. An effective and efficient NSS that provides regular and reliable data is an important indicator of good policies and is a crucial component of good governance.
The SDG indicators not only require data on areas of enquiry that NSSs have not traditionally produced, they also demand new levels of disaggregation to ensure that we leave No One Behind. What is becoming clear moreover is that the traditional NSS cannot produce all of the data required alone and new actors such as other Departments and Ministries and private sector organisations must now be engaged with and thought of as part of a wider data ecosystem.
In this publication, all 244 SDG indicators are classified according to DCS tier system. To facilitate the implementation of the global indicator framework, all indicators are classified into three tiers on the basis of their level of methodological development and the availability of data at the global level, as Tier 1: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant; Tier 2: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries and Tier 3: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested. The availability of data for indicators at the national level in Sri Lanka, is not necessarily aligned with the global tier classification and therefore, DCS created its own tier classification for implementation.
Baseline data
Production of accessible, timely, and reliable disaggregated data, and building statistical capacity are essential steps in the process of achieving SDGs. Preparing a publication on the availability of data for SDG indicators is an important endeavour to facilitate establishment of baseline data, monitoring the progress, and reporting the achievements of SDG targets.
The United Nations General Assembly has recognized that baseline data for several of the targets remain unavailable, and called for increased support towards strengthening data collection and capacity building for Member States, to develop national and global baselines where they are non-existent. They committed to addressing this gap in data collection so as to better inform the measurement of progress, particularly for unclear numerical targets.
In Sri Lanka, out of 244 indicators, data are already compiled for 46 indicators through ongoing censuses and surveys conducted by the DCS. The DCS could compile data on 29 indicators by adding new modules into ongoing censuses and surveys. Other institutions of the NSS including various ministries, departments and other institutions need to give leadership in compiling data for some SDG indicators. This publication titled Status of Sustainable Development Goals Indicators in Sri Lanka: 2017 presents baseline data and details on the availability of data on SDG Indicators through statistical activities of the DCS. Baseline data including year, unit, value, source and frequency of updating for all 46 SDG indicators already produced by the DCS are included in this report.
The cross cutting issue of data disaggregation
Underpinned by the commitment to Leave No One Behind, the Inter Agency Expert Group on the Sustainable Development Goals has stated that indicators should be disaggregated, where relevant, by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, and geographic location, or other characteristics, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Statistics. Data disaggregation is critical because aggregate level data do not show discrepancies at lower levels. DCS will arrange to disaggregate all its statistics into above levels as much as possible to ensure that Sri Lanka will not leave anyone behind in its march towards 2030 agenda. DCS has launched a website carrying all information discussed here (baseline data, indicator framework etc.) and it can be reached through its website www.statistics.gov.lk.

Scientists finally know how birds get their colour
There are about 18,000 bird species on Earth, and every species is differently coloured.
While some birds are so bright in colour, one can spot them from afar, some are coloured so as to camouflage- youll never realise if youre even looking at the bird! The feathers are composed of intricate combinations of mottles, scales, bars, and spots, making each one unique.
It has already been discovered that different patterns and colours help camouflage the birds from predators, but have you ever wondered how they get such different colours
Dr. Ismael Galvan and his team of expert researchers conducted a study on about 9000 bird species plumage coloration to answer the very question.
Two types of pigments are responsible for the pumage coloration: melanins, which produce a range of black, grey, brown, and orange colors, and carotenoids, which are used by specialized feather structures to generate brighter color hues.

Former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa and her second son Yoshitha Rajapaksa will appear before the CID tomorrow.
CID sources speaking to Daily News said they have been summoned with regard to a jeep owned by the Siriliya Saviya Foundation.
The jeep was donated to the Foundation by the Red Cross.
Summons had been previously sent to the two members of the Rajapaksa family on 27-28 July but both failed to show up citing various health reasons.
It has been reported that the jeep in question had been used in the abduction and murder of rugby player, Wasim Thajudeen in 2007.
Questioning now has been directed to find out whether Shiranthi Rajapaksa knew of the incident and whether Yoshitha had used the jeep on that fateful night.
Thajudeen who met with a deadly car crash was first deemed to have been an accident but was later proven to have been tortured and murdered.

SLs economy continues  to stabilize - IMF
Sri Lankan economy which showed signs of stabilization in 2016 has continued that trend in 2017, the IMF said.
Sri Lankas overall fiscal deficit decreased from 7 percent to 5.4 percent of GDP between 2015 and 2016, with public finances strengthening under an IMF supported program, the IMF country report said. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) played an important role in helping the authorities to achieve this progress, particularly in implementing reforms and strengthening macroeconomic stability, while strengthening much needed investor confidence.
The IMF Executive Board also expressed optimism that the new Inland Revenue Act will support fiscal consolidation, make the tax system more efficient and equitable, and generate resources for social and development programs.
Further accumulating international reserves and enhancing exchange rate flexibility will help reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerability.
Sri Lankas overall fiscal deficit decreased from 7 to 5.4 percent of GDP between 2015 and 2016, underpinned by a 2 percent-of-GDP reduction in the primary deficit.
The tax-to-GDP ratio remained unchanged at 12.4 percent in 2016 as one-off revenue increases in 2015 were replaced by buoyant tax collections. Public debt rose from 82 to 84 percent of GDP between 2015 and 2016 largely due to exchange rate depreciation and an increase in guaranteed debt IMF Executive Board had completed the second review of Sri Lankas EFF arrangement on July 17, which enabled the disbursement of US$ 167.2 million to Lanka bringing the total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 359.682 million (about US$ 501.5 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board granted a waiver of nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion on accumulation of external arrears which was missed due to continued difficulties of establishing a payment platform and waivers of applicability of the performance criteria for end-June 2017 on floor of the central government primary balance and the program net official international reserves of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, given the unavailability of the information necessary to assess observance.
The governments reform program, supported by the IMF, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, rebuild foreign exchange reserves, and introduce a simpler, more equitable tax system to restore macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive growth.

SLs macroeconomic, financial conditions  stable - Furusawa
Sri Lankas performance under the Fund-supported program has been broadly satisfactory.
Macroeconomic and financial conditions have been stable, despite severe weather events and global market volatility, said Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Acting Chair and Deputy Managing Director, Executive Board IMF.
The authorities have launched fundamental income tax reform, undertook meaningful corrective actions to achieve program targets on international reserves, and remain committed to the reform program. Going forward, the reform momentum should strengthen further with greater ownership, building on the progress made so far.
Fiscal performance has been strong. Targets for the fiscal balance and tax revenue have been met. The new Inland Revenue Act, which has been submitted to parliament, will support fiscal consolidation, make the tax system more efficient and equitable, and generate resources for social and development programs.
Nevertheless, Sri Lankas high debt burden and gross financing needs require further revenue-based consolidation. Timely progress in structural reforms, including tax administration and energy pricing, will strengthen the platform for durable consolidation.
Inflation and credit growth remain on the high side. While monetary policy was tightened in March, further tightening is desirable until clear signs emerge that inflation pressures and credit expansion have subsided. While financial soundness indicators remain stable, banks capital adequacy ratio has declined due to rapid credit growth.
Financial sector supervision should be strengthened, and macro-prudential measures could be deployed to rein in credit growth if needed. Continued international reserves accumulation and enhanced exchange rate flexibility to which the authorities are committed, would reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerabilities, he said.

The Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) commenced its National Diploma in Politics and Political Leadership program yesterday.
Civil activists, government officers, police officers and civilians interested in a career in politics have enrolled in the course, which chiefly aims to provide political literacy and an ethical approach to succeeding at elections.
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa said popular politics has had an adverse effect on Sri Lankan politics. He said communal politics have worsened the status.When British left us, they imposed a system on us where parliamentarians elected on the basis of ethnicity. We are still suffering from this division. Sri Lanka must overcome communal politics and promote a nationalistic political approach, he said. National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganesan said parliamentarians should at least be able to communicate verbally in both national languages. We cannot develop this country with a gap in communication. he said.
Minister Ganesan further said understanding different people and their mindset is important when taking political decisions.
Minister Ganesan further said devolution of power is crucial within an undivided country. I am not talking just about North. Power should be distributed to all villages despite where they are located within the country. We do not have a monarch here Ganesan added.
Sri Lanka Foundation Institute Chairman Sarath Kongahage said the program aims to provide sophisticated understanding of political science and the political system of Sri Lanka for producing an active political being with a better awareness and to produce political leaders with great leadership skills and political literacy.
Kongahage requested the government to release lands owned by the Sri Lanka Foundation to extend the premises.

Slick Britain win shock 4x100 relay gold
LONDON, Saturday: Usain Bolt's final track appearance ended with pain and frustration on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4x100 metres relay as Britain stunned the United States to win a shock gold medal.
Bolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive world relay title but they were struggling in a distant third place when he collected the baton.
As he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor midway down the home straight with what was later described as cramp in his left hamstring.
However, the 60,000 in the stadium who had come to mark the farewell of sport's greatest showman had only a split second to absorb what was happening as up ahead history was being made by the host nation.
The United States, with individual 100m gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way but they were always trailing the slick Britons.
Brilliantly executed exchanges by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record and European record and securing the world title for the first time.
I wasn't sure if I had won or not, I gave it my all but I could see Christian Coleman out of the corner of my eye, said Mitchell-Blake.
The feeling of euphoria was from infinity. I can't register it. We smashed the British record to pieces.
Five years ago Talbot and the 18-year-old Gemili messed up a changeover as Britain were disqualified in the semi-finals of their own Olympics on the same London track so it was a particularly sweet moment for the two.
To run it with Danny Talbot after such disappointment in London 2012, it is so special to come back, said Gemili, who was not selected for the individual races and missed an Olympic 200m bronze by three thousandths of a second last year.
It's crazy. Honestly a dream and a reality tonight.
Britain's only other men's global sprint relay golds came in the 1912 and 2004 Olympics while their winning time that beat their 1999 best of 37.73 has only been bettered by Jamaica and the U.S.
It completed a great night for the host nation's sprinters after their women had earlier taken silver behind the Americans in the sprint relay, their best performance since the first championships in 1983.
The U.S. men took silver in 37.52 but for a nation that used to be totally dominant in the event, it was only their second medal in the last eight global finals after a series of world and Olympic disqualifications.
After DQs in recent years we knew we had to get the baton round and to finish the night smoothly is a fantastic achievement and we'll enjoy our moment on the podium, said Gatlin.
The Brits had a hell of a race. You can't take it from them. They had the pressure of running on home soil and they delivered.
On his old rival Bolt he said: This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now.
Japan took advantage of Jamaica's travails to take third in 38.04, just holding off China (38.34). - Agencies

Sri Lanka wilt under Pandya blitz
T20 specialist Hardik Pandya played an extraordinary innings of controlled hitting to score his maiden century in any format and place India in a strong position to push for a 3-0 whitewash of the three-match series against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
Pandyas blazing knock of 108 off 96 balls saw India recover from 339-7 to 487 all out. By stumps Sri Lanka shot out for 135 in their first innings and forced to follow-on 352 runs in arrears for the second successive Test ended the second day on 19 for the loss of Upul Tharangas wicket to trail by 333 runs with three days of play left. Dimuth Karunaratne was unbeaten on 12 and nightwatchman Malinda Pushpakumara on nought.
It was another pathetic display of batting by Sri Lanka on a second day pitch where Indias last three wickets had added 168 runs. Their batting was first undone by Mohammad Shami who ripped through in his opening spell to disperse the two openers Karunaratne (4) and Tharanga (5) for 23. Tharanga in fact wasted a review when he got an edge to the wicket-keeper but before asking for a review he first had a chat with his partner Karunaratne, which was weird.
Kusal Mendis who looked in good touch ran himself out at 18 and from then onwards it was a series of poor shot selections that led to the dismissals. Mathews collected his second duck of his career (121 innings), Dickwella played with his usual flair scoring 29 off 31 balls before giving the charge to left-arm spinner Kuldip Yadav and being stumped yards down the track. Yadav also accounted for Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara and Vishwa Fernando to end with career best figures of 4 for 40 in 13 overs in only his second Test.
Pandyas amazing innings clearly shifted the balance heavily in Indias favour. Without a first-class or one-day hundred behind him Pandya who came to bat at number eight blazed his way to a century off 86 balls that included seven sixes and seven fours, his second fifty required only 25 balls. In that second phase he slammed six sixes and two fours that included 26 runs off a Malinda Pushpakumara over  the third most scored off one over in Test cricket. The left-arm spinner was punished for two fours and three sixes in his 23rd over as Pandya ran riot after Indias ninth wicket had fallen for 421.
Until that time he had played a decent knock building up useful partnerships of 62 with Umesh Yadav (26) and 20 with Mohammad Shami (8). It was pure clean hitting and all his shots were so powerfully struck that it cleared the boundary line with ease.
During Pandyas onslaught it was difficult to fathom the tactics of Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal who was found wanting in his captaincy skills. He allowed Pandya to retain the strike shielding last man Umesh Yadav without bringing the field in towards the end of the over on several occasions. And then again when paceman Lahiru Kumara was bowling at Pandya he had nine men patrolling the boundary line without a single catcher in position for the edge. It was unbelievably poor captaincy that allowed Pandya to dominate.
Another sore point was under bowling Dilruwan Perera who delivered only eight overs in the entire Indian innings of 122.3 overs - strange tactics this. He did not get a bowl at all yesterday with Chandimal sticking to his other two spinners Lakshan Sandakan and Pushpakumara.
It was Sandakan who finally ended Pandyas superb innings when he had him caught by Perera at deep cover trying another big hit - off the third ball after the lunch break that brought the Indian innings to a close.
Sandakan picked up his first five-for in a Test innings with figures of 5 for 132. He claimed three of the last four Indian wickets to fall yesterday for 48 runs in a 10.3 over spell. Pushpakumara failed to add to his tally of three and ended with his figures spoilt by Pandyas assault conceding 82 runs.
Indias Hartik Pandiya celebrates his century off 86 balls on the second day of the third and finalTest against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.

Tea, rubber, coconut still have great demand in international market
Sri Lankas traditional exports - tea, rubber and coconut - still have a great demand in the international market and those who are involved in these three industries should be encouraged to increase the expected export target, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
Minister Dissanayake made these remarks at the inauguration of the three-day international Coconut, Rubber and Tea (CRT) exhibition and trade fair held at BMICH from August 11-13.
President Maithripala Sirisena opened the exhibition. A large number of locals and foreigners involved in these three industries were present.
The objective of holding the international exhibition was to facilitate local and international personnel involved in these three industries to meet and share knowledge and views and to learn about latest technology of each industrys operations.
Minister Dissanayake said that Sri Lankan tea, coconut and rubber should be positioned internationally as leading commodities despite some obstacles faced by cultivators and others involved in these industries.
The Minister also highlighted the production of high quality teas, especially the value added tea and said there is a great demand in China for our value added tea.
He said in addition, there is a good market for our rubber and coconut in China and our tea, rubber and coconut exports could be expanded after the signing of the Free Trade Agreement between Sri Lanka and China shortly.
The Minister also focused attention towards the coconut industry and said the prevailing drought conditions have become an obstacle to the industry and steps will be taken to revamp the industry to win the international market.
The Minister appealed to local participants who made their representation at the exhibition to take the message to their villages since the cultivators of these products are living in villages.
Speaking on rubber cultivation, the Minister said steps have already been taken to develop rubber lands by using latest technology to expand production.
He mentioned the encouragement extended by both the President and Prime Minister to develop these three industries and improve the income of cultivators.
President Sirisena and Minister Dissanayake visited several stalls at the exhibition and trade fair.
When Minister Dissanayake visited tea stalls, a leading tea exporter and the Tea Director of Euro Asia Company (Pvt) Ltd, Vajira Rajapaksa welcomed the Minister and explained the development of the tea industry. He said there is great demand for tea in countries such as China, Russia, Ukraine, USA as well as in several Middle Eastern and European countries.
Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd (ANCL) was the media sponsor for the event.

Twenty couples are alleged to have said I do twice over to defraud the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority and obtain compensation payments due to those who surrendered their lands to the Moragahakanda Resource project.
Police have launched investigations into this matter following a complaint made by the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority Matale S.P.T.B. Sugahtapala.
The Mahaweli Authority had complained that 20 couples had obtained compensation due to such families who lost their lands to the project by submitting pre-dated marriage certificates when they have been already married.
They had obtained these fraudulent marriage certificates with the connivance of certain marriage registrars.
Several marriage registrars who had aided and abetted this malpractice have been already identified and several police teams have been deployed to record statements from them.

Top US military official arrives South Korea amid North Korea tension

The US' top military official has landed in South Korea ahead of talks with the country's leader and US military amid rising tensions on the Korean peninsula.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph. Dunford arrived at Osan Air Base Monday, and is scheduled to meet with the leaders of US Forces Korea and South Korea President Moon Jae-in.
The looming threat of a North Korean missile strike on the US territory of Guam, and Pyongyang's increasing nuclear capabilities, have exacerbated tensions in the region.

"Gen. Dunford just arrived in Osan Air Base to meet with US Forces Korea leadership and explore the Camp Humphreys area with his team on board 2 UH-60 Black Hawks," a short statement on the Joint Staff Facebook page states. The trip has been long scheduled and was not arranged in response to the North Korean nuclear threat.

"The trip highlights our ironclad commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea in the face of North Korea's provocations and threats," the statement said.

Dunford prefaced his Asia trip with a trip to Hawaii to meet with US Pacific Command, and will visit also visit key ally Japan, as well as regional superpower China.

The three-country visit is in "support (of) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's diplomatic and economic campaign to deter North Korea" from seeking an effective nuclear deterrent, according to a US Department of Defense statement.

North Korean military figures are putting the final touches on aplan to fire four missilesinto the waters around the US territory of Guam, to be presented to leader Kim Jong Un within days.

In a statement last week, Gen. Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army, said the plan to fire "four Hwasong-12 intermediate-range strategic ballistic rockets ... to signal a crucial warning to the US" would be ready by "mid-August."

A notice put out by Guam's Joint Information Center Saturday warned residents how to prepare "for an imminent missile threat."

"Do not look at the flash or fireball -- it can blind you," the note said. "Lie flat on the ground and cover your head. If the explosion is some distance away, it could take 30 seconds or more for the blast wave to hit."

On Saturday, some of Japan's land-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile interceptors began arriving at Japanese Self Defense Forces (SDF) bases in three of the four prefectures any North Korean missiles would likely fly over en route to Guam.

Pyongyang identified three of those areas -- Shimane, Hiroshima and Kochi prefectures -- in its statement last week.

A spokesman for SDF said the missiles were being deployed not to intercept missiles, but rather "just in case." He did not elaborate.

Sim Tack, a senior analyst for private intelligence firm Stratfor, said the Japanese batteries are designed for protecting the area where they are deployed, "(they are) not meant to shoot missiles out of the sky as they pass over Japan at high altitude."

"So unless those North Korean missiles were to fall short, the Patriots shouldn't have a function to serve in this particular case," he said.

The SDF spokesman said the country'sAegis ballistic missile defense systemwas deployed in the waters between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, but would not give a specific location.

Aegis is able to track 100 missiles simultaneously and fire interceptors to take out an enemy's ballistic projectiles.

In South Korea, where both the military and civilians are used to facing threats from North Korea, Defense Minister Song Young-moo warned the country's armed forces "to maintain full readiness" to "immediately punish with powerful force" any action against the South.

"Recently, North Korea made its habitual absurd remarks that it will turn Seoul into a sea of fire and that it will strike near Guam," Song said according to ministry officials. "North Korea raising tension (on the Peninsula) is a serious challenge against the South Korean-US alliance and the international community."

US-South Korean joint military exercises are due to begin later this month. The annual exercises, called Ulchi-Freedom Guardian, are expected to run from August 21 to 31.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders have called for calmas both Pyongyang and Washington upped their saber-rattling rhetoric.

On Friday, US President Donald Trump doubled down on his statement that he would unleash "fire and fury like the world has never seen" if Pyongyang continued its threats, saying in a tweet that "military solutions" were "locked and loaded" for use against North Korea.

According to a statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xi told Trump in a call between the two leaders Saturday that all "relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel described escalation as "the wrong answer," while Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Trump's statements were "very worrying."

Last week, New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English criticized Trump's "fire and fury" comments as "not helpful in an environment that's very tense."

French President Emmanuel Macron called for the international community to work with North Korea to "resume the path of dialogue without conditions," following a call with Trump Saturday.

Washington has previously said it will consider talks with Pyongyang if it agrees to give up its nuclear weapons program, a precondition North Korean officials have described as a non-starter.

At a church in central Guam on Sunday, parishioners sang "Lord, we pray for world peace" after discussing the potential North Korean threat.

"There's a lot of disbelief going on, there's a lot of anxiety," Father Paul Gofigan told CNN after the mass.

Gofigan said there was not a lot of panic in Guam, and that people's faith -- the island has been overwhelmingly Catholic since the arrival of Spanish missionaries in the 17th century-- has been on display in recent days.

"Faith is so deeply rooted into our culture," he said.

The territory's governor, Eddie Baza Calvo, said he had spoken with Trump and the President's chief of staff, John Kelly, on Saturday.

"Both assured me that the people of Guam are safe," Calvo wrote on Facebook. "In the President's words they are behind us '1,000 percent.' As the head of the Government of Guam, I appreciate their reassurances that my family, my friends, everyone on this island, are all safe."

As an unincorporated US territory, citizens of Guam cannot vote in general elections.The island is also home to a large US military presence, a fact that has led to tension with some local residents, particularly those of the indigenous Chamorro community.

"Nobody really deserves to be caught in the middle of these games," said Victoria-Lola Leon Guerrero, an activist who campaigns for a lowered military presence.

"You're playing with people's lives. We just want peace, we just want to continue to enjoy our lives here."

Tough broads
When a female politicians worst crime is to be unlikeable and uncompassionate, how much rationality and coldness is acceptable for women intellectuals and artists Just how tough is tough enough Deborah Nelson, a professor of English at the University of Chicago, considers the politics, psychology and philosophy of toughness in her study of six modern women: Simone Weil, Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, Diane Arbus and Joan Didion. Nelson originally titled her book Tough Broads; it would be more idiomatic to call them Tough Cookies.
But neither of these admiring monikers for the fast-talking dames in 1930s screwball comedy would suit the austere, aloof, serious, resolutely (if self-deludingly) unglamorous heroines of her book, and they would surely have been insulted to be linked with Katharine Hepburn, or even labelled as women at all.
These writers, intellectuals and artists insisted on the aesthetic, political and moral obligation to face the painful reality of the twentieth century head-on. Their toughness was a premeditated lifelong project . . . worked out with a great deal of self-consciousness. But they all faced anger and hostility for their insistence on confronting suffering and pain without emotion.
Their tone of unemotional clarity on the most traumatic events of their time made them respected and feared; but crossing the fine line between detachment and heartlessness also made them seem out of step with their times. On some subjects  the Holocaust, the Eichmann trials, civil rights, Vietnam, 9/11  their detached refusal of empathy and solidarity shocked even their close friends and allies.
Psychologically cold
Nelson calls their hyper-rational stance unsentimental, implicitly equating emotion with sentimentality, a much-derided genre of female writing in nineteenth-century America, which has been defended by feminist literary historians as a style with its own aesthetic practices. Unlike sentimentality, however, unsentimentality has no literary history; and when women practise it, they can be judged for personal failures of feeling, rather than philosophical rigour.
Thus these six women have been perceived as psychologically cold rather than engaged in an ethical project with different assumptions.
Nelson defends them against such charges. She argues that unsentimentality is a strategic ethical choice, not a by-product of personality or a flaw in femininity. These women had to renew, rethink and revise their choices to be unsentimental all the time.
They accepted the necessity of causing pain to readers in order to force them to look at the hard facts, but they were not personally cruel, perverse, unfeeling. Although there were connections between them  McCarthy and Arendt were friends, McCarthy translated Weil, Sontag wrote influential essays about Weil and Arbus  they were not a group or a school. Nelson suggests that they are affiliated more closely by style and shared sensibility than they are by biography.
Indeed, their main affinity may have been their mutual distaste for collectivity, especially in the form of feminism. Their contempt for the sisterly, affectionate, collective and utopian aspects of the feminist movements of their day underlined their individualism and illustrated their resistance to palliative and optimistic visions of all kinds. Nelson does not emphasize gender in her analysis, but obviously gender is central because it is unusual for women to choose a tough public voice and style. As Didion noted in an essay of 1976, on Georgia OKeeffe, Hardness has not been in our century a quality much admired in women.
Determined careerist
Susan Sontag: The making of an icon, for example, is a revised and updated edition of a controversial unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock (Rollysons wife and collaborator) which revealed Sontags lesbian love affairs, skewered her as a determined careerist, and emphasized the strategies of her publisher Roger Straus and agent Andrew Wylie in making her famous.
The backstory of the biography is fascinating in itself. The author of twelve biographies of figures from Marilyn Monroe to Michael Foot, Rollyson devotes a chapter of his Confessions of a Serial Biographer (2016) to a detailed and furious account of the way Sontags entourage, in his view, systematically blocked his access to information, defamed his reputation, and influenced reviewers to attack his conclusions. In their preface to the new edition, the authors are still angry with Sontag and her entourage.
But their first version ended before Sontags diagnosis with myelodysplastic syndrome, and her protracted and painful death, in 2004. Now, with access to Sontags letters and diaries, both published and in her archive at UCLA, the authors declare we are in a position to enhance the texture of our narrative, adding a sense of immediacy.
Amazon queen
They also add a sense of compassion and admiration. While Benjamin Mosers authorized biography-in-progress should eventually give the fullest picture of Sontags development, Rollyson and Paddocks determined research, especially the interviews they conducted with more than a hundred men and women who knew Sontag, many of whom have since died, make this book a valuable resource. It is not a sympathetic biography, but it is serious and informed, seeing her as a grandly self-created artist. And what a portrait of the artist as a woman! Sontag reinvented herself numerous times, and repeatedly forged her view of herself as an intellectual and dissident. Her life story complicates and questions her public image as an indomitable, scornful Amazon queen, immune to human passions and needs; and it challenges her iconic toughness.
According to her son, editor and executor David Rieff, Sontags intimate and emotional journals of love affairs, self-doubt, vanity, tenderness, intellectual curiosity and insatiable zest for living, constitute the great autobiographical novel she never cared to write. Even Sontag could not always be tough enough to meet her own severe expectations, but the letters and journals may turn out to be her most enduring legacy.

Trumps Climate Report burden
The impending release of a key government Climate Science Special Report will force President Trump to choose between accepting the conclusions of his administrations scientists and the demands of his conservative supporters. The special report is part of the National Climate Assessment, which presidents are required by law to conduct every four years.
The current draft of the climate science report was written by scientists inside and outside government, with input from the public and the National Academy of Sciences. The report will now go before a White House committee staffed by political appointees from 13 agencies who are expected to complete their review by Aug. 18.
The assessment details the risks that climate change poses to the United States, so as to inform federal agencies and local policymakers as they prepare for droughts, rising sea levels and other effects.
Since taking office, Trump and his advisers have argued that the global fight against climate change is a threat to the American economy. In his speech withdrawing from the Paris accord, the president said the agreement imposes draconian financial and economic burdens that are unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.
President Bill Clintons administration released the first National Climate Assessment in 2000. Bushs administration delayed for years on releasing an updated version until the environmental groups successfully sued it and released beginning in May 2008.
The Obama administration, by contrast, published the third version of the assessment in 2014, with the government building a graphics-heavy website to tout the findings and Obama conducting TV interviews on weather networks about the effects of global warming.
The draft special report on climate change now under review by the White House focuses primarily on the physical science of global warming, and will feed into a much broader evaluation of the potential social and economic consequences of climate change.
Nine takeaways from the National Climate Report
A scientific report on climate change obtained by The New York Times shows that warming is already having a large effect on the United States.
1. Its hot out there.
It is getting warmer everywhere, but in the contiguous United States, the West is warming the fastest. While temperatures in the country (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) have increased an average of 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900, the Southwest and the Northwest, as well as the Northern Great Plains, have seen a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees or more. A degree and a half may not seem like much, but even slight changes in temperature can have widespread effects. The report said that heat waves and droughts had reached record intensities in some parts of the country. But the Dust Bowl of the 1930s remains the benchmark for heat and drought in American history, by virtue of the area involved and how long it lasted.
2. Wetter hurricanes in the East.
While it is not certain that the frequency of intense hurricanes will increase, hurricanes that do occur will bring more rainfall than ever and could potentially be more destructive.
3. Bad news for California.
Warming will probably bring further reductions in winter and spring snowpack, which the state depends on for much of its water supply. If greenhouse gas emissions remain high and few steps are undertaken to better manage water resources, chronic long-lasting shortages  or hydrological drought  are possible by 2100.
4. When it rains, it pours more.
Americans are already experiencing more extreme precipitation. The amount of precipitation that falls in the heaviest storms is higher across the country, when storms from the last three decades are compared to storms from 1900 to 1960. The change has been highest in the Northeast, where 27 percent more rain falls in the worst storms.
5. Flooding related to sea-level rise is a problem already.
Tidal flooding that is already occurring in places like Miami and Norfolk, Va., will get worse throughout the century and affect cities on both coasts. By the end of the century, for example, parts of Charleston, S.C., may flood at high tide nearly every day. Low-lying parts of San Francisco are also extremely vulnerable, too, and are expected to have frequent flooding.
6. Some areas will suffer more from rising seas.
Sea-level rise is expected to be worse in the Northeast and along the Gulf of Mexico, in part because the land in those regions is naturally subsiding. It is expected to be less of a problem in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Ocean circulation patterns, salinity and other factors can also influence how large the sea-level increase will be.
7. El Nio isnt forever.
Recurring natural shifts in atmospheric patterns can affect temperature and precipitation from months to years. The recent El Nio, for example, contributed to making 2015 and 2016 the warmest years on record. But such natural variability, the report said, has little influence on global or regional climate trends over periods of a decade or more.
8. Humans are to blame.
The federal report left no doubt as to responsibility for a warming climate: It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid 20th century. There are no convincing alternative explanations supported by the observational evidence, the report said.
9. Be ready for surprises in the future.
The report said that through greenhouse gas emissions and widespread deforestation, humans were conducting an unprecedented experiment with the climate system. Although climate modeling has gotten more sophisticated, no model can capture all the elements of the earths complex climate. The report warned there was a significant possibility of climate surprises in the future, either compound events, where two or more extreme events occur simultaneously, or tipping point events where some threshold in the climate system is crossed. The more the climate is changed  the more emissions continue or increase  the greater the risk of such surprises, the report said.

Trump wants to de-nuke the world
US: Nuclear weapons pose greatest threat to the world, US President Donald Trump has said as he favoured a complete elimination of atomic arms by all countries possessing it including Pakistan, China and Russia.
I would like to de-nuke the world. I know that President Obama said global warming is the biggest threat. I totally disagree.
I say that it's a simple one -- Nuclear is our greatest threat worldwide. Not even a question, not even close, he told reporters at Bedminster in New Jersey.
So, I'd like to de-nuke the world. I would like Russia and the United States, China and Pakistan, and many other countries that have nuclear weapons, get rid of them, Trump said.
He said until his aim of a nuclear-free world is achieved, America will be the most powerful nuclear nation on the earth by far.
The first order I gave to my generals, I want this, our nuclear arsenal, to be the biggest and the finest in the world, Trump said in response to a question.
We spent a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of effort. It is in tip-top shape, and getting better and getting stronger. Until such time as this scourge disappears, we will be so much better and so much stronger than anybody else. And nobody, including North Korea, is going to be threatening us with anything, he said.
Trump said his administration will be increasing military budget by many billions of dollars because of the North Korean threat and other reasons.
Talking about the Russia sacking 755 workers of the US Embassy in Moscow, Trump thanked his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, boasting that the move would cut payrolls and save him some money.
I want to thank him (Putin) because we're trying to cut down on payroll. And as far as I'm concerned, I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll, he said.
There's no real reason for them to go back. So I greatly appreciate the fact that they've been able to cut our payroll for the United States. We'll save a lot of money, Trump said.
Moscow had last month announced counter measures in response to tough new sanctions proposed by the United States, ordering Washington to reduce its diplomatic staff.- PTI

Sri Lanka celebrated World Elephant Day on August 12, against a backdrop where the National Elephant Conservation Policy updating process has been at a standstill and the proposed Managed Elephant Reserve in Hambantota is yet to be gazzetted after nearly a decade. In the meantime, Sri Lanka's unique elephant community awaits a man-made tragedy.
Facts
The problems start with facts. While the first National Survey on Elephants conducted in 2011 said there are around 6,000 elephants in Sri Lanka, nearly twenty elephant conservation activist groups beg to differ. According to them, there are only 2,500-3,000 elephants in Sri Lanka at present. They also say there are only about 120 tuskers among the elephant community in Sri Lanka.
Of the African elephants, 100 percent males and 80 percent females have tusks. But in Asia, only the male elephants have tusks. Of the Asian elephants in the main land, 90 percent of the elephants also have tusks, whereas in Sri Lanka, there are only 5-6 percent tuskers among its elephant community.
Sri Lankas elephants belong to the type subspecies Elephas maximus maximus. The other two subspecies are Elephas maximus indicus (living in mainland Asia) and Elephas maximus sumatranus(living in the island of Sumatra). The special subspecies Elephas maximus maximus aka the Sri Lankan elephant is restricted to the island nation.Environmentalist Supun Jayaweera said This sole fact should be enough to realize that we have a unique community of elephants in Sri Lanka who should be conserved at any cost. Rarity of tuskers among the elephant community in Sri Lanka is due to the disappearance of the important tusker gene due to human activities, especially in the pre-colonial era.
Sri Lanka has the highest density of Asian elephants per square kilometer amongst countries in the Asian elephant range. It was reported that the elephant ranges in Sri Lanka have been reduced by 11 percent during the last 40 years.
The Department of Wildlife recently told the Daily News that all preparations have been made for a National Survey on elephants in Sri Lanka by the end of 2017.
A jumbo history
According to the historical records, there have been more than 20,000 elephants in the wild of Ceylon during the pre-colonial era.
The colonial rulers took the elephant community in the island as an agricultural pest. So they passed an ordinance, encouraging people to hunt the elephants down. They rewarded the trophy hunters with much bounty. Tuskers were the top target. Bigger the tusker, the bigger the bounty was, Jayaweera said.
Historical records say that an infamous trophy hunter Major William Rogers killed 1,500 elephants. Major Thomas Skinner had killed 600 elephants, whereas Captain Galvy killed 500 elephants. The elephants mostly killed were inhabitants of the upcountry and the wet zone.
In 1937, the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance prohibited elephant hunting. The then fine of Rs. 2,000, now stands up to a Rs. 500,000. However, the damage was already done, Jayaweera said, The hunters had killed almost all the great-tuskers in the island. The elephants no longer live in the upcountry. The great-tusker gene was removed from the line of Sri Lankan elephants. What remains is a very weak line of tuskers. We will have lesser tuskers in the future.
Cross-tusker gene
The Cross-Tuskers, Jayaweera identifies as the rarest among the rare tuskers of Sri Lanka. Only a 5-6 percent of the Sri Lankan tuskers are cross-tuskers. In Sinhala, we call such tuskers Dala-Poottuwa. These cross-tuskers have one of their tusks overlapping the other. They are such magnificent creatures, he said.
The line of cross-tuskers in Sri Lanka exists only in Yala and Kumana areas. The cross-tusker gene is restricted to these areas. Most of the cross-tuskers were sheltered by the Yala sanctuary. Jayaweera added.
Maha Dala-Poottuwa, Panampaththuwa-Poottuwa, Walaskema-Poottuwa and Kumana-Poottuwa, are few of the well-known cross-tuskers in Sri Lanka.
Story of Yala Podi-Poottuwa
The most well-known is the Yala Podi-Poottuwa, who had a unique relationship with the workers and the tourists who came to Yala. He had a sedate temperament and was the iconic attraction. Unfortunately, Podi-Poottuwa was killed for tusks in 1986 and the investigations revealed that Yala Podi-Poottuwa, who loved humans, had walked up to its killer unaware that it was a hunter, Jayaweera said.
He added, it is the same Yala Podi-Poottuwa who appears in the logo of the Department of Wildlife Conservation.
Jayaweera predicts a gloomy future for tuskers in Sri Lanka unless authorities expeditiously implement the national policy to conserve elephants at full force.
Legal aspect
The general legal background defending all the fauna and flora in Sri Lanka basically are three fold. The three enactments are the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO), the Forest Ordinance (FO) and the National Heritage Wilderness Areas Act.
FFPO was enacted in 1938, which was later amended in 2009. The Act protects the indigenous wild plants and animals and prevents their commercial exploitation. All the areas declared under this act are intended to achieve this end. Senior Environmental Lawyer Jagath Gunawardena believes that available legal provisions are more than enough to save these giants from harm. He said, What matters most is the implementation of the available laws. So, the law enforcement authorities, Gunawardena added, should play their part. The next unfortunate limitation to the available legal provisions for protecting these animals is the political involvement in the matter, he said. He added that respective authorities who are responsible for these animals should not be operating under any political pressures.
Ad hoc development
Upholding similar views, former Director General of the Wildlife Conservation Department Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya said the National Policy on Elephant Conservation, is good, whereas the implementation (of the policy) is not.
Dr. Pilapitiya identifies ad hoc development plans implemented around the country to be the main issue that hinders proper conservation of the elephants in Sri Lanka. He said, These unplanned development projects result in humans encroaching into elephant habitats.
"However, If we can adhere to planned development, I believe we have enough space for both humans and elephants." he added. Dr. Pilapitiya further said the land acquisition for development projects has been the most problematic when dealing with the Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC).
For example, if you take the triangular areas between the Mattala Airport, Hambantota Port and the Sooriyawewa playground, it shelters more than 400 elephants. This land belongs to both Forest Department and the Mahaweli Development Authority. This area is proposed as a Managed Elephant Range (MER) as well. But unfortunately these lands are being acquired for number of development projects at the moment, Dr. Pilapitiya added.
There is a narrow elephant migration corridor which connects the said area from Southern part of the country to the Northern parts. This area is called Hendilla. We hear that 5 acres of land in Hendilla have been allocated to a housing project. When the Hendilla elephant migration corridor will be blocked from this project, the HEC will increase to a very high level, Dr. Pilapitiya further said.
Dr. Pilapitiya said, "The development can be moved to somewhere else, whereas we cannot expect the elephants to work around us."He also pointed out that of all the Asian countries where elephants are in habitat, Sri Lanka records the highest rate of Human Elephant Conflict (HEC). He said about 250 human deaths and 70 elephant deaths are annually reported in Sri Lanka because of the HEC, which he defines as very much avoidable deaths from both parts caused by unplanned development.
Dr. Pilapitiya said environmentalists are not trying to stop development. But it is important that the development we do is a well assessed, much planned one. "Nature tourism in Sri Lanka, which brings in large foreign revenue, should not be affected by the ad hoc development system carried out in the country," he added.
Dr. Pilapitiya further said, There is too much political interference hindering the wildlife conservation in Sri Lanka. I am not talking about this government nor am I referring to the previous one. For more than twenty years or so, political interference has continuously hampered or frozen the elephant and other wildlife conservation policy implementation in Sri Lanka.
Delayed means denied
Chairman of the committee updating the National Elephant Conservation Policy of Sri Lanka Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando said the updating process is at a halt due to internal administrative issues in the Department of Wildlife. "The National Elephant Conservation Policy was due to be updated in 2006, which never happened. The policy is supposed to be updated every five years. Thus, Professor Kotagama, advisor to the Minister of Wildlife proposed the necessary updating should be done to the conservation policy", Dr. Prithiviraj said.
"Subsequently, a committee chaired by myself was appointed in 2016 including 10 more members from the Department of Wildlife. However, it is presently at halt due some internal issues in the Wildlife Department", Dr. Prithiviraj added.
A reliable source says the aforesaid internal matter is in relation to an unfair promotion criteria followed by the department, with regards to Assistant Directors working. According to the source, there is one category of assistant directors who are graduates. They have not being given promotions for 20-odd years.Speaking of the proposed Managed Elephant Range (MER) in Hambantota, Mattala, Dr. Pritiviraj said the proposed for the MER came in 2010, following an Environmental Assesment Report conducted for the Mattala Airport.
He told that the Ministry of Wilflife has already sent all the necessary documentation for the MER to be gazzetted, and the reaons for the delay in gazzetting is unclear.
Collaring
Notwithstanding the fact that GPS collars may not be the most sophisticated tech option for tracking elephants, it is an affordable option for Sri Lanka. The demand for collering the tuskers resurfaced recently, when a tusker near Kala Wewa was injured by a trap gun in July.
Dr. Pritiviraj, Chairman of the Center for Conservation and Research (CCR), pointed out tracking elephant movements is very important for mitigating the Human-Elephant Conflict. Explaining further Dr. Prithiviraj said land use planning and its development should also take into consideration existing elephant ranges, their movement patterns as well as their behavior to reduce the chances of elephant encroachments into human settlements.
"We can follow collared elephant movements and avoid human activities in the areas where they occupy the most." he said. He pointed out that all elephants need not be collared. "We only need to collar a main elephant or a tusker in a group." It is said that an elephant herd has a matriarch leader.
Dr. Pritiviraj introduced recently collared elephant Ranmali who calls the Mattala proposed MER her home. Dr. Pritiviraj pointed out that CCR tracks Ranmali's movement which mostly confined to the proposed MER. Her movements are followed and recorded by the CCR as follows.
Meanwhile, pointing out the importance of collaring tuskers, Environmentalist Supun Jayaweera said tracking tuskers is important in many ways. "Sometimes if a tusker is injured, its movement will freeze if it can't walk. At present, we have no proper procedure to find out if a tusker is harmed or not. We usually find out about an injured tusker when a wildlife officer notice the absence of a tusker and specifically attempt to locate the animal," Jayaweera added. "When we found Deegha Danthu for example, it was injured two or three days back. He was provided with care after we found him. A proper monitoring wouldn't want us to find him. We need to do away with this directionless approach when protecting these tuskers. That is why we emphasize on collaring the tuskers even though the photographers and tourists find collared elephants roaming in the wild to be rather unnatural," Jayaweera said.
On elephant-watch
Following the recent incident involving the Tusker of Kala Wewa in July 2017, the Department of Wildlife Conservation announced that it has already called for tenders to purchase GPS collars for elephants. Environmental activists and elephant lovers await the arrival of GPS collars in due course.
