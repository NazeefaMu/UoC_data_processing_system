JVP, a civilised party with high  ethical standards  - Anura Kumara

The JVP is a civilised party with high ethical standards, which produces disciplined persons, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He said it is praiseworthy how Vijitha Herath acted after an accident by setting an example to the public. He made these comments at a press conference at the JVP headquarters on Wednesday.
Heraths accident is not the only accident happened in Sri Lanka. Many accidents take place in the country per day. About eight persons die from accidents each day. This is just one of them. The accident took place when he attempted to save the life of a pedestrian. His cab collided a telephone post close to Rajagiriya junction. Is there anything wrong in attempting to save a human life, Dissanayake asked.
Dissanayake called the Police and bore the responsibility. The Police had alleged him of not attempting to avoid an accident and for damaging state property. We paid the loss. He was charged with Rs. 1,500 for not attempting to avoid an accident, said.
He said false news stories have been created claiming that he had driven the vehicle under the influence of liquor.
The JVP leader said he knew Herath since his university life. Throughout the years, we have come to know about his personality, he said.

First innings of the next  Test is hugely important: Kaushal Silva eyeing a Lords Test hundred

DURHAM: The dream of every cricketer is to score a hundred at Lords, but it is only a handful of lucky ones who get that opportunity to do so.
Amongst the Sri Lankans who have achieved that feat are Sidath Wettimuny, Duleep Mendis, Amal Silva, Mahela Jayawardene (twice), Marvan Atapattu, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara.
Diminutive right-handed opening bat Kaushal Silva is no exception. He has his sights firmly set on scoring a hundred at crickets most hallowed grounds when Sri Lanka take on England in the third and final Test beginning on June 9.
Ive played four Tests in England now, scored three fifties but no hundred yet. Im hoping to get set and go for the big one  to a hundred in the next, said Silva who gained a lot of confidence from his knock of 60 in the second innings of the second Test at Durham.
As a team weve finished this match off on a good note. Taking that mindset into the next game is important. Also, personally, Im disappointed about the way I got out.
The last occasion Silva played at Lords in 2014 he scored twin fifties (63 and 57) but he hopes to make it into three figures this time around.
It was Silva who set the tone for the Lankan batting revival at Durham with his patient knock that occupied 145 balls. Both he and his opening partner Dimuth Karunaratne were able to dent the England new ball bowlers Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad so that they were did not pose the same to the batsmen who followed.
An openers role is especially important here, because our success has knock-on effects for the team, said Silva.
If Dimuth and I bat a good number of overs, the ball gets old and the others find it easier. Its Englands opening bowlers who are the real wicket-taking threats, and the pressure they apply is immense, he said.
In the last innings Dimuth and I batted 17 overs, and that made it easier for the rest of the team. If we can play like that, with positive intent, I think we can be successful.
Following Silvas half-century skipper Angelo Mathews scored an attractive 80, Dinesh Chandimal a magnificent 126 and Rangana Herath a plucky half-century that enabled Sri Lanka to total 475 and avoid the ignominy of successive innings defeats.
We all knew we had it in us to bat like that  its just that we werent able to in the first three innings, said Silva. Now a few individuals have scored runs. Theyve got confidence. Its only after youve done it a few times that it becomes easier for you. But we need to replicate that by training with that intensity, then taking it into the next match. The first innings of the next Test is hugely important, because that will set the tone for us.
Explaining the effects it has on a bowler when you showing positive intent, Silva said, If you attack any bowler, they will be put on the back foot by that. If you keep leaving the ball, these bowlers are so skillful that there is still a chance of getting out.
Rotating the strike is crucial. When we score runs there is a little pressure on them as well. Here, the difference is that the good ball is what you should expect  that is what is normal. The skills of their bowlers are great. So to counter that, we have to try and bat positively.
The other thing is to get them to bowl three or four over spells. With any fast bowler, if you have them bowling 15-20 overs, anyone will tire and drop their performances a bit. Among the seven batsmen we have we should be able to do that. Whoever is batting well that day should be able to bat through and ensure that happens.
It was not so long ago that Silva who began his Test career promisingly with two centuries and eight half-centuries in his first 19 Tests lost his place following a poor run of scores against India and West Indies where he managed one fifty in nine innings. He was left out of the tour to New Zealand, but fought his way back into the team for the England tour with some heavy scoring in the domestic Premier league tournament.
I knew that though I was dropped, I could find a way back into the team by scoring runs. I had only done poorly for one series. I believed that I could get back, said Silva. In the domestic tournament, I scored about 600 runs in four games  including two double centuries. If you score runs, you can have a place in the team.
Silva said he did not do anything big to his batting to earn a recall but it was all to do with the mental aspect.
When you look at first-class cricket and domestic cricket theres a huge difference. The main reason is that bowlers at this level deliver a lot of very good balls. There are fewer loose balls and the bowlers are all good, said Silva.
As a batsman what you should try is to score runs off every scoring opportunity. Theres also a skill in identifying who is not bowling as well that day and scoring off him. The biggest adjustment is mental. Its about being patient and waiting for the bad ball, and learning to see through tough periods.
Silva was of the opinion that it was not the bowlers who were at fault but the batsmen for Sri Lanka being 0-2 down in the three-match series.
Our bowlers have actually done well in the last two games. There were a few mistakes, but on the whole, theyve been very good.
They didnt get support from the batsmen, said Silva. We cant aim too high, but if we can get to 300 or 250 at least, we can put some pressure on them, because our bowlers are doing well.
He compared his teams fielding to the batting and said, I dont think we are a terrible fielding side. Some days we field well and others we dont. That happens with the batting as well. Consistency is what is missing.
Maybe lack of anticipation is an issue. But we cant have those excuses. If a bowler is doing well on a flat wicket and a catch gets dropped, thats really tough on them. As a policy we dont blame cricketers for dropping catches, because we all train hard. Anyone can miss a catch.

Royal goes out  favourites against  St.Anthonys today

St.Anthonys College, Kandy hosts Royal College, Colombo at Bogambara today at 4:15pm in one of the crunch match of this weeks competition and if Royal are to be victorious in this game then they can advance one step forward to the top position in the Singer Inter-School League rugby tournament as the leaders are down to play against tough opposition in their second round games in this week.
The Royalists have an immaculate record after five matches and their cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of ever reliable forwards who are scoring try after try through their famous rolling maul in this League tournament to go along with the dependable place kicking of their young 17-year-old full back Ovin Askey.
They have had no challenge against D.S.Senanayaka College(36-10), Wesley College(17-14), St.Joseph College(27 all draw), Trinity (winning the 1st leg 22-17). Royal went down to Trinity in the return leg in Kandy by 13-18. Last week they stage a spectacular come back where they were trailing 0-19 down to win 33-24 against the fighting Peterites.
Their only blemish this season coming against arch rival SThomas College, Mount Lavinia where they were leading till the last minute and lost in the end by 22-16.
On the other hand St.Anthonys College possesses Samuel Maduwantha their ever reliable fly half who can play in the pivotal position of full back also is the highest point scorer in this years on going Singer League but has been blowing hot and cold and is savouring the sting of two straight defeats in the past two weeks. Unbeaten Thomians came from behind to invoke their spirit against Anthonians. Isipatha didnt need any invitations to thrash the Katugasthota outfit last week as well. Also they lost to St. Peters in kandy.
These were preceded by two victories over two Kandy Schools, Darmaraja College and Kingswood College but the bite has been taken off their campaign later on and it could be worse for them after this week.

Eranga available to play  3rd Test if selected - Bandara  to join KJP to UK

The ICC has confirmed to Sri Lanka Cricket that fast bowler Shaminda Eranga who was reported for suspect action during the 2nd England Test, can be considered for selection to the 3rd Test at Lords on the 9th June.
Eranga is due to present himself for assessment at Laughborough on the 6th of June, and the ICC has confirmed that Eranga is permitted to continue bowling in international cricket until the results of the testing are known Meanwhile, National Selectors, headed by Sanath Jayasuriya have called up 29 year old left-arm-medium-fast bowler Chaminda Bandara to National duty following the lower back injury sustained by Dushmantha Chameera.
Bandara whos 5 year career spans 51 First Class matches hauled an impressive 9/68 in the AIA Premier League Tournament against the Sri Lanka Army, and has 141 First Class wickets.
The old boy of St. Marys College  Kegalle is the only fast-bowler to feature among the top 15 wicket-takers of the AIA Premier League Tournament 2015/16.
Speaking on his selection, Chairman Selection Committee says; Bandara has been performing well domestically and he is the best choice available at the time for the English conditions.
Bandara will leave Sri Lanka together with Kusal Janith Perera, and both players are expected to be available for the 3rd Test.

Cricket: Test home comforts a worry for ICC

International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson believes Tests will be more evenly contested if schedules are changed so that visiting teams have more time to adjust to local conditions.

Sri Lanka's nine-wicket defeat by England at the Riverside last week gave the hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in three-match series, after an even more emphatic innings and 88-run win in the first Test at Headingley just days earlier.

Victory meant England had won 15 of their last 21 home series, a success rate of more than 71 percent, and home advantage is becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world.

Figures compiled by the Cricinfo website show that in the 10 years to September 2015, teams have lost more than twice as many matches as they have won when playing overseas, a record far worse than in earlier years.

Overcast early season English conditions, which accentuate the degree of swing generated by the Dukes ball used in England, and where pitches can aid seam movement too, are one of the most challenging environments for any touring side.

Yet Sri Lanka's preparation for back-to-back Tests involved two three-day games against two Second Division counties fielding under-strength sides.

"It's not good where the home team seems to have such a huge advantage and I know the record over the last two or so years the home team comes out on top much of the time," Richardson told AFP in an interview.

"That's partly down to the fact I think that teams don't allow enough time to acclimatise."

- Ball change -The situation faced by Sri Lanka, who bucked the trend by winning a two-match series in England 1-0 in 2014, is one familiar to many touring teams.

Australia, who've now gone 15 years since their last Ashes series win in England, are planning to use the Dukes ball in the second half of their next first-class Sheffield Shield season in a bid to help their batsmen adjust, although the absence of typically English weather as well may minimise the impact.

When celebrated wicket-keeper Rodney Marsh, now Australia's chairman of selectors, made his first tour of England as a player in 1972, the squad faced 11 opponents before the first Test, with plenty more fixtures in between international games.

The demand from players for shorter tours has been exacerbated by the rise of lucrative Twenty20 tournaments such as the Indian Premier League, which at best can mean leading players arrive late for a series in England or, more dramatically, simply opt out of international cricket completely.

"I think more and more teams and squads are becoming more specialised -- that should allow teams to prepare for a Test series even while their Twenty20 team is finishing up a series somewhere else," said Richardson.

"Having said that, we are looking at competition structures across all three formats (Tests, one-day internationals and Twenty20)," the former South Africa wicket-keeper added ahead of the ICC's annual conference, in Edinburgh from June 27 to July 2.

England are the only visiting team in the past decade to have enjoyed Test series wins in both India and Australia, two of the toughest places for touring sides to triumph.

Part of the reason was that they enjoyed good standard match practice before the Test campaign started.

This wasn't just a matter of the number of fixtures but their quality, as exemplified by England's 2015/16 Test series win in South Africa, where they played a South African Invitational XI and several fixtures, across different formats, against South Africa A prior to the first Test.

With the ICC considering plans to split Test nations into two divisions, Richardson said: "We want to find ways of playing slightly less cricket but more meaningful cricket.

"That means reducing the workload on players and also allowing time for teams to play that extra warm-up game which will give them more of a chance to acclimatise."

Ireland name uncapped pacer McCarthy for Sri Lanka series


Barry McCarthy, the 23-year-old uncapped fast bowler, has been included in Ireland's 13-man squad for the two-match One-Day International series against Sri Lanka, to be played in Malahide on June 16 and 18.
McCarthy, who has been plying his trade for Durham in the English county, has been rewarded for his recent form as he bagged his maiden first-class five-wicket haul last month. "It has been a great last couple of weeks and this news has really put the icing on the cake for me. Its been brilliant to play first-team cricket at Durham and to achieve success too, which has given me great confidence should I get a chance against Sri Lanka," the elated youngster gushed.
"Barry has been in tremendous form with Durham and deserves his opportunity. Hes a powerful cricketer who will fit in well with the squad," John Bracewell, the head coach said.
William Porterfield will lead a fairly experienced squad into the series, with seven of the 13 having made more than 100 appearances for Ireland.
"Whilst we as selectors are not afraid to take a punt, continuity is also important. The side selected are proven performers at this level and with a busy summer of cricket we believe starting the season with a strong core of hardened internationals is the place to start," Bracewell explained.
Ireland endured a disappointing campaign in the ICC World T20 as defeats to Oman and Netherlands denied them the chance to advance to the tournament proper. Alan Lewis, the chairman of selectors, however is upbeat ahead of an encouraging fixtures lined-up for the summer.
"After the disappointment of the World T20 it will be great to get back on the horse as it were. Its fantastic that we have so many fixtures this summer, which will put real heat on all to perform," Lewis said.
Full squad: William Porterfield (capt), George Dockrell, Ed Joyce, Tim Murtagh, Andrew McBrine, Barry McCarthy, Kevin OBrien, Niall OBrien, Stuart Poynter, Boyd Rankin, Paul Stirling, Stuart Thompson , Gary Wilson.
