Promote unity, peace, brotherhood
May unity, peace and brotherhood strengthen between all communities while health, wealth and prosperity increase, stated Malwatta Chapter Anunayake Thera Most Ven. Niyangoda Vijithasiri Thera.
The Thera, in his message for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, said that the New Year is celebrated according to Sinhala and Tamil traditions. The transition of the Sun from the House of Pisces to the House of Aries marks the beginning of Sinhala and Tamil New Year, celebrated on April 14. Both the Sinhalese and Tamils celebrate the event and participate in New Year rituals in a festive mood.
The Thera said all must practice these age-old rituals and customs with an understanding of their importance. The Thera also observed that the majority of the nation, the Sinhalese, have to act with great responsibility and called for unity between ethnicities and wished all a prosperous New Year.

We should build a promising  future for younger generation
It is the responsibility of adults, to create a promising future for the younger generation. Therefore, the existing drug menace as well as other malpractices within society, should be eradicated, Galewela Police OIC Janaka Vithanachchi said.
He said so at an awareness programme held for civil security committee members and police personnel at the Galewela T. B. Tennakoon Memorial Hall.
"We as adults, should lead our children on the correct path. Every religion teaches us to work for the betterment of society and those who adhere to religion, would not go astray," he said, adding that the main objective of the police, is to protect the people of the nation.
"Hence, cooperation between the public and the police is essential to carry out the said task. We must work together so as to create a prosperous future for our children," Vithanachchi said.

13 African athletes go missing at Commonwealth Games
GOLD COAST, Thursday - Five more African athletes may have vanished from the Commonwealth Games, organisers said Thursday, after eight competitors from Cameroon were suspected of fleeing a day earlier.
Gold Coast organisers confirmed reports that athletes from Rwanda and Uganda were thought to have gone missing, while they were also looking to verify the whereabouts of two squash players from Sierra Leone.
Were obviously looking at it very carefully, Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive David Grevemberg told reporters.
We have a service to people who have legitimate visas to be in this country, he added.
Until it becomes a true issue and somebody has outstayed their visa, or have formally applied for asylum, we just need to continue to monitor the situations.
The focus now is to support teams in trying to track down the athletes who are missing.
More than 100 athletes overstayed their visas at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Athlete visas for the Commonwealth Games expire on May 15, Grevemberg said. Eight athletes from conflict-hit Cameroon -- one third of the central African countrys 24-strong team -- were said to be missing from the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday, sparking an Australian Border Force manhunt. As the search continues for Cameroons five boxers and three weightlifters, Grevemberg insisted the welfare of the athletes came first.
We obviously have been in close contact with Cameroon officials, he said.
We share their concern regarding obviously the safety, welfare, whereabouts of these athletes.
Cameroon team manager Victor Agbor Nso told local media he had reported the matter to police on Wednesday.
Australias Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned that athletes would be forcibly removed from the country if they attempted to overstay their visas.
They arent going to game the system, he told local radio.
Australian Border Force officers will find these people (and) theyll be held in immigration detention until they can be deported.  AFP

Aloysius, Palisena  further remanded
Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till April 26 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
The two suspects were produced before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne for the purpose of remand extension.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue.
The court had issued a warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case since he failed to comply with court orders.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with the criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Defence Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.

Army establishes new Directorate for Overseas Operations
The army is trying to cooperate with the Human Rights Commission is the screening and vetting process of peacekeepers prior to overseas deployment because they are not guilty of any wrong, said Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
In a letter addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena recently, the Human Rights Commission (HRC) charged that the Army had breached an agreement to vet military personnel being sent for UN Peacekeeper positions around the world.
HRC Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama said the commission and the tri-forces had jointly agreed to a vetting process for Sri Lankan troops being sent abroad.
However, the Army Commander said, We are yet to sign an MoU between the Sri Lanka Army and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. It is in sketch form as of now, as the proper wordings and conditions have to be included in the MoU. We want them to have a complete inquiry independently.
We have agreed to these conditions. But as of now we have a problem concerning time. This was introduced in December 2017, but out troops to Bali had to be dispatched, so we sent them based on the previous process of screening. We sent the first 200, then the UN and other organisations wanted the troops to go through this vetting process by the HRC. Now we are looking at an interim situation and until such time these organisations can stand on their own feet, we are working with the SIS, CID, FCID, Police and other agencies to screen our troops.We do have a very stringent screening process, he added.
The Commander opened the Directorate for Overseas Operations (DOO) at the Old Dutch Building in Colombo 3, named Sama Medura. To date 18,179 Army members have effectively contributed to UN peace keeping missions. Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne was the chief guest at the opening of this new unit, which will be headed by Major General Mervyn Perera who will serve as the Director General of the DOO.

Avurudu Reflections
Another Sinhala and Tamil New Year will dawn tomorrow (14). According to ancient astrological beliefs, the transition of the Sun from Meena (Pisces) to Mesha (Aries), marks the beginning of a New Year, called Avurudu in local parlance. The Sinhala and Tamil New Year, celebrated every April in Sri Lanka and many other countries in the region, is a major event on our cultural calendar.
Avurudu is perhaps the only event that motivates an entire populace to sit down for a meal at the same time and begin work at the same time. Avurudu teaches us the value of togetherness, forgiveness, peace and co-existence. Avurudu literally brings the whole country together through the auspicious times. There are those who scoff at auspicious times, but they teach us the value of punctuality. This should not be confined to the New Year Nekaths (auspicious times) but rather continued throughout the year.
In Sri Lanka, the Sinhala and Tamil New Year has become a national event, without being confined to Sinhala Buddhists and Tamil Hindus per se. Sri Lanka's very multi-ethnic nature means that Avurudu transcends all man-made boundaries, enveloping all communities and religious groups in its joys. This New Year has dawned in a month that has exemplified the multi-ethnic and multi-religious character of Sri Lanka. It started with Easter Sunday, a Holy Day for Christians celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. The month ends with Vesak, the Thrice Blessed Day that marks the Birth, Enlightenment and Passing Away of the Buddha. Vesak, though primarily celebrated by Buddhists, is a national festival that sees everyone coming together.
Such ethnic and religious unity is the need of the hour, especially when political and other forces opposed to the peaceful co-existence of various communities are working overtime to ignite the flames of hatred. We have sadly seen the destruction they can cause both physically and mentally in the recent incidents in Digana. We must resolve not to let such incidents happen again. Amity is the only path to peace, which our Nation so critically needs.
The Government has set in motion a viable programme for peace and reconciliation. The proposed new Constitution will also incorporate many chapters to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation while creating a truly Sri Lankan identity. This is just one of the significant steps taken by the Government in the quest for peace.
Peace is very much a matter of the heart. And peace should begin at home. This is the lesson that Avurudu teaches us. It is a time for forgetting all past disputes with family members, neighbours, superiors and colleagues. It is a time for giving and for forgiving. Avurudu is a time for renewing bonds within families and among relatives. We should forget animosities that give rise to hatred and radiate compassion instead. Engaging in religious observances during the Nonagatha period brings religion closer to our lives that are veering alarmingly away from moral values.
It is indeed a time for recalling and re-engaging in cultural traditions that we have nearly forgotten. Thus when we offer a sheaf of betel to someone at Avurudu, it signifies that we no longer harbour any ill-will towards that person and wish him/her long life and good health. Thus Ganu Denu (transaction) goes beyond the literal monetary meaning of the concept of give and take  that sharing and caring should be an integral part of our lives.
Respecting elders starting with ones parents is another moral value that comes to the fore during the Avurudu season. At a time when elders are sometimes neglected by their children, who prefer to keep mothers and fathers in elders homes, Avurudu reminds us of the importance of respecting and protecting them. Elders impart wisdom to the younger generation and guide them on the correct path in a world where moral values have been swept away by a torrent of unbridled commercialism.
In fact, the message of Avurudu itself is at risk of getting lost in a sea of commercialism spread by vendors who urge people to spend relentlessly for New Year celebrations. Commercialism has unfortunately crept into all national and religious festivals. Judging by newspaper and television advertisements, Avurudu has become one big shopping and entertainment season. Its core values have been swept aside. But this should not be the case. We should see through the commercial veneer into the very heart and soul of these national events. But we must look beyond the new clothes and sweetmeats to grasp the true meaning of Avurudu, which is to bring happiness to our hearts and minds.
Major events such as Avurudu call for soul-searching on a national scale. This is a time to reflect collectively on why and where we have gone wrong and on how we could put things right in the future. Avurudu is not only an ideal opportunity for peace and reconciliation at home and in the village, but also in the country as a whole. That is one New Year resolution that we should be firmly determined to turn into reality.

## Title: AVURUDU  TRIBUTE TO SUN AND NATURE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, April 13, 2018 - 01:00
AVURUDU  TRIBUTE TO SUN AND NATURE
Erabadu flowers. The sounds of a Koha in the distance. The feeling of a fresh spring is definitely in the air. It can mean only one thing - Avurudu is here again. Another Sinhala and Tamil New Year will dawn at 8.13 a.m. tomorrow, signifying one of the most important national events in the country.
Yes, Avurudu or Puthandu (in Tamil) is primarily celebrated by Sinhala Buddhists and Tamil Hindus, but over the years it has transcended such man-made boundaries and become a national festival celebrated by all Sri Lankans. That is what Sri Lanka should be  a country where all live in harmony and take pride in each others cultural norms and traditions.
But above all, Avurudu celebrates our very close bond with Nature. In a way, it is our tribute to the Sun, whose movement from Meena (Pisces) to Mesha (Aries) is the very basis of the traditional New Year. This is distinct from the modern Gregorian calendar introduced just 436 years ago. On the other hand, the roots of the traditional New Year go back thousands of years. In fact, Oriental cultures have based their calendars  and daily life  around the movements of the Sun and the Moon for millennia.
New Year traditions
The festival is based on the fact that Sun gives us life. Our food is literally made by the Sun through the process of photosynthesis, which is really the basis of all life on Earth. Thus the New Year traditions evolved as a result of farmers expressing their gratitude to the Sun and Nature for a bountiful harvest. One cannot get any closer to Nature than that. The traditional New Year (or variations of it) is a common festival all over Asia, but here in Sri Lanka it is the most important national event of the year. In fact, the Sinhalese word Bak for the month of April signifies fortune, being a derivative of the Sanskrit root word Bhagya.
Avurudu teaches us many lessons apart from bringing us closer to Nature. What other national festival unites an entire country to do certain activities at the same time Some may disregard and even make fun of the Avurudu Nekath or auspicious times, but they help make us more punctual and disciplined. While cooking and partaking meals in accordance with auspicious times is certainly very important, the foremost place in Avurudu traditions should go to the age-old tradition of Ganu Denu, which literally means Give and Take. That is sadly a factor that is missing from our lives for the most part, but Avurudu reminds us of the importance of compromise and the joy of sharing.
The symbolic conduit for Ganu Denu in Sri Lanka (as well as in neighbouring India) is the humble sheaf of betel leaves. There are many legends associated with the betel leaf which has become a pivotal item in New Year festivities. Again, the betel leaf symbolises our close affinity with Nature. It is thought of as a harbinger of prosperity.
Peaceful co-existence
Avurudu reminds us of the importance of respecting our elders. Hence the practice of worshipping parents and elderly relatives when the New Year dawns. But there is another higher purpose  giving someone a sheaf of betel leaves means that you have forgotten or forgiven any enmity, misunderstanding or anger that may have caused a rift in the old year. Thus Avurudu is a season for Giving  as well as for Forgiving. It is a time where everyone in the family and the neighbourhood gets together in a spirit of harmony and peaceful co-existence. Another important part of Ganu Denu is commencing some sort of work for the first time in the New Year. Called Weda Alleema in Sinhala and Er Mangalam according to Hindu traditions, this calls for starting some work that would bring prosperity to oneself and the family throughout the year. For example, a student can study a lesson and a farmer can work on his field.
Avurudu is a joyous occasion - what would it be without all those sweetmeats Some of the Avurudu sweetmeats are found nowhere else on Earth. Kavum, Kokis, Athirasa, Bibikkan, Mun Kavum, Peni Walalu, Asmee and many other types of sweetmeats adorn the Avurudu table, along with alien arrivals such as cake and biscuits. No Avurudu table can be complete without the obligatory Kiribath (Milk Rice), which is the first item cooked to mark the dawn of the year. The overflowing of milk in this instance sysmbolises happiness and prosperity for the entire family. In many Hindu households, a sweet rice is made with new raw red rice, jaggery, cashew nuts, ghee and plums.
The Avurudu table brings everyone together. This is a very important in a society where the tradition of family sit-down meals has disappeared for all intents and purposes. Todays pressures to relentlessly pursue money and differing interests/work hours of family members mean that no one has the time to enjoy a sit-down meal over free-flowing conversation and plenty of laughter. At best, the whole family might have eyes glued to the television while having dinner with no conversation at all. Family bonds have taken a severe beating due to modern lifestyles, but Avurudu reminds us that we can  and should  do better to keep families together.
The demands of commercialism have enveloped everyone in our families, including the children. Unlike in the days gone by, todays children are pressured by parents, teachers and the wider society to study all the time in order do well at examinations at the expense of their playtime. However, Avurudu literally gives them a break from the tedium of studying and attending classes non-stop. Avurudu is playtime, from the Onchillawa (swing) to nearly forgotten indoor games such as Panchi and Keta. It is also a time when the children get a lot of gifts, from new clothes to toys. Naturally, it is the children that enjoy Avurudu the most, starting with the delicious sweetmeats on the table. Of course, Avurudu games and festivities have no age limit  everyone is free to join in the fun.
Bak Maha Ulela
Most villages do have Bak Maha Ulela events where the entire village comes together for a bit of downtime. Participating in many traditional games such as Pillow Fighting, Tug-O-War, Cadjan Weaving and Raban playing give the villagers an opportunity to reaffirm their bonds with each other. The authorities must also make an effort to preserve some of the more traditional games such as olinda keliya, eluvan keliya, mevara sellama, buhu keliya, muthu keliya and mee sellama. Of course, these events are open to all, regardless of communal o religious differences. This is significant at a time when there is a dire need to reinforce the bonds among different communities and religious groups.
But Avurudu cannot be confined to ones home or village. Avurudu gives us an opportunity to visit far-flung friends and relatives at least once a year with plenty of gifts and sweetmeats in hand. There is a massive rush to go to villages, with buses and trains filled to capacity. This is also one of the few chances for those based in the cities to go back to their villages for a few days to get in touch with their roots, so to speak.
Avurudu also has a spiritual or religious element, though the commercial elements may sometimes overshadow it. The Punya Kalaya (literally a time for meritorious deeds) or Nonagathaya (literally a period with no auspicious times) is designed to let us visit the temple or the Kovil to purify our souls. Thus the Avurudu brings to the fore the nexus between the village and the temple/place of worship. Many of the problems in our lives can be traced to the gulf between us and the place of worship  Avurudu gives us an opportunity to renew this bond. The temple is also often the location for anointing oil for the New Year, an age-old tradition that is said to bestow fortune and good health. This is usually done by the head priest or a village elder.
Avurudu is sometimes likened to a person, through the reference to an Avurudu Kumaraya (New Year Prince). He is supposed to be a radiant individual who brings prosperity to the whole village and the whole country. In fact, in keeping with this thee, many Avurudu festivals select an Avurudu Kumaraya and as well as Kumaraya (Princess).
There are many other rituals and traditions associated with the New Year, such as bathing for the new and old year and leaving for work in the New Year. We might not have the time for observing all Avurudu traditions, but the lesson is clear  togetherness pays dividends in the form of peace and harmony.
Avurudu is a time for a fresh start in every sphere of life. From new clothes to a new coat of paint to new aspirations, it marks a deviation from the old routine and signals that life is ready to take on new challenges in the coming year. Avurudu thus gives us fresh hope for a successful, bountiful year ahead.

British submarines move  into missile range of Syria
UK: British Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered British submarines in the Mediterranean to move within missile range of Syria in readiness for strikes against the Assad regime by the end of this week.
Whitehall sources said Britain was "doing everything necessary" to be able to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles from nuclear-powered submarines against military targets in Syria.
One source said that "if any action is going to happen, it is going to happen before Monday".
As of Wednesday night, May had not come to a final decision on whether Britain would join the US and France in any air strikes, but the Prime Minister wants to be able to act swiftly if and when she decides to join any offensive.
The Royal Navy has three Astute-class submarines that could be heading towards Syria - HMS Ambush, HMS Artful and HMS Astute. Their Tomahawk IVs have a range of 1600 km, meaning the subs would need to lie off the coast of Syria, Lebanon or Israel while awaiting the order to strike. Each submarine can carry 38 missiles.
We are moving subs in, we are doing everything necessary operationally to do that. If any action is going to happen it is going to happen before Monday because once you start having a debate about it, it will be very difficult for No 10 to do anything," a Whitehall source said.
May is understood to have resolved that any decision to join allied air strikes would have to be taken by the Cabinet rather than by Parliament, as delaying action will give Syria the chance to move its military assets near to Russian hardware, making it harder for the US or UK to get a clean strike.
There was already evidence on Wednesday of Syria trying to move its aircraft out of range. Opposition groups said the Syrian regime was shifting military vehicles away from its airbase in Hama, a potential target for American cruise missiles.
Activists also said Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group supporting the Assad regime, was clearing its own positions near the T4 airbase in central Syria. Israeli jets reportedly struck the T4 base on Sunday night, killing 14 people, including seven Iranians in an attack first reported by Syrian state media as having been carried out by the US.
Michael Horowitz, a senior analyst at the Le Beck geopolitical consultancy, said that the regime would probably move its most sensitive equipment close to Russian forces, in the hope that the US would be less likely to risk accidentally striking Russian troops.
European air traffic controllers on Wednesday issued a "rapid alert" for airlines in the eastern Mediterranean over the possibility of air strikes into Syria within the next 72 hours. The European Aviation Security Agency, which receives intelligence reports from classified sources, warned of possible launches of air-to-ground strikes or cruise missiles in the area.
The US does not have an aircraft carrier in the area yet, meaning strikes would have to be launched from the USS Donald Cook or the USS Porter, two US Navy destroyers already in the Mediterranean.
The Donald Cook departed Larnaca, Cyprus, on Monday after completing a scheduled port visit.

CAA launches Special Market Monitoring  Programme for Sinhala and Tamil New Year
Boosting its consumer safeguards for the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year (Avurudu), the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) had launched a special seasonal monitoring programme on the directions of Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen. Hence, CAA monitoring currently expands to Avurudu sales promotions by firms and various seasonal discount campaign offers.
Meanwhile, the rush to cash in on the season by errant traders is strong and the CAA had netted almost Rs. 5 million in fines in a short period.
The Sinhala and Tamil New Year season is a time when many consumers fall victim to errant traders, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said, while addressing a meeting with his officials on April 11.
As a result, we have increased raids and collected almost Rs. 5 million as fines. CAA officials had informed that a Special Market Monitoring Programme (SMMP) is in place during this season, to safeguard consumers, he added.
On the instructions of Minister Bathiudeen, CAA officials guided by its Chairman Hasitha Tillekeratne under the said SMMP, had initiated monitoring prices of items including food sold at rest stops where long-distance passenger buses break journey midway for refreshments. CAA officials are closely monitoring defective products including household appliances prompted on seasonal discounts and sales campaigns.
The CAA is also monitoring prices of mineral water bottles and other beverages that are currently being sold. The quality of food sold by roadside mobile units, are also being monitored to ensure consumer safety.
In the pre-New Year period between March 12 and April 10, the CAA conducted 2,586 raids countrywide and filed 1,238 court cases.
If any consumer were to feel that they had fallen prey to such malpractices, they should call the CAA hotline: 1977.

Englands Heather Knight, Natalie Sciver and Anya Shrubsole are among Wisdens five Cricketers of the Year.
Shrubsole also becomes the first woman on the front cover of the Wisden Cricketers Almanack.
All three were in the national side, captained by Knight, which beat India in the final to win the 2017 World Cup.
Essex seam bowler Jamie Porter and West Indies batsman Shai Hope complete the list.
Only two women had previously been chosen among Wisdens five Cricketers of the Year, with Englands Claire Taylor included in 2009 and compatriot Charlotte Edwards in 2014.
India captain Virat Kohli was named the leading cricketer in the world, while compatriot Mithali Raj was the worlds leading womens cricketer.
In a new award, Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan, 19, was declared the leading Twenty20 cricketer.
The coveted awards, which began in 1889, are a central feature of the annual Wisden Cricketers Almanack.
It means a huge amount to me personally, Shrubsole told BBC Sport. What I feel most about it is its just such a great reflection of where womens cricket is, and also how much that World Cup win really captured the nation.
You could have put any number of people from that World Cup-winning team on the front cover and it wouldve had exactly the same impact.
ECBs handling of Stokes sad
Wisden editor Lawrence Booth has criticised the England and Wales Cricket Boards handling of Ben Stokes following an incident in September.
The England and Durham all-rounder was made unavailable for selection for the Ashes in Australia this winter after being accused of fighting outside a Bristol nightclub.
Stokes appeared in court in February charged with affray before joining up again with the England team during their tour of New Zealand.
Stokes denies the charge and a trial date has been set for 6 August.
To suspend Stokes while he awaited the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service was reasonable enough, said Booth.
To lift the suspension the moment he was charged was perverse. It was all so sad.
The Wisden Five - the editors verdict
Booth said Knight lifting the 2017 World Cup helped change womens cricket forever, adding that her 364 runs at an average of 45 - including a century against Pakistan - were central to Englands success.
Booth was also full of praise for Sciver. He said: No stroke in 2017 was more memorable than Nat Scivers deliberate deflection between her legs, instantly christened the Natmeg.
But she was more than a one-trick pony. She hit 369 runs in the tournament at an average of 46 and a strike rate of 107, including hundreds against Pakistan and New Zealand, took three for three against West Indies and scored a half-century in the final against India.
India were 191-3 as they chased 229 for victory before Shrubsole sparked a collapse by taking 5-11.
Shrubsole finished with figures of 6-46 - the best in a World Cup final - and also achieved the status of a national hero, added Booth.
Booth said West Indies batsman Hope produced one of the individual performances of the year. Hope became the first man in history to score a hundred in both innings of a first-class match at Headingley during the second Test against England.
Porter was the leading wicket-taker in County Championship Division One last season with 75 wickets to inspire his team to their first title since 1992.  BBC

Extending nonagate ad infinitum
Tomorrow is Sinhala and Hindu Tamil New Year. And the nonagate (the period in which there are no auspicious times) will begin and end. However, in a wider context nonagate or the period of relative inactivity has already begun with the results of the local government elections. The No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister was the do-all and be-all for politicians as well as their followers since then. Country was virtually paralyzed, notwithstanding even the anti-Muslim mini-pogrom. Even after its defeat in Parliament the nonagate continues, with the Cabinet itself paralyzed by the SLFP boycotting its Sessions. Strange times and strange behaviour, indeed!
Some argue that the nonagate is much longer and that it started soon after the first 100 days of the Yahapalana Government. Whatever it is, the state of inactivity continues with no end in sight.
No Confidence Motion 
Those who stand for the abolition of the Executive Presidency say that the incumbent President by his force of example has proved that the post could be dispensed with no loss to the country. He has failed to deliver. Fighting corruption, reinforcing Rule of Law, ensuring a decent standard of living to the masses, forging national unity and defeating chauvinism, eliminating nepotism and political interference in administration etc., - in each of these counts he has failed to deliver. His whole time was and is still devoted to chasing a mirage unity of the SLFP, starting perhaps in good faith but deteriorating later to seeking perpetuation in office with an eye to 2020 elections.
Vacillation, inconsistency, irrationality, betrayal and speaking untruth were characteristics that the people abhor in a leader. The 6.2 million that voted for change in January 2015 was no different. They had placed their trust in President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. As things stand today that trust placed in both of them has been shaken.
The defeat of the No Confidence Motion gave them another chance for redemption. The electoral defeat and the unscathed survival after the No Confidence Motion could have brought them to their proper senses. Instead what we see is a perpetuation of the status quo ante.
In an extra-ordinary twist of moral principles the President seems to oppose the resignation of Ministers who openly displayed their no confidence in the Prime Minister (and hence the Government too). It is much more honourable for the official SLFP to resign from the Government and let the UNP carry on with a minority government rather than staying in the Consensus government and ruin it from within.
One could recall that most of the 16 Ministers and MPs of the SLFP who voted for the No Confidence Motion were not elected to Parliament on the popular mandate that brought President Sirisena to power. They actually campaigned against him and the principles that he then stood for. They are more like thieves who dine and wine in a house that does not belong to them (or they have surreptitiously crept in).
How much better would it be, if our politicians learn to guard their wide mouths At one instance, they wax eloquent on their abhorrence of corruption and vow not to sit with them in the same Cabinet and in the next instance invites them to join in the formation of a Government.
Questions have been raised about the discussions the Tamil National Alliance had with the United National Party prior to the No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister. They have openly unabated. Those discussions were about demands of the people they represent but there was no written agreement. Even a written agreement is not an unusual practice in politics. For example, prior to the 2015 Presidential election President Sirisena gave an undertaking to make Ranil Wickremesinghe the Prime Minister. However, attempts are being made to give a communal twist to the discussions alleging that the country has been betrayed to separatists.
With the JO /SLPP taking the lead in the crusade against this so-called betrayal with overt and support from what remains of the official SLFP including its leaders, an early solution to the national question as well as Constitutional reforms is impossible before 2020. Thus the nonagate will continue unabated.
Man-made obstacles 
The focus of the government will obviously be on the Provincial, General and next Presidential election as is already evident from the sayings and dealings of politicians and the enthusiasm shown by sections of the media in opportunistically promoting candidates. Hence any governance, leave alone good governance, will be not among their priorities. The result would be anarchy and disorder. Meanwhile, trivial issues will be blown up disproportionately to keep the followers amused and perplexed at the same time.
As far as the economy is concerned, balance of payments as well as the balance of trade will likely deteriorate while the devaluation of the rupee and the escalation of the payment of debt and interest are inevitable. It is doubtful whether the setbacks in the agricultural sector due to natural factors such as the unprecedented drought and man-made obstacles such as the non-punctual availability of fertilizers and the high prices of agricultural inputs could be reversed in the interim period before the next presidential or parliamentary elections.
Experience of the last three years does not justify any new confidence in the ability of the Government to implement a crash economic recovery programme that Minister Champika Ranawaka and others speak of. A clear understanding of the strategic path of economic development and the policies to be followed should precede such an action plan.
Whatever it is, there will be no dull moment in local politics. Re-alignment of political forces is already on the cards. There will also be many lateral movements or crossovers across the political spectrum. Vertical movements or leadership changes would be rather cosmetic. Nor will there be any reduction in the antics of politicians whether it is lying prostrate in the middle of the road, fake suicide attempts such as hanging from ceilings, staging fast unto deaths albeit with surreptitious feedings etc.

Former Sathosa chairman  granted bail
Former Lanka Sathosa Chairman Nalin Ruwanjeewa Fernando arrested for allegedly misappropriating Rs.39 million Sathosa funds during the last Presidential Election, was yesterday ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
While ordering the suspect to be released on bail, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne observed that the alleged offences cannot be considered as offences committed under Public Property Act since Lanka Sathosa comes under the purview of Company Act.
The suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.25,000 with two sureties of Rs.300,000. An order was also issued preventing the suspect from leaving the country.
The FCID had commenced an investigation against former Sathosa Chairman and for Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage in connection with importation of 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draught boards during the previous regime.
On April 06, the Court of Appeal had dismissed a writ petition filed by former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage who sought an order preventing the FCID from arresting him for allegedly committing offenses under Penal Code and the Public Property Act while importing sports equipment.

## Title: A future for  GMOs in Sri Lanka
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, April 13, 2018 - 01:00
A future for  GMOs in Sri Lanka
Genetically modified organisms are a big story in India. More than 90 percent of Indias cotton crop, which is one of the largest in the world, is genetically modified for pest resistance.
But, nearby Sri Lanka doesnt have a significant presence of GM crops or GM food at all. In fact, according to available government data, there arent any GM crops or products being produced or sold in the island.
Janitha Liyanage, Head of FoodScience and Technology Department, Sabaragamuwa University.
That does not mean there couldnt be in the future, though.
Many scientists think that changing climatic and economic conditions could make certain GM crops are desirable in the domestic market.
Due to the persistent droughts experienced in the dry zone during the past few years, agricultural productivity in Sri Lanka has been negatively impacted, said Janitha Liyanage, Head of the Food Science and Technology Department of the Sabaragamuwa University, in an interview.
He said, he sees a way forward with genetic engineering.
Introduction of crop species produced by (genetic engineering) with increased yield and with resistance to environmental stresses, as well as pest and weed resistance, may be an ideal solution, provided that they are implemented in a proper manner.
In an attempt to ensure the safe introduction of GMOs in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, launched the National Bio-safety Framework Project in March.
The projects aim is to set up screening and testing procedures to analyze the risks to human health and the surrounding environment of any GMO brought into Sri Lanka.
Before we put it on the market, it must be safe and when it makes it to the market, we must tell people what it is, said Shanaka Gunawardena, the Manager of the new Bio-safety Project.


Screening for safety 
Right now, the project is operating from a small office in the Environment Ministry in Battaramulla. In a site visit last week, many boxes were still unpacked, while the staff was rushing through various meetings between different Ministries and stakeholders.
They are starting a two-year journey to try to identify, assess and control the rollout of any GMO coming into the country.
By the end of 2020, we will have everything running, Gunawardena said. Just like other technologies, biotechnology and bio-safety need to go hand-in-hand, he argued.
Say you develop a vehicle, he said. You cant just make it and then immediately go ask people to drive it.
Some larger countries, such as the United States, have already been growing GM crops for years.
Genetically Modified mustard seeds.
Put simply, a GMO, or genetically modified organism, is an animal or plant whose genetic material has been manipulated to express certain traits through genetic engineering techniques.
The type of GM cotton grown in India for example, has been engineered to produce certain toxins to deter pests such as bollworm. In the US, much of the soybean crop is herbicide-tolerant.
But critics consistently warn of the unintended side effects of genetic engineering. GM crops can contaminate surrounding crops or wild plant varieties, while some studies have shown eating GM food can negatively affect human health.
Sri Lanka has always taken a cautious approach in allowing GMOs to come into the country. In 2000, it signed the Cartagena Protocol on Bio-safety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, an international agreement to ensure the safe handling of GMOs.
But the country did not adopt it until 2004.
Movement on bio-safety has been slow since. Though Parliament amended the Food Act in 2006 to require labeling of GMOs being sold to the public, the capacity to adequately detect and analyze the risk of such products was never developed, according to Gunawardene.
Under the law, if you are bringing GM food products, you must go through the food authority and label it, he said. The cutoff for labeling something as GM is, if more than 0.5 percent of its contents come from GM ingredients.
But Gunawardene said the current technology available can only detect GM contents in a product if its above 10 percent.
You can come along with the regulation, but if you dont have the capacity, how are you going to regulate that, he asked.
The result is that theres a lot of uncertainty about the presence of GMOs in the country. The Environment Ministry hired the genetics lab GeneTech to test basic consumer products such as butter, ketchup, and cereal for GMOs in 2009, 2011 and 2014. Nothing showed up, but Gunawardene warned that it does not mean there might be small amounts of GMO ingredients in other products the tests had missed.
PlantQuarantine in Katunayake.
So, after a long dead period in legislation, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization proposed lending technical assistance to the government to develop a robust risk assessment programme, Gunawardene said.
Along with financial support from the Global Environment Facility, new regulations are now going through the legal draftsmans office to provide the Environment Ministry the power to identify and assess any GMOs imported into or developed in the country.
Under the new proposed laws, if someone wants to bring a (GMO) for any reason, they must send an application to the environment ministry, he said.
The Ministry will then look at the application, and forward it to the relevant sectoral authority, such as the Agriculture Department or Ministry of Health. That authority has to do a full risk assessment, using the expertise of the Bio-safety Project and then provide a public report and recommendation on the product.
Lab tests will be performed at entry points, such as the plant quarantine at Katunayake Airport, Gunawardene said.
More than 90 percent of Indias cotton crop is genetically modified.


Existing fears 
Gunawardene hopes the new project can calm peoples fears about GM products and ensure safe implementation for farmers or importers looking to introduce GMOs.
Research shows that many Sri Lankans are already wary about buying GM food.
A 2012 study from the Postgraduate Institute of Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya, found that in a survey, nearly 70 percent of the respondents felt that GM foods were a risk to health.
57 percent of respondents said, they would never buy a GM product, while 93 percent felt that labeling GM food as such was very important.
The consumer should be given the choice, said Jagath Gunawardene, an environmental lawyer independent from the bio-safety project. The consumer should be given the information and choice, though it might hurt the profits of some companies.
Drought conditions in the Northern Province last year.
Gunawardene said, he suspects that the labeling requirement, as well as a previous blanket ban on the import of GMOs, has discouraged companies from importing them to Sri Lanka.
Shanaka Gunawardene, of the National Bio-safety Project said, he hopes the new bio-safety framework will encourage domestic innovation with genetic engineering.
Citing ongoing experiments with drought-resistant rice at the University of Colombo, currently, its at a stalemate, he said. They tell us that (they) cannot proceed, because they dont know what to do next. Without a safety measure, theres no clear next step in taking the product to market.
And researchers here seem united in the opinion that growing GM crops will be necessary in the future.
The United Nations forecasts that the global population will increase from 7.2 billion today to 8.1 billion in 2025, with most of the growth taking place in developing countries, said Liyanage, of the Sabaragamuwa University Food Science and Technology Department.
In this context, GMOs have the potential to (increase yields) and (reduce) reliance upon synthetic pesticides and herbicides, he said.
That is, if the challenges regarding safety testing, regulation, policies, traceability and food labeling are properly addressed, he added.
In his office in Battaramulla, Gunawardene sketched a worst-case scenario for his programme: Imagine we find some farmer in a certain place, and all the native varieties around it are just dying, because of some GM crop that wasnt (screened), he said.
Then it will be too late, he said.
Its their job now to make sure that doesnt happen.

Hemmathagama Post Office failed to provide grants, elders allege
Elders of the Hemmathagama village complained that the main post office of the area had failed to provide their annual grants, yesterday. Elders receive a grant of Rs. 2,000, they said and added that they had received grants prior to the Sinhala and Tamil New Year during the past years.
Post officers said that the Mawanella Divisional Secretariat office had not provided the money to the Hemmathagama post office.
The elders had been waiting at the post office for hours, while expecting to receive grants and some had even travelled for over three hours to get to the post office. The elders further said they arrived on Tuesday (11), only to be disappointed.
When inquired, the Mawanella Divisional Secretary said that the Divisional Secretariat had not said that the grants would be given before the New Year.
We give these grants on April 15, every year. However, we would give the grant on April 16 as the 15th is a holiday. The Divisional Secretariat annually spends Rs. 4.3 million for these grants and we havent got the funding from the government yet. We have 250 adults in our division, she added.
However the officials of the post office stated that the grants were given to the elders before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year during the past years.

Kandy remembers sports promoter EW Balasuriya
EW Balasuriya, Kandys versatile sportsman, sports benefactor, philanthropic, and above all a gentleman, was remembered on his eighth death anniversary. He died on April 6, 2010.
Balasuriya started his education at Dharmaraja College and later at Ananda College. He excelled at cricket as an opening batsman. During his playing days, he was rated as one of the steady opening bat with an array of strokes. He was known as EW and Bala and was a well-known figure in Kandy and Sri Lanka. He was there to give a hand to every sport, social work and education.
Only those who moved with this great gentleman knew about his other social activities in which he was deeply involved. There was hardly any sporting event in Kandy in which he was not involved in. His pet sports were rugby and cricket. The encouragement he gave to players and clubs by way of financial assistance, advice and guidance is well known to many.
As a donor he was unique and, unlike most others, he was freely available to all sportsmen at any time. He was one-time secretary of the Central Province Cricket Association and later hit the top spot when he organised the first official Test match at the Asgiriya Stadium in Kandy when Gamini Dissanayake was president of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka. He gave a big hand to Kandy by helping the Municipal Council to build the Mahiyawa Crematorium, and to convert the Bogambara grounds into a stadium in 1972. EW had the gift of making people feel exalted and raised their spirit by a few words of comfort or expression of support. Dont worry, you do whatever you like I will give the backing, I am there with you, were his favourite words. He also gave a big hand to the Dharmaraja College swimming pool project.
In the field of rugby, he is the person who founded the Kandy Lake Club in 1962 and Kandy RFC. EWs idea of forming this club was to give the unknown ruggerites a chance. He was a great rugby developer. His first rugby side was coached by Maurice Perera, the famous All Ceylon prop forward and coach and Sydney Ratwatte.
He also gave a big hand for cricket and Kandy Lake Club producing top cricket teams and cricketers in the 1960s and making them champions of Central Province. He is no more, but his memory will remain forever in the minds of all those who knew his qualities. He will not be forgotten by the sports-loving public of Kandy.

New Year harvests  progressive values  and ethics - President
The evolution of human civilisation has taken place from era to era enriching the people as cultured entities. The unique cultural events celebrated by various people around the world indicate the affinity and utmost dedication towards their traditional heritages, President Maithripala Sirisena said in his New Year message.
The Sinhala and Tamil New Year showcases the traditional riches of the Eastern people.Aluth Avurudda is indeed an introduction of a new human with a new vision and a new attitude to the society. By conforming a study of oneself during the transitional time of the inauspicious period, this advanced person performs New Year rituals, enters the society as a close relative carrying the message of peaceful co-existence and social reconciliation,the President said.
The New Year binds with the traditional customs which blooms inter relations and family relationships and showers the human thoughts with refreshing fragrance which flows to the future with our deep understanding and respect we have for the traditions of the New Year.
By deeply studying this glorious cultural event, which harvests progressive values and ethics to the whole society and celebrating it, we can surely collect a bountiful harvest of peace and prosperity.
Another invaluable aspect of New Year celebrations is that they depict the lively bond which the humans share historically with the nature and how this occasion is utilised to express gratitude to the nature, thus exhibiting the great virtues of our ancestors that carried forth for generations.
Sharing such great values with everybody, I wish all the Sri Lankans who are living in the country and outside, a Sinhala and Tamil New Year filled with peace and prosperity, the President said in his New Year message.

Nimali, Gayanthika  flop in womens 800m
Two Sri Lankan women athletes Nimali Liyanaarachchi and Ganyanthika Abeyratne competing in heat number one and three were complete disappointments for Lankan fans here in Australia who made their way from faraway places of Australia to witness these athletes in action. None of them showed any impressive performances in the womens 800 metres heats and failed to qualify for a place in the final.
Nimali and Gayanthika who have between them shared the national womens 800 metres record could finish seventh and eighth respectively in their heats.
Gayanthika trailed behind the lead pack for the entire race and finished with a time of 2:04.72 which was far below her personal best of 2:02.55 which is the current national record for the event.
The winner of the heat Caster Semanya of South Africa who is a favourite for the gold clocked 1:59.26.
Nimali also suffered the same fate as her team mate failing to keep pace with the rest of the field and finished with a time of 2:08.52. Kenyas Emily Cherotich Tuei won the heat with a time of 2:00.58.
In fact the two Lankans were unable to achieve their personal best during the heats which can be considered one of most disappointing performances. Gayanthika speaking after the event said that she was not satisfied with her own performance and noted that up to around the 600 meters mark she was keeping well but soon felt the heat as the other runners piled on the pressure.
She said that she would in future concentrate on running in the 200 metres for the forthcoming Asian Games.
Gymnastics
At the time of going to press Rhythmic gymnastics were in progress for the second day in Coomera Indoor Stadium. Sri Lanka only competitor for the this event Anna-Marie Ondaatje who did well last night to aggregate a total of 44.300 in the Individual All-Round Final is set to continue her best form during the ongoing events scheduled for the evening at the same venue.

NO DRAWBACK TO FOREIGN INVESTMENTS
The Opposition is trying to create a fear psyche among would be investors in Sri Lanka as part and parcel of a sinister move to destabilize the economy, Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne yesterday.
Releasing a statement to the media, the State Minister said these allegations by the Opposition were baseless, especially since the country achieved the largest FDIs in history last year.
Speaking further, he categorically denied claims that the government mulled amending the Companies Act to send the details of persons having 25 percent of the shares in Public Limited Companies to the CID to inquire on acts of money laundering.
He added that there was also no basis in saying that wider powers were to be given to the CID to question directors and shareholders of private companies.
The government recently introduced special initiatives to strengthen the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism regime by amending the Companies Act No.7 of 2007.
This amendment approved by Cabinet incorporates the requirement of maintaining of a register, which contains details of the beneficial interest in shares or warrants or similar interest held by any individual who owns 25 percent or more of the issued shares of any public limited company, he said.
Accordingly every public limited company will have to file records of such beneficial interest in the share, warrant or any other interest along with the personal details of the individual concerned with the Register of Companies annually along with the annual returns of the company.
The State Minister noted that these measures were taken as Sri Lanka was recently listed among the high-risk countries for money laundering by the Inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the European Union.

In areas where even a single cultivation could not be completed during the Yala and Maha Seasons, the proposed project would be implemented to provide assistance for more than 500 farmer families where this cultivation is to be conducted using a minimum amount of water from the Inginimitiya Irrigation Project.
In addition, assistance had been provided to farmers for the cultivation of additional crops, while a project to pump water by utilising solar power, a multipurpose weed-suppressing rotary system, small-scale machinery and a programme on providing incentives to young agricultural entrepreneurs, would be conducted soon. The said project, which would be carried out under the Food Production National Programme operative under the Presidents Office, would deploy grants for the benefit of framers and consumers.

Red tape affecting countrys forward march - Minister
Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to give leadership to end red tape in public administration.
Ranawaka speaking at a ceremony in Thalapathpitiya yesterday to begin the construction of a 30-storeyed middle class housing complex consisting of 400 housing units, brought the attention of the PM that they have to face inordinate delays when carrying out development work owing to the administrative red tape in the public sector.
We have to go through a number of institutions to get the greenlight for a development project. There are 123 public institutions in this country that deal with land affairs. In order to have the land for a development purpose, we have to go through many of those institutions and this is really annoying. For example, a simple mistake of a single digit of a file number once delayed our work for 18 long months as we had to go through all those institutions again after rectifying the error. I urge the President and Prime Minister to come up with some convenient method for us to cut administrative red tape, he stated.
Making the public sector independent is not enough. We must make it efficient. In Korea, there is a single-window approach for development work and that is very convenient. The functions of our public institutions must be separated in a proper and scientific method, he added.
Ranawaka pointed out that Maharagama, Kaduwela and Kotte must be declared as one municipal unit for the smooth functioning of the emerging fully-fledged city housing a large number of key administrative buildings and middle class population.
Commenting on middle class of the country, Ranawaka said, The middle class are the pioneers of development, innovation and political change. They will be the future political activists. In national elections, their votes decide which side would win.
The Prime Minister, agreeing to the ministers views on the middle class, further added that a strong middle class is necessary for the development of the country. The middle class is growing. Today the middle class means not only the professionals and businessmen, but also highly skilled labourers and technicians. The Government has allocated more money to provide for their housing needs, he said.
The PM turned the first sod for the new fully-fledged middle class housing complex in Sri Jayewardenapura Hospital Road in Thalapathpitiya. The estimated cost for the project is Rs 7 billion. A Chinese company is undertaking the construction work. It is the fifth housing complex constructed under the Viyathapura project initiated by the Urban Development Authority.

Saudis shoot down rebel  missiles, drones
SAUDI ARABIA: Saudi Arabia said its air defences on Wednesday intercepted ballistic missiles fired from rebel-held Yemen at Riyadh and the south of the kingdom where two drones were also shot down. Yemen's Shiite Huthi rebels said their cross-border barrage marked the launch of what their leadership has dubbed "the year of ballistics".
The attacks prompted swift condemnation from a Saudi military spokesman, who said the kingdom would respond "with resolve".
A missile launched from Sadaa, the Huthis' stronghold in northern Yemen, "towards Riyadh was successfully intercepted" by Saudi air defences, said Colonel Turki al-Malki, spokesman for a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Huthis.
The announcement came after an AFP journalist witnessed explosions and heard three blasts over the capital, which has come under repeated attack by Huthi rebels. Malki said Saudi forces also intercepted two missiles in the southern Jizan and Najran provinces, close to the border with Yemen.
Saudi Arabia has since March 2015 led a coalition of Arab states fighting to roll back the Huthi rebels in Yemen and restore its neighbour's internationally-recognised government to power.
Nearly 10,000 people have since been killed in the conflict, in what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Saudi Arabia accuses its rival Iran of smuggling missiles to the Huthis -- a charge Tehran denies.
Wednesday's attacks were claimed by the rebels via their news outlet Al-Masirah.
"The missile force carried out a large-scale ballistic missile attack on various parts of Saudi Arabia," Al-Masirah said.
It named the defence ministry in Riyadh, King Abdullah Economic City in Najran and the Saudi Aramco facility in Jizan as the targets. The Huthis said the attacks were timed to "inaugurate the ballistic year announced by the President".
Saleh al-Sammad, head of the rebels' supreme political council, in a speech earlier this week declared 2018 would be "the year of ballistics".
As the announcement on the missile interceptions emerged, Malki also said in a separate statement that Saudi air defences had shot down two unmanned Yemeni drones in southern Saudi Arabia. One of the drones was targeting the Abha international airport in Asir province, which led to a temporary suspension of air traffic. Upon coalition inspection, "it turned out to be a hostile Huthi drone with Iranian components", Malki said.
A second drone was identified while approaching a "civilian object" in Jizan province, he added.
The Huthis claimed attacks on Abha airport and Saudi Aramco, located in Jizan, publishing an infographic of the "Qasef 1" drone on Al-Masirah.
Oil giant Aramco downplayed the attacks, saying its "operations and facilities, including our facilities in Jizan, are operating normally and safely". - AFP

SLFP should quit Unity Government - SB
Former Minister S.B. Dissanayake said the SLFP should quit the Unity Government and let the UNP form their own government yesterday.
He said that his group comprising 16 SLFP parliamentarians have suggested to the Central Committee to quit the unity government.
The CC will take a decision on whether to take this Unity Government forward after the Presidents return from London next week, Dissanayake said.
Sixteen SLFP Ministers, State Ministers and a Deputy Minister resigned from their ministerial posts after voting in favour of the impeachment presented against the Prime Minister.
Former Minister S.B. Dissanayake speaking to media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters yesterday on behalf of the team of sixteen members said their team will be no longer with the unity government and therefore they will sit with the Opposition.
He said that they will work under the chairmanship of President Maithripala Sirisena further aiming to strengthen the SLFP and the UPFA further.
We are with the SLFP under the leadership of its Chairman, President Maithripala Sirisena to strengthen the party further and we will build a cordial rapport with leftist parties to create a broader and strong opposition he said.
According to him their team has made a suggestion to the party Central Committee (CC) to quit from the Unity Government letting the United National Party (UNP) form their own government.
However when asked whether they will join the Joint Opposition, he stressed that they will not join the Joint Opposition, but will stay with the SLFP and the UPFA.
Even though they sit with the Opposition, the SLFP will support with every fruitful and positive move of the UNP government if the UNP forms their own government.
Former Ministers Dayasiri Jayasekara and Chandima Weerakkody said there is no use of wasting time with the Unity Government anymore and will play the role of the Opposition. They also noted that the SLFP should quit from the Unity Government and let the UNP to form their own government.
We are keeping a cordial rapport with the JO, as the majority of the JO is SLFP parliamentarians. But at this juncture we will fulfill task of the opposition without sitting with the Joint Opposition Dayasiri said.
The party Central Committee should take the decision on whether to bring this Unity Government forward.That decision will be taken at the next CC meeting, he said.
MP Dayasiri said the behaviour of both UPFA and SLFP General Secretaries cannot be accepted. But they dont want to clean their dirty linen in public but those issues will be taken up at the CC of the party. Former Sate Minister Dilan Perera said certain SLFPers are working with the UNP secretly. According to him, the test conducted to ascertain the suitability of the Unitary Government was not a success. Parliamentarians Tharanath Basnayake, Anuradha Jayaratne and Thilanga Sumathipala also participated in the press conference.

SLJGJ condemn killing of Palestinian journo
The Sri Lanka Journalists for Gobal Justice (SLJGJ), while condemning the killing of Palestinian journalist Yasser Murtaja while on duty, yesterday, called upon the Israeli authorities to hold to account those who shot and killed Murtaja and those who gave the orders.
The SLJGJ, in a statement issued under the signature of its President and former Editor-in-Chief of the Daily News Jayatileke de Silva and Secretary Mahinda Hattaka, said every civilized nation should ensure the safety of journalists and recognize the role played by the messengers and watchdogs.
Here is the full statement: "The Sri Lanka Journalists for Global Justice (SLJGJ) calls upon journalists and peace loving people worldwide to unite in condemning the killing of Palestinian journalist Yasser Murtaja while on duty.
"The SLJGJ also condemns comments by Israeli Defence Minister justifying the killing and calls upon the Israeli authorities to hold to account those who shot and killed Murtaja and those who gave the orders.
"Murtaja, a journalist attached to the Palestinian news group Ain Medal, died on April 7, a day after he was shot by an Israeli solider, while he was covering the Palestinian Land Day protests. Five other journalists were injured in the firing.
"It is the duty of every civilized nation to ensure the safety of journalists and recognize the role they play as messengers and watchdogs. The killing of Murtaja only confirms the culture of impunity that exists in Israel with regard to Israeli troops crimes against the Palestinian people. The deaths of Murtaja and scores of peaceful protesters in recent days belie Israel's claim to be a democratic nation. Instead, they expose Israel's apartheid nature and colonial mentality.
"According to human rights groups, Israeli soldiers had orders from senior Israeli officials to use live ammunition against Palestinian protesters even if protesters did not pose a threat to the soldiers or civilians.
"We back the United Nations' call for an independent international inquiry into the killing of unarmed Palestinian protesters who are demanding that Israel withdraws from Palestinian land so that the evicted Palestinians could return to their land of birth.
"We also note that according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), no one has been held accountable for the killings of journalists in Israel and occupied Palestine, though 16 journalists have been killed since 1992."

Snake threats, shoe-throwing force IPL team out of Chennai
New Delhi, Thursday: Protest-hit Chennai Super Kings were Thursday ordered to play all their remaining Indian Premier League (IPL) home games 1,200 kilometres away in Pune after players had shoes thrown at them and were threatened with snakes being unleashed into their stadium.
Demonstrations marred Chennais winning return to the IPL after a two-year ban for corruption on Tuesday night, against Kolkata Knight Riders, and when a threat to unleash snakes followed it prompted the officials to act.
Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu state, which has seen volatile protests over the handling of a water-shortage crisis with the authorities saying they could not guarantee security at Super Kings matches.
The IPL governing council assessed the current situation in Chennai and a decision was taken to shift the matches from the MA Chidambaram Stadium to Pune, a league statement said on Thursday.
That means all of Chennais six remaining home games in the cash-rich tournament will be on the other side of India 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) away.
Super Kings all-rounder Shane Watson was among the first to comment.
Very sad for our team @ChennaiIPL and the fans here in Chennai that we wont be playing anymore games here this season. The atmosphere last game was incredible. Lets hope this situation in Tamil Nadu is sorted out asap, the veteran Australian said on Twitter.
I trust a peaceful resolution is found soon for the problems at hand. Thanks to everyone for making the team so welcome, said coach Stephen Fleming, the former New Zealand captain. Senior batsman Suresh Raina also took to Twitter to say he would miss our home ground and the fans. You are always in our hearts, he added in the message. AFP

Speaker calls  for fresh start this New Year
Worshiping the sun which symbolises the expression of gratitude with the realization that one is also a part of nature, is a common feature of many civilizations. Especially those belonging to the civilizations of the Orient where agriculture and religion are interconnected, express their understanding of and gratitude towards nature through the worshiping of the sun, which is the source of life for the entire ecosystem, stated Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in his message marking Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
The message added: For Sri Lankans, the Sinhala and Hindu New Year festival, which unites all people for a common cause and awakens the strength of unity of the people, is a rite that relates to their religion, livelihood and environment as well as a celebration.
The Sinhala and Hindu New Year generates the desire to live in harmony respecting other cultures by reaffirming to us the fact that we all have a common source of life as living beings nurtured by the sun.
With the Sinhala and Hindu New Year, a reorganizing of society takes place with new vigour for the dawning year, by reminding us, yet again of the duties, responsibilities and values that are related to various social strata and relationships.
On this New Year, we should focus not only on creating a fresh environment by cleaning ones house and the surroundings, but also on laying a firm foundation for the future by putting aside by-gone differences, paving way for pure thoughts. This fresh start with unity that is found in each and every household and village has become the essential hope for our motherland.
Everyone who wishes a prosperous future for the country, hopes to see especially His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and all parties of the government working together with mutual respect and understanding to bring about a stable and strong government.
I wish all citizens of Sri Lanka a prosperous Sinhala and Tamil New Year that fulfills all those fair wishes and enlivens good customs and practices!

Three T20Is in Karachi  were nothing but a  humiliating experience
With the very greatest respect and regard for the good people of Pakistan delighting over the return of official international cricket to Karachi and the manner in which they annihilated the West Indies, those three T20 Internationals were, from a Caribbean perspective, nothing but a humiliating experience, both for the way the matches themselves unfolded and for the surreptitious manner in which a team was put to together by a Cricket West Indies administration that has shown absolutely no regard whatsoever for whatever vestiges of pride and prestige are left in the team for which they are ultimately responsible.
I have actually given myself 24 hours from the third and final thrashing administered by Sarfraz Ahmeds men to calm down a bit and not come across as someone fixated narrow-mindedly with West Indian considerations. And of course it has to be considered that since lifting a second World T20 title so dramatically in Kolkata two years ago, Pakistan have comfortably had the measure of the champions, winning six of seven matches (three in the United Arab Emirates, four in the West Indies) before the three-in-a-row romp against a hapless side.
Still, the margin of the defeats  143 runs, 83 runs and by eight wickets with more than three overs to spare  were depressingly one-sided, even if it afforded the tens of thousands of cricket-starved fans at the National Stadium almost non-stop celebration from the first match on April 1 to the finale on April 3, ironically, the same day of the triumph over England in 2016 at Eden Gardens courtesy of Carlos Brathwaites unforgettable four consecutive sixes off Ben Stokes in the last over of the final.
Brathwaite, now installed as the regular captain of the T20 team, wasnt in Karachi along with many other prominent members of the squad who opted not to travel to Pakistan, no doubt still concerned about the security situation there.
Look, I know this is a matter that infuriates many Pakistani fans who may feel that these players are just a bunch of pampered cowards and that the incidents of violence in the country are few and far between and very much distant from the cricket environment.
But you have to appreciate how these occasional attacks are presented in the Western media and how cricketers, many of them, will feel that they are financially secure enough not to have to take any risks in pursuit of the US$25,000 reportedly offered by CWI to players to participate in those Karachi matches.
This West Indies team skippered by Jason Mohammed is what we refer to in these parts as a pick-up side, meaning that you just take on board whoever happens to be standing in the way and available for the trip. As such, nothing can be read into the composition of the squad other than they were prepared to go given the financial incentive and at the urging of an administration required to fulfil a contractual obligation.
No collection of players under the banner of the West Indies should ever be so constituted. Hopefully there will never be such an experience for Pakistan as well.
Add to that the fact that CWI said nothing about the three matches while the Pakistan Cricket Board were providing all the information leading up to the brief series and the abiding impression to Caribbean followers of the game was that this was almost a secretive operation.
While there have been many trials and travails over the past two decades, West Indians are still remembered for the flair, the brilliance and the supreme professionalism they once displayed as a matter of course on the field.
That admiration extends from the Kashmir to Karachi and every other part of the cricketing world.
To see the team presumably representing the people of these tiny territories pulverised from pillar to post begs the question of the purpose of the exercise, other than to give Pakistani fans long-overdue cause for home celebration. At least there was much jubilation because the visitors didnt offer much of a fight. But then, thats what sport is supposed to be  a contest. Those three matches at the National Stadium in Karachi certainly werent that.
In another matter, there is much relief throughout the region that the West Indies will be at the World Cup next year in England. Not celebration, just relief, because for the two-time World Cup winners to have to go through the qualification event in Zimbabwe was seen as hugely embarrassing here.
They made it, yes, but their performances were hardly convincing. In every single match there were periods of real struggle and of course in the critical fixture against Scotland, Jason Holders men benefited from a poor umpiring decision and then torrential rain to sneak a five-run win that confirmed World Cup qualification.
That unconvincing effort, which included three losses to Afghanistan (one in a warm-up match), leaves most West Indian fans with very little expectation for what is to come in just over a years time.
Im glad I waited a day before writing this!

Dudley Senanayakes  45th death anniversary
A true  Liberal  Democrat
Players were allowed to go home for snacks during a cricket match. Once Dudley was at home during a cricket match. He was bleeding from the nose. Father DS, a cricketer himself who played for the same school S. Thomas ignored the minor tragedy and asked the son,
How much did you score
Fifty two
Out for Fifty two
No, retired hurt, a ball hit my nose.
You see, a retired hurt batsman can go and bat later in the innings
Basic treatment with Ice for his bleeding nose, and an aspirin for relief from pain; followed by a quick lunch, he was asked to go back and complete his century. Dudley was back at the crease at the fall of next wicket. Upon his return to pavilion with a century against his name on the board, the batsman was greeted by the doctor who the father had sent to attend on sons bleeding nose: but, the million dollar question is, was DS successful in his effort to inspire the son with the idea of spirit and bravery However, they knew the rules; and played by the rules.
Both Dudley, and his brother Robert followed the father DS in captaining S. Thomas College at cricket. Dudley shined in athletics, football, boxing, and hockey. He won the popular Victoria Gold Medal awarded to the Best All-Round Boy also became its Head Prefect.
Dudleys four times as PM: Incomparable
What is significant is not how many times Dudley became the Prime Minister, but the number of times he was elected by the people as the Head of State, and not just a powerless PM or power shared with one above him, but as the leader of nation. In that sense Dudley Senanayake is incomparable; he never pleaded for leadership, and never intended to consolidate his place in the party through manipulations, but was chosen unanimously. In 1952, he was chosen over the more senior members to be the Prime Minister. It happened after the premature tragic death of father DS Senanayake. But he was not pleased; the staunch liberal democrat, Dudley dissolved Parliament and left the fate of the nation and the UNP in the hands of the people, who overwhelmingly elected him to lead the nation.
Fathers training
D. S. Senanayake used to put his two sons Dudley and Robert, 13 and 11, on their horse, and tied the pedals to the saddle. Dudley nervously held on to the saddle. DS, the newly elected member representing Negombo in the Legislative Council (1924) would whip the horse on its rear. Fear of a fall compelled little Dudley to maintain his balance; a lesson, if you were scared, you would never learn to ride a horse. They say DS met with his death from a fall from his mount  at Galle Face Green; but the truth is that DS who is no mean horseman, that he suffered a heart attack and fell off [medical team attended on him a few months before accurately predicted his fate]. Did the riding lessons made any good to our mild mannered, emotional and sensitive leader Did he ever become an excellent horsemen The unconventional horse riding lessons as a child and motivating young cricketer to go for a century disregarding a broken nose, however, had little effect in his initial years as PM.
HARTAL Shoot-at-sight order and resignation
In July 1953, a mass workers rally was held by the Marxists parties to protest against moves by JRJ, the Finance Minister in Dudleys government to cut back the rice subsidy in full, [25 cts to 70 cts a measure] a legacy of World War II, which the people considered their birthright. Young Marxist firebrands made provocative speeches at a rally held in the city to disapprove the move. The crowds ran riot creating an uproar compelling police to baton charge and tear gas to disperse the unruly crowds. As tension grew among masses, the LSSP and Communist Party leaders saw an opportunity; they called for a Hartal on August 12. The Hartal turned out to be a ferocious mass uprising. At the height of the chaos and confusion, a panicked Cabinet led by Dudley withdrew to a British Warship docked in the Colombo port along with officials, from where the government functioned.
Curfew was imposed under Martial Law and orders issued to shoot at sight. The rioting men and women in many areas stood disobedient; the Police had to open fire causing nine deaths. Dudley Senanayake was singled out in attack by the opposition and he had to countenance by himself on most of criticism, he even collapsed inside the chamber under stress and nervousness. Subsequently he had to be flown to London for treatment, but never recovered from shock, and on his return, this timid and hesitant man taught a lesson by example to all politicians by resigning on his own as Prime Minister and as the leader of United National Party and from politics altogether. He abdicated the throne and the party leadership to the disappointment of masses and of party supporters. After bidding good bye to politics he led a spiritual life sans politics for four years where he was actively involved in spreading Buddhism in Germany. Witnessing the UNPs disaster under Sir John Kotalawala at the 1956 general elections, and with the party and general public demanding his return, Dudley was forced to re-enter politics in 1957. Dudley Senanayake was installed back in leadership position by the senior members, rank and file and masses. A retired hurt batsmen can go and bat later in the innings.
Dudley-Chelva Pact of 1965
The most valuable piece of agreements Dudley Senanayake signed with the moderate Tamil leadership in 1965, [leader of the Federal Party, SJV Chelvanayagam] is commonly known as the above agreementit addressed several key recognition and concessions for the Tamil speaking minorities which included devolution, language, and land matters. It was an arrangement that could have re-enfranchised the Tamil-speaking citizens and sealed a permanent solution to ethnic disharmony. However, his failure to rally sufficient backing for it within the Sinhalese community in the South had disastrous consequences. Had it been put into action five decades ago, it is quite possible that Sri Lanka would have been a dynamic, well-off, peaceful nation. This document illustrated Dudleys idea and insight to recognize what was desirable to arrive at an accommodation with the smaller groups that is divided on the basis of language.
The massive crowds congregated at the Old Parliament and Independence Square was unprecedented in the history. Creating a sea of heads, it was filled with people who thronged to pay homage to their loving leader. The writer joined the queue at Thunmulla a couple of days before the funeral and was able to pay last respects only around seven Oclock in the following morning at Woodlands. Dudley, a man of integrity was a true Liberal Democrat. It was a fitting grand funeral for an unassuming man who engaged in politics not for his or for his kith and kins but for the benefit of poor masses.
All three leaders of his United National Party who ruled from 1953 to 1993, belongs to the ---- long list of opponents who vilified, maligned, and criticized the son of the Father of Nation in most appalling manner on different circumstances. These unreasonable insults and allegations, aiming to harm his reputation started from the day Dudley became Prime Minister for the first time in March 1952, and lasted until the last few days when he was ailing at Durdans hospital preceding his departure on April 13, 1973exactly 45 years ago.

Wolves win to move within  two points of Premier League
LONDON, Thursday - A wonder goal from Ruben Neves helped power Championship leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers to a 2-0 victory over Derby County at Molineux on Wednesday that pushes them to the brink of earning Premier League football next season.
The Portuguese international Neves scored an astonishing dipping 51st minute volley from 30 metres out to seal the win that puts Wolves 11 points clear at the top of Englands second-tier standings.
Diogo Jota, another of Wolves Portuguese contingent, had struck after six minutes to launch the leaders towards a win that leaves them two points from sealing promotion, mathematically, to the Premier League after a six-year absence.
They could seal top flight football by beating their Midlands rivals Birmingham City on Sunday at their Molineux fortress.
Yet if second-placed Fulham fail to beat Brentford at home on Saturday, Wolves could even be celebrating promotion 24 hours before that match.
Nuno Santos entertaining Wolves side have enjoyed a special season but their fans had seen nothing to top the strike from Neves, who controlled a Derby clearance, flicked up the ball and unleashed an unstoppable volley.
The win moved Wolves on to 92 points from 42 games, 11 clear of Fulham, who currently hold the other automatic promotion place by a point from Cardiff City, who have a game in hand.
Derbys own promotion push was dented as they stand fifth among the playoff places on 68 points.
