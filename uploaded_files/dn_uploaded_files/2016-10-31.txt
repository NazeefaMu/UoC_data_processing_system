Careers of Didier Drogba and Steven Gerrard could end soon
LOS ANGELES, sunday: The Major League Soccer careers of Didier Drogba and Steven Gerrard could end without either man kicking another ball as their teams head into nerve-wracking sudden-death playoff games starting Wednesday.
Two of the biggest names of the English Premier Leagues golden era, Liverpool icon Gerrard joined Los Angeles Galaxy in 2015 just a few months before Chelsea legend Drogba headed to Montreal Impact.
However, both Gerrard and Drogbas seasons are hanging by a thread as their respective teams face knockout games this week which could end their campaigns.
The Galaxy face a one-off game against Real Salt Lake at the StubHub Center in Carson on Wednesday, with Gerrard, on the mend from a recent hamstring injury, far from certain to make the matchday squad.
Drogbas Montreal teammates, meanwhilem face an awkward trip to face D.C. United in Washington with the Ivorian striker struggling with a sore back.
Failure of the Galaxy and Montreal to negotiatate their first-round opponents could in all probability spell the end for Gerrard and Drogba.
Gerrard, 36, fueled speculation about his future at the weekend with a social media post interpreted in some quarters as a farewell message to Los Angeles fans.
Living in Los Angeles and playing for the great Galaxy supporters has been a privilege, Gerrard wrote.
You have made this place feel like home to me. This city and this club will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you.
Liverpool return
It came as reports in Britain said former England captain Gerrard had held talks with Liverpool about returning to Anfield in a coaching role.
Gerrard, who was in England earlier this month to undergo treatment on his hamstring, trained separately from his Galaxy teammates on Monday after returning to California.
Galaxy coach Bruce Arena, meanwhile, is bracing for a tough test against a Salt Lake side his team took four points from in the regular season.
I think we played them twice this year, beat them at home and had a tie on the road there, Arena said. Always a good team. Obviously, a team weve seen before in the playoffs. We expect a tough match. Drogba, meanwhile, faces an acrimonious end to a career in Montreal that has unraveled rapidly after a successful debut season.
The 38-year-old has scored 21 goals in 32 appearances for Montreal since making his debut for the club in August 2015.
But Drogbas first full season in the MLS this year has been marked by tension between the player and his club, with the nadir coming on October 16 when the striker refused to be a part of Montreals matchday squad after being told he would not be in the starting line-up.
Montreal President Joey Saputo insisted the feud between Drogba and the club had been settled, though it did not prevent MLS from hitting the player with a fine last week for the no-show.

Flying advertising boards halt South African game
JOHANNESBURG, Sunday: There were flying advertising boards, a wonder goal, floodlight failure and a yellow card for teasing an opponent during the first round of the South African League Cup this weekend.
A sudden gust of wind sent one wooden board into the back of a goal net, two others on to the pitch, and blew over two dugouts during a match in Pretoria.
The wind, torrential rain and lightning forced the match to be temporarily halted before SuperSport United won 1-0 after extra time against Ajax Cape Town.
Zimbabwean Eric Chipeta deflected a close-range shot from Thuso Phala into his net to decide one of four ties that went to an additional 30 minutes.
Luvuyo Memela dribbled past opponents from the centre before beating Namibia goalkeeper Maximilian Mbaeva from inside the box to earn Orlando Pirates a 2-1 win over Golden Arrows.
In a game of great goals, Mpho Makola gave the Soweto Buccaneers an early lead and Wayde Jooste levelled from a superbly flighted second-half free-kick.
Kaizer Chiefs and Maritzburg United found themselves in the dark due to a power failure six minutes from the end of regular time at Soccer City, the 95,000-seat national football stadium in Soweto.
Neither team could manage a goal and Chiefs advanced 4-2 on penalties with the decisive spot-kick coming from debutant Keagan Buchanan. AFP

West Indies A complete clean sweep
West Indies A led by top order batsman Jason Mohammed completed a 3-0 sweep of the unofficial one-day series against Sri Lanka A when they won the third and final match by eight runs on the Duckworth and Lewis rain rule at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Winning the toss for the third successive occasion in the series West Indies A rattled off an impressive score of 305 for five wickets in a game reduced to 47 overs with centuries from Mohammed and Andre McCarthy who added 163 runs for the fourth wicket after they had got off to a poor start losing their first three wickets for 59 in 15 overs.
Mohammed struck eight fours and three sixes in his unbeaten knock of 105 scored off 108 balls and McCarthy slammed 13 fours and 3 sixes in an explosive innings of 102 off 75 balls. Due to bad weather Sri Lanka As target was revised to 257 off 38 overs. They were on target to achieve that total but fell short by eight runs.
Opener Danushka Gunathilaka contributed a fine half-century 58 off 60 balls (7 fours, 1 six) and there was all round contributions from the rest of the batting but it was just not enough to get them over the line. Sri Lanka A finished on 248-7 when the overs ran out.
