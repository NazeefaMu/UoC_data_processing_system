Sad Cook quits as England Test captain
London: Alastair Cook resigned as England Test captain on Monday after a record 59 matches in the role, saying it was a sad day but the right decision for the team.
Yorkshire batsman Joe Root is the strong favourite to take over with an announcement expected in the next fortnight, as England build towards the Ashes in Australia at the end of the year.
Cook, Englands leading scorer in Tests with 11,057 runs, became captain in August 2012 and led his country to Ashes glory on home soil in 2013 and 2015 as well as series wins in India and South Africa.
Its been a huge honour to be England captain and to lead the Test team over the past five years, Cook, 32, who intends to carry on playing Test cricket, said in a statement.
Stepping down has been an incredibly hard decision, but I know this is the correct decision for me and at the right time for the team.
Cooks decision to stand down follows Englands 4-0 series defeat in India at the end of last year, which put pressure on him to quit.
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said a proper process had started to appoint a successor, with the team not in Test action again until July.
Cook, who also led England in a record 69 one-day internationals between 2010 and 2014, is the countrys most capped Test skipper and has scored more Test centuries than any previous captain.
He was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2012 and ICC (International Cricket Council) World Test Captain in 2013.
He tendered his resignation to England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Colin Graves on Sunday.
Its a sad day personally in many ways, but I want to thank everyone Ive captained, all the coaches and support staff and, of course, the England supporters and the Barmy Army who follow us home and away and have given us unwavering support, Cook added.
Playing for England really is a privilege and I hope to carry on as a Test player, making a full contribution and helping the next England captain and the team however I can.
Englands director of cricket Andrew Strauss said Cook had made a fantastic contribution and deserves to be seen as one of our countrys great captains.
We now move on with the process of appointing the right successor, Strauss said.
There are a number of established players who are playing formal or informal leadership roles and whilst weve rightly not spoken to anyone in relation to the Test captaincy so far, we can now talk fully and openly within the team.
We expect to be able to make an announcement before the team head to the West Indies on 22nd February.
A classically elegant left-handed opening batsman, the square-jawed Cook took charge of the England Test team following Strausss retirement from the game in August 2012.
In his first tour as captain he led England to a first series win in India in 28 years, hitting centuries in the first three Tests.
His first Ashes series in 2013 ended in triumph and after a harrowing 5-0 whitewash in Australia in 2013-14, England regained the urn in 2015.
Cook oversaw a historic series win in South Africa in 2015-16 and last year England came within one win against Pakistan of topping the ICC Test rankings.
He went 35 Test innings without a century between May 2013 and March 2015, but the milestones have continued to stack up. He was the first England batsman to reach 10,000 and then 11,000 Test runs and sits 10th in the all-time list, 4,864 runs behind the record held by the great Sachin Tendulkar.
Cooks mentor Graham Gooch, the former England captain, told BBC Radio 5 Live he had tried to convince the Essex man to stay in the role.
This type of sportsman only comes once in a generation, maybe less, Gooch said. Hes a great man and hes still got great things to do for his country. AFP

Wandering Minstrel at Country Roads
The Country Music Foundation, the organiser of the 2017 Country Roads concert for children, is proud to announce that globally-famous Wandering Minstrel Keith Potger, founder of The Seekers band, has been added to the line-up for this years 29th anniversary show. The Country Roads concert for children is scheduled for Sunday, March 19 at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Says Keith on his upcoming performance at 2017s Country Roads, I am looking forward to visiting Sri Lanka. Further details about Keiths tour can be obtained by writing to FeizalSamath, CMF founder at [emailprotected]
Born in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), Keiths musical career started well before The Seekers first stormed the UK charts in 1965. He is a self-taught musician who studied 6 string guitar, banjo, mandolin and keyboards. With an eye to a musical future while still at school, he performed in vocal groups which evolved into the internationally famous The Seekers in 1962.
Taking up the 12 string guitar, he composed the distinctive riffs that are a trademark of The Seekers chart topping recordings, Ill Never Find Another You and A World Of Our Own, as well as many other singles and album tracks, augmenting the wonderful lead voice of Judith Durham and the boys ear-catching harmonies and instrumental talents.
The Seekers have toured extensively as a group since 1993. During this period Keith has continued writing and recording original songs. He released his first solo CD Secrets Of The Heart in 2004, followed by Sunday in 2007 and in 2010 he released his mostly self-penned third solo CD, Smile Now. Accompanying himself on his trusty 12 string and 6 string guitars, his Wandering Minstrel style of performance includes material from his solo CDs, Seekers favourites, along with songs and anecdotes from his long career in the music industry. 2015 and 2016 saw Keith on the road again presenting his solo concerts to audiences in Queensland and New South Wales as well as visiting Nashville to co-write material for his fourth solo CD.
Sponsors of the concert include HNB, Dilmah, BBDO, LOLC, Dialog and Cargills.

I am confident we can make it to 2017 WC
Finishing as one of the top four sides in the Super Six stage which is a direct passport to qualify and play in the 2017 ICC Womens World Cup in England will be the utmost priority for Sri Lanka who launches their campaign against India at the P Sara Oval today.
Sri Lanka is just one of 10 nations vying to finish within the first four of the ICC Womens World Cup qualifier that commences today in Colombo.
India is the toughest team in our group and we have to win at least three matches to qualify for the next round, said Sri Lanka Womens cricket head coach Hemantha Devapriya.
We have beaten India before, they are not unbeatable but they have improved in their game. Since the time we beat India half the players who represented Sri Lanka at the time are not there today, main players like Shashikala Siriwardena who is injured. But there are a few players of that winning team in our present squad and they have that mindset behind them, he said.
Sri Lanka is grouped with India, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Thailand in Group A. Group B comprises South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Scotland and Papua New Guinea. The top three sides from either group will advance to the Super Six stage while also carrying forward points they earn against sides which have progressed from their group.
The top four sides from the Super Six stage, in which each side will play three matches against teams from the other group, will complete the eight-team line-up for the ICC Womens World Cup 2017, while the top two sides will battle out for the title in the 21 February final.
Its an advantage playing under home conditions but there is also a bit of disadvantage also because of the pressure as expectations are high for us to do well, said Devapriya.
However the players are ready to perform and take up the challenge. In the last three months since I took over I see about 20 percent development in all areas which is a surprise for me. I expected about 10 percent improvement but I can see that they have improved more than that. Their commitments and the areas they have developed are very pleasing.
Their attitudes have changed and we worked hard. It was a hectic three months and the players also coped up very well to the demands. We had good preparations. We played a lot of practice games with the under 17 boys overall and they are ready for it. Now its all about putting it into practice at the matches and showcasing their talent. They are confident and I can see it in them, he said. Sri Lanka played a warm-up game against Pakistan on Sunday which they lost by three wickets. But what was more pleasing to the coach than the result was that Sri Lanka was able to top 200 in their innings.
Its a plus point scoring over 200. We couldnt win because Pakistan batted well and at the same time we didnt bowl well. We didnt have the pace to bowl on that wicket. The result didnt matter much because both sides were trying out various things ahead of the tournament. The players know what to do, they have indentified their roles and I am confident they will do their best, said Devapriya, a former wicket-keeper/batsman of the pre-Test era.
Devapriya said that his team will be banking on senior players like Eshani Lokusuriyage, Chamari Atapattu, Prasadani Weerakkody, Dilani Manodara and Chamari Polgampola to lead their batting and in the bowling Udeshika Prabodhani, captain Inoka Ranaweera, Iroshi Priyadharshani and Chamari Atapattu. Devapriya said that he expected the tracks for the matches would be 50-50 and would give equal chances to both batters and bowlers.
He said that he was pleased to see that the promotional program being carried out by Sri Lanka Cricket to raise the standard of womens cricket in the country is proving to be a success.
There about 2000 students keen to play cricket. SLC is organizing an under 21 district tournament for them. At the same time there is a group going around picking talent. Thats a good indication that we will have good players coming through. A lot of schools start playing cricket around the age of 16. I have seen young players but they are not yet ready to make it big, they have the talent. Its our responsibility once this tournament is over to identify these players and get them into the main stream and groom them, Devapriya said.

AG wants to be transparent
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said he is committed to stand by the principles of good governance on which the Yahapalana government was formed.
Wijesinghe said as the Auditor General of a country where good governance thrives, he is compelled to execute his duties to the utmost, delivering transparency and accountability.
He questioned as to how he should help achieve good governance if he is supposed to keep secrets from the public.
One of the basic principles of good governance is transparency. I will have to speak up openly and overtly. If the Auditor General has to function in secrecy what good governance would there be he questioned.
Wijesinghe pointed out that when it comes to matters regarding public property, he has no power to keep any matter under wraps and not be accountable to the public.
He also pointed out that with the recent implementation of the Right to Information Act, the public was entitled to have access to information to which he cannot do otherwise.
The public might sue me if they suspect that I suppress important information. I can in no way hide any information from the public, the Auditor General said.
He said he got the Auditor Generals Department website upgraded to upload all audit reports to it, soon after sending them out to respective institutes, for the public to access.
As the Auditor General, I am not ready to write secret-letters to fulfill other peoples whims and fancies. I will execute my duties while securing the sensitive aspects of the public administration, he said.
Wijesinghe said the judiciary is also making an effort on promoting accountability and transparency.
He said the public is starving for justice and accurate information.
The public will only be able to come to a conclusion on certain issues, only if they are privy to multidimensional observations and impartial information,  the Auditor General pointed out.
Speaking on issuing of surcharge certificates, Wijesinghe said under new amendments to the Audit Act, the Auditor Generals powers of surcharge will be extended. Audit surcharge is a statutory remedy available to safeguard the property of the institution subject to audit. In practice, it serves to recover the loss sustained by the Local Authority or university from the persons responsible for such loss.
The Auditor General of Sri Lanka does not possess power of surcharge in respect of government departments, ministries, public corporations and Provincial Councils.
With the new changes, even if a minister discards a surcharge certificate issued by an Auditor General, the Audit Commission can probe into the matter if necessary. So no one indicted will be able to get away with what they have done using political favours, Wijesinghe said.
The Auditor General said issuing a surcharge certificate precedes much inspection, discussion and audit queries.

Alabama, Cuba to strengthen maritime ties
The Alabama State Port Authority and the National Port Administration of Cuba signed a five-year, cooperative agreement to collaborate in port and cargo marketing studies and strategies, engage in promotion and exhibition activities, and share data.
We are seeing increasing demand for normalized trade between the United States and Cuba, and it is our goal to foster relationships between the ports and their maritime communities to further changes in U.S. Cuban trade policy and facilitate improved ocean carriage services to the benefit of our shippers, James K. Lyons, chief executive officer of the Alabama State Port Authority, said.
In October 2016, the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) eased the rule that prohibits a vessel that calls Cuba from entering a U.S. port within 180 days of its departure from Cuba.
While the amendment may allow vessel operators to efficiently deploy their vessels and avoid the 180-day waiting period, ocean carriers must nonetheless comply with all other U.S. restrictions in order to take advantage of the amended rule.
Ocean carries engaged in sanctioned trade between Cuba and the United States can take advantage of the 180-day rule waiver. In addition, ships originating from worldwide ports and transiting through Cuba can take advantage of the waiver as long as the carrier does not load non-sanctioned cargoes bound for the U.S.
U.S. sanctioned trade between Alabama and Cuba principally include poultry and forest products.

Asias growth poles will drive the global economy - ADB
A new chapter of Asia's growth story is being written either side of the Ganges Delta. South Asia is rising. China is striving to reach a new level. Along the Mekong, startling growth is reversing decades of stagnation.
There's just one element missing that could elevate this growth curve to new heights, not just for Asia but globally. If India and other South Asian nations-collectively forecast to grow by 7.3% in 2017-can integrate their dynamic economies into the rest of Asia, they could lift the region to a higher plane of social and economic development-just as Japan and China led Asia into the modern economic era.
An economic engine of this size could potentially erase extreme poverty in the region. Removing obstacles to trade and investment between South Asia, Southeast Asia and other parts of Asia is the key to making this happen. If South Asia and Southeast Asia each cut non-tariff barriers by 50% and trade costs by 15%, gains in South Asia's prosperity would total an impressive 8.9% of GDP, and 6.4% of GDP in Southeast Asia.
The channel for that growth should run along India's east coast, through Bangladesh and Myanmar into the rest of Southeast Asia and China. Myanmar and Bangladesh are ideally located to open the economic floodgates between the economies on the southern side of Asia and those to the east.
These two countries are the connective tissue between Asia's growth poles. Given the paucity of trade between South Asia's constituent countries-only 5% of total trade is done with each other compared to 35% in East Asia and 26% in Southeast Asia-Asia's next growth spurt is more likely to come from synching strengths across sub-regions in ways that compensate for their respective weaknesses.
This is happening, but not fast enough. Trade between the economies of South Asia and Southeast Asia climbed from just $4 billion in 1990 to $90 billion in 2013. But that's just a fraction of the potential gains. Large economies on either side of the Ganges need to work harder to build the mutual trust, consensus, and political commitment needed to forge closer trade and transport links.
South Asia can take some cues from its eastern neighbors. Their economies grew quickly even after the global financial crisis through new trade agreements, highways, shipping routes, and cross-border logistics.
They plugged themselves into regional and global production networks-not just building products for export, but building components or adding value to products built in multiple countries and striking trade deals particularly between China and neighboring countries. They made it easier to communicate by phone and internet connections between countries.
South Asia lacks the institutional framework provided by ASEAN, which has galvanized economic integration throughout Southeast Asia by liberalizing investment and trade regimes, pushing down production and logistics costs. Regional production networks have gravitated to Southeast Asia, attracted by differences in wage and labor productivity levels across countries.
To play an important role in global growth, South Asia's economies need to be more tightly integrated with each other, with Southeast Asia and other parts of Asia. The Trilateral Highway connecting India, Myanmar and Thailand will deliver physical connectivity. But for such links to translate into efficient movement of goods it is crucial to develop more robust value chains with Southeast Asia and East Asia.
Market and institutional links are equally important. There has been progress, but more is needed. ASEAN and India have forged a free trade agreement to deepen trade in goods and services and strengthen investment ties. India is partnering with Myanmar to deepen maritime trade by developing Sittwe in northern Myanmar as a deep-sea port.
A host of new economic corridors are another key to connecting Asia's fastest-growing countries. The Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar economic corridor will spur economic integration. The 2,500 km East Coast Economic Corridor (ECEC) along India's east coast includes the Vizag-Chennai Industrial Corridor, which could link into Bangladesh, Myanmar and China and finally to the ports of Vietnam.
The ECEC's strategically located ports provide an opportunity to develop multiple international gateways to connect India with global markets and value-chains. Matching the strengths of India's northeast in products such as wood, rubber, cement and steel to ASEAN's needs would maximize the ECEC's potential as an eastern gateway. There is great scope also for economic corridors connecting India with Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, to maximize the export earnings of these growing regional economies.
For all this to happen, behind-the border barriers to trade in South Asia need to be addressed, including better IT infrastructure and regulatory regimes to make it easier for businesses to grow, innovate, and create much-needed jobs.
Asia's growth poles will drive the global economy for years to come. By standing together, they can take the next step towards even greater prosperity.

Beyond Independence celebrations
We have an elected President and a Prime Minister whose party requires a few votes to muster a simple majority in Parliament. There are no elections to either the Office of President or the Parliament anytime soon. However every day much of news is dominated by reports on who is opposed to whom, charges and counter charges on corruption or actions of a Joint Opposition.
A CPA publication highlights several features of the 19th Amendment including the removal of the Presidents immunity for official acts, reducing the Presidents power in relation to Parliament, reintroducing term limits for the office of the President, taking away the sole power of the President to make appointments to key independent institution and improving transparency in the law making process whilst the President retains power over other aspects of Cabinet appointments, the President is required to act on the advice of the Prime Minister in identifying specific MPs for appointment as Cabinet and other Ministers.
A total of 174 amendments had been submitted for consideration during the committee stage of the Bill (63 amendments by the Government and 111 by the Opposition). Clearly the amendment is an expression of many ideas for the Office of the President and Parliament to govern the country.
A time to govern
If no elections other than the Local Government elections have to be held, is it not time for Government at all levels to govern While politicians have a right to election in between polls if they want to, it does expose their limitations on governing the country.
For example we are faced with unprecedented challenges caused by climate change. Considerable knowledgeable and literature on what needs to be done is available. A subject Minister during a recent conversation with an expert who had 42 years University teaching experience with a huge volume of published knowledge had asked his key officials five times during the conversation to consult the expert and draft a Cabinet paper. The requests remains ignored for now!
Across the board Officials have become comfortable and govern less and less. Some argue Ministers are involved in the domain of the public officials. There is truth to the argument. Intent to review, KPIs on performances by line agencies have been mentioned. We have heard of Secretaries Meetings in the past. Somewhere between the Secretaries to the President and or Prime Minister would it be difficult to review performances
Optimizing resources
We have enough human resources from Government on the ground. The national Budget is full of opportunities to leave no one behind and to use powers and functions of devolved units such as the Provinces.
Fish and related industry is an example of where we can do a great deal more. The country is surrounded by fishing grounds, our fish is stolen by others and we have inland fishing also at our disposal. However until 2015 our Fisheries Cooperation had never made profits. A next to impossible feat. They are now on track to realize their actual potential.
The 2016 -17 budget provides the following provisions.
Potential to increase the export proceeds at least by five fold in the next three - five years, through the export of not only raw crabs, lobsters, prawns oysters, etc. but also through value addition, including canning and processing. Aquaculture Industry Zones in Hambanthota, Mannar and Batticaloa, allocation -Rs. 500 million. Development of the inland fishery industry will yield multiple benefits, including addressing the nutritional deficiencies, promotion of industries and creation of employment by establishing 100 Integrated Inland Fishery Villages, allocation Rs. 300 million. Ornamental fish industry, which has a significant potential for expansion where the utilization of the out grower system will bring in more synergies, allocation Rs. 25 million.
I would add ensuring all those engaged in fishing are given opportunities to acquire NVQ 2 qualifications graduating upwards including in to deep sea fishing.
In a context in which more fish is harvested than meat globally we can thrive locally and in overseas markets.
Global examples
Solaiman Sheik shows off the harvest from his fathers small pond near Khulna, Bangladesh: freshwater prawns, a profitable export. The family also raises fish in the pond and, in the dry season, rice fertilized by fish wastea polyculture that has tripled output with little environmental downside.
Natures own water filters, giant Japanese scallops thrive on fish waste at an experimental farm off Canadas Vancouver Island. The farm also uses sea cucumbers and help to consume excretions from nearby pens of native sablefish.
At dawn on Chinas Fujian coast, seaweed farmers head out to tend their aquatic fields. Such farms help China grow 12 million tons of food a year with no soil or fresh water and no fertilizer except runoff from the land.
These are examples which are replicable in our fisheries industry yielding considerable benefit to the country and sector as a whole.
This country has ample opportunities to prosper. In the absence of a war to blame all our troubles our political spectrum and public service remain exposed for their inadequacies. Our populace is not ignorant and uninformed. They cannot be fooled all the time.

Britain, Spain advance in Davis Cup
PARIS: Britain was defaulted into the Davis Cup quarter-finals Sunday while Spain edged Croatia to advance and defending champion Argentina battled Italy into a decisive fifth match at a rain-hit tie.
Canada's Denis Shapovalov hit chair umpire Arnaud Gabas in the face with a ball and was defaulted in the deiciding match, handing Britain's Kyle Edmund a 6-3, 6-4, 2-1 triumph and giving Britain a 3-2 victory in the first-round tie at Ottawa.
It was a strange way to finish, Edmund said. I've never been part of something like that. Shapovalov, a 17-year-old Israeli-born Canadian, apologized to Gabas in the referee's office as the umpire was being treated for bruising and swelling of his left eye before being taken to a nearby hospital.
No one is nicer or carries themselves better for a 17 y/o than Shapovalov, Canadian teammate Vasek Pospisil tweeted. Everyone can see that today was an accident. Pospisil had blasted 25 aces in a 7-6 (7/3), 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5) victory over Dan Evans to level at 2-2 for Canada, which was without injured world number four Milos Raonic.
Britain won Saturday's doubles match. Edmund lost to Pospisil in Friday's singles and Shapovalov fell to Evans.
It's a shame that it has happened that way and I feel for the young lad because he's a great talent and he has learned a harsh lesson today, British Davis Cup captain Leon Smith said.
I thought Kyle, from what we saw Friday to the way he came out today, he was absolutely fantastic.
Britain, the 2015 champions playing without top-ranked Andy Murray, advanced to a quarter-final matchup April 7-9 against France with that winner facing either Spain or Serbia in a September semi-final. AFP

Cameroon toast unlikely triumph and look to future
LIBREVILLE: Cameroon celebrated the most improbable of victories at the Africa Cup of Nations on Sunday which coach Hugo Broos hoped would pave the way towards a bright future for his team.
The Indomitable Lions showed remarkable character to come from behind and beat Egypt 2-1 in a brilliant game at the Stade de l'Amitie in Libreville with Nicolas Nkoulou and Vincent Aboubakar scoring to spark wild celebrations.
It was the first time a team had come from behind to win the final since 1994 and it was a first continental title for Cameroon since 2002, their fifth in total.
The triumph, witnessed by a crowd in the Gabonese capital made up of a majority of Cameroonians, completed a remarkable journey for a side who had been written off prior to the tournament.
Eight players, notably the Liverpool defender Joel Matip and the Schalke striker Eric Choupo-Moting, had refused call-ups to the squad, leaving Broos to work with a young and inexperienced side.
That team had already eliminated the hosts Gabon, much-fancied Senegal and Ghana en route to the tournament finale, where they claimed Cameroon's first win against Egypt in a Cup of Nations final at the third attempt.
I brought in some new young players and we started working. We did a good job and now today we have a team, said Broos after Sunday's match.
His man management has been remarkable and on Sunday it was notable that two substitutes scored the goals.
Nkoulou, the Lyon defender, started only once during the tournament and came on as a first-half replacement for the injured Adolphe Teikeu.
Aboubakar, the powerful centre-forward currently playing for Besiktas in Turkey, also started only one game in Gabon, but he had scored the decisive penalty in the shoot-out against Senegal in the last eight and his winner in the final was stunning.
It is the best way to win a final. I think we took a bit of a blow to the back of the head in the first half but the substitutions changed the match in the second half, said the forward Clinton N'Jie.
Defender Michael Ngadeu, one of the stars of Cameroon's run, heaped praise on his Belgian coach, under whom the Indomitable Lions have been beaten just once since his appointment last year.
He is a magician. The team has been reborn under him, said the Slavia Prague defender, who scored the opener in the semi-final against Ghana.
A lot of them didn't believe in him, I'll admit. A lot of Cameroonians criticised him. But today I think he is the hero. He should get a medal for what he has done.
He has given us this solidarity, this mentality.
He has given us a 'joie de vivre'. Cameroon were the first African nation to make a major impression at the World Cup and for a long time were the leading footballing force on the continent, but those days had seemed behind them following recent struggles.

Citizen Participatory Audit in the pipeline
The Auditors Generals Department is planning on implementing a Citizen Participatory Audit to enhance the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector service, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said.
An evaluation system is being developed to assess how successfully a government institution has executed its responsibilities, the Auditor General said.
Wijesinghe was speaking at an event organised by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) at the Mayors Residence yesterday. In a participatory audit, the public gets the opportunity to air out their opinion on the governments process of delivering service and government programmes.
With a participatory audit, the citizens will give their judgement as to how satisfactorily the public administration has executed its responsibilities, the Auditor General said.
For example, the citizens will be able to assess how many times they have to come to a government institution to get some work done. They will reveal how much money they had to spend as bribes to get something done, Wijesinghe said.
He said thus, in the near future, clear accounts provided by a public institute will not be the only yardstick used by the Auditor General to decide on a qualified opinion on an audit report of that institute.
I will take public judgement as a benchmark before giving an opinion on an audit report, the Auditor General said.
He also pointed out with the 19th amendment, the Auditor Generals Department has provisions to audit not only the accounts but also the services provided by government institutions.
This amendment may seem a simple change but it is almost a controversial step.
With this amendment, the Auditor General can even audit the security service in a government institution, the Auditor General pointed out.
The event was organised by the CMC on receiving for the first time after 42 years, a qualified opinion from the Auditor Generals Department on their audit report.
CMC Commissioner V.K.A.Anura pointed out for more than four decades, CMC has received an adverse opinion from the Auditor General on its audit report.

Appeal to USA to save Bangladesh children
I recently read a news from the Daily News that a Bangladeshi father has sought permission from the Government to kill three terminally ill children of his family which melted my heart being unable to treat them anymore. He pleaded mercy killing of his three children from the Government of Bangladesh which really would be a heart rendering predicament for parents nevertheless who belong to any country or community or cast or creed.
This Bengali parent, Hossain, a fruit vendor has described his years of long struggle to cope with the cost of the treatment of a deadly disease called Duchhenne Muscular Dystrophy which his two sons aged 24, 13 and a grandson 8, suffer.
Bangladesh is the poorest country in Asia which lacks free health care and medical treatment for the penury people.
At this pathetic situation of these three children, while congratulating Donald Trump the newly elected president of the USA, I make a very humble appeal to help them to overcome their sufferings and save their lives!

Every composer keeps a voice in mind for a song
The popular Bollywood singer Shreya Ghoshal who is debuting in the MTV Unplugged Season 6 believes that each song demands a certain voice and music composers cast the right voice for that. Every composer keeps a voice in mind for a song, as casting the right voice is important, otherwise the song changes completely. Since people heard me a lot and are aware of my ability to bring certain nuances to the rendition, they know which song is perfect for me, the singer told IANS on a telephonic interview.
Starting her formal music training at a very young age and participating in television music contest Sa Ra Ga Ma Pa, Shreya made her Bollywood debut as a playback singer in Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Devdas and bagged her first National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer at the age of sixteen. She went on to sing not only in Bollywood with songs like Barso Re, Yeh Ishq Haye, Cheeni Kum, Ooh La La, Nagada Sang Dhol and Chikni Chameli among others but also widely in regional languages including Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, Malayalam and Bhojpuri among others.
However, at present, she is comparatively singing less number of songs. I never refused too many songs in life. Yes, I do choose a song because I work in too many languages so there is a time constraint, but I do listen to the song, take time and then say no to it, Shreya said. The singer will be singing six songs on the MTV Unplugged Season 6. The are: Deewani Mastani, Mohe Rang Do, Sun Raha Hai Na Tu, Leja Leja Re, Agar Tum Mil Jao and Lata Mangeshkars Rasm-e-ulfat ko nibhayein.
Though singing before live audience is not a new gig for Shreya, all the songs are going to get a different dimension in unplugged version because of its acoustic instrumentation.
Whether it is Deewani Mastani, Mohe Rang Do or most of my songs, have quite larger than life orchestration. Now break it down to a classy acoustic rendition is a great refreshing change for me. I would love to do it again.
While choosing songs from a long list of hit songs was a real task for her, when asked about why she is singing a Latajis song, she said, I wanted to sing a song of Lata Mangeshkar and Rasm-e-ulfat ko nibhayein is my favorite. I love Madan Mohan ji as a composer and this song is the combination. I love this song.
On the other hand, she is also singing Leja Leja Re, a duet Shreya sung with Ustad Sultan Khan that was written by Irshad Kamil and composed by Sandesh Shandilya.
This time, Sultan sahaabs son Sabir Khan will be playing the Sarangi. I think I will be reliving some moments through these songs. Its wonderful, shared Shreya.

Lokuge warned that the government will fall into more trouble than it has faced with regard to the controversial bond issue, if it sells the national carrier to the aforesaid company.
The JO member said two prominent individuals in the management team of the company who were involved in the local transport sector in the past had numerous accusations of fraud and corruption against them.
The workers of several companies run by the two individuals had complained that the management have failed to pay their social security funds such as the EPF.

The Great Wall : Underwhelming!
The wall stands or the world falls. Protect whats yours, is what this war epic essentially says, of course with no reference whatsoever to the current US-Mexico situation.
Hollywood potboiler
Nevertheless, the films timing couldnt have been more inappropriate as the story reveals why the wall was built. What adds to its predicament is its predictable plot, reminiscent of formulaic Hollywood blockbusters.
The splendid use of vivid colours, imagery and Chinese background score initially get your hopes high but The Great Wall soon turns into a monster-slashing, CGI heavy, dated Hollywood potboiler with no soul. If you seek nothing more than popcorn entertainment and some visual thrill, this movie may do it for you but otherwise, it fails to amaze. While Yimou lets you get a glimpse of his unique vision, a standard script and his drive to please the global audience (predominantly mainstream Hollywood fans), affect his storytelling. You dont get to experience anything new.
Fighting skills
Matt Damons Chinese film debut (in English language), is as underwhelming as his last Jason Bourne movie. He seems utterly uninvolved in his portrayal of mercenary-warrior William Garin, who gets captured in China during his quest for the precious black powder.
Though a prisoner, his fighting skills earn him the respect of the colour-coded Chinese troops, who allow him to join their fight against the Taotie (monsters).
His heroism not only saves China but also the mankind. The westerners must save the world, after all, isnt it
The Great Wall doesnt have a single dull moment, thanks to the visuals in 3D. But if you seek something deeper, beyond the spectacle of fantasy war movie tropes, this ones quite forgettable.

ICTA implements citizen service delivery technology infrastructure for MFA
The Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) took another step towards creating a digitally empowered nation by implementing an electronic Document Attesting System (eDAS) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) yesterday.
Using this electronic system, citizens can obtain their certificates attested and certified within five to fifteen minutes, by accessing a single counter at the Ministrys Consular division.
Till the launch of this electronic system, the MFA followed a manual process of document attestation and certification and citizens had to spend two days to obtain this service. However, as a result of the newly implemented technological infrastructure the issuing of certificates can now be done within 15 minutes.
The state of the art infrastructure includes high speed scanners and biometric authentication for ensuring document safety, traceability, good governance and transparency.
Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Esala Weerakoon, Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva,Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera, ICTA Chairperson Chitranganie Mubarak ICTA MD and CEO Muhunthan Canagey at the eDAS launch.
The center has been implemented with the modern queue management system which enables citizens to book appointments using their mobile phones and provides notifications on their mobiles as well. The solution was deployed on the Government Cloud infrastructure and connected using the government network. The system will also be extended to all foreign embassies.
ICTAs vision is to have a digitally inclusive society, and one of its objectives is to ensure an efficient and seamless, citizen friendly experience in government ICTA MD and CEO Muhunthan Canagey said.
The Consular Division of the MFA serves around 500 citizens to attest and certifying their documents on a daily basis and they have to examine and verify more than 1200 to 1500 documents per day. With the implementation of this electronic system, the MFA can now provide this service in an efficient and effective manner where the general public spend less than fifteen minutes at just one single service desk. With the implementation of eDAS, citizens can also get prior appointments if they are intending to visit the Consular Division to obtain their services. It is also important to note that the MFA has managed to relocate the consular division at a new location with improved and developed ICT Infrastructure and interiors. It is a commendable fact that the service cost remains the same while the service mechanism and delivery is greatly enhanced and upgraded. Senior Director General,Consular Division of the MFA, M.Ganegamarachchi said the newly introduced eDcoument Attestation system in the Consular division would serve as a perfect example of how effective service delivery can be ensured through Cross Government coordination via digital platforms. eDocument Attestation systems digitally linked to the Public, Sri Lankan and foreign diplomatic missions, Divisional Secretariats, the Department of the Registrar General, the Department of Immigration and Emigration, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, and many others could benefit. The digital platform of the Consular division is capable of interacting with relevant stakeholders in real-time, drastically reducing the waiting time in the document attestation process.This enhanced credibility will also enable the public to receive consular services from foreign diplomatic missions and agencies promptly.
ICTA has been entrusted with the task of digitizing the economy with vision of a digitally inclusive society. ICTA is the apex policy, facilitation and implementation agency of the government of Sri Lanka.

IMF program crucial to deliver on reform agenda - De Mel
The longevity of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program will be crucial to deliver on Sri Lankas promised reform agenda to maintain the economy from a global market perspective, Hayleys Group Senior Economist Deshal De Mel said.
Noting that the IMF program in Sri Lanka has managed to bring back the stability of currency, interest rates and investors confidence he said the initial tranches of the IMF program are based on relatively straight forward structural targets such as revenue enhancing reforms which dont have any significant impact on economy.
However, the government is likely to face difficulties when it comes to succeeding the latter part reforms of the IMF program, which include reviving state owned enterprises, trade taxes and liberalising the trade policy and so on. If we do have any delays in some of the reforms implementations, or some tranches being disbursed, it will deter the investor confidence to a greater level.
He further added that Sri Lanka has got an excellent opportunity in terms of showing itself as a hub for trading activities in the Indian Ocean.In order to leverage on this, the country needs to formulate intact policies that could help garner more economic benefits.
De Mel said much efforts are needed to attract export oriented FDI that have the ability to bring in new industries, especially in the area of textiles and apparel so that Sri Lanka will have much better balance in terms of its export basket.

Even the world at large seems to have recognised this happy marriage between the two major political parties of Sri Lanka, which has resulted in a considerable amount of stability within the country, so much that there is a considerable amount of goodwill and respect shown towards our country by most leaders including the Western world. It is also refreshing to note that the UAE government has now appointed Ministers for Tolerance and Happiness, paving the way for a harmonious relationship between our countries. This will open doors for more fruitful associations in all spheres be it religious educational economic and other connected fields that can be of mutual benefit, added Ambassador Mohideen.

The Commissioner said that the visit of the Foreign Minister of Canada for the first time in 13 years, the formation of the Sri Lanka-Canada Friendship Group in the Canadian Parliament and the initialling of a fully-fledged Code Share Agreement between the two countries, after nearly 14 years since the initial request are reasons for the tie.

The High Commissioner expressed his satisfaction over the trajectory of bi-lateral ties and said that he hope to further expand relations in 2017.
Malaysia-Sri Lanka relations must be enhanced for mutual benefit
Malaysia
The existing relations between Malaysia and Sri Lanka must be enhanced for the mutual benefit of the two countries, Sri Lanka High Commissioner to Malaysia, A.J.M. Muzammil said.
He said relations between the two countries dating back to several centuries had been transformed into a multi-faceted, mutually rewarding partnership encompassing all fields of interest.
Citing trade relations as an example, Muzammil pointed out that trade relations between Sri Lanka and Malaysia had increased, expanded and flourished over the years, making Malaysia one of Sri Lanka's major trading partners.
"A large number of Malaysians of Sri Lankan origin and the Sri Lankan expatriate community here have been working in every sphere of activity, including public administration, plantation and industrial sectors leaving an indelible imprint in the development of Malaysia," he said.
Muzammil said this in his Independence Day message in a booklet, in conjunction with the 69th Sri Lankan Independence Day celebration organised by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Malaysia on Saturday.
The celebration at the high commission saw the gathering of some 200 people, both locals and Sri Lankans.
Meanwhile in his speech, Muzammil said Sri Lanka had shown great progress and transformation since its independence from the British in 1948.
He said Sri Lanka was among the countries which promoted and practised democratic traditions within its institutions.
"Today, we have independent judiciary and free media and Sri Lanka can be proud of its high literacy rate of over 93 per cent and life expectancy of above 75 years, which is on par with developed nations," he said.

Its action time
The decision by the Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE) to investigate the infamous hedging deals where the country lost a monumental Rs. 14 billion is indeed a timely one given that the public attention has today been craftily diverted to the alleged Central Bank bond scam by those members of the Joint Opposition against whom corruption investigations are pending. According to our main story yesterday COPE has decided to launch a full scale investigation into the oil price hedging deals of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in 2007 which resulted in heavy losses to the state. COPE Chairman Sunil Handunhetti said a similar investigation, as in the case of the Treasury bond transaction, would be commenced on the much talked about hedging deals.
The alleged Treasury bond scam had already been subjected to a full scale investigation by COPE and the matter has been directed to the Attorney General for action, by parliament. In addition President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a Special Presidential Commission to probe the affair, giving the Commission a three month time frame to reveal its findings .On the other hand, the hedging deals were swept under the carpet by the Rajapaksa regime with no person or persons held accountable. It will therefore be a monumental lapse on the part of the government if the hedging deals that blew a vast hole in the economy were left to whither on the vine and the culprits allowed to go scot free. It is surprising indeed that this matter which obviously reeked of corruption was not probed by the Yahapalanaya government at the very inception. Anti-corruption champions such as Wasantha Samarasinghe and Keerthie Tennakoon too had been lukewarm on the hedging deals while going hammer and tongs on alleged bond scam. All the actors involved in the matter are well known and the public is owed an explanation as to why this was sent into the forgotten things of limbo while investigating bodies were going after much lesser offences such as misuse of government vehicles.
Not just the hedging deals, but the Greek bond issue where the country again lost billions too should be brought to the fore and the wrongdoers punished. The hedging deals drew strictures from no less a personage than the former the Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva who stated in open court that his peon had more qualifications than the individual placed at the helm of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation at the time- another glaring instance where nepotism under Rajapaksa rule cost the country dear. The losses incurred by the alleged Central Bank bond scam pales into insignificance when considering the cumulative losses suffered as a result of the hedging deals and the Greek bond affair. What is more, those directly responsible for this mind boggling loss to the country are today taking high ground on the bond issue and has the brass to give press interviews on the matter while government ministers hardly talk about the hedging deals or other mega scams of the past, giving the impression to the public, and justifiably so, that charges leveled against the Rajapaksas were mere fiction.
This failure on the part of the government to communicate effectively with the public has not only caused misgivings in the minds of the public pertaining to corruption allegations against former VIPs but also emboldened those in the Joint Opposition, hauled before the various Commissions, to carry out their camouflage act by going to the Bribery Commission against a Top Ten team of Ministers. A clear case of the hunter becoming the hunted.
The Joint Opposition anti-corruption crusaders who are now busy drawing a red herring to deflect the mega corruption charges laid at their feet should be effectively countered by bringing out the whole sordid details of the hedging deals. This, and the Greek bond affair, are only just two instances where billions were frittered away by the Rajapaksa government. Other cases of profligacy too should be reopened and those now posing as paragons of virtue should be exposed, starting with all Central Bank involvements. To begin with, a probe is in order to ascertain who was responsible for paying out astronomical amounts to the US lobby firms to promote Sri Lanka among the US Congressmen and for writing the speeches of the then Ambassador - another instance where nepotism under Rajapaksa took a heavy toll on the countrys finances.
The government should also take up the matter of financial loss to the country resulting from the failed bid to secure the right to hold the Commonwealth Games in Hambantota where a plane load of sportsmen, models, actresses journalists et al. were flown to the Carribean in the company of the countrys first son.
The government, by remaining silent on these matters, is inadvertently giving the lie to its claim, made during the elections, of mega corruption and financial profligacy during the Rajapaksa Presidency, thus making the swindlers, and fraudsters look squeaky clean. Why not open the whole can of worms and expose those in Lilly white garb who lorded it over under Rajapaksa rule

Japanese consortium to invest US$15 mn on 10 mw solar plant
A multi-million dollar project for the establishment of a solar power plant in Sri Lanka is underway with investment from three Japanese companies through a Japanese consortium.
The companies Shibatasyoji, Sawada and WQ Inc are renowned for their extensive expertise in establishing solar power plants in Japan and this pioneering scheme in venturing out to Sri Lanka will provide the country with the optimum knowledge in this area of competence. Shibatasyoji Co., Ltd., and Sawada Co. Ltd are the main investors while WQ Inc. will be providing the main components to the project.
The Japanese experts conducted a series of extensive research in this field, concluding that Sri Lanka is one of the most viable countries for solar power.
In addition, the Sri Lankan governments announcement in 2015 vesting its interest to establish a series of solar power plants in the country gave it the needed boost in laying the groundwork for this project.
The project is in partnership with TAD Lanka Investments, the local facilitating partner for the Project, and Sierra Technology Holdings (a subsidiary company of Sierra Holdings), the local EPC partner for the project.
The official signing ceremony took place last Friday between the Japanese Consortium and the two local entities with the initial commitment of establishing a 10 mw solar power plant and an added pledge to invest in 100 mw solar power plant in future.
This project will set the benchmark for future projects of this calibre in Sri Lanka paving the way to meet the impending power crisis and we are willing to give our unstinted support towards reaching success in this field, remarked a representative of the Japanese Consortium.
TAD Lanka Investments is proud to be involved in this gigantic venture which provides the country with stability and certain growth in the technology that promotes the usage of sustainable and renewable energy. It also addresses the crisis at hand, while opening variable opportunities for further investment to Sri Lanka in this area, TAD Lanka Investments Director and CEO Atheeq Ansar said.

Katy Perry has excited her fans by announcing a comeback performance at the Grammys and drastically changing her look.
Typically brunette, the star has dyed her hair blonde and gone for a pastel pink look.
The pop singer, who hasn't released an album since 2013, and the only offering since then has been her single Rise, which had a lukewarm reception by fans used to her previously steady stream of earworms.
Her work since then has mainly taken place off-stage, she's been on tour and spent the bulk of last year campaigning for Hillary Clinton.
Some have speculated she may use the Grammys to take a shot at President Trump, who she has consistently criticised.
However, others are hoping she returns to her music and uses the event to debut a new single.

He said one must not forget that one must interact with the people despite all the comforts of smart technologies, digitalisation, infrastructure and new management systems, such as those available at the Consular Affairs Division.

He said as the public service window of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Consular Affairs Division is expected to win the hearts of the people even as they provide an efficient consular service to the public.
Even as we use novel technologies to improve our services, the people also resort to technologies to keep us under check, the minister said.
I received an e-mail from Saudi Arabia yesterday which had a sound file that contained a conversation that had taken place between that person and a certain person at our foreign mission there in which the person from our side is apparently blaming that person, he said.

The premier garment manufacturer, MAS Holdings has tied up with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society (SLCS) to conduct a seminar on Cervical Cancer and Breast Cancer for middle aged women on February 7 (today) at SLCS Auditorium, Bullers Lane, Colombo 7, commencing at 9.30 am.
The objective of holding the seminar, sponsored by MAS Holdings in collaboration with the SLAC is to create the awareness of country's young and middle aged women, especially mothers about the dangerous situation of breast and cervical cancers and measures that should be taken to detect them early and how to get rid of them.
Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in a woman's cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina).
It is reported that over 12, 000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year.
SLCS, Public Education Committee ,Chairperson Merle Weerasinghe said that Cervical cancer can often be found early and sometimes even prevented entirely by having regular Pap tests if detected early.

Men rush for a brush with a lush blush!
Its official. Men are now wearing makeup. Believe me I am not making it up. I was a disbeliever too until I witnessed it with my own pair of gaping peepers. Actually, it was observed only recently when I arrived to fetch the wife home from her regular beauty parlour in town.
It is certainly a chic place, as far as clinically chic places go. A personable young receptionist with black and blue spiky hair informed me that the missus was still undergoing her therapy. His head resembled the dishevelled spikes of a porcupine which had just emerged after a raging battle.
Young Porcu-spikes then turned to me and with utmost politeness asked: Would you too like a haircut, while you wait sir I shook my head as I made a tactical retreat fearing that if he got any closer he could poke my eyes out with his tonsorial bristles. He was joined by a petite beautician with a surgical mask at half mast who tried to convince me to try a facial, a pedicure and manicure. I declined as graciously as I could.
But she was persuasive and asked me to visit the cosmetics section, where entire shelves were now dedicated to male vanity. My curiosity aroused I followed her. Oh, I thought, the twits who start eliminating their zits have become the latest trend in boys behaving girly-like. These dudes have gone from secretly filching some of their womens moisturizers to owning enough beauty products to make most transvestites blush.
Beyond swanky moisturizers and creams, there was on offer a scandalous assortment of toiletries that tailor to the new male vanity. I am talking about foundations, skin-toners and bronzers, nail varnish and even lipstick, words that until now have been nonexistent in the male lexicon.
I asked her: But arent these services and products traditionally aimed at women, such as eye-liner, fake tan, face-toner and spot or blemish concealer She looked at me pityingly and I was made to understand that long gone are the days when lipstick and eye-liner were reserved for women. From eyeliner, sorry, guy-liner to mascara, begging your pardon again, manscara, thousands of males have taken to wearing make-up regularly.
A decade ago men wearing make-up were an oddity as a macho culture stressing mens rough, tough image was prevalent everywhere. Masculinity was clearly defined when men were men and would rather be dead than caught patronising a beauty parlour which was strictly a feminine preserve. But the debate goes more than just skin deep. Now, I have always understood that cosmetics are a womans means for keeping a man from reading between the lines.
But some men appear to have taken to makeup as a sort of religion and are born-again cosmetic users. It seems men are not just content to indulge in a little beauty therapy they want to be the ones dishing it out as well. There were many young hip-hopper therapists and some older ones as well sashaying around in tight pants while preaching the dangers of loose jowls.
There was a time when guys started filching a dollop or two of the other halfs concealer to cover up those bags after a night on the tiles. But they had the grace to do it furtively. Before their partner knew it, they made a quick dip into her mascara or face cream. Most dudes used to wear makeup in secret and were basically makeup thieves. Yes then the long arm of gender equality had extended its reach past the boardrooms and into womens bathrooms and medicine cabinets.
So it seems they all keep reaching for the blusher but quite openly now. No, not me, I blush naturally when I think of my male peers dipping into skin-care creams. Times sure are a-changing with the young and not so young urban male all set to take over the traditionally female bastion of beauty parlours and cosmetics. They certainly take care of their appearance in a way that would have had their grandfathers spluttering into their happy hour highballs.
But there were some ageing regulars as well. The clientele was a mixed hodgepodge of the young, the middle-aged and even an oldster on the wrong side of 90 who came tottering out with the aid of a walking stick.
The geriatric limper with his ubiquitous walking stick emerged from his ministrations like a spectre out of a horror movie. He actually looked like Draculas twin, his face completely overshadowed by the eyeliner which must have cost a bomb. I could easily have given the old duffer two black eyes for free, gratis and for nothing.
The beautician enlightened me that the application of face masks has not yet picked up to the expected level of acceptance among men as yet. While most other forms of grooming that had been women only territory till late has turned unisex. Usage of face mask has yet a long way to go. I suggested that a good many of them should be advised to actually wear permanent face masks  both before and after make up  to spare the world the horror of their appearances.
By becoming attuned to the beauty industry, men are now openly availing themselves of the same opportunities afforded to women.The transformation of many males from macho to makeup has also been propelled by competition for jobs and romance. It represents a new revenue stream for global cosmetics makers grappling with the saturated womens skincare market.
Perhaps it would do men good to hang on to a few traditional concepts of manhood so we do not lose sight of who we are. How long will it be until men start going to the bathroom in pairs to touch up their foundation Or gossip about their partners while sitting under the perm hair dryer, their feet soaking in soothing skin toner
My toilet shelf contains a razor, a can of shaving cream and a bottle of astringent after-shave. There is something admirable about the man who takes his imperfections with grace and carries on with his life.
Maintaining a good image is fine, but lets draw the line at face paint.
Its sounds funny to some of us but not everyone. That is because no one even bats a false eyelash or raises an artificial eyebrow these days about male make up, it seems.

Mourinho taunts Chelsea in style wars
LEICESTER: Jose Mourinho took a swipe at his old club Chelsea as the Manchester United boss accused the Premier League leaders of lacking style.
Mourinhos side cruised to a 3-0 victory at Leicester on Sunday and he was quick to highlight the difference between the dominant United display and what he perceives as the more prosaic efforts of Antonio Contes men.
Frustrated by criticism of the cautious nature of his teams when he was in charge at Chelsea, Mourinho made it clear that he is unimpressed the way the Blues, currently nine points clear at the top, and also Tottenham and Liverpool, have been praised despite employing safety-first philosophies.
My team is playing very well but for many years in my career, especially in this country, when my teams were ruthless and phenomenal defensively I listened week after week to people saying that was not enough, despite winning the title three times, Mourinho said.
This season it looks that being strong defensively and good on the counter attack is art. That is a big change in England.
We are Manchester United, we want to play attacking football. This is the way the fans want us to play.
But I dont want to be a manager of a team that doesnt win matches. We have to score goals. Today we did and that made the difference. Today was very important. Mourinhos claims seemed a little harsh, but he was in typically mischievous mood and even referenced his demise as Chelsea boss last season, which came following a defeat at Leicester. The last time I was in this chair I was sacked a day later, he said with a smirk before bringing an end to his post-match press conference at the King Power Stadium.
Mourinhos buoyant outlook was a contrast to his sulky demeanour following last weeks draw against Hull and the key to his mood swing was Henrikh Mkhitaryan, the United midfielder who tormented Leicester with his subtle passing and clever movement.
Emotional
Mkhitaryan scored Uniteds opener and set up the third for Juan Mata after Zlatan Ibrahimovic had doubled the visitors lead. Mourinho acknowledged the first goal had been crucial as it boosted his teams belief and shattered Leicesters already fragile morale. We missed the first big chance but scored the next one. That is the story of the game, he said.
We didnt play better than in many other matches. We were solid, but we scored goals.
It makes all the difference. In the second half you are in emotional and tactical control. You kill the emotion of the opponent and the whole game looks different. Having left Mkhitaryan out at the start of the season, Mourinho is now convinced the Armenian has adapted to the Premier League. AFP

According to the minister's media secretary, the minister had said rumours that circulate in connection with the topic has no base. He expressed those views during a meeting at the Health Ministry.
Minister Dr. Senaratne stated that the delay in conducting investigations on large scale corruptions such as the MiG deal, Dubai bank accounts and the Wasim Thajudeen murder is an issue. The government had been criticised for conducting investigations on minor issues, while ignoring the major ones. Some officials do not do their duty and the law cannot be implemented against them, he said.
My son, MP Chathura Senaratne and I will extend our fullest support to the strike launched by the Manpower workers attached to Sri Lanka Telecom and will provide legal aid. It is because they dedicated themselves to create this good governance Government, the minister said.

Pan Asia Bank SAVIYA, microfinance loan scheme to support rural livelihood development
Sri Lankas fastest growing commercial bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLCs Saviya Microfinance loan scheme is designed to assist development of livelihood for prospective entrepreneurs who remain largely overlooked by the mainstream conventional banking.
Our belief that in Sri Lankas economic growth story, there is a pivotal role to be played by small enterprises engaged in industries such as agriculture, livestock development, fisheries, and other small enterprises. As such, it is our duty and responsibility as a successful local bank to empower small scale entrepreneurs by making credit facilities available to them at their hour of need, said, Naleen Edirisinghe, DGM Retail Banking & SME of Pan Asia Bank.
Naleen Edirisinghe further said that, We grant this special loan scheme, bringing credit, savings and other essential financial services within the reach of millions of people who still remain overlooked by most financial institutions, due to their inability to offer sufficient collateral. This void prompted Pan Asia Bank to venture out to serve this segment of population in Sri Lanka by providing credit facilities based primarily on the banks evaluation of the applicants vocation and its confidence in the success of the enterprise rather than the collateral.
SAVIYA loan scheme also aims to promote a savings culture among these customers and thereby strengthening their financial position he further added. Supplementing the SAVIYA loan scheme, is an investment-based savings scheme where it is mandatory for the borrowers to contribute an additional agreed amount every month towards a savings build up which could be used as collateral for any future expansion of business activity.
The bank also permits group loans against the cross guarantees where maximum number of borrowers in each group to be 5 nos.
The minimum value of such loans will be Rs.25,000/-and the value granted will vary depending on the requirement considering the past track record of the particular borrower.
We expect to further expand the SAVIYA loan scheme to cater to a wider section of the targeted market segment such as small scale Agribusiness, Seasonal Crops and Dairy farmers who already maintain supplier linkages, Edirisinghe added.

The pitches play a vital role
As the saying goes Sri Lankans are like rabbits being chased by wolves. At present, against the Proteas the curse is said to be fast bouncy wickets, with a good measure of swing thrown into the melting pot.
When a young team is struggling to find its feet in no-mans-land even the dormant of critics might spring out of the woodwork to make hay while the sun shines. This is the normal form and one should not get agitated by this scenario.
Delving into the past, it is interesting to note what Partab Ramchand in his book The Gentle Executioners had to say. He was referring to Anil Kumble, the present coach of the all conquering Indian team who are blazing a victory trail in India at present.
Apparently Kumble has had a poor tour in South Africa, and Ramchand states as follows, The allegations returned to haunt him on the tour of Sri Lanka where the pitches were heavily loaded in favour of the batsman exemplified by the events at the Premadasa Stadium during the first Test at Colombo that saw 1489 runs being scored and only 14 wickets being taken. The average of 106.35 runs per wicket was the second highest in the 120 year old history of Test Cricket and Sri Lanka ran up the highest total ever 952 for 6. Things were slightly better for the bowlers in the second Test adds Ramchand , this was also played at Colombo but at the nearby SSC grounds when 1403 runs were scored and 32 wickets taken. The home team batsmen teased, tormented and toyed with the Indian bowlers who in absolute adverse conditions found the going tough. All the bowlers were dealt with harshly but somehow it was Kumble, who bore the brunt of the criticism probably because of his stature and because of the stories that were already circulating that he was ineffective abroad.
Ramchand goes on to add that it was okay for bowlers like Nilesh Kulkarni and Rajesh Chauhan to finish with the kind of figures that they would see in their bad dreams but given his reputation Kumble was expected to take wickets in any clime and in any condition. No bowler took more than his haul of five wickets in the two Tests but the fact that these were obtained at 86 runs a piece attracted adverse comments. For the record Kulkarni and Chauhan who played in only the run riot at the Premadasa Stadium had figures of one for 195 and one for 276 respectively.
Ramchand states that, Kumbles critics also overlooked the fact that Sri Lanka by then was formidable opposition not only at home but also abroad. Their status as the World Cup champions had given them the confidence of tackling the best even at Test Level and Ramchand mentions that in batsmen like Sanath Jayasuriya, Roshan Mahanama, Mahela Jayawardene, Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga, Marvan Atapattu and Hashan Tillekaratne they had world class players.
If any proof was needed of their rising stature in the longer version of the game they provided it on the return tour of India later in the season.
This goes to show that Sri Lankan Cricket peaked in 1996; the above mentioned names mentioned by him were world class to a man indeed. Leave alone seven world class players, at present we have none and Mathews and Chandimal are still no match to the above mentioned stalwarts.
The gaping holes left by Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene are getting wider and deeper by the day. It certainly is disheartening to note that in the 3rd ODI played on Saturday, the two young batsmen Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva who are earmarked for greater things in the future failed miserably. Mendis after showing glimpses of his brilliant talent went reaching out to drive a ball he could have left alone or played off the back foot and gave a catch to the covers.
This was poor shot selection and unnecessary haste. Dhananjaya on the other hand came and played a lethargic forward defensive shot to Imran Thahir, as if he was in a hurry to get back to the comfort zone of the dressing room. No wonder, the boy must have witnessed the thumping on the helmet that brave skipper Upul Tharanga absorbed. De Silva the talented batsman looked jaded I feel that at this level the enthusiasm should be sustained.
With the material at hand one cannot point fingers at the people up above. My guess is that let the pot simmer until it gets to boil one fine day in the future.

Refreshed Barca seek to continue Cup dominance
MADRID: Holders Barcelona have a fourth consecutive Copa del Rey final in sight when Atletico Madrid visit the Camp Nou on Tuesday with the daunting task over overturning a 2-1 semi-final, first leg deficit.
Stunning solo goals from Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi put Barca well in command of the tie before half-time at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday.
And both are well-rested for the return as Suarez sat out Saturdays 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, whilst Messi took a rare break for the final 25 minutes after netting his 31st goal of the season.
It is important to realise that to reach our three objectives we need the whole squad, said Barca boss Luis Enrique with his side going for a second treble of league, Cup and Champions League in three years.
One key member of the Barca squad will be missing for Atleticos visit, though, as Neymar is suspended.
Messi will also have to be careful as a yellow card would rule him out of the final should Barca advance.
The hosts are also likely to also be without Gerard Pique and Rafinha.
Pique came off at half-time after picking up a groin strain, whilst Rafinha broke his nose in a collision with Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen at the weekend.
However, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets are close to returning from hamstring and ankle injuries respectively.
Atletico were a team transformed in the second-half of the first leg as they roared back into the tie after the introduction of Fernando Torres at the break.
Antoine Griezmann halved the arrears, whilst Torres and Kevin Gameiro all came close to levelling near the end.
Torress impact continued as he scored his first La Liga goals since September with a double in Saturdays 2-0 win over Leganes.
We know the game on Tuesday will be extremely difficult, but it is in the hard games where our pride comes out and we hope to experience one of those magic nights on Tuesday, said the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker.
However, the size of the task awaiting Diego Simeones men is underlined by the fact Torres scored twice the last time they won at the Camp Nou during in his first spell at the club in 2006.
Atletico will also be without suspended captain Gabi.
Defender Lucas Hernandez returned to training on Sunday after he was arrested in the early hours of Friday morning on suspicion of domestic violence.
However, the Frenchman is unlikely to be involved in Simeones squad.
Wednesdays other semi-final is more delicately poised at 0-0 between Alaves and Celta Vigo.
Celta had the weekend off as their La Liga clash with Real Madrid was postponed after high winds caused structural damage to their Balaidos stadium.
Alaves even made a petition to the Spanish Football Federation to have the second leg postponed, claiming Celtas extra time to prepare handed them an unfair advantage.
The Basques, though, have home advantage and are full of confidence after virtually securing their place in the top flight for next season with a 4-2 win at Sporting Gijon on Sunday despite resting a swathe of key players.

The road before us
Forty year-old Mrs. Doreen Kulandaivelu was returning home to Pandiruppu from school where she was a principal when her trailing saree became entangled in the rear wheel of her motorcycle. She fell from the motorcycle and was injured. Passers-by dispatched her in a three wheeler to hospital at nearby Kalmunai. Halfway there however the three wheeler engine failed and she was transferred to another three wheeler. The engine of that one also stalled a few miles from the hospital.
As her condition worsened she was put in a passing car and admitted to the hospital.
But the doctors there decided to transfer her by ambulance to a larger hospital at the main town of Batticaloa. The ambulance, which was said to be travelling at high speed with its sirens on, collided head on with a van coming in the opposite direction. Five persons, including the ambulance driver and two medical staff were seriously injured and all, including Mrs. Kulandaivelu, were transferred to another vehicle. Upon arrival at the Batticaloa hospital Mrs. Kulandivelu was found to be dead.
Delightfully Imperfect-Paul Harris
Paul Harris is a British journalist who was ordered out of Sri Lanka in 2001-2. The reasons for his forced departure are clouded in controversy. Strangely, according to Harris, his strong anti-LTTE line was one of the reasons for the sudden withdrawal of the welcome. In the short period he was here Harris was productive, writing several books, reports and newspaper articles on the country. In Colombo, Harris was based mainly at the Galle Face Hotel the inspiration for the title of his book-Delightfully Imperfect.
In this book, Harris, in addition to the main theme- the Galle Face Hotel, also describes his experiences here including news items taken from the local newspapers, the tragic story of the school principal Mrs. Kulandivelu, being one. He has taken this from the Sunday Observer. Although adopting a factual, unsentimental style, Harris nevertheless scores his points with effect, drawing our attention to a national reality; a repeating theme of predicament and ineffectual response-the challenge and the incompetence of the challenged, the vast gap between the rhetoric and delivery.
What we are inured to, foreign eyes see differently, see us from without; a collective existence bordering on the tragicomic, the whole of which we are irretrievably constituent parts.
Did Mrs. Kulandivelu have to die in that way Where does the blame for the tragedy lie
The lack of civility evident on our roads; blaring of horns, the belching of heavy vehicles, the mayhem of the Tuk-Tuks, the indiscipline of the pedestrians; this is the road culture we live with, and the only one we know.
I recently met an expatriate who has lived here for some years. In the course of our conversation we came to the deplorable situation on our roads. He had worked in several Asian countries before, in urban monstrosities such as Jakarta, Manila and Dacca. By their sheer size, population and traffic these humongous cities reduce us to insignificance and consequently make most of our urban problems seem smaller and arguably easier to manage.
But we have failed to do that.
In these huge cities, a few kilometers can take several hours; the roads simply cannot take the volume of vehicles. Colombo, on the other hand, has a small city atmosphere but yet it is a big mess. People here give the impression that roads with vehicles on them are a novelty. The way they behave behind a wheel, they could well be taking a stroll on a village green, in any way they fancy. No allowance is made for other road users. It seems their minds cannot process the complexities that arise when there are other vehicles nor acquire the discipline that is essential in the situation.
Bus drivers
The driver only has his vehicle and his destination in mind, anything else on the road is immaterial, he simply does not care. I rarely see a driver allowing another to get into a lane or giving way to another here. They just keep nudging forward, even inch by inch, in an ugly attempt to get ahead. And this is a nation which in everything else is so slow and laid back! Where are they rushing to Rush or no rush, they always come late!
Although it was embarrassing to hear such an opinion I really could not dispute his assessment of the culture of our roads. Perhaps blame need not fall on all drivers equally, so I inquired In your opinion, who are the worse drivers
He replied promptly.
No doubt the prize for the worse should go to the bus drivers. They act as if the roads have been created for them to make money. Nothing else matters. Actually the bus drivers diminish the quality of the country; to think that these chaps who are said to be providing a public utility can behave in this manner on the road is disgusting.
The second on the list are the Tuk-Tuk drivers and the motorcyclists. I agree it is difficult to assume a personal dignity when hunched down inside a Tuk-Tuk. That pose probably distorts the way they view the world, scavenging has becomes an acceptable occupation. They drive in the most juvenile manner. Fairness in not something they are familiar with. Overtaking from every side, jumping the line, cutting across your path is routine, part of the monkey-game.
Whenever I come across a Bus or a Tuk-Tuk driver I take a good look. There is a certain commonality about them, a suggestion of unreliability- children in adult bodies With your familiarity with all this you may see them differently, without differentiation, but to my foreign eyes there is a dubious quality
Who are the other obvious culprits, I asked.
He paused.
I would say that those who drive the big cars, limousines and four wheel drive vehicles of these Third World elites, are also generally rude; horning, flashing their lights impatiently, cutting across and not keeping to a lane and so on. Maybe, they feel important; assess themselves high in the local hierarchy, either financially or socially; and this is their announcement of that assessment. Funny thing is, often the vehicle is driven by the driver, the Sir or Madam is seated behind.
Education system
When you count all the bus, lorry, van, taxi, three wheel, State sector, forces, private sector and those who drive for individual employers, it seems to me that driving must be the occupation of at least half a million Sri Lankans . Their job, particularly those who drive individuals, is to transport other bodies to their destination, something the passengers can do themselves. It is not a very productive or creative occupation.
In Sri Lanka, a chauffeur driven car is seen as an easily acquired status symbol. There must be something wrong with your education system that this is the only skill these drivers have learnt or find in such a dulling occupation a good way to earn a livelihood. I think it is a mark of a poor society, poor, not only in terms of money; going nowhere.
The last in the categories of bad drivers, perhaps the least offensive, are those who drive small cars. I assume these are people who have recently acquired a car and really do not understand the road. It is funny to watch them tackling road situations, clueless, yet selfish, is how I would describe their driving. The blame here should go to the licensing authorities. But then this is Sri Lanka!
As much as I wished to challenge this rather dim description of our roads, reality denied me an effective response. What the expatriate expressed is demonstrated every day, on every road. To a foreigner, our roads may be a subject of delightful humour, but to us who have to undergo the experience daily, imperfect in the extreme.
I would conclude with another story from Delightfully Imperfect, Paul Harriss book on his life in Sri Lanka. His source for this story is The Island newspaper.
Lodged a complaint
A man from the Matara area was arrested by the police on the complaint of a 23-year-old woman. Apparently, she had married a local fisherman and after seven days of marriage her spouse went off to sea on a fishing trip. As the newspaper put it for some reason or other he did not return for several months.
She came to know a 45-year-old man who was said to be a kapumahattaya in a devale. After hearing her sad story the kapuwa said he could bring back her husband in seven days. For that purpose she should come to his devale.
When she arrived he gave her a white cloth and told her to have a bath and come to him dressed in the white cloth. She obliged and when she appeared before him she was told to lie down at a certain place in the devale. Thereafter he had raped her.
After a few days her husband had returned home.
Then she had told her husband everything about the rituals she had conducted. The fisherman who realized what had taken place went to the Matara Police along with the wife and lodged a complaint.
Obviously, the road before us is very long and there are so many bends, turns and twists .

Russia, China sign deal to bypass US dollar

In a symbolic blow to U.S. global financial hegemony, Russia and China took a small step toward undercutting the domination of the U.S. dollar as the international reserve currency on Tuesday when Russias second biggest financial institution, VTB, signed a deal with the Bank of China to bypass the dollar and pay each other in domestic currencies.
The so-called Agreement on Cooperation  signed in the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on a visit to Shanghai  was followed by the long-awaited announcement on Wednesday of a massive natural gas deal 10 years in the making.
Our countries have done a huge job to reach a new historic landmark, Putin said on Tuesday, making note of the $100 billion in annual trade that has been achieved between the two countries.
Demand for the dollar, which has longserved as a safe and reliable reserve currencyin international transactions, has allowed the U.S. to borrow almost unlimited cash and spend well beyond its means, which some economists say has afforded the United States an outsize influence on world affairs.
But the BRICS countries  Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, a bloc of the worlds five major emerging economies  have longsought to diminish their dependence on the dollaras a means of reshaping the world financial and geopolitical order.In the absence of a viable alternative, however, replacing it has proved difficult.
For its part, China sees the dominance of the dollar in international trade transactions as a remnant of American global dominance, which they hope to overthrow in the years ahead, said Michael Klare, a professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College. This is a small step in that direction, to reduce the primacy of the dollar in international trade.
Some have been tempted to view Tuesday's deal in the context of Putin's showdown with the West over the crisis in Ukraine. After the U.S. and Europe imposed sanctions on Moscow for its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, Putin may have finally made good on promised retaliation against what he views as Western hegemony in Russia's near abroad.
Breaking the dominance of the U.S. dollar in international trade between the BRICS is something that the group has been talking about for some time, said Chris Weafer, a founding partner of Macro-Advisory, a consultancy in Moscow. The Ukraine crisis and the threats voiced by the U.S. administration may well provide the catalyst for that to start happening.
To be sure, the Russia-China bank deal is mostly a symbolic step. Liza Ermolenko, an emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London, said that the deal was still a very small one, in the grand scale of things, and that it wouldnt change Russias reliance on the dollar overnight. Most of Russias export contracts in the oil and gas markets are still priced in dollars, she noted, and on a wider scale, replacing the dollar with the ruble is much too risky to even consider.
Likewise, even though China has agreed to the gas deal, which could see over $450 billion of Russian natural gas flow from eastern Siberia into China over the next 30 years, Russia is not in a position to abandon its ties with Europe.
"From the commercial standpoint, Europe is the most profitable market for Gazprom, said Mikhail Korchemkin, the founder of Eastern European Gas Analysis, who has consulted for Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company. "Exports to China can generate a small profit, [but] only if the government makes it free of taxes and duties.
But the bank deal is another indicator that Russia and China arein the middle of a wider rapprochement, which analysts say is premised not on ideological alignment but on a mutual desire to undercut the U.S. in their respective spheres of influence.
Both countries are wary of President Barack Obamas pivot east, a recalibration of U.S. foreign policy away from decades of war in the Middle East andtoward the fast-growing economies of the East. Cynical observers have interpreted the shift as an effort to contain China.
"This is a marriage of mutual strategic interests, not a marriage of love," said Klare. China wants energy and weapons from Russia, and Russia wants diplomatic backing and cash. Its a quid pro quo.
Yet even if China feels threatened by U.S. encroachment, it is Russia that is desperately pursuing closer ties with China.
Putin may have gotten the better of the Western powers in the showdown over Crimea, but at the cost of growing geopolitical isolation. Under intense pressure to demonstrate Russia's avowed independence from the West, he has repeatedly threatened that he could simplyshut off its natural gas pipelinesto Europe and find new markets for Russian energy exports.
Separate from that political posturing, the Russian imperative to find new markets for its energy exports is nonetheless very real. Energy demands in Europe have plateaued and may even decline in the long term because of stringent environmental regulations.
If Russiawants to continue to be a petrostate, it has to shift marketing of its exports to Asia," said Klare, who noted that Western energy conglomerates like ExxonMobil have begun doing the same.
We dont want to push this too far and see it as a formation of a new, global anti-American bloc that is starting a new Cold War, he added. "This is market-driven more than its political."

S. African legend Joost van der Westhuizen dead at 45
Johannesburg: South African legend Joost van der Westhuizen died on Monday aged 45 after a long battle with motor neurone disease, triggering a wave of tributes to one of rugbys greatest.
The former scrum-half, Springboks captain and 1995 World Cup winner was diagnosed with the condition in 2011 and his declining health had been closely followed by anguished fans around the world.
It is with great sadness that we confirm the passing of Joost. He passed away in his home surrounded by his loved ones. He will be sorely missed, the J9 Foundation, which was set up in his name, said on its Facebook page.
As his condition worsened in recent days, South African President Jacob Zuma described van der Westhuizen as one of the best rugby players that the country has ever produced.
The rugby world was quick to express its condolences, with Irish great Brian ODriscoll tweeting: RIP Joost van der Westhuizen. An incredible player and fighter to the end.
Joost will be remembered as one of the greatest Springboks -- not only of his generation, but of all time, said Mark Alexander, president of SA Rugby.
As a player, he lifted the Rugby World Cup, Tri-Nations and Currie Cup while establishing himself as one of the best scrum-halves world rugby has ever seen.
He also became an inspiration and hero to many fellow sufferers of this terrible disease.
We all marvelled at his bravery, his fortitude and his uncomplaining acceptance of this terrible burden. AFP

Sadaharitha team tours Assam to harvest best practices in Agarwood
A delegation from Sadaharitha Plantations including the Companys Chairman, Sathis Nawarathne, toured Assam, in the south eastern Himalayas to gain hands on experience of growing and marketing Agarwood, considered to be the worlds most sustainable investment in commercial forestry.
Assam is known to be Indias Agarwood capital and sharing best practices in pricing, training labour and exploring marketing opportunities with the Indian experts would help the team from Sadaharitha to benefit from the knowledge they gain. Assam is the gateway to northeastern India and shares borders with Bhutan and Bangladesh.
Speaking of the delegations tour to Assam, Sathis Nawarathne said We benefited immensely from the tour and will be able to provide sound investment opportunities to our clients by exchanging best practices with the Agarwood growers in Assam and in turn we were able to share our own expertise for their benefit.
Among the members of the Sri Lankan delegation was Dr. Upul Subasinghe, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science, the University of Sri Jayawardenepura and also the Forestry Consultant of Sadaharitha Plantations. His paper titled Gyrinops Walla: Recently discovered Agarwood producing tree in Sri Lanka was published recently in the journal of All Sanchi (Agar) Growers Association of India and the publication focused on the issue that frequent smuggling and poaching made the species vulnerable to extinction.
In the paper he states Lack of knowledge of poachers about the Agarwood resin formation and its existence, directed to cut the trees of all sizes without any scientific intervention and therefore it became a massacre causing a severe threat to the existence of this species. International demand for Agarwood is increasing and over the past decade it has resulted in over exploitation. Poaching increases tree mortality, reduces the growth rate of pre-adults and adults, and decreases the percentage of adults that reproduce. Loss of lowland forest habitats also threatens populations of these species.
Low yield from plant material, typical and labour intensive process of extraction are some key reasons behind the high cost of Agarwood oil.
Agarwood undoubtedly is a billion dollar industry, in which the ever increasing price is attributed to the constantly growing demand in larger markets such as Middle-East, China, USA and Europe in various forms such as graded chips, powder, oil and as finished products, such as perfumes, incense and medicine and even as jewellery because of the belief that it brings wealth and good luck.
Agarwood is listed in the Convention for the International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), and cannot be traded internationally without a permit to ensure the survival of the species. The wonder tree is regarded as a gift of nature since the tree does not contain any perfumery oil glands. The agar oil is formed when infected with microbes when the tree is bored and infested by the trunk borer.
Sadaharitha Plantations has been in the forefront of Agarwood cultivation in Sri Lanka, offering expertise as well as value added commercial forestry investments to clients, contributing significantly to the conservation of our planet by protecting the environment.

Scions Strategy
The young author was turned down by a dozen of publishers. The publishers used one particular term, which is controversial enough: religion. When you talk about religion, it may hurt the communities. The publishers had been bothered more about the social opinion than a potential market.
But that turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the young author. He was to establish himself as an author turned entrepreneur in the booming literary industry. He became a new addition to Indias vast literary industry: Amish Tripathi.
The publishers feared blasphemy, Amish expressed his sentiments during a recent visit to Galle. He embraced the rejection like a rebel. He took over the publishers job himself banking on his years of expertise in finance. Amish was soon to become a familiar sight in the bookshelves.
Amish Tripathi, born in 1974, is an Indian novelist, known for The Immortals of Meluha, The Secret of the Nagas, The Oath of the Vayuputras and Scion of Ikshvaku. The first three books are a combination of the Shiva Trilogy, while the fourth is the first of the Ram Chandra Series. The Shiva Trilogy as well as the Scion of Ikshvaku were ranked as the fast-selling book series. Tripathis books have sold over 3.5 million copies. He has also been handpicked as an Eisenhower Fellow, an exclusive programme for outstanding leaders from around the world.
I was fascinated by the pantheon of gods and deities in India. There was this God Nataraj who was obsessed with his wife and many more, notes a beaming Tripathi.
He chose the modern English to narrate the most ancient lore of his country. And then he initiated his own marketing campaign.
It is all about thinking out of the box. If you say we cant do this, I take it as a ridiculous sentence. Being rejected is a blessing in disguise.
If only the publishers accepted Amish, he would not have come this far.
Tripathis first marketing strategy was distributing the first chapter of his first book. It was a well-kept secret as no one had experimented on it before. Amish compares this strategy with a promotion of shampoo sachets. When you cannot afford the normal shampoo, the sachet is the convenient option. That also gives you an idea about the bigger shampoo bottle.
I applied the same theory. It is all about investing at the right time. I placed the first chapter of my first book in the cash counter, because that is where you find the serious customers.
When you approach the normal customers in the supermarket, they are not serious buyers. The serious customers actually use money. They would hardly mind investing on a book. Having distributed the first chapter, a few weeks before the launch, Amish Tripathi soon witnessed a great success in a newfound marketing campaign.
Amish Tripathi has been awarded the Society Young Achievers Award for Literature in 2013. His most recent awards have been Raymond Crossword Popular Fiction Award for his book Scion of Ikshvaku and the Dainik Bhaskar Readers choice Award in 2016.
Tripathis books are essentially based on religious themes, apparently as he is a devotee of Lord Shiva. An atheist in his youth, Amish claims to have returned to his faith following the first book. He had the opportunity to gather the cream of Hindu mythology and theology knowledge from his grandfather, a Sanskrit scholar.
Religiosity and liberalism go hand-in-hand in India, Amish claims, but hastens to add: You need to be innovative. Keep on innovating marketing concepts.
I do not know if it is applicable in Sri Lanka. But I am sure the Sri Lankan god culture would definitely inspire any author.
Amish Tripathi uses an English that appears natural to him. Language should not be a barrier. It should only be a medium to generate a creative genius. Criticism is his much favoured subject.
Criticism is a must when you are an author. You should always listen to criticism. Id pay thousands to get others feedback. The authors should have critics. That is essentially because I write to myself.
Words, Tripathy said, should evoke the right mood. When you write a love scene, you should be in a Shah Rukh Khan mood, notes Amish Tripathi with a slightly sarcastic tone. Probably why his books sell in millions rather than thousands.
Described as Indias first literary popstar by world-renowned film director Shekhar Kapur, Amishs unique combination of crackling story-telling, religious symbolism and profound philosophies has made him an overnight publishing phenomenon, with spiritual guru Deepak Chopra hailing Amishs books as archetypal and stirring.
Amishs 4 books till now  The Immortals of Meluha (2010), The Secret of the Nagas (2011) and The Oath of the Vayuputras (2013), which collectively comprise the Shiva Trilogy and Scion of Ikshvaku (Part 1 of the Ram Chandra Series) (2015)  have over 3.5 million copies in print with gross retail sales of over Rs 100 crores.
His books have been translated into 18 Indian and International languages.
Ram crouched low as he bent his tall, lean and muscular frame. He rested his weight on his right knee as he held the bow steady. The arrow was fixed in place, but he knew that the bowstring should not be pulled too early. He didnt want his muscles to tire out. He had to wait for the perfect moment. It must be a clean strike.
Its moving, Dada, whispered Lakshman to his elder brother.
Ram didnt reply. His eyes were fixed on the target. A light breeze played with the few strands of hair that had escaped the practical bun atop his head. His shaggy, unkempt beard and his white dhoti gently fluttered in the breeze. Ram corrected his angle as he factored in the strength and direction of the wind. He quietly cast his white angvastram aside to reveal a battle-scarred, dark-skinned torso. The cloth should not interfere with the release of the arrow.
The deer suddenly came to a standstill as it looked up; perhaps instinct had kicked in with some warning signals. Ram could hear its low snort as it stomped its feet uneasily. Within a few seconds it went back to chewing leaves as silence prevailed. The rest of the herd was a short distance away, hidden from view by the dense foliage of the forest.
By the great Lord Parshu Ram, it ignored its instincts, said Lakshman softly. Thank the Lord. We need some real food.
Quiet
Lakshman fell silent. Ram knew they needed this kill. Lakshman and he, accompanied by his wife Sita, had been on the run for the last thirty days. A few members of the Malayaputra tribe, the sons of Malaya, led by their captain, Jatayu, were also with them.
Jatayu had urged flight well before the inevitable retaliation came. The botched meeting with Shurpanakha and Vibhishan would certainly have consequences. They were, after all, the siblings of Raavan, the wrathful demon-king of Lanka. Raavan was sure to seek vengeance. Lankan royal blood had been shed.
Racing east through the Dandakaranya, the dense forest of Dandak, they had travelled a reasonable distance parallel to the Godavari. They were fairly reassured now that they wouldnt be easily spotted or tracked. Straying too far from the tributary rivers or other water bodies would mean losing out on the best chance of hunting animals. Ram and Lakshman were princes of Ayodhya, inheritors of the proud Kshatriya tradition of the Raghukul, the descendants of Raghu. They would not survive on a diet of herbs, fruit and leaves alone.
The deer remained stationary, lost in the pleasure of grazing on tender shoots. Ram knew this was the moment. He held the composite bow steady in his left hand as he pulled the string back with his right, till it almost touched his lips. His elbow was held high, almost perfectly parallel to the ground, exactly the way his guru, Maharishi Vashishta, had taught him.
The elbow is weak. Hold it high. Let the effort come from the back muscles. The back is strong.
Ram pulled the string a notch further and then released the arrow. The missile whizzed past the trees and slammed into the deers neck. It collapsed immediately, unable to even utter a bleat as blood flooded its lungs. Despite his muscular bulk, Lakshman rushed forward stealthily. Even as he moved, he pulled out a knife from the horizontal scabbard tied to the small of his back. Within moments he reached the deer and quickly plunged the blade deep in between the animals ribs, right through to its heart.
Forgive me for killing you, O noble beast, he whispered the ancient apology that all hunters offered, as he gently touched the deers head. May your soul find purpose again, while your body sustains my soul.
Ram caught up with Lakshman as his brother pulled the arrow out, wiped it clean and returned it to its rightful owner. Still usable, he murmured.
Ram slipped the arrow back into his quiver as he looked up at the sky. Birds chirped playfully and the deers own herd displayed no alarm. They had not sensed the killing of one of their own. Ram whispered a short prayer to Lord Rudra, thanking him for what had been a perfect hunt. The last thing they needed was for their position to be given away.
Ram and Lakshman made their way through the dense jungle. Ram walked in front, carrying one end of a long staff on his shoulder, while Lakshman walked behind, holding up the other end. The deers carcass dangled in the middle, its feet having been secured to the staff with a sturdy rope.

Shapovalov sorry for striking umpire
OTTAWA, Sunday: Canadas Denis Shapovalov was left mortified after joining tenniss hall of infamy on Sunday, offering an apology and promising that he would learn from his momentary explosion of temper that left a Davis Cup umpire needing a visit to hospital.
Shapovalov, one of the brightest young talents in the game at 17, said he was ashamed after hitting chair umpire Arnaud Gabas with a ball he smashed away in anger during the Canada- Britain tie in Ottawa.
After dropping serve in the third game of the third set, Denis Shapovalov hit the ball very hard, unintentionally striking chair umpire Arnaud Gabas in the left eye, causing him to need medical attention, the International Tennis Federation said in a statement on Monday.
The incident happened in the third set of the deciding rubber with the tie locked at 2-2 and Shapovalov, the Wimbledon boys champion, two sets and a break of serve down to Britains Kyle Edmund.
The teenager was immediately defaulted for unsportsmanlike conduct, with Britain handed a 3-2 victory in the tie.

Shashi Welgama further remanded till Feb.16
Two persons including former Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Chairman Shashi Welgama, a nephew of former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till February 16 by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky for allegedly cheating and misappropriating Rs. 125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.
At a previous occasion, the Court refused to grant bail to the suspects citing there are no exceptional circumstances to release them on bail. However, the defence had filed a fresh bail application on behalf of the suspects and the Court is to deliver its bail order on next hearing date.
On December 20, 2016 Welgama and Nandana Priyantha Perera, the owner of Nandana Auto Products Co. Limited were arrested by the CID regarding an investigation into a financial fraud said to have taken place when purchasing leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID had informed Court that the SLTB on two occasions had paid advance payments amounting to Rs. 40 million and Rs. 166 million to Perera to provide leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID further alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to SLTB with a deficiency, which amounted Rs. 24 million and Rs. 101 million.
The CID further alleged that the former SLTB Chairman had authorised the financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then SLTB Chairman. The CID further informed Court that original documents pertaining to this fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by the previous administration and a complaint regarding this incident had been made by present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena.
The suspects are charged under the offences under the Public Property Act.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing for the former SLTB Chairman had denied the allegations levelled against his client citing that there is no evidence to prove that his client was involved in the financial transaction. He told Court that his client had undergone a bypass surgery in 2014 and that fact be considered as an exceptional circumstance to release him on bail. At a previous occasion, the Court had issued an order directing the Controller of the Emigration and Immigration to prevent four individuals including the former SLTB Chairman, Nandana Priyantha, Sanjeewa Waidyatilleke, and Sumith Hettiarachchi from leaving the country.

Shooting John Wick was no walk in the park
John Wick: Chapter 2 filmmaker Chad Stahelski knows both Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne well; he worked as Reeves stunt double on the Matrix movies and directed the Speed star in the first John Wick film. But Stahelski admits that even he geeked out when the time came to shoot the scene in his hitman action sequel which reunites Reeves (a.k.a. the former Neo) with Fishburne (a.k.a. the onetime Morpheus).
First day with Laurence, were shooting rooftop stuff, says Stahelski. Once Keanu comes out of the door, its Laurences shot [in which he says], The Man, the myth, the legend, John Wick. We had been to Laurences apartment in New York. We had talked about the scene. Laurence and Keanu had workshopped it a little bit, so we got it pretty dialed in. Then you step on set, were doing this big crane move  The man, the myth, the legend  and Im geeking out over on the other side of the roof. Its very personal to me, because I spent so much time with these guys, and when I met them, I was only, like, 26 and just a stunt guy. [Back then] youre kind of in awe because theyre great actors, great performers, and just cool guys. They were the coolest guys to the stunt team  just how they treated their doubles and stuff. Complete class act. Cut to years later, youre sitting there, and youre Action! The man, the myth, the legend! Then theres quiet. I just spaced out for a second. And Laurence turns his head toward where I was standing, and he says, You gonna say, Cut Im like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cut! Cut, cut, cut! Im like, Yeah, I just geeked out, man, Im sorry. Im 46, and I just geeked out over you guys, Im sorry! The Hollywood Reporter

Some are trying to upset the apple cart: Ravi
A few members among the group who joined in the unity government after the formation of the good governance by the President and the Prime Minister are attempting to create problems while enjoying ministerial portfolios. They should realise that the President and the Prime Minister have engaged in one integrated journey, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
Those who worked full time to prevent the happening of good governance rule, later joined the same administration and their current attempt to put the government in trouble is clear evidence to their malice, the minister said.
The minister made these remarks after paying homage to the Temple of the Tooth Relic on Sunday. Later, the minister paid courtesy calls on Chief Prelates of the Malwathu and Asgiri Chapters an, received the blessings of the two Nayake Theras.
Karunanayake who met the media outside the temple said that he is taking directives only from the President and the Prime Minister.
He said he was not ready to be dictated by individual ministers.
The minister said the duty and responsibility of the government is to implement the mandate given by the people of this country on January 8 and criticism by certain individuals who seized ministerial positions through bargains was futile.
Karunanayake said budget allocations for some of inactive ministries have been curtailed and the relevant ministers were complaining.
"I am not going to answer such calls," he said.
The minister said the government was leading a people-friendly journey by curtailing tax and minimising waste and corruption.
Karunanayake said the country would fall into a crisis if the government was going to work according to the statements issued by some provincial governors and chief ministers.
"The President and the Prime Minister have been doing enough according to the Constitution thereby protecting the sovereignty of the country while maintaining harmony among all communities," he said.
The good governance has walked and extra mile to restore not only five-star democracy but seven-star democracy in the island. Neither white-van culture nor abductions are reported today. No incident of assault is reported either. However the process of bringing the perpetrators to book for their irregularities committed during the previous regime is delayed because such process is being done according to the rule of law, Karunanayake said.
The minister told the two Mahanayakes that the proposals by them to be considered for Budget 2017 have been included accordingly.
He said the Mahanayakes proposed to grant a monthly stipend for student monks and necessary allocation to implement the grant has been made in the budget.
The minister said a mechanism to pay the grant will be launched on the advice of the Chief Prelates.
The Malwathu Chief Prelate said that a country cannot move without revenue.
The Nayake Thera said that it is the responsibility of the government to maintain reasonable prices on essential commodities despite various public tariffs.
Karunanayake said the current government has taken measures to bring down the prices of 24 essential items out of 25 after the presidential election.

State deprived Rs. 5.5 million due to Press Club rip offs in the past
Certain individuals had allegedly earned unconscionable profits amounting to million of rupees for themselves from the Press Club maintained in Fort, Colombo for the benefit of journalists thereby depriving the state of nearly Rs. 5.5 million income during the Rajapaksa period of rule, investigations by the Presidential Commission Investigating Fraud, Corruption, Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges have revealed. Following this revelation, the Commission has summoned several former directors of information and the person said to be the manager of the Press Club and recorded statements from them.
The Press Club was opened in 1998 with a liquor licence, for the benefit of journalists to have some enjoyment after a hard days work.
Initially 356 journalists had obtained its membership but by 2003, the membership dropped to a meager 23. By 2010, it had catered to more outsiders than journalists. The Press Club earlier situated at Transworks House had been later shifted to a building in Olcott Mawatha, Colombo.

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) Executive Director Ashoka Ubeysekara said state should appoint and train officers to formulate Right to Information (RTI) Act and educate citizens about their right to information and how they can make use of it.
Speaking at a press conference at the Organization of Professional Association (OPA) auditorium yesterday, Ubeysekara said that the TISL along with the Sarvodya Movement will contribute towards implementing the Act.
TISL Right to Information Manager Sangeetha Gunaratne said a project was to be implemented yesterday and a bus would travel island-wide starting from Colombo Fort educating citizens about the RTI Act in Sinhala, English and Tamil.
She said centres would be established in the Colombo, Matara, Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, and Ratnapura Districts with Sarvodaya to assist public in understanding the RTI Act.
Public officers still do not know enough about the RTI Act or its implementation procedure. We understood it when we visited public authorities on Friday. Therefore, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry needs to train public officers to practise it, she said.

Swedish experts to assist SL exporters

Three Swedish trade experts will arrive to Colombo next week to help Sri Lankan exporters who are striving for the Swedish market.
The Department of Commerce (DoC) has made arrangements to call experts from the Swedish National Board of Trade to meet Lankan exporters in Colombo on February 15.
Sweden  Sri Lanka bilateral trade earned $64 million in 2015.
This shows that there is strong unrealised trade potential for both countries Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen said today (7).
The Minister added that DoC presentation will be a great pioneering step to open new trade opportunities and diversify the present trade.
The DoC information session in collaboration with Swedish National Board of Trade for Lankan exporters will be held in the World Trade Center, Colombo on February 15 from 10am.
The topic selection of the presentation are info on Swedish market for food products for private label industry (with special focus on dried coconut products, fruits and vegetables, spices including cinnamon, tea, organic food products), rules and regulations when exporting food products of non-animal origin to Sweden and the EU, the EU GSP+ and sustainable development, services by the Swedish National Board of Trade to the exporters of Sri Lanka and the potentials of Sri Lankan food exports to Swedish and Nordic markets. 
At present, apparel, rubber and transformers are mainly exported from Sri Lankas to Sweden while Telephone sets, Kraft papers and paperboards and gold are mainly imported from Sweden.

Taking a leaf from Thailands  Sawai Sriya agri marvels
The Sawai Sriya Garden, Nakhon Nayok Province Thailand is offering the technology of producing bio diesel from used cooking oil to Sri Lankan companies.
Chairman Sawai Sriya told the Thailand Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Nopporn Adchariyavanich, that he is now ready to share this technology with Sri Lanka and also rest of the world.
He said that he gets used cooking oil from houses and mixes them with agriculture waste and producers diesel for the past six years. This has been very successful and I am using this diesel to power my double cab vehicle for the past five years.
He said that the unique feature of this system is that its very much cheaper than diesel sold in fuel stations and there is no damage to the vehicle as he together with villagers have been using it for the past five years. In addition this process also helps the environment since we are re-using the used cooking oil and agri waste.
In addition they also have several unique, cheap and cost effective agri methods that could be easily adopted to homes and farms.One simple method is to fill a used glass bottle with water and just turn it around and put it in flower or agriculture land. The water in the bottle would then be absorbed to the plant and this has to be replaced only after several days.
Another unique method he has invested is to dig a small hole in plantain barks and plant red onions and green leaf like Kankun in them. The water from the plantain tree could sustain the plants.
He said that there are several tropical healthy plants that could be budded with oranges, lemon and lime.
Sawai Sriya Centre also today is one of the biggest attractions for tourists who come to see these unique agri marvels and exploiting this several shops too have being put together by villagers. I also have the world's tallest sugar cane tree which was made tall by joining PVC pipes and allowing the tree to pass through it. The PVC pipe is tied to a lamp post.
Nakhon Nayok is a small province in central Thailand, northeast of Bangkok. In the east are the mountains, forest and grassland of the vast Khao Yai National Park, home to diverse wildlife including bears, elephants, macaques and rare birds. However the province was virtually abandoned until the Thailand King, in 1989, under the Chaipattana Foundation bought a piece of land covering an area of six acres near Khun Dan Dam in Nakhon Nayok Province and developed the area. Later the Vajiravudh College Alumni Association under the Royal Patronage was given permission to use this piece of land as a learning project for King Bhumibols Concept of Development. This led to the planning of a recreational centre to demonstrate the royal concept and theories of agricultural development, environmental improvement, and natural resources conservation.
I took a leaf from the philosophy of the King and built The Sawai Sriya Garden, which is a major success.The philosophy tends to encourage us not to forget who we really are and what is suitable for our culture, tradition, as well as our way of life.The late king also emphasized on natural resources development.
The king paid attention to every element of natural resources which helped with the alleviation of the agricultural, environmental to livelihood and economic problems. I am now old and want to give these R&D to the benefit of the world, he said.

For the first time in Sri Lanka TESS (Tropic Engineering Supplies and Services) Group has acquired a Japanese shipping vessel to purchase fresh fish from fishermen in mid sea.
The CEO and Director of TESS Group of Companies, Shiran Fernando said that they have
invested US$ 2.4 million to get this ship from Japan.
CEO and Directors Shiran and Dilshan Fernando with the new vessel.  
He said that the main aim of this is to purchase ship from fishing boats allowing fishermen to remain in water for longer times. He said usually fishermen return to the land next day with their catch and return again in the night. This is because they dont have capacity to store fish. What we plan is to coordinate with them in med sea via GPS technology and but fish on the sea. By enforcing this plan the fishermen could remaining in sea for more days.
In addition to purchasing fish we also introduce a system to provide them essential provisions like food from our boat. An online payment scheme too is on the cards.
Fernando said that their aim is to increase fish production enabling Sri Lanka to be self sufficient, This process would also help to curtail fish imports and save foreign exchange. In addition it would also help to lower fish prices.
TESS is a diversified group of companies engaged in Engineering, Export of Marine products, Deep sea Fishing, supply of healthcare equipments & services and Export of agricultural produce from Sri Lanka.
The group is the largest exporter of Marine products from Sri Lanka to the European Markets and is among the 10 largest perishable exporters from Sri Lanka to world market and enjoys BOI status and enjoys a 15 year tax holiday.

## Title: Tissue culture: Towards better coconut plantations

Tissue culture: Towards better coconut plantations
Coconut, a tree that has a tall elegant trunk topped by a crown of green leathery leaves covering about 100 feet circumference, is one of the few trees which is traditionally bound with the Sri Lankans. As a plantation crop, it plays a vital role in the Sri Lankan economy.
There is no single plant which gives so much to man in a variety of ways. However, in Sri Lanka the coconut acreage is shrinking due to urbanisation, pests, diseases, and drought.
Even though there is a rising demand for coconut-based health and beauty products in the world, the exportable supply declines due to the increasing population which is ultimately responsible for the higher domestic consumption.
To overcome this problem, the creation of new and commercially desirable cultivars which are genetically uniform with agronomically superior characters, becomes essential and this can be achieved only by a proper breeding programme. However, due to the long life span and high genetic variability in the coconut populations (heterozygosity), coconut breeding is a long, difficult and an expensive process.
The situation is worse as coconut lacks a vegetative propagation method. A method which can be used to propagate high yielding, disease-resistant varieties rapidly will break the present yield barrier of coconut and give the strength to fight with other oil crops to retain its status as an important food source. Application of biotechnological tools for crop improvement is essential and one area under focus is clonal propagation of coconut through tissue culture technology.
Tissue culture (In vitro culture)
Tissue culture is a technique by which excised plant tissues, organs or plant cells are cultured aseptically in specially formulated artificial nutrient media, inside glass vessels, under controlled environmental conditions to grow in to new plants. The capacity of a single plant cell to divideand differentiate to generate an entire plant (totipotency) is the phenomenon behind this technique.
This is a valuable tool for plant breeders to speed up the breeding and multiplication of promising genotypes when conventional breeding methods take more than a decade. Two types of in vitro culture techniques are useful for crop improvement of coconut.
1. Micro propagation of coconut
Micropropagationwhich is a form of tissue culture is the practice of rapid multiplication of plant material to produce a large number of daughter plants. Thousands of copies of a plant can be produced using this method. The resulting daughter plants are identical to the mother plant and are similar to each other. The group of plants derived from a single individual through micropropagationis called a clone'.
Coconut is usually propagated by seed. It is the easiest and quickest method of propagation. Due to the genetic variability of coconut populations (Being a heterozygous palm), when propagated by seed, there will be much variation within the progeny. Desirable characteristics of the parent palm may not be seen in the progeny palms. In other words, no two seedling palms are alike. By multiplying high performance individuals through tissue culture, uniform daughter palms can be produced which are identical to the mother palm.
This would allow significant yield increases by propagation of high yielding individuals. In the same way, palms exhibiting resistance to certain diseases and tolerance to adverse growing conditions could be propagated. In other words clonal propagation would mean more rapid availability of breeding results to the coconut growers.
As a result of extensive research done over the years, it is now possible to regenerate coconut plants through tissue culture.Micropropagation of coconut occurs through a process called somatic embryogenesis, by undergoing a sequence of steps. In the present process, new plants are formed from somatic embryos which are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos.
The first step in the somatic embryogenesis pathway is the production of an undifferentiated mass of cells called callus'from the cultured plant tissue. These callus cells re-differentiate into somatic embryos under the appropriate culture conditions and optimum combinations of hormones.
Somatic embryos later develop into complete plantlets when given the appropriate conditions.The physiological and anatomical characteristics of micropropagated plantlets necessitate that they should be gradually acclimatized to the field environment. During acclimatization,coconut plantletsare placed in free-living conditions to acquire where they must photosynthesize and overcome challenges from microbes.
There were a lot of constrains to be solved during the journey of developing a protocol for coconut micropopagation. These were addressed one by one and considerable progress has been achieved so far. In any plant tissue culture protocol, selection of a suitable starting plant material (explant) is a major factor which governs the successful plant regeneration.
Various tissues including tender leaf, immature inflorescence, shoot tip, immature embryo and plumule (obtained from the mature embryo) and unfertilized ovaries have been used in clonal propagation research.Among the several explants tested so far, unfertilized ovary which is collected from unopened female flowers have shown to be the most promising explant.In coconut, a new inforescence emerges at the tip of the crown every four weeks.
After emergence, the spathe splits open due to the expansion of the inorescence. When collecting explants for coconut micropropagation, newly split open inorescence is designated as stage 0 and the next inflorescence immediately below it, which has not opened, as stage -1. Unfertilized ovaries are dissected from immature inflorescences collected from -4 stages (inflorescence to be opened in 4 months time) causing a minimal damage to the mother palm while collecting explants. Thus this technique allows repeated collection of explants from the same mother palm in 6 - 9 month intervals.From one particular inflorescence the number of explants which can be cultured is low because the average number of female flowers that exist is generally around 30. This is one of the drawbacks of using unfertilized ovary as the explant limiting large scale culturing to produce higher number of clonal plants. This canbe overcome by a callus multiplication phase introduced after callus initiation. Callus multiplication finally contributes to an increase in the success rate of plant regeneration. Tissue culture response of unfertilized ovary explants excised from each palm shows very high variation. In order to overcome this limitation, attempts have been made to identify a pool of mother palms which are responsive for in vitroculture. Activated charcoal has been used during culture process in order to prevent tissue browning.In spite of its advantage of adsorbing growth inhibitory substances; activated charcoal also adsorbs growth regulators especially synthetic auxins such as 2, 4-D in the medium which ultimately lead to undefined culture conditions.The problems associated with batch to batch character difference in activated charcoal were minimized by using Activated coconut shell charcoal (ACSC) from a Sri Lankan Company. ACSCis a guaranteed source of activated charcoal with consistent characteristics and the product has been assured for having the same origin throughout and guaranteed by the manufacturer.
Even though plant regeneration from various tissues is possible, the number of clonal plants obtained still remains low. However, not like in previous days, now it is possible to regenerate coconut plantlets consistently through micropropgation. Slow growth and low survival rate of clonal plants after transplanting in soil are other handicaps that need to be resolved through further research efforts. The promising results obtained so far by ovary culture indicated that cloning coconut is not far-fetched and it can become a reality in the near future. This will also lead to rapid mass propagation of improved varieties ensuring a steady supply of uniform, high quality planting material to growers.
2. Mature zygotic embryo culture
Besides clonal propagation, embryo culture technology is also an important tool for plant improvement. This technique mainly facilitates collection, exchange and conservation of coconut germplasm.Embryo culture involves excising an embryo aseptically from the seed and planting it in a sterile nutrient medium. Instead of the endosperm in the seed, culture medium provides all the necessary ingredients for the embryos to germinate and develop into complete plants.
In vitro raised, embryo germinated plants are transferred to soil within 6-8 months of culture. After a few months of hardening, they could be planted in the field. Embryo culture is a fairly simple technique which is easy to perform. This is mainly used for three main purposes.
i. Embryo rescue
Embryo culture technology is used to save embryos that fail to develop naturally. One such coconut type is Dikiri coconut. Dikiri coconuts are characterized by the soft, jelly-like kernel that almost fills the interior of the nut. The liquid endosperm in these nuts is thick and viscous instead of watery. Coconut cultivars with similar kernel characters are found in different countries with different names; Makapuno in the Philippines, Kopyor in Indonesia, ThairuThengai or NeiThengai or Ghee Thengai in India and Mapharao Khati in Thailand.
The Makapuno is an expensive delicacy and its planting material is highly priced in the Philippines. In Sri Lanka, dikiri-bearing palms are rare and they are mainly confined to Weligama area in the Matara District.
This type of coconut has a very limited production (normally, only 2-20% Dikiri nuts could be harvested from an ordinary Dikiri-bearing palm) and is of high price, which is more than 10 times higher than the normal fresh coconut due to soft and sweet flesh, meaning that it is much sought after by customers. Due to the economic benefits, the farmers are keen to propagate and build up a population of Dikiri plants.
Micropropagation of coconut through somatic embryogenesis using unfertilized ovaries as the explant
However,Dikiri nuts do not germinate under normal conditions because the endosperm which supports the germination of the embryo is abnormal and rots when the nut matures. Farmers face problems raising Dikiri palms due to this problem.
Now the embryo culture technology is used successfully at CRI to rescue Dikiri embryos. Since the embryo present in the Dikiri nut is normal, it can be removed from the abnormal kernel (embryo rescue) and cultured in a suitable growth medium. Resulting plants have the potential of producing 75-100% Dikiri nut yield if planted together and/or isolated from other coconut palms by a pollen barrier.Distribution of Dikiri plants among growershas an impact on poverty alleviation by way of improving the smallholder's income. Nearly 100 in vitroraised Dikiri plants have been established in the field and some plants have already been distributed among farmers.
ii. Germplasm exchange
Coconut growing countries including Sri Lanka face problems when trying to develop new varieties due to thelimited availability of genetic material for the breeders to use. This is one of the major obstaclesthat delay the progress in coconut variety improvement. This problem could be solved if coconut material from different coconut growing countries could be exchanged for coconut breeding programmes.
Germplasm materials are now made available to interested coconut producing countries through a programme lounged by Coconut Genetic Resources Network (COGENT). However, exchange of coconut germplasm was hampered by the large size of the nut, lack of dormancy and phytosanitary difficulties. Embryo culture provides a solution to these problems.
Germplasm can be exchanged in the form of excised embryosin small tubes and germinate them in to complete plantlets in the recipient country. The safe movement of germplasm is assured through this technology as the risk of contamination is minimal.Under the germplasm exchange program, embryos from twenty three varieties were brought from three different countries namely India, Papua New Guinea and Ivory Coast.
These embryos were grown in culture and the resulting plants were field planted.These varieties will be used by the coconut breeders of Sri Lanka for future-breeding programmes.
iii. Germplasm conservation
In vitro techniques are of great interest for the collecting and storage of coconut germplasm. Coconut produce recalcitrant seeds, i.e. seeds that cannot be dried to sufficiently low moisture level to allow their storage at low temperature. Traditionally, coconut genetic resources are preserved as whole plants in field gene banks. However, conservation in the field gene banks is subjected to risks of losses caused by biological and climatic hazards. In addition, field gene banks require huge land areas and routine maintenance is very expensive.
Different in vitro conservation methods are employed, depending on the storage duration requested. For short- and medium-term storage, the aim is to reduce growth and to increase the intervals between subcultures. For long-term storage, cryopreservation, i.e. storage at ultra-low temperature, usually that of liquid nitrogen (-196C), is the only current method. At this temperature, all cellular divisions and metabolic processes are stopped.
The plant material can thus be stored without alteration or modification for a theoretically unlimited period of time. Moreover, cultures are stored in a small volume, protected from contamination, requiring very limited maintenance. Appropriate culture media have been developed to allow short and medium-term preservation of mature embryos.
Once cultured in these media, the embryos are subjected to a slow growth phase, and they can be recovered later by transferring to germination medium. Preliminary experiments done at Coconut Research Institute, Sri Lanka have also shown that long-term conservation of coconut embryos is feasible through cryopreservation.

Trademark conundrum
Delays in local trademark registrations are leading to many Sri Lankan businesses from not being able to fully reap the benefits of the Madrid Protocol and access international markets, revealed a recent study by Verite Research. The Protocol is a centralised global system that simplifies the process Sri Lankan businesses have to undergo when registering trademarks abroad. The Government 2016 budget however allocated Rs.100 million to speed up accession to the Madrid Protocol.
Executive Director, Verite Research Dr. Nishan De Mel highlighted that Sri Lankan business go through a lengthy and costly process to register their trademarks abroad.
Trademarks help consumers to easily recognise specific products or services and it is a valuable business asset. It reduces the time, inconvenience and cost incurred by companies that try to ensure international recognition and protection of their trademarks, explained De Mel.
He said not only huge businesses but even the small companies have realised the need for trademark registration and added that the concept of export, building trademarks and branding has widely increased in Sri Lanka and this shows how important it is to have an efficient system for trademarks.
The Madrid Protocol is a centralised, simplified system of registering trademarks abroad. It is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). Currently, there are 98 members in the Madrid Protocol covering 114 states and organisations. It is a convenient process as it allows companies to register their trademark in multiple countries by filing a single application in one language while paying a single set of fees. Further, the system guarantees that applications would be processed within a fixed period of one to one and half years. It also removes the need to hire local attorneys, thus saving a lot of money spent as legal fees.
NIPO of Sri Lanka stands as a barrier to the potential success abroad
According to Dr. De Mel, the National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO) of Sri Lanka takes around 3-5 years to process trademark applications.
He pointed out that despite significant growth in resident trademark applications during the last decade, the number of trademarks registered a year have stagnated.
Registering trademarks at home is an important first step for a company that seeks to register its trademarks abroad. Therefore, to get the full benefits of accession to the Madrid Protocol, Sri Lanka needs to first take measures to address the problems within the local trademark registration system, he added.
Dr. De Mel explained that a market economy was expected to generate price reductions and quality improvements for consumers by creating competition between produces to deliver the best value for money. For producers to compete and distinguish themselves amongst buyers their product should be uniquely recognisable; that means other producers should not be able to mimic their trademarks. Trademarks are words, images or a combination of these and act as unique identifiers. When the product of a company comes to be trusted and valued for its quality, the trademarks of the company become the repository of that value; this is how the customer recognises the historically established credibility of the product.
This competitive drive for improvement and trust among producers can only be sustained by allowing trademarks to be protected from imitation, he added.
He further explained that if the government wanted to accede to the Madrid Protocol, then they should take initiatives to quicken the local registrations.
If the country joins the Madrid Protocol, it becomes compulsory for the companies to have the local registrations in place to get international registration. Global applications will be rejected if the company has not registered locally. Local registration at NIPO is the starting point, the whole process will be jammed if that is not efficient, he said.
He noted that Sri Lanka fared poorly compared to other middle income countries like the Philippines, Bulgaria and Vietnam given their inability to get trademarks registered locally at a much faster pace. The number of local trademarks registered as a percentage of applications a year was over 50 percent in these countries prior to their accession to the Madrid protocol, whereas in Sri Lanka it is as low as 14 percent.
Verite Research found that the requirement the Madrid Protocol imposes on Sri Lanka in return for its benefits was simple. That is, to demonstrate its ability to process foreign trademark applications within a short, fixed period of one and half years.
The benefits Sri Lanka can gain from the Madrid Protocol is severely undermined by the slow process of trademark registration in Colombo, said Dr. De Mel.
He also highlighted the lack of stakeholder consultation and transparency of the accession process and added that even though a year has passed since the proposal to accede was made, stakeholders are unaware of the progress that has been made.
However, publicly available information revealed a large gap between the number of applications that the National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO) received, the number of trademarks issued and the time taken to register trademarks.
Verite Research pointed out that on average, during the last decade, NIPO received 4,540 trademark applications a year from within Sri Lanka but only issued an average of 755 registrations per year. That is 17 percent of the average number of applications. The number of trademark applications has increased over the years but the number of registrations have remained stagnant. In contrast, the Intellectual Property office of the Philippines received on average 12,949 resident trademark applications from within the country and registered 8,320 trademarks a year during the same period. That is 64 percent of the average number of applications. Vietnam received on average 22,700 resident trademark applications a year during the last decade and registered 13,053 trademarks a year during the same period. That is 57.5 percent of average applications a year.
Meanwhile, consultations with the private sector had revealed that institutional and process inefficiencies were the key reasons for the delay.
The NIPO did not respond to requests for information or for meetings with senior officials despite numerous phone calls, emails and faxes. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a full analysis of the duration-data and the reasons for the very low number of trademarks registered in Colombo. Identifying the reasons and addressing them remains vital for the country to benefit from the Madrid system, said Dr. de Mel. He further said that at present, there was no mechanism in place for the private sector, a key stakeholder in the process, to regularly interact with the NIPO. Hence, one instrument is to put a system in place for the private sector to be an active participant in the process. In addition, another instrument could be the involvement of the oversight committees of Parliament, regularly enquiring and monitoring the bureaucracy on its local trademark registration performance and status of accession to the Madrid Protocol.
NIPO Responds
Director General, NIPO, G.R Ranawaka speaking to the Daily News however denied allegations that they were the main obstacle to Sri Lanka realising its full potential through the Madrid Protocol.
The DG stressed that her work was complex and made even more difficult with an extremely short staffed department.
We have to check whether there are similar trademarks and also check the subjective and objective grounds on whether the mark is acceptable. Then we inform the applicant. After the applicant has paid the application fee we publish it in a government gazette. Thereafter it has to be kept for three months for the public to make objections if there are any. If no objections, the applicant would be granted the certification once the registration fees are paid, she explained.
Ranawaka stated that the time consumed to issue certification depended on the goods.
There are 45 classes and they are distributed to the officers. Depending on the classes, the number of applications received vary. In the Food class (starch, tea and coffee) there is a backlog of two years which needs to be cleared. Sometimes it takes one year or two years to finalise an application because of the backlog. Before 2013, there were some applications that we couldnt even touch due to the shortage of staff, she added.
Ranawaka further said there were only 10 officers even though they should have 20. The vacancies have not been filled thus far.
After I took over office in 2012, we managed to get down development officers through the graduates scheme. The Management Services Department do not allow NIPO to recruit directly- it is government policy. They were not trained in IT, so we had to train them to work in this field and we had 20,000 to 30,000 applications to be cleared. We worked on them in 2014 and 2015 and the certifications are being issued now, she said.
She noted that NIPO had a backlog of about 12,000 applications which were filed in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
They are currently working on a project to clear all the applications before the end of this year as the government is planning to accede to the Madrid Protocol.
NIPO has recruited some officials on an outsourced project also to quicken the process, she added.
Madrid accession is a 3 to 4 year project in any given country. WIPO says a country cannot access the Madrid protocol within a year and they have advised to spend minimum three years on this project. The government allocated 100 million for 2016 and I requested the funding to be divided into two years, the treasury agreed and we got Rs.50 Million. We have done a lot of work with IT upgrading and the e-filing systems are now in place. Many awareness sessions were conducted and though we invited many, they were unwilling to attend these events, she said.
Ranawaka claimed that shortage of staff was one of the reasons for the delay in issuing the trade mark certificates.
Even now we have a shortage of staff and I am struggling to meet targets. I am the only official in the senior level; there are no directors or deputy directors as it is only the Public Service Commission that can appoint. It is through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that NIPO can send requests. Generally, in the executive category the procedure is to recruit to the assistant director level first. They can become deputy directors only after 10 years and the deputy directors will be promoted as directors after another seven years. Directors have to spend five years before becoming the Director General, she said.
Ranawaka noted that she spent over 20 years at NIPO to become the DG and in the last 20 years there have been no recruitments to the assistant director level.
She explained that there was a huge service gap between her and the junior level officers.
After I became the DG, I promoted an official as the assistant director and there were two more vacancies as legal officers. An examination had to be conducted by the Examination Department to recruit them and they took nearly one and half years to conduct it. But to the senior level, NIPO does not have the authority to conduct examinations directly.
Public Service Commission has to approve to recruit senior officials from the government service. It is now that the PSC has given the approval for recruitment, she added.
When officers are not recruited on time the problem persist through out. It is now that we see some measures being taken. We receive nearly 9,000 to 10,000 applications every year and only 3,000 applications reach the registration level. There are more 12,000 applications that need to be cleared before the end of this year and we are working towards it, said the DG.
Importance of trademarks for Sri Lankan business
Trademarks help consumers distinguish one product from another and provide an important competitive edge for companies over similar products from their rivals.
Protecting trademarks by registering them at home and abroad is a vital first step in safeguarding the reputation and brand value in respective markets, said Chairperson and Chief Executive of the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), Indira Malwatte .
She noted that this would help prevent others from copying or misusing the trademark and tarnishing the reputation of the company and added that the proposal made by the government in 2015 to join the Madrid protocol is a step taken in the right direction.
Dr. De Mel also pointed out that registering trademarks abroad is cumbersome.
It entails submitting multiple applications in multiple languages to multiple intellectual property (IP) offices in multiple countries. The time each IP office takes to register trademarks is not fixed and can vary between a year to ten years. The trademark owners have to hire IP lawyers in each country and spend considerably on legal fees, he said.
Malwatte said if the benefit of a hard-earned reputation can be stolen by copying it, there will be little incentive to earn that reputation and a companys success in registering trademarks and developing a brand image at home is likely to increase the probability of success abroad.
As there are delays in the process, the product we take to the international market are copied and sold by the time the company gets the international trademark registration. This is the reason for having a system of national and international registration of trademarks and providing concomitant protection.
Registration normally takes place with the intellectual property (IP) offices in each country, she noted.
Verite Research further revealed that calculations made by the International Trademark Association of the United States as far back as in 2003 shows that the cost to register a trademark in the USA and 10 other countries under the national route (by applying through individual IP offices in each country) amounts to US $ 14,600 and only US $ 5,800 under the Madrid route. There are two constituencies that directly benefit through Sri Lankas accession to the Madrid Protocol. The first are international companies in Madrid member countries that are keen to supply to Sri Lanka but have not yet registered their trademark in Sri Lanka.
They are helped by Sri Lankas accession because, then, if they lodge their application through WIPO, their application will be processed within 18 months in Sri Lanka. The second group that benefits are Sri Lankan exporters who have already registered their trademark in Sri Lanka, claimed Dr. De Mel.
According to Malwatte, accession to the Madrid Protocol will enable Sri Lankan exporters to develop their product and brand with confidence, knowing that the investment in consumer confidence is duly protected.
This in the longer term also encourages them to develop and sell products under their own trademarks/brand names in export markets, rather than being invisible to customers and remaining a supplier to brands/trademarks owned by others.

Trump to create voter fraud commission led by VP Pence
US: Donald Trump said Sunday he is creating a commission headed by Vice President Mike Pence to investigate what the US leader alleges was massive voter fraud in the 2016 election.
No public evidence has emerged of large-scale illegal voting in the November election, and Trump and the White House have failed to substantiate the president's claim. However Trump listed the ways he believed voter fraud had occurred during an interview with Fox News's Bill O'Reilly which aired before the Super Bowl on Sunday.
The fraud was apparent, Trump said, when you look at the registration and you see dead people that have voted, when you see people that are registered in two states that voted in two states, when you see other things, when you see illegals -- people that are not citizens -- and they are on the registration rolls.
It's really a bad situation. It's really bad Trump said.
Trump's own lawyers have stated in legal filings that there was no evidence of fraud in the November 8 election.
But on Sunday the president promised to set up a commission to headed by Vice President Mike Pence and we're going to look at it very, very carefully.
Trump has previously argued that were it not for illegal immigrants voting, he would have won not just the electoral college but also the popular vote, which was taken by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.
Although there has been no substantiated evidence of massive voter fraud, US officials have said they believe that Russia attempted to meddle in the presidential vote by hacking Democratic Party emails as part of a pro-Trump campaign.

UNPARALLELED PATRIOTISM
Continued from yesterday
The fighting reached its climax from June to August and it became quiet by October. The reinforcements arrived from Madras lifting the morale of the British soldiers. In addition they adapted another method of suppressing the rebellion by terrorizing the people and setting fire to crops, destroying houses and irrigation systems, depriving them of their livelihood.
Herbert White the British Government Agent at Badulla has minuted: If thousands died in the battle they were all fearless and clever fighters. People have lost their houses and all their belongings. It is doubtful whether Uva has at least now recovered from the catastrophe.
The true identity of the pretender was revealed. Although he was known as Doraisamy, he was none other than Wilbawe a disrobed Buddhist monk and was arrested. He then escaped and fled to Bintanne where he found a sanctuary among the Adhivasis.
In the meantime a serious misunderstanding arose between Keppetipola and Madugalle. Later they patched up their differences and then led the rebellion. Nevertheless the disunity among them affected the rank and file, which helped greatly to turn the course of events in favour of the British.
Governor Brownrigg on January 1, 1818 met the Kandyan chieftains at the Magul Maduwa, addressing them in a long speech which was interpreted by Abraham de Saram expressed his concern and disappointment said: any inhabitant in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) should have been wicked and bad base enough to plunge his country into war in an attempt to place on the throne a member of the late Malabar king whose tyranny and oppression the British had rescued it.
The Governor warned the chieftains saying that Great Britain would never relinquish a sovereignty acquired by the voluntary acts of the chieftains and people.
Declared the leader of a gang
He then read a Proclamation in which he stated, Keppetipola with 18 other rebels, outlaws enemies of the Britannic Majestys Government.
Continuing his speech the Governor said, anyone who helped to seize the traitors could be assured of honours and promotion. But he also added, I have the power without your assistance to put this rebellion down and I will put it down.
The proclamation also stated that their lives accordingly forfeited and their property confiscated. Their lands it was announced would be distributed as rewards among those who continued to be loyal. Keppetipola alias Monaravila was declared the leader of a gang.
Inspite of the Governors warnings and actions, Earl of Bathurst, the Secretary of State in England, in June 18, wrote to the Governor, nothing could justify the pertinacious prolongation of the conquest which assumed extremely doubtful.
The fighting continued and it became more intensive. On February 18 Martial law was declared over the entire Kandyan provinces. By this time the Kandyan Provinces had put forth their own leaders.
In April a reward of 1,000 pagodas was offered for the head of Keppetipola and an equal sum of money was offered for the head of Pilimatalawa. The situation however became so serious when arrangements were made to withdraw British troops from their positions in the Kandyan provinces.
Molligoda Disava in charge of Hatara Korale remained loyal to the British throughout and it helped the British to communicate between Colombo and Kandy. The shortage of food and illness among the rebels became acute daily which made the rebels disillusioned about their struggle. Due to the prolonged struggle the rebels found it difficult to replenish their numbers who were sick.
Other than Molligoda and Ehelepola the other Chieftains remained neutral or were loyal to the British. However, Ehelepola who remained loyal to the British was taken into custody and was sent to Colombo but no charges were made against him. Later he was sent on exile to Mauritious by the British providing the necessary comforts of a prince, where he spent the last years of his life.
The Chieftains Mollogoda, Ekneligoda, Mahavalatanne and Muslims continued to support the British which eventually helped to quell the uprising. By August the fighting abated. All was quiet in October.
British troops
Madugalle on an earlier occasion on September 8, on the advice of Pilimatalawa expressed his willingness to hand over Kepetipola and Wilbawe and cooperate with Kapuwatte and Ehelepola. This suggestion of Madugalle was conveyed to the Agent in Sat Korale.
At the same time on October 28, the officer in charge Nikawella Camp Ensign Schulebraid received the information of a Bhikkhu hiding in a nearby jungle sent dome of his men to capture him.
On reaching the place the Bhikkhu was brought before the officer. It was then revealed the monk was Wariyapola Sri Sumangala who had the Sacred Tooth Relic concealed in a bundle of robes he was carrying with him. The recovery of the Relic from the rebels was regarded by the people as a sign of the destiny of the British to rule over the Kandyans.
Although Madugalle patched up the differences with the other rebel leaders, with the arrival of the reinforcement from India the British troops became fortified.
The news of the fleeing Keppetipola and Pilimatalawa heading for Anuradhapura came to be known to the British troops led by Lieutenant William ONiell who followed them on their trails. They left in the early hours on October 4, 1818, reached Puliyankulama Village in the afternoon at 3.00 p.m. They finally arrived at Paravahagama and surrounded the Paravahagama Walauwa where Keppetipola, Pilimatalawa and others were staying.
It was a rainy day which made the journey difficult for the soldiers. When they surrounded the Walauwa, two rounds of firing were aimed at them. Then the guns became stilled. On the orders of ONiell, the soldiers broke into the Walauwa when Keppetipola appeared from inside, held the hands of ONiell and identified himself saying I am Keppetipola.
Details of Disavas capture
Pilimatalawa was sick and was lying in bed while Madugalla succeeded in escaping through the rear of the Walauwa, with two other Mohottalas taking with them Keppetipola Disavas sword and his dress he wore in battle and his ornaments, hurriedly fled to Monaravila Walauwa in Koswatta close to Matale.
The two Mohottalas and Madugalle reached the Walauwa at Monaravila. While conveying the details of the Disavas capture his wife fainted. Madugalle who was standing close by held her preventing from falling. After regaining her senses, she spoke saying that she would go to Kandy and meet the British Agent and plead innocence of her husband.
Madugalle cautioned her not to do so and said it would create problems and futile to act in that manner.
Three days later after arresting Keppetipola, Madugalle too was arrested and they were brought to Kandy under army guard. The news of the arrest of Kepptipola and Madugalle by Lieutenant ONiell made Governor Brownrigg happy and congratulated him, ordered extra allowance to the members of the British army who accompanied ONiell. In a Gazette notification the Governor felicitated Lieutenant ONiell, on the capture of these superlative disturbers of public peace.
On the same day of arrest November 13, they were tried under court martial for waging war with intent to subvert His Majestys Government lawfully established.
The court comprised Lieutenant Colonel R. Kelly, the President while H.W. Cleather was the Deputy Judge Advocate. The order of the court was given on the same day.
It said, The court having maturely weighed and considered the evidence in support of prosecution and given due weight to such matters as have been waged by the prisoner in his defence is of opinion that the said Keppetipola late Disava of Ouva otherwise called Monaravila Maha Nilame was guilty of acts of treason. Wherewith he is charged viz. Keppetipola late Disava of Uva otherwise called Monaravila Maha Nilame, a proclaimed traitor charged with having at various places was against the Majestys Government by having in or about the month of May last at Diyabatme Welle and other places in Uva exercised the office of the First Adigar or Minister to a person pretending to be king of Kandy and by having in or about the month of July last entered the Province of the four Korales with a body of armed men for the purpose of instigating the people of that Province to rebellion with the view of subverting His Majestys Government lawfully established.
Kandyan chieftains
The court having so found the prisoner guilty aforesaid doth adjudge him to suffer death at such a time and place and in such manner as His Excellency the Governor and Commander of the Forces may be pleased to direct.
While Keppetipola was in jail according to Henry Marshall, Deputy Director General of Army Hospitals, Keppetipola conducted himself with self expression. When Marshall visited him in jail, he spread out the coarse soiled cloth he was wearing round his waist, said smilingly, you know this is not the way I used to dress.
Marshall also said, that Keppetipola never hesitated to discuss the subject of the insurrection and his manners and conduct were frank and affable in the company of Europeans unlike other Kandyan chieftains.
Keppetipola and Madugalle were executed near Bogambara lake on November 26. They were first taken to the Sri Dalada Maligawa on that day early morning at their request where they met Sawers, whom Keppetipola knew at Badulla.
Marshall then described the last act of these two leaders. The knelt before the priest upon the threshold of the sanctuary, the repository where the Sacred Relic was placed.
Keppetipola gave a description of the meritorious acts which he did to the Sangha and gifts bestowed on temples and other acts of piety. He then pronounced his prarthana  the last wish he made was that in his next birth he might be born in the Himalayas and finally attain Nirvana.
Last religious offering
Thus concluded his religious devotions. He was then addressed by the Nayaka Thera who spoke in an impressive tone and manner acknowledged that his merits thus accrued were great and pronounced a benediction.
The last words of the monk were as sure as a stone thrown up into the air returns to the earth so will you in consideration of your religious merits, be present at the next incarnation of the Buddha and receive your reward.
The scene between the chief monk and Keppetipola was most solemn and impressive. Keppetipola who had been kneeling all this while rose up turning to Sawers, addressed him I give you a share of the merits of my last religious offering.
He then rewound his upper cloth from the waist and presented it to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, jocularly observing it said, although it was both foul and ragged the merit of the offering would not on these accounts be diminished it being all he had to give. Keppetipola in a firm and collected manner shook hands with Sawers and bade farewell.
Keppetipola sent his last message to his wife through a close associate and requested her to go with her son Podi Banda to live with her parents at Delwala Walauwa in Marapana close to Kegalle and to convert his residence at Keppetipola into a temple and with the income from the lands to maintain the temple. Afterwards he was conducted to the place of execution near Bogambara lake not far from Sri Dalada Maligawa. He then requested to be provided with water for ablutions and asked for a short time to perform his religious rites. His request was granted and he washed his hands and face, tied up his hair in a knot on the top of his head and sat down on the ground beside a small bush, grasping it at the same time with his toes and from the fold of his cloth which enclosed his loins he took a small Bana potha.
He began to recite some gathas from it, then handed it to the local official who was present and requested him to give it to Sawers as a token of gratitude he felt for his friendship and kindness shown while they were officially associated at Badulla.
While Keppetipola was repeating Pali gathas the executioner struck him on the back of his neck with a short sword. At the time he breathed out the words Araham. A second stroke deprived him of life as he fell on the ground  a corpse. His head then being separated from the body and according to the Kandyan custom it was placed on his chest.
Henry Marshall later presented the cranium of the departed Keppetipola Disava to the Museum of Phrenological Society of Edinburgh.
When Sri Lanka was granted independence the skull of the Disava was returned to the island. On November 26, 1954, the skull was interred in a memorial built at the Maha Maluwa facing the Pattiruppuwa of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. The memorial pillar is based on a platform of the architecture of the Anuradhapura period  the foundation of the Sinhalese culture.
The monument is a Kandyan pillar standing on a moulded base. The centre of the pillar has four panels adapted from the carvings of Embekke devale and on each of which is carved the figure of a Sinhalese soldier in the attitude of fighting. The capitol of the pillar is surmounted by a Vimana copied from Gadaladeniya vihara. The pillar symbolizes the brave chieftain who laid down his life for his country.
The panel relief portrays his act of bravery and the Vimana signifies that he has been exalted to the position of a higher spirit.

US Justice Department defends 'lawful' Trump travel ban

The US Department of Justice has defended President Donald Trump's travel ban and urged an appeals court to reinstate it in the interests of national security.
A 15-page brief argued it was a "lawful exercise of the president's authority" and not a ban on Muslims.
The executive order temporarily banned entry for all refugees and visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries.
A hearing has been set for Tuesday on whether to allow or reject the ban.
The filing was made to the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in response to the halting of Trump's order on Friday by a federal judge in Washington state.
The judge had argued the ban was unconstitutional and harmful to the state's interests.
As a result, people from the seven countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - with valid visas were able to travel to the US again.
What did the Department of Justice argue
The brief filed on Monday evening said the Washington court had "erred in entering an injunction barring enforcement of the order".
"But even if some relief were appropriate, the court's sweeping nationwide injunction is vastly overbroad," the Department of Justice added.
The key arguments in the brief are:
the president is best placed to make decisions about national security
it is "incorrect" to call it a ban on Muslims because the seven countries were identified for their terror risk
the executive order is therefore "neutral with respect to religion"
aliens outside the US have no rights to due process
Confusion at airports
The executive order issued by President Trump on 25 January fulfilled his campaign promise to tighten restrictions on arrivals to the US.
Its main components were:
nationals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - even those with visas - banned from entering the US;
a temporary ban on all refugee admissions;
the reprioritisation of minority religion (interpreted to mean Christian) refugee claims;
a ban on all Syrian refugees;
a cap on total annual refugee admissions to the US of 50,000.
It caused confusion at US and foreign airports when it came into force, and was widely condemned, although polls suggest that US public opinion is sharply divided on the policy.
Who has spoken out against the ban
The states of Washington and Minnesota have argued that as well as being unconstitutional, the travel ban is harmful to their residents, businesses and universities.
Attorneys general in 16 states have signed a letter condemning the ban, and lawsuits have been launched in 14 states.
Former secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeleine Albright and former CIA director Leon Panetta have joined others in drafting a letter which describes the travel ban as ineffective, dangerous and counterproductive.
And lawyers for tech firms including Apple and Googlehave also lodged argumentswith the court, saying that the travel ban would harm their companies by making it more difficult to recruit employees.
Supreme Court battle looms
Trump's defence is similar to the Department of Justice argument - that national security is at risk.
The president has attacked the "so-called" judge behind the Washington ruling, and said: "If something happens blame him and court system."
Whatever the decision of the appeals court on Tuesday, the case could end up in the highest court in the US, the Supreme Court.
The last immigration case that reached the justices there ended in a 4-4 tie.
But if Trump's nominee to fill the ninth berth, Neil Gorsuch, is confirmed in time, it could tip the balance in the president's favour.

VAT Case: Court orders release of production items
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court has issued an order directing the CID to release the inventory receipts of the confiscated documents belonging to an aggrieved party of the controversial VAT case, which were mixed up with the production items of the VAT case.
The Chief Magistrates Court made this order consequent to a request by the counsel appearing for Shirani Anoma Wettasinghe Dullewa, an aggrieved party in the controversial VAT case.
Counsel asked the inventory receipts of the confiscated documents be released to them in accordance with the High Court judgement.
An aggrieved party of the controversial VAT case alleged that the Criminal Investigations Department was yet to release the inventory receipts of the confiscated documents belonging to them, which were mixed up with the production items of the VAT case.On October 3, 2014, the Colombo High Court ordered the release of the receipts of the confiscated documents belonging to Dullewa and her son, a third party, after delivering the judgement of the main case.
A letter forwarded by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) secretary had also maintained that the certified copies of the inventory receipts (Confiscated 37 documents) could be handed over to Dullewa after delivering the judgement.
However, the aggrieved party observed that even though more than two years have passed after delivering the judgement, the CID was yet to release the inventory receipts.
Filing an affidavit before the Colombo High Court, Dullewa had stated that a large number of deposit certificates belonging to her and her son Upendra Wettasinghe Dullewa were found among the production items of the VAT case.
She requested Court that an order be issued to release the deposit certificates belonging to her and her son if they were not relevant to the VAT fraud case (4027/7) and unless included in the witness list.
On a previous occasion, counsel appearing for the aggrieved party informed Court that the money his clients earned from overseas had been deposited in Treasury bills with the approval of the Central Bank and the relevant documents pertaining to the deposited money were taken into CID custody.
The counsel said these documents were not relevant to the VAT fraud case and the CID might have mixed it up with the VAT case documents.

Whats in a pocket
Pockets are great only when you have them and only when they are large enough to stuff anything you want inside them. While mens clothing tends to have capacious, visible pockets, womens clothing tends to have small pockets, if any at all. Womens jeans have pockets, but not big enough to even fit the latest smart phones. The question that many women have been asking for a while now is why are womens pockets so tiny or totally non-existent Dont women need to carry keys and a mobile phone, too
While some designers feel that pockets arent required in womens wear, others opine that if women want them, the designers would be happy to provide more practical pockets in their collection. Over the years, we have seen an increase in the necessity of pockets in womens wear which is why, designers have made a shift towards increasing them among womens clothing. We now have pockets in dresses, kurtas and even lehengas. If women are now asking for more practical pockets, designers will most definitely respond with clothes suited to their needs, says designer Rahul Mishra. Talking about whether introducing pockets in kurtis or trousers decrease the fashion quotient, Rahul says, Not at all. Aesthetically speaking, pockets dont necessarily go with all kinds of clothes, so that definitely needs to be taken into consideration.
According to designer Payal Singhal, who designs contemporary Indian clothing, traditionally Indian wear didnt have pockets and hence most brands still dont have them. As a lot of east and west designs are fusing, several designers are adding pockets in Indian wear too, she says. Further, she says, The general rule of the pocket is that your whole palm can go inside it comfortably, and hence the latest mobile should fit. Maybe its that they are trying to save the fabric or something, I dont know.Many women have been complaining about the inadequacy of their pockets, mens clothes, on the other hand, have loads of pockets, thus freeing their hands and movement considerably. However, many think a womans handbag can never be replaced by a pocket, no matter how comfortable. Men have minimal things to carry, on the other hand, women tend to carry their keys, phones, their lipstick, their compact, their tissues and so many other things. So, women need handbags, even if the pockets are big and spacious, says well-known designer Anamika Khanna.
Ace designer Rocky S thinks that its not possible to have pockets on certain dresses.
Weve always believed in incorporating pockets that are practical and help hold basics. However, we understand, it is not always possible to have pockets; large or small on particular silhouettes that require a certain flow. At the end fashion is about utility. It is the buyers choice and we understand the changing needs and constantly try to keep pace with it.
History of pocket in women clothing
l In the 17th Century, pockets in a womans dress used to do a lot more than simply decorate. A pocket was one of the few truly private places to keep personal possessions.
l In the 18th and 19th Century however, womens pockets shrunk and sometimes even disappeared.
l In the late 19th Century, dress patterns started to include instructions for sewing pockets into skirts if you felt like being an independent woman.
l At the dawn of the 20th Century, fashion was so obsessed with slimming womens silhouettes that pockets started getting cut out of womens pants completely.
l 21st Century did see the return of pockets in the women clothing lines, but they are generally very small or even fake.

Wimukthi Galahitiyawa wins FCCISL award for Brand Centrical
Wimukthi Galahitiyawa is is an award-winning entrepreneur, a strategist and an innovator with a passion to make brands look better and a vision to make people who work with him better, too.
He is currently a Director and Brand Strategist of Brand Centrical which he founded in 2013 with his business partner Diluni who also happens to be his wife.
Wimukthi was felicitated by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) as the Young Entrepreneur of the Year for 2016. A self-taught Creative turned Brand Strategist and currently the Co-founder of Sri Lanka's first Branding Agency that focuses mainly on branding, Wimukthi said that his journey as an entrepreneur has not always been a smooth one.
Sharing his story with us, he said that while working full time he also had his own business on the side ever since he left school.
Being an entrepreneur is challenging. It may require you to step out of your comfort zone, take risks and face a crisis. What's important is however not to lose focus in the process,Wimukthi said.
Commenting on the industry, he emphasised the importance of companies taking branding more seriously and how branding is a more comprehensive process than merely coming up with a logo and a tagline. According to him, branding is the process of structuring and improving a business internally and positioning in the correct light in the minds of its potential consumers or target audience.
Branding is about making an impression. It's a 360-degeree approach that involves making a brand appealing to a given audience as well as aligning the internal branding with the outward positioning, Wimukthi said.
He was of the opinion that Sri Lanka could use better young creatives who are not merely educationally qualified and familiar with the software but who have the capacity to think independently and out-of-the-box'.
In this regard, Wimukthi believed better opportunities should be given to youth in the form of internships to get hands-on experience and discover themselves and their strengths as creatives.
How are you deferent from an Advertising Agency
Marketing agencies are focused on providing short term Advertising services to announce specific product or service features tough TVC, Radio Spots, and print media.
We no longer live in a world where people choose products or services based on features & cost. In fact people don't buy anymore. People like, follow, associate, experience brands as suppose to buying. Thats why people choose their bank based on experience even if products/services are the same as any other bank or people choose to consume certain beverages over other even after its being proven that people can't tell the deference of the competitive beverage during blind tests.
Advertising is the last step of our process of branding. We use research conducted into internal environment of the organisation to understand the gaps and also external markets to understand where the organisation stands in the market. Our solution are crafted by our highly trained graduates in marketing to suite the gaps identified during the research. We focus mainly on how the organisations can be improved internally trough better processors and internal branding to compete with the external markets and also by crafting brand strategies to increase the brand value and association of the target audience.
I focus on strategies that help brands to craft their brand personalities and connect with people on an emotional level. Which results in the target audience placing trust in any product or service the organisation provide and willing to pay for it without being driven by heavy advertising campaigns.
Did'nt you feel starting a business challenging at the beginning
I started my career at a company where everything was done wrong. This helped me learn how not to treat your people, clients and consumers. When i started my business, i had a strong purpose and passion to work on project that delivered results without being limited by client's budget. Looking back at my journey and how i started, it never felt as a financial or a business challenge but as a challenge to develop businesses through creativity. i was simply enjoying what i was doing. I guess that's why i was able to gain and maintain a high profile clientele from early days.
What prompt you to start the business of this nature
I was fascinated about the way how design can control the way people behave even during my school years, then I soon realised advertising had the ability to create positive change in communities at large. I think that was the main reason why i wanted to enter the advertising industry.
I started off as a creative and was able to progress to the top in the creative industry during first 6 years and then change the focus into management which helped me to achieve an Directorial position in one of Sri Lanka's leading ad agencies. However my 8 years of experience in the industry made me realise the lack of evolution in the industry compare the rest of the world and requirement for a agency to go beyond marketing services to guide Sri Lankan business to transform.
Backed by our vision, me and my partner was able to form the Sri Lanka's first branding agency.
Are you able to find skilled employees needed for your industry
That was our biggest challenge from the time we started Brand Centrical. Since our companies and agencies were heavily relaying on advertising for so many years our education system dose not produce employees in the areas of branding. Due to this reason, overtime we have developed systemic policies and our own internal training programs for all our employees. We also have hiring policies in place that ensures the entry standards of all our employees. Our people were the reason behind our success.
What are some of the companies that has placed their trust in you
We have gained over 40 plus companies during our last three years and 20 plus companies receive continuous consultancy related services to date. Some of our regular clients are Hayleys, Commercial Leasing Company, Baurs, Delmege and Jetwing.
How do you feel about receiving this award
We benched mark our success in changing the industry itself as the first branding agency in Sri Lanka. Which is evident when looking at Sri Lankan business and also top traditional agencies adapting branding services.
This wasn't a personal achievement, winning this award was an additional recognition to the contribution we made as a small business making an big impact in the industry. We are proud about it.
What are your future plans
We have introduced three subsidiaries during last 3 years and provide specialised services to business to advance their capabilities. We are also looking at service innovation that help companies create a leading edge in their respective categories. Also we are planing to contribute to the industry by introducing mush needed vocational training in the areas of branding based on our internal training programs. We will continue to provide our services and lift Sri Lankan businesses to new heights.
