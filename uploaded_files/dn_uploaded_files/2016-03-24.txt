Development activities won't be delayed - PM
Planned development activities in the country would be carried forward without any intermission, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining in the adjournment debate on the current situation of the economy of the country moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
He said the Government has initiated agreements for a US$ 1.5 billion swap from the Reserve Bank of India, while it had also sought another US$ 1billion swap from the Central Bank of China to face the prevailing foreign exchange issues of the country.
He said the Government within the next month would make a final decision as to how to handle the current debt situation of Sri Lankan Airlines. "Minister Kabir Hashim informed me that the exact debt concerning Sri Lankan Airlines could be higher than the amount stated at present. Sri Lankan airlines may not be able to repay it. We have to decide whether the Treasury is going to shoulder this burden. We will inform Parliament on any such decision as soon the as the Cabinet decides on it," he said.
He said further discussions are on with regard to the tax proposals, adding that some of them would be implemented with effect from April and the balance from September. He noted that the Government's discussions with the IMF were mainly on the tax system, adding that discussions on a loan were secondary. "We are ready to extend our talks on a loan as well, as a contingency plan. If UK decides to withdraw from the EU, the global economic situation could worsen. We have to be ready to face such a situation as well. If the situation gets better, we need not obtain an IMF loan," he said.
The Prime Minister said he hopes to brief the House on the Government's future plans in May after analyzing the global economic situation. He also stressed the need to formulate new laws to empower Parliament to play a more active role in handling public finances.
"No Government, may it be the current President Sirisena's Government, should be allowed to obtain loans in this callous manner. Parliament has a huge responsibility in this regard, including bodies such as the State Accounts Committee, Public Accounts Committee and the COPE. I propose to appoint another committee consisting 6 MPs to look into the laws of other countries and to make suggestions to the Government on new laws necessary to empower our legislature. legislations in New Zealand are important in this regard.
We have already formulated a 'Parliamentary Budget Office Bill'," he said.
The Prime Minister also assured that investors would come to the country, adding that Japan would help develop Kandy, while Singapore would help develop Trincomalee. He said all deals with China would be finalized during his tour to China in April, adding that the Government would present new proposals for the next two years during this tour.
He said he is to undertake a tour of Singapore in June, while the President is to undertake a tour in Tokyo by the end of May. He said discussions with India on ETCA were progressing, while the agreement would be beneficial to both sides. "I spoke to the EU Development Commissioner concerning the GSP plus benefit and the removal of sanctions on our fish exports. Likewise, discussions are on with Turkey, Iran, Thailand and Malaysia too. Let us move forward by confronting the challenges. We are transparent in what we do. We need foreign aid to uplift the lives of those in the North.
Village and national level development would be carried forward uninterruptedly," he said. Referring to Anura Dissanayake's comment, the Premier also said he never told the people to tighten up their belts.

Building bridge between India and Sri Lanka: No discussions so far
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday, that no discussions had taken place on the building of a bridge between India and Sri Lanka during his recent visit to India.
The Prime Minister was responding to an oral question raised by UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila who queried about the statement made by Minister of Road Transport and Highways of India, Nitin Gadkari in the Indian Lok Sabha that the Sri Lankan Prime Minister had discussed the construction of such a bridge with the Prime Minister of India during his visit.
The Prime Minister said the English version of Lok Sabha in the Hansard is not yet available and it is reported that this statement had been made in Hindi. If you understand Hindi, you could translate it to English and explain it to the House. Can you speak even one sentence of Hindi
But, I know the joint Opposition knows much about Malayali Manthra. That is the reason why the Joint Opposition dashes coconuts at Seenigama Devalaya. You should not whip up racial fear in this Assembly.
I would like to say that Indian Minister Gadkari seems to be keen on building a bridge between the two countries. But, there had been no discussions on this issue between the two countries officially or at diplomatic level.

'President Sirisena's govt will not keep people in the dark'
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday proposed to facilitate a debate on the recent islandwide power outage during the next Parliamentary sittings week.
He was joining in the adjournment debate on the current situation of the country's economy moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
He assured that necessary measures would be taken to supply power without interruption, adding that the country's power crisis faced is of two fold.
"One problem is that if we utilized Mahaweli River waters to generate hydro power, there would be less water for agricultural purposes. That was the reason we are trying to purchase power on lease as an urgent measure. We are presently discussing the cost of this measure. The other problem is that the country would be faced with a power crisis by 2018 if we do not increase our power generation. We have to implement a programme to generate more power by 2018 - 2019. Therefore, we have proposed both short term and long term solutions for the power crisis. We need the support of everyone to confront this challenge," he said.
He said the Government led by President Sirisena would not allow the country to be in the dark.

'Under guise of road building, former regime swindled half the loan money'
Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka told Parliament yesterday that the previous government under the guise of building expressways, airports and ports, obtained loans at very high commercial rates and swindled part of the money.
He was participating in the debate on the adjournment motion. He said due to it, the end result was the Treasury having to pay two or three times larger than the actual amount that would have gone for these projects. Today we have to spend 75 percent of the GDP to repay our loans. Even the unborn generation have to pay these loans.
During the previous regime, a person known as the economic assassin, a former Secretary to the Treasury was in charge of the economy. The result was the people of this country had to live in a great difficulties. Even though they boasted about development, what really happened was the country falling into a debt trap.
There was no middle class and there were a few millionaires and the rest of the people were poor. The former ruler allowed his henchmen to swindle money and they are the very people who are today shouting against the anti-corruption move of the government.
The former President said at the recent Joint opposition rally, that he should be given the country back, but this is the first ordinary MP that had made such a demand when there is a President and Prime Minister elected through independent elections. But we all know how he ruled the country for the last 10 years.
Former Defence Secretary has said the war ended because of him.
Normally, it is the duty of a Defence Secretary to coordinate the war. Not only him, But all other previous Defence Secretaries too did the same thing. But they never boasted that they led the war.

PM's associates taking economic decisions sans knowledge - Anura Kumara
A few close associates of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are taking economic decisions pertaining to the country without any knowledge of ground realities, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake claimed in Parliament yesterday.
Naming a few, Dissanayake said Charitha Ratwatte, Paskaralingam and Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran are among this coterie. He was moving an adjournment motion on the current situation of the economy of the country.
The MP said that these people who are not to be found when the Government topples, come back and play a vital role in decision making whenever a Government is established under Ranil Wickremesinghe.
"They do not live in this country. They don't know the history of the country and they cannot associate themselves with this land. They know nothing about the life style and the problems faced by the general masses, but they make economic plans for the country. Those are the people who propose to send balloons to get wi-fi while talking about digitalism. It is wrong to abruptly say that the country would be made a Singapore or Malaysia. We have to find the model that would best suit our country," he commented.
Dissanayake said the country's economic plan should be based on three pillars namely increasing the production, people's participation to production and fair distribution of wealth created by the production.
He said investors would not come to the country as expected by the Government due to the prevailing global economic crisis, adding that the investors who come would only show interest to buy existing business avenues such as Lanka Hospital, Hilton, Shell Gas etc. He said the Government's present economic policy is dependent on loans, fines and taxes, adding that this would not succeed.
He said the Government's target to achieve economic growth of 5.3 percent of GDP would hardly be possible given the current situation.
