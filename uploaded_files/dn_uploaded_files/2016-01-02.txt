Africans Sexwale, Toure eye major honours

JOHANNESBURG, FRIDAY: African glory-seekers this year include South African Tokyo Sexwale, who wants to be FIFA president, and Ivorian Yaya Toure, bidding for an unprecedented fifth straight CAF Footballer of the Year title.
Another off-field event certain to capture the attention of a continent in which football is the dominant sport will be the 2018 World Cup groups draw with 20 African teams eyeing five places in Russia.
Along with two World Cup matchdays, there will be four rounds of Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, the African Nations Championship and the Champions League and Confederation Cup club competitions.
AFP Sport sets the scene for an African football schedule that kicks off on January 7 with the CAF awards and could last until December 18 if the CAF champions reach the Club World Cup final.
FIFA presidency
Apartheid-era political prisoner cum business tycoon Sexwale hopes to succeed disgraced Sepp Blatter and become president of scandal-ridden FIFA after February 26 elections in Zurich.
Bahraini Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, Jordanian Prince Ali Al Hussein, Swiss Gianni Infantino and Frenchman Jerome Champagne are the other challengers for the task of cleaning up the world football body.
Highlight of the Sexwale manifesto is a call for the ban on sponsors' names appearing on national team shirts to be scrapped, which could greatly boost the income of cash-strapped associations.
CAF awards
Manchester City midfielder Toure is favoured to win a record-extending fifth consecutive CAF Footballer of the Year title in the Nigerian capital Abuja.
Yaya Toure
Other stars shortlisted for the award are Gabon and Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ghana and Swansea City midfielder Andre 'Dede' Ayew.
Toure, 32, was voted BBC African Footballer of the Year last month and made the Ballon d'Or World Footballer of the Year and FIFPro World Team of the Year lists.
World Cup
The line-up for the June 24 groups draw in Cairo reads like a who's who of African football with only Equatorial Guinea and Benin of the current top 20 national teams failing to make the cut.
Assuming seeding is based on FIFA rankings, as was the case for two knockout rounds, one of the five mini-leagues could comprise Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Nigeria and Morocco.
The other 16 survivors are Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Libya, Mali, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia.
Africa Cup of Nations
Former champions South Africa are in serious danger of missing the 2017 tournament in Gabon after being held at home by Gambia and losing away to Mauritania.
Bafana Bafana -- which means "the boys" -- tackle Group M leaders Cameroon at home and away during March and only two victories are likely to keep them in contention for a place among the 16 finalists.
Nigeria, champions in 2013 and non-qualifiers two years later, play record seven-time title-holders Egypt twice in another highlight of the matchday 3 and 4 fixtures.
African Nations Championship
Rwanda host during January and February a unique international competition, reserved for footballers playing in their country of birth.
Title-holders Libya failed to survive the region-based qualifiers, but the other two former champions, DR Congo and Tunisia, will be in central Africa.
Morocco impressed in an unbeaten elimination campaign while Nigeria believe they can improve on a third-place finish in South Africa two years ago.
CAF Champions League
TP Mazembe of DR Congo outplayed USM Alger of Algeria 4-1 on aggregate to win the 2015 final and history suggests they could go all the way again.
The club from mining city Lubumbashi won back-to-back titles in 1967 and 1968 and again in 2009 and 2010, and boast an all-star current line-up from DR Congo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Tanzania and Zambia.
Among former champions in the 55-club line-up are Al Ahly and Zamalek of Egypt, Club Africain and Etoile Sahel of Tunisia and Enyimba of Nigeria.
CAF Confederation Cup - SUB HEAD
Twice CAF champions Esperance of Tunisia stand out in a weak 51-club qualifying-rounds field for the African equivalent of the Europa League.
But the line up for the group stage could be dramatically strengthened depending on which eight clubs drop down to the Confederation Cup after the final Champions League qualifiers.
The Nigerian entrants are Nasarawa United and Akwa United, Ajax Cape Town and Wits carry the hopes of South Africa, and debutants Bandari represent Kenya. AFP

Amir returns to Pakistan squad

LAHORE, PAKISTAN: Paceman Mohammad Amir was set to make his return to the Pakistan team after being selected on Friday for an upcoming series in New Zealand, months after completing a five-year spot-fixing ban.
His inclusion in the Twenty20 and one-day international squads remains contingent on him being issued a visa by Wellington -- a potential hurdle given Amir's criminal conviction for his role in arranging deliberate no-balls during Pakistan's tour of England in 2010.
The scandal, which also involved his captain Salman Butt and fellow bowler Mohammad Asif, was broken by an undercover reporter of the now defunct British tabloid News of the World.

Ashwin first Indian bowler to top ICC's year-end ranking in 42 years

NEW DELHI: After bowling outstandingly well throughout the year, Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin ended the year 2015 as the top ranked Test bowler in ICC rankings, released on Thursday.
This makes the Chennai spinner first India bowler since Bishen Singh Bedi in 1973 to achieve the feat of finishing the year on top.
Mainstay of the Indian bowling line-up, Ashwin took 62 wickets in nine Tests this year, including 31 scalps in the four matches against South Africa in the Freedom series.
Ashwin recently achieved the number-one spot for the first time in his career, replacing injured South African Dale Steyn. The Proteas fast bowler could only bowled 3.5 overs in England's second innings in the Durban Test.
In fact, its a double delight for the 29-year-old Indian tweaker, who also ended the year as top-ranked Test all-rounder.
Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja finished the year at sixth position.
For the records, Ashwin and Jadeja are the only two Indians in the top 10 rankings of the Test bowlers.

Barcelona break Real Madrid's record calendar year goals

Spanish champions Barcelona have broken rival Real Madrid's record for most goals scored in a calendar year on Wednesday after blanking Real Betis 4-0 at Camp Nou.
As expected the match belonged to Luis Enrique's side, and by the half-hour mark, Barca benefited from a missed Neymar spot kick, which resulted in an own goal from Betis defender Heiko Westermann.
Four minutes later, Lionel Messi doubled the lead to help Barca level Real Madrid on 178 goals in a year, which the Santiago Bernabue side had achieved in 2014.
Two second-half goals from Luis Suarez killed off the competition and also improved Barca's count in 2015 to 180. Of these, Messi, Neymar and Suarez have contributed 48, 41 and 48 respectively.
The match was also Messi's 500th appearance for Barcelona.
With the win, Barcelona have climbed back to the top of in La Liga table with 38 points. Atletico Madrid are in second place with same points, but have played an extra game. Real are in third place with 36 points.

Benitez in the spotlight on return to Valencia
Rafael Benitez
MADRID, FRIDAY: Real Madrid coach Rafael Benitez returns to Valencia, where he won two league titles with Los Che, fighting to hold onto his job on Sunday.
Madrid's awful 2015 began with defeat at the Mestalla which ended a 22-game winning run and led to the eventual sacking of Carlo Ancelotti after he failed to deliver a major trophy.
And his successor could also be set for the chop after just six months in charge should Real suffer a fourth league defeat in eight games.
Yet, despite another unconvincing display in seeing off Real Sociedad 3-1 on Wednesday, thanks in part to two debatable penalty decisions in their favour, Benitez insists his side are improving and can challenge for La Liga and the Champions League in 2016.
"What I want (in 2016) is for the team to keep winning games and the fans to enjoy victories, good football and a title," he said.
"The review of the year will be made at the end of the season. We continue in good form because the team reacted well and is playing better every game."
It is the first time that Benitez will return to the Mestalla as the opposition coach after leading a golden age for the club with titles in 2002 and 2004 before joining Liverpool.
That success seems a distant memory with Valencia in desperate need of the points themselves with Gary Neville yet to taste victory after his first three games in charge in La Liga.
A 1-0 defeat to Villarreal on Thursday left Neville's men 11 points off their target of a top-four finish having failed to win any of their last eight games in La Liga or the Champions League.
However, they have only lost three of their last nine meetings with Madrid and haven't been beaten at home in La Liga since November 2014. The visitors are expected to be at full strength as captain Sergio Ramos trained on Thursday after missing the win over Real Sociedad. Madrid could find themselves five points adrift of the leaders by the time they kick off at the Mestalla with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in action on Saturday.
Catalan derby
Barca rounded off a five-trophy haul in 2015 with a 4-0 win over Real Betis in midweek to also set a new record tally for Spanish football of 180 goals in a calendar year.
Their quest to repeat that feat in 2016 comes in the first of three Barcelona derbies in 10 days away to Espanyol on Saturday -- the teams will also meet over two legs in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey. "2015 has been the best year for all of us. To end the year in this way feels great, but we are aware that in three days we begin a new year with a special game," captain Andres Iniesta told Barca TV.
Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba are all expected to return after being rested against Betis as Barca look to extend a seven-game winning run against their local rivals.
Atletico's late show with two goals in the final two minutes at Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday ensured they stayed level with Barca at the top of the table, albeit having played a game more.
Angel Correa scored and Thomas Partey and Jackson Martinez provided assists off the bench in Vallecas and all three could be rewarded with starts when the league's bottom side Levante visit the Vicente Calderon.

Bloodied Van Gaal pursues Man United upturn

MANCHESTER, FRIDAY: Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal remains in office after the most testing fortnight of his 18-month tenure, but he is not secure in his job just yet.
Van Gaal appeared to be in serious danger of being sacked following a run of four successive defeats, culminating in a feeble performance as his team were beaten 2-0 at Stoke City on Boxing Day.
However, there was greater encouragement two days later, even though a 0-0 draw at home to Chelsea extended United's run without a victory to eight matches in all competitions ahead of Saturday's visit of Swansea City.
Van Gaal's side produced a much livelier attacking display against Chelsea than has been the norm this season, creating several chances and seeing both Juan Mata and Anthony Martial strike the frame of the goal.
Van Gaal has acknowledged during his team's poor recent run that his position has been under threat, but he says that pressure is simply part of the job for manager and players alike.
You have to show it for 90 minutes against the resistance of the opponent and also under the pressure of the environment and the pressure you put yourself under, said Van Gaal, who has lost all three of his previous games against Swansea by the same 2-1 scoreline.
And you have to cope with that.
Van Gaal has rediscovered some of his famous bullishness, but United need to start finding victories quickly, having slipped nine points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal with half of the season played.
Against Chelsea, United survived a couple of scares to regain the defensive solidity that has served them so well at Old Trafford this season.
Van Gaal's side have conceded only three league goals at home so far and no other team in the division can boast a better record than that.
The Dutchman has been helped in that respect by the fact that he is once again able to field a reasonably strong defence following a raft of injury problems, with full-back Matteo Darmian returning to the team against Chelsea on Monday after almost three weeks out with a hamstring injury.
Luke Shaw remains a long-term absentee with a broken leg, though, and fellow full-back Antonio Valencia is still recovering from an ankle injury, although there are hopes that Marcos Rojo's dislocated shoulder will not keep him out for too much longer. In attack, Martial remains United's likeliest source of a goal, with captain Wayne Rooney having failed to score in the league since October 17.
Finding a goal may not be straightforward against a Swansea side who have kept clean sheets in each of their last three matches.
Caretaker manager Alan Curtis has steadied a side who were plummeting into relegation trouble before Garry Monk was sacked earlier this month.
Curtis led Swansea to a first victory in eight games as they defeated West Bromwich Albion 1-0 on Boxing Day, following that up with a hard-earned goalless draw at Crystal Palace two days later.
Curtis gambled somewhat by making eight changes for the trip to Selhurst Park in order to keep his squad fresh, including three men - defender Jordi Amat, midfielder Matt Grimes and forward Marvin Emnes - who had not previously played a single minute of league football all season.
Curtis is likely to bring back most of those who were rested on Monday, which would mean recalls for Ki Sung-Yueng in midfield and playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson, among others.
Swansea's aim is to marry their defensive meanness to a more prolific attack, as their total of 16 goals from 19 games this season is the second-lowest in the Premier League.
When you look at our goals for column, it is a problem. We need to score more, Curtis said. It's not necessarily the strikers to blame for that as we need to produce better quality service into the frontmen.

Central Province medal winner felicitated

National Sports Festival is an inter-provincial meet and the organisers should ensure that sportsmen and sportswomen from the provinces represent the respective provinces they were born. They should check their birth certificates and justice done to their province, said the Secretary to the Central Province Sports Department Mrs M K K Karunaratne.
She made these observations when she addressed the audience at the felicitation ceremony for model winners at the 41st National Sports Festival and held at the Auditorium of the Central Provincial Council at Pallekele.
She said that she is making this plea as the province often without the basis amenities and with the greatest difficult produce sportsmen and sportswomen who rise to national level. When they reach the top and for employment purposes they take up residence in other towns more particularly the Western Province who every year win the Championship title at the National Sports Festival while Central Province is always the runner up.
This trend must be stopped and if it is not place is good. Central Province has the talent but in most places lack on facilities. We don't have an astro turf track nor the astro turf facilities to play hockey but out girls and boys won the hockey championship titles. We produced six best performers in Udaya Ranasinghe (Table Tennis), Shehan de Silva (swimming), Madura Dharmaratne (Ladies Hockey), I R K Willawarachchi (mens hockey), W G I V R Wijesuriya (Taekondomale), R D K Dharmawardena (Judo-Men).
This year we won 47 gold medals - two more than our previous best of 45 and we can do much better or even lift the championship title if those born in our province represent us.
She added that four girls from Kandy were members of the Sri Lanka netball team which won the Asian Youth netball championship a few days back. Udaya Ranasinghe is the national champion at table tennis and Shehan de Silva is the national champion at swimming. This shows individually we have been dominating and we should harness the talents for team work.
Chief Minister of the Central Province Sarath Ekanayake said that as the government we have been endeavouring our best to provide the best facilities to our sports starts but these are our limitations and adequate funds is one of them. We intend constructing more grounds. He has had discussions with the Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera for funds to complete the balance work at Digana Sports Complex. He took the Sport Minister on an inspection tour.
Our target to become the Best Province in the country by 2015 and this we have been not able to achieve due to various untoward problems. But have courage and determination and we will be able to achieve this in the future.
Minister of Sports of the Central Province Premuka Bandara Tennakoon said that much has been dealt on this felicitation ceremony by the other speakers and it is gratifying to note that this has been our best ever performance in this 41 year old National Sports Festival. We can even do better if we could master our best team.
He said that sports is not only winning medals or cups or trophies. It teaches us many other things which could be very useful in life when you step into the society. A sportsman acknowledges both victory and defeat in the same vein. If you cannot win, you go to the next competition with grit and determination. That defeat has made you stronger, You learn leadership and team work which are no useful to the society. You hardly ever hear of a sportsman in a problem. He knows how to face and handle a problem without getting into difficulties. These are things he or she had learnt in sports to manage problems.

Comebacks of the year 2015
Grant Elliott
When the year began he was not in New Zealand's ODI squad. When it ended, he was the team's fourth-highest run-getter in the format in 2015. Since he played his first ODI in a year and a half on January 11, the 35-year-old Elliott averaged 44.73 across 27 matches, scoring a century and four fifties.
Against Sri Lanka in Dunedin, he and his Wellington team-mate Luke Ronchi smashed the record books in an unbeaten stand of 267 in 180 balls. Against Pakistan, he eased New Zealand home in a chase of 211 with 64 not out from 68 balls. There have been other plucky, crucial contributions. A series of 20s that allowed others to score quicker.
Then came the World Cup, where after a series of aborted starts Elliott captivated a nation on March 24 at Eden Park, filled to the brim with 41,279, when New Zealand faced South Africa in the first semi-final. Elliott entered at 128 for 3 and finished the job by swinging Dale Steyn for six to remain unbeaten on 84 from 74 balls with one delivery left in an epic match. That innings propelled the co-hosts to their first World Cup final, but the MCG threw up a mismatch. Elliott again stepped up with 83 from 82 balls out of a dismal total of 183.
Nothing he did after that could match the Eden Park high, but with 850 runs and 16 wickets in 2015, Elliott represented a memorable cricketing comeback at the age of 35.
Amit Mishra
23
The need for a legspinner during India's Test tour of Sri Lanka was what appeared to tip the scales in 33-year-old Mishra's favour when the BCCI selection committee picked the squad. His recent first-class record had been far from eye-catching - ten wickets in six Ranji Trophy matches in the last season - and his most recent competitive cricket was in the IPL where he took nine wickets in 12 games, average 34.34 and economy 7.71. What happened next was memorable.
Mishra played all three Test matches and turned up his best series, statistically. He took 15 wickets, had the lowest average (15), strike-rate (31.6) and economy (2.84) of all India's bowlers and his lower-order batting repeatedly helped the team's cause. Recalled after four years, Mishra fit into the first Test as the third spinner, but by the second was rightfully the second choice. He took five wickets in Galle to compliment R Ashwin and out-bowled Harbhajan Singh, then had a fine outing at P Sara with seven wickets and ended with three wickets and, crucially, innings of 59 and 35. His wickets were mostly that of bowlers, but played a big role in the overall outcome.
After that series in Sri Lanka, Mishra would have expected to play more against South Africa. In the end, he featured in just the Mohali and Nagpur matches, where the pitches were tailored to assist spin. While R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja hogged the limelight, Mishra claimed AB de Villiers twice in Mohali and JP Duminy, Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis in Nagpur. Should have played in Delhi, but was rested for an extra fast bowler. Didn't do much with the bat. Didn't bowl nearly as many overs as Ashwin and Jadeja, but with big wickets each time he bowled, Mishra really didn't let his captain down. With India scheduled to play 14 Tests over the next 12 months - nine at home - Mishra could prove to be a vital cog for India.
Shoaib Malik
Not the first Pakistan player to make a surprise comeback, but the 33-year-old allrounder's latest recall proved his most successful. Malik's first internationals since the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were two Twenty20 internationals at home against Zimbabwe, which produced just 14 runs and two wickets, but he found himself in Pakistan's ODI squad.
Playing his first ODI since the 2013 Champions Trophy, he marked the occasion with 112 from 76 balls, his eighth century in the format and first since September 2009. In the second ODI, Malik slammed an unbeaten 36 from 20 balls to hasten a six-wicket win. He made 3 in the abandoned final match.
After the Zimbabwe series, Malik flew out to the West Indies where he represented Barbados Tridents in the CPL, contributing 209 runs (average 52.25) to the runner-ups. Linking up with Pakistan's limited-overs squad in Sri Lanka, he again contributed to series wins in the ODIs and T20Is: scores of 55*, 51, 42*, 29* and 11 in five ODIs and Player of the Series in the two T20Is for three wickets and 54 runs, of which 46 came in the first game. Apart from his batting, Malik kept runs down with his offspin, which Azhar Ali used in short spells.
During Pakistan's limited-overs tour of Zimbabwe, Malik turned in impressive all-round performances in all three ODIs. In the first match he made 31 to help revive the innings from 35 for 3, then took three wickets in a 131-run win. In the second, Malik's unbeaten 96 hauled the tourists from 17 for 3 and almost to victory, with the umpires eventually calling off the game due to bad light.
Less than 24 hours after Malik hastened Pakistan's series win with an unbeaten 34 from 28 balls, the PCB announced that he had been added to an existing 15-man Test squad to face England "given his present form in T20Is and ODIs". With Azhar injured and Mohammad Hafeez unable to bowl because of action issues, Malik was drafted into the XI for the Abu Dhabi opener. In his first Test match since August 2010 - and 33rd overall since his debut in 2001 - he produced a career-best 245 from the No. 3 spot.
However, as his form faded dramatically, Malik announced he was quitting Tests at the end of the series. His final act as a Test cricketer was taking a seven wickets as Pakistan sealed the series 2-0. All in all, a key figure in the revival of Pakistan as an ODI force with 607 runs in 15 innings at an average of 67.44, apart from 27 wickets across all formats in 2015.
Usman Khwaja
The 28-year-old New South Wales batsman's third coming as a Test cricketer was his most successful by leagues, even factoring in a hamstring injury that ruled him out of two Test matches. Where he previously managed 377 runs at 25.13 in nine matches across two stints in 2011 and 2013, with just two fifties, at the end of 2015 the recalled Khawaja was mesmerising.
Batting at No. 3 in the first two Tests versus New Zealand he produced attractive centuries of immense confidence and crispness. In the first innings in Brisbane, Khawaja entered at 161 for 1 and stroked his way to a maiden century, 174 off 239 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. In Perth, he took guard at 101 for 1 and was next out for 121 at 403 for 2. Not surprising, then, that Khawaja remarked during the New Zealand series that he was "finally starting to enjoy" playing at Test level.
Having missed Australia's next two Tests - one each against New Zealand and West Indies - Khawaja proved his fitness with a Big Bash League century and slotted back into the starting XI for the Boxing Day Test. It was back to business, with a pleasing 144 from No 3 helping the team to 551 for 3 declared in its first innings and then in the second, cracking 56 from 61 balls before falling to a lap-sweep off Jason Holder with a declaration looming. In five innings since return to the team, Khawaja made 504 runs at 126. Talk about making it large.
Nick Compton
When in the second half of 2013 Nick Compton was seen on American celebrity news channel E! dancing on a Los Angeles soundstage in his underpants, it appeared his England career was over. At the time, Compton - grandson of England legend Dennis - was five months out of the Test team following a falling out with then coach Andy Flower and found himself in LA to support the Compton Cricket Club. In the time since he was dropped in May 2013 until his comeback to the Test squad in late 2015, England had tried out seven batsmen at the top alongside Alastair Cook.
In his time outside of the team, Compton put in solid performances for Somerset which, following Adam Lyth's horror Ashes series and the failed Moeen Ali experiment, forced the ECB think-tank to go back to the 32-year-old. Playing his first Test since May 2014, and in the city of his birth, Durban, Compton put in a fine effort in seeing his team through a tricky first day of the Boxing Day Test. He displayed commendable application to hold the first innings together - perhaps the reason the selectors recalled him from county cricket - and his partnership of 125 for the fourth wicket with James Taylor (70) steadied England from 49 for 3.
Compton ended a truncated opening day on 63 and then added 22 on day two before walking when he nicked a pull shot off Morne Morkel, a dismissal that triggered a collapse of four wickets for 20 runs in the span of 29 deliveries. His 85 lasted 236 balls and 383 minutes.
When England batted again, Compton found himself at the crease in the tenth over with England's lead at 101. When he departed 116 balls later for 49, the lead was 206. Two solid innings in his comeback Test sends Compton, and this England team, into 2016 with plenty of promise.

Controversies in 2015
N Srinivasan era ends
Ending the N Srinivasan era in Indian cricket, the Supreme Court ruled that the Tamil Nadu strongman could not stay on as Board of Control for Cricket in India president as long as he was the Chennai Super Kings owner.
The SC-appointed Lodha Commission then suspended CSK and Rajasthan Royals for two years from the IPL after their owners were found indulging in betting. A rattled BCCI replaced them with new teams based out of Pune and Rajkot for two years. Led by a new president, Shashank Manohar, the Board introduced a slew of reforms to check conflict of interest.
Yasir Shah, Kusal Perera flunk dope test
Not just athletics, even cricket faced a 'dope crisis' as Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah and Sri Lanka's 'keeper-batsman Kusal Perera faced the prospect of a ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance. Shah flunked a dope test conducted in November during the ODIs against England, while Perera failed an out-of-competition test in October.
The end for Kevin Pietersen
In his bid to make a comeback to the England team, Kevin Pietersen even gave up a lucrative contract in the IPL. However, despite smashing an unbeaten 326 for Surrey, KP's hopes went up in smoke after his former teammate Andrew Strauss, now England team director, made it clear to him that 'trust issues' meant he couldn't play for the national team ever again.
Llong is wrong
The first-ever day-night Test between Australia and New Zealand was marred by controversy when third umpire Nigel Llong handed Nathan Llyon a reprieve despite the batsman clearly edging the ball.
Llong relied on hot-spot, which was inconclusive while the snickometer showed an edge. The decision altered the fortunes of the game.
Turf Wars
After South Africa amassed 438 in the fifth ODI at Wankhede, Team India director Ravi Shastri allegedly abused curator Sudhir Naik. Looking to stump SA in Tests, India laid out vicious turners. India won the series 3-0. But the euphoria was soured after the ICC deemed the Jamtha pitch poor.
Ishant's ugly side
During India's tour to Sri Lanka, pacer Ishant Sharma had a run-in with Lankan seamer Dhammika Prasad, both on the field and outside the hosts' dressing room. The pacer copped a one-Test ban.
Indo-Pak deadlock
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan kept trying to revive cricketing relations with India, but it fell on deaf ears as the BCCI cited lack of government approval. His attempt to meet BCCI chief Shashank Manohar in Mumbai too was thwarted by the Shiv Sena who staged a protest. TNN

Junior National Chmapions Samadhi Hettiarachchi (Mahamaya Girls College) and Krishan Wickremaratne (Vidyartha College) won a double each while Thanushi Rodrigo (Mahamaya Girls College) pocketed the Ladies Open Singles title at the first ever maiden Central Province Table Tennis Championship organized by Butterfly Table Tennis Club and sponsored by Kanumale Enterprise (Pvt) Limited and Udarata Kahata - a Tea Company based in Kandy and worked off at the Jagath Rajapakse International Table Tennis Stadium at Ganegoda off Peradeniya.
Despite the school vacation and the long weekend along with the Christmas vacation a large number of entries were received due to the efforts by the main organizing committee headed by former national coach Mahinda Ellepola (President). Ms Chandima Abeyratne (Secretary) and Induka Abeyratne (Treasurer). At the beginning this championship appeared to be a non-starter due to lack of funds to defray the expenses. Kanumale Enterprise headed by Vipul Kanumale and Udarata Kahata headed by Bimal Fernando along with other small sponsores came to their rescue.
Fourteen year old Thanushi hailing from a family known for their prowens in table tennis put up a sterling display to win the Ladies Open Singles Championship by defeating Sheshala Bandara by the convincing margin of 3-1. Sheshala Bandara who made her appearance after a lapse of nearly 18 months did impress but failed to win over her younger opponent Thanushi following a number of excellent displays has a national ranking outwitted her opponent with some smart serves and smashing the returns when necessary. Thanushi main event could not do in the age group events. She lost to Samadhi in the under 15 finals and in was pushed in the under 18 singles semi finals. But she displayed great guts to win the ladies open event. It was a great day for the family as the youngest Hasindu Rodrigo won the boys under 10 title by defeating Akesh Dimantha of Vidyartha College. Fourteen year old Samadhi at TT has come a long way since she got into the winning streak a few months back which culminated in their winning the junior national ladies title last month. A very talented paddler and many more titles are for her asking if she can only make good fight back through recoveries. At times she takes it easy and this little girl should be taught more of the game and other essentials. She won two titles here both the under 15 and under 18 events.
In the girls under 15 finals Samadhi scored a comfortable 3-1 win over the ladies Open winner Thanushi. Samadhi won the first set with ease 11/2 but Thanushi hit back with a 11/4 win in the second. Samadhi polished off the game with 12/10 wins in the next two sets.
In the girls under 18 singles Samadhi had an easy 3-0 passage over Dinithi Dissanayake. It was only in the second set that the loser put up a semblance of a fight before going down 12/10.
Krishan once again turned out to be a winner though often in the showdown of Udaya Ranasinghe. He won the boys under 18 title with a close 3-2 win over schoolmate Prasad de Silva. A grim battle was witnessed and at the end of the fourth set the scores were level at two all. But Krishan playing a cool game wrapped up the deciding fifth set with 11/4 win.
Then came the Men's Open Singles and once again it was a battle between Krishan and Prasad de Silva ad this time Krishan did one better by winning 3-1. Prasad de Silva won the first set 11/9 but Krishan won the next three sets in a row romp home with a double. The preserving Hasini Ikiriwatte of Mahamaya Girls College entered two finals but could not win both. But she looks a very promising paddler and should hear more of her in the future of 9 year old girl. In the under 10 finals she lost to Hasini Dullewa 2-1 and moving further up in the girls under 12 finals she lost to Samadhi Wedagedera also from Mahamaya Girls College.
The boys under 15 finals saw a titanic struggle between two top players in this age group between Disanka Tennakoon of Dharmaraja College and Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College, Kandy and the former scored a 3-1 win. The scores were equal by the end of the second set but Tennakooon rounded off the game by winning the next two sets. A better performance was expected from the enormously talented Chathura Gunasekera.

England star May face Six Nations injury woe

LONDON, THURSDAY: England wing Jonny May looks likely to miss the whole of his country's Six Nations campaign with a knee injury.
May was forced to come off during Gloucester's English Premiership draw against Harlequins at Twickenham last weekend.
He sustained the injury while kicking the ball and it has now emerged that he needs surgery.
"Jonny has suffered a pretty significant knee injury that requires surgery," Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys told the Gloucester Citizen on Thursday.
"He's seeing a specialist on Tuesday and based on the outcome of that we will have a much clearer picture on what needs to be done.
"Most importantly, it is a huge blow for Jonny to suffer an injury like that at this stage of the season. But knowing him and his dedication, he will leave no stone unturned in his recovery."
England's first Six Nations fixture is against Scotland on February 6 and given Humphreys' bleak prognosis it seems highly unlikely that May will play any part in the tournament. The 25-year-old had re-established himself as England's first choice wing in the second half of this year. His absence would be another blow to new England head coach Eddie Jones, who has already lost centre Henry Slade, back row Dave Ewers and prop Kieran Brookes to injury for all, or part, of the Six Nations.

Fourth ODI between New Zealand - Sri Lanka washed out
The fourth One-Day International (ODI) between New Zealand and Sri Lanka has been washed out, as only nine overs could be played at Saxton Oval Ground, in Nelson and Sri Lanka will remain 1-2 behind, which ends their chances of winning series.

The rain did not let the match start on time and did not let it start for three hours. The match was reduced to 24 overs after that and Sri Lankan captain Angelo Matthews chose to field first after winning the toss.

New Zealand got off to a flying start as they scored 37 in first three overs. Martin Guptill scored 27 off 14 balls as he hit 3 sixes. But then Sri Lanka got few wickets and New Zealand were 53/3 after losing their captain Kane Williamson and both openers.

The hosts were 75/3 in 9 overs when rain came again and this time match officials announced that the match has ended without any result. The fifth and last ODI will be played in Mount Maunganui and Sri Lanka will have to win that to level the series. (cricketnewsworld)

Gamba gives Reds blues with Emperor's Cup win

TOKYO, FRIDAY: Brazilian striker Patric scored two classic poacher's goals as Gamba Osaka beat Urawa Reds to retain the Emperor's Cup on Friday.
Urawa, Japan's best-supported side, will be sick of the sight of Gamba, who shattered their J-League title hopes last season and once more plunged a dagger through their hearts on the big stage.
Patric, who had earlier hit the bar and shaved a post when he really should have scored, fired Gamba into the lead on 32 minutes in Tokyo after cleverly springing the offside trap.
Shinzo Koroki equalised for the Reds minutes later, smashing home a left-foot shot from close range.
But Patric restored Gamba's advantage by sweeping home a Yasuhito Endo corner eight minutes into the second half, delighting the blue half of a New Year's Day crowd of 43,000.
Endo came close with a dipping free kick and an injury-time breakaway chance. At the other end Gamba survived late pressure to win their fifth Emperor's Cup after finishing runners-up in the J-League and J-League Cup this season.
"It was agony at the end -- I just wanted the players to hang on," said Gamba manager Kenta Hasegawa, who led his side to the domestic treble in a sparkling 2014 season.
"It was a case of third time lucky for us this season, but I had faith the players would pay the supporters back after they endured disappointment in the other competitions."

Graeme Smith called to help South Africa

LE CAP, FRIDAY: Former South African captain Graeme Smith linked up with the South African team as an adviser on Friday ahead of the second Test against England which starts at Newlands on Saturday.
"Graeme was a wonderful cricketer for South Africa and a wonderful captain," said current captain Hashim Amla. Smith will be with the team for the rest of the four-match series.
South Africa will make at least two changes following a crushing 241-run defeat in the first Test in Durban.
Amla announced that Kagiso Rabada will replace the injured Dale Steyn. He also dropped a strong hint that Quinton de Kock would come in as a wicketkeeper and batsman, with AB de Villiers relinquishing the gloves and playing as a specialist batsman.
"The final call will be made by the selectors," said Amla.
"If Quinny does come in he will take a load off AB and he has also been in very good form with the bat. If he does play, the selectors will have to decide who they will leave out. It will be a tough decision, whether it is Faf (Du Plessis) or JP (Duminy) because these have been integral guys in our team for many years."
Fast bowler Kyle Abbott will undergo a fitness test ahead of the match after feeling tightness in his left hamstring at the end of the first Test. If Abbott does not play, he will be replaced by either Chris Morris or Hardus Viljoen, who are both uncapped.
Viljoen, 26, was called up as cover for Abbott. He took 20 wickets in the first two matches of the current season's first-class campaign for the Lions franchise.
Amla said he was not concerned that Smith, who captained South Africa in 108 Test matches before retiring two years ago, had made some strong criticisms of South Africa's batting and selections in his capacity as a television commentator during the first Test.
South Africa have not won a Test since last year's New Year fixture against the West Indies at the same venue.
"When you win or lose a cricket game you are either going to be praised or there is criticism," said Amla. "That's just the nature of international sport.

Havies-Kandy game should be a thriller

The confrontation between two unbeaten clubs Kandy Sports Club and Havelocks Sports club in the Dialog 'A' Division inter-club league rugby first round match at Havelock Park today should turn out to be a thriller. The match will kick off at 6:30 pm under lights.
Havelocks who had a close game against Police in their first outing came back to their normal pattern of play to be unbeaten so far along with Kandy. Havies have been training hard during the last few days and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Kandy on the hand registered run away victories against CH and FC, Air Force, Police, Army and had a close call 22-16 win against the fighting CR and FC unit in their last outing will have to be at their very best if they are to beat the high riding Havies in their own den at Havelock Park.
Going by the two team's performances so far a close tussle for supremacy can be expected.
The forte of Havelocks team has been their power-packed forwards. The Havies 'eight' especially Ganuka Dissanayaka, Prasad Madusanka, Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Janik Jayasuriya and Sudarshana Muthuthanthri have given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be given a torrid time by the Kandy forwards spearheaded by burly Heshan Kalhara and ably supported by Soyuru Anthony, Kishore Jehan, Damith Dissanayaka, Piyumal Manchanayaka and Gayan Ratnayaka.
In the set scrums the experienced Havelocks hooker Prasad Madusanka should get the better of his vis-a-vis Damith Dissanayaka while the line outs should be shared between the Havies duo of Jayasuriya and Muthuthanthri and Kandy's Anthony and Ratnayaka.
With the halves combination of Rahul de Silva and Rimzie Jamaldeen having clicked in the last few matches Havelocks will hope that Rahul will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Hirantha Perera and Nishon Perera. In addition they have two experienced wingers in captain Sadun Herath and Randitha Warnapura who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Kevin Dixon often joining the line to form the overlap.
Teams:
Kandy SC : Piyumal Manchanayaka, Damith Disanayaka, Kishore Jehan, Shehan Dimitri, Gayan Ratnayaka, Heshan Kalhara, Shehan Pathirana, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratna or Srinath Sooriyabandara and Fazil Marija (Captain), Dansha Dayan, Gayan Weeraratna, Lavanga Perera, Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Nigel Ratwatte
Havelocks (probable XV): Ganuka Dissanayaka, Prasad Madusanka, Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Janik Jayasuriya, Jason Melder, Shenal Deelaka, Rohitha Rajapaksa, Sudarshana Muthuthanththri, Rahul de Silva and Rimzie Jamaldeen, Randitha Warnapura, Hirantha Perera, Nishon Perera, Sadun Herath (Captain), Kevin Dixon.
CR v Navy today
In another match today fourth placed CR and FC will host the high riding third placed Sri Lanka Navy at Longden Place. Match is due to start at 4.00 pm. (WAI)

Hazlewood fit and ready for final Windies Test

SYDNEY, FRIDAY: Australia pace spearhead Josh Hazlewood said he was feeling fresh Friday and ready to go for the weekend's final Test against the West Indies in Sydney.
Hazlewood went wicketless and bowled a total of 41 overs in Australia's 177-run trouncing of the Windies in Melbourne to retain the Frank Worrell Trophy series ahead of Sunday's third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
There were suggestions that Hazlewood might be rested from his home Test after bowling throughout Australia's five Tests this season against New Zealand and the West Indies.
But Hazlewood said he was feeling in great shape and ready to play in his sixth Test of the southern summer, despite just a five-day turnaround from the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.
Pace partner Peter Siddle is troubled by an ankle injury and is battling to play in the Sydney Test, thrusting more responsibility onto Hazlewood to lead the Australian pace attack.
"I'm feeling pretty good. That extra day really helped, finishing (the second Test) on day four. I still got through quite a few overs but the body has pulled up pretty well," Hazlewood told reporters.
"I had a light bowl today and everything is feeling pretty good. I'm feeling as ready to go as I have for all the other Test matches this summer."
"I bowled reasonably well in different spells and not so well in other spells (at the MCG). That happens every now and then. My body is feeling as good as it has all summer and I am ready to go."
Following the Windies Test, Australia have five one-day internationals and three Twenty20s against India this month.
The Australia squad for the India ODIs is expected to be announced during the Sydney Test.
"I guess I will just play it by ear as we go along," Hazlewood said.
"It depends how much I bowl in the next Test match and how I pull up. It would be difficult to play every (limited overs) game. We will have to pick and choose." AFP.

## Title: I want a second chance. I want to serve my country again" : Saleem Malik
## Supertitle:

I want a second chance. I want to serve my country again" : Saleem Malik

Armed with a silken touch and having the ability to bludgeon the ball in equal measure, Saleem Malik was a mainstay of the Pakistan batting order in a career which began in 1982 and lasted seventeen years. During these years, Malik's daring match winning and saving innings gave him an almost cult like following amongst Pakistan cricket followers. He played 103 Test matches, scoring 5768 runs and also 283 ODIs where his run tally was an impressive 7170.
In an exclusive interview with PakPassion.net, the fifty-two year old Saleem Malik looked back at the highlights of his career, the Justice Qayyum report, spoke about the hurdles he has faced in his attempts to serve the nation and the game of cricket once again, his recollections of playing under Imran Khan and explained how he can use his experience to remedy some of the technical issues with today's Pakistan batsmen.
Q : You played many great innings for Pakistan. Which ones are special and memorable to you
A : Well the ones that stick out for me in One-day cricket are the world-famous and much loved innings in Kolkata when I made 72 from 62 balls against the West Indies in the Nehru Cup final (November, 1989) and we went on to win the match off the second last ball. But the One-day innings that really stands out for me is an innings that I played in the Caribbean against their ferocious pace attack in Trinidad. I scored 85 from only 55 balls and that match was played in 1988 when Patrick Patterson, Courtney Walsh, Winston Benjamin and Curtly Ambrose were bowling very quick.
As far as Test cricket is concerned I'm proud to say there were some very special innings. One innings though that really satisfies me was at Headingley in 1987. It wasn't anywhere near my highest Test score but it was a vital innings of 99 on a very difficult wicket at Leeds. But the pleasing thing was that we went onto win the match by an innings and my score of 99 helped in that victory. My highest Test score of 237 against Australia is also a much-cherished innings. The match was in Rawalpindi in 1994 and we were in trouble when we had to follow on. However we battled hard in the second innings and my innings contributed to us saving the match.
Q : Do you think you were treated fairly by Justice Qayyum
A : Well those people that looked after Justice Qayyum survived and those like me that didn't offer him anything were targeted. I was coming towards the end of my international career so I was made the scapegoat. They had to find one or two scapegoats and I was conveniently one of them.
Q : I interviewed Tauqir Zia a few years ago and he made it clear that some players escaped harsher punishment from Justice Qayyum because the Pakistan team would have struggled to find adequate replacements. How does it make you feel to hear this
A: Justice should be equal for all. The law, rules and regulations should be the same irrespective of your background or status. My question to those in authority has always been why was I treated differently to others Why was I punished so harshly Why was I shown no remorse or given a second chance I never even wanted to play cricket again, but I was still blacklisted and isolated. I've tried so many times to clear the path for myself to work again in cricket, by coaching children but they won't even let me do that. I wanted to make a cricket academy, they wouldn't even let me do that.
Q : So without cricket what have you been doing, how have you coped
A : When all my paths were blocked as far as an academy or coaching was concerned, I formed an NGO (Non Governmental Organisation) which was to be for the welfare and help of former cricketers in Pakistan who were struggling financially. This was for cricketers who were struggling to support their family despite having played First-Class cricket and in some cases international cricket. I was putting money from my own pocket and from friends to organise benefit matches for some of these cricketers who needed assistance. These benefit matches were held for two years, but last year after we made all the arrangements and the match was supposed to be televised and was supposed to include some current and veteran players, a block was put on the match and players were told they would be banned if they played and the venue of Gaddafi Stadium Lahore was told not to allow the match to happen. Then I tried to host the charity match at the LCCA ground and wasn't allowed to do so. These are just some of the stumbling blocks I have had to face. I was trying to help cricketers in dire straits in Pakistan by organising charity matches but I wasn't even allowed to do that.
Q : So what is your current status as far as your life ban is concerned
A : Well I wrote several letters to the Pakistan Cricket Board and brought up the issue in the media and eventually I was told that I'm now clear both from the Board's perspective and legally. But the PCB also said to me two years ago that they wrote to the ICC for further clarification but I have not heard any further in that regard. So I wait as I have done for many years and wait for the ICC to clarify matters with PCB before I can move on and earn a living from cricket.
Q : How does it make you feel when you see some named in the Justice Qayyum report working as coaches, commentators and in other parts of the media
A : I'm not angry or bitter. It just hurts. I played so many matches for Pakistan, I took part in so many great wins and even single-handedly won and saved matches for my country so why can't I be given a second chance as others have been I love Pakistan, it's my country I would do anything for my country I just ask for another chance to serve my country. Sadly there are some people who don't want to see me given another chance and that hurts. It's almost as if those few people have it in for me and don't want me to be given another chance. There are many players named in the Qayyum report and elsewhere who have been allowed to work in international cricket but the fact remains after sixteen years of isolation I've not been given another opportunity.
Q : You played alongside some of the greats of Pakistan cricket like Imran Khan. What are your memories of those great days
A : Imran Khan was a fantastic role-model. He was senior in age and also the leader of the group. The players respected him and he was the commander-in-chief. Under Imran Khan's leadership there was discipline and the group of players was very united. What I really enjoyed about playing under Imran Khan was his positive attitude in Test matches. He wanted to win and this was a refreshing change from some captains whose mindset was to not lose and if we won, then that was a bonus. In addition, Imran brought neutral umpires into international cricket and that eradicated the suspicions of some teams who weren't happy about home umpires. He was a pioneer for Pakistan cricket, a great thinker and someone who played with such a positive attitude and that reflected on his teams. In my mind he was the man who brought the winning mentality into Pakistan cricket. He also brought into the team an attitude that if you lose, you go down fighting. The players who played alongside Imran Khan carried on the philosophies that he implemented.
Q : You performed really well at Essex. Why do you think you were such a success in County cricket
A : I say this with all due respect to County cricketers of that era but the fact is that I had been playing for Pakistan against the best bowlers in the world and some of the all-time greats. Each County had a few good players and some world-class players but not quite in the league of international cricket. Yes conditions at times were tough in England for batting but my game plan was always to see off the best bowlers and target the others. I feel that more Pakistani players especially batsmen need exposure to County cricket, especially the four-day version.
Q : What are your thoughts on Pakistan's upcoming batsmen like Umar Akmal, Sohaib Maqsood, Ahmed Shehzad and others
A : One of the biggest problems is that we are not allowing our young batsmen to settle into international cricket and establish themselves. At times I feel that the current senior players should be doing more to help the young batsmen rather than protecting their own positions in the team. Imran Khan in his day encouraged young fast bowlers to become great cricketers, he didn't worry about his own place in the team and that one day the young bowlers may replace him in the team.
Q : What's wrong with the current Pakistan limited-overs teams
A : I don't think the selectors are doing a very good job in picking the right players. Also it seems that our limited-overs captains are either too soft in allowing themselves to be overruled or on the other hand selecting players based on favoritism. The solution is simple; Improve selection and ensure players are picked on merit not through friendships with the captain.
Q : What are your thoughts on the overall standard of batsmen around the world these days
A : I'm a big fan of Virat Kohli; he's a great player. He and AB de Villiers are the sort of players who have proved themselves in all conditions and in all formats. One thing that really annoys me though about modern-day cricket is the size of the boundaries. How can an international match be played where the boundary is just over 60 metres. These days edges fly for six, but in our day you didn't get too many edges flying for six as the boundaries were much bigger. In my day if you edged it, more often than not you were out rather than the ball flying for six. Sometimes I see players doing well in domestic Twenty20 leagues with the ball flying around everywhere, but when they are thrown into international cricket those same players struggle.

India hits one billion mobile phone subscribers

INDIA: India notched up its billionth mobile phone subscriber in October, the country's telecoms regulator said, underscoring the importance of its fast-growing mobile market, the world's second largest after China.
Mobile phone subscriptions have boomed in India in recent years as aggressive cost-cutting by its 12 hyper-competitive operators has driven down prices, leading to some of the cheapest tariffs in the world.
The number of mobile subscribers rose by nearly 7 million in October from the previous month to surpass one billion, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said Wednesday, hitting a milestone that China reached in 2012.
"It is a matter of great pride for us. It shows an empowered India and an engaged India and a tech-savvy India," Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told the Times of India newspaper.
"It will mean more data, more government-to-government connectivity, more broadband," he said.
The figures do not indicate that India has one billion individual mobile phone users, however, as many people have more than one connection.
"Dual sim" phones are particularly popular, allowing the country's cost-conscious consumers to use two different mobile plans to get the cheapest rates for local or national calls, for example.
In poorer Indian states such as Bihar, "teledensity" -- the penetration of telephone connections for every hundred people -- is as low as 54 percent, with a stark urban-rural divide.
But it still represents remarkable growth in the market since 2000, when there were just two million mobile subscribers in the country, according to research firm Ipsos.
"India is adding 10 to 15 million mobile subscribers every quarter -- that's big," Bhasker Canagaradjou, head of business consulting at Ipsos in Mumbai, told AFP.
"It is the fastest-growing market globally -- even China is not growing as fast," he said.
With more than 200 million Indians mostly in rural areas yet to get their first phone and others rushing to trade up to smartphones, growth is unlikely to slow down dramatically, Canagaradjou said.
For many people in India, a mobile phone represents their sole means of accessing the Internet, with smartphones leapfrogging desktops as the most common way of getting online.
Cheap, mostly Chinese-made smartphone handsets are available from as little as around 1,000 rupees ($15), with many people waiting for free wifi connections to get online instead of buying expensive data plans.
Seeking to capitalise on this, Google recently announced a plan to install free wifi at 400 Indian railway stations across the country over the next three years. - AFP

Japan's Uchiyama fends off challenge to WBA title

TOKYO, THURSDAY: Undefeated champion Takashi Uchiyama of Japan on Thursday successfully defended his World Boxing Association super featherweight title for the 11th time, beating Nicaraguan Oliver Flores with a technical knockout.
Uchiyama (24-0-1, 20 knockouts) went into the New Year's Eve bout clearly at ease against his challenger, 24.
Victory for the veteran Japanese titleholder, 36, came quickly -- one minute and 47 seconds into the third round -- when a single left body blow put the Nicaraguan fighter flat on the canvas.
It was a technical knockout as Flores (27-2-2, 17 knockouts) was declared no longer capable of continuing to fight before the end of the count.
"I am in very good condition," Uchiyama said after the bout. "I tried to take it easy in the first few rounds."
The headline bout was part of a WBA doubleheader at Ota Ward General Gymnasium in Tokyo. AFP

Klopp eyes Reds revival in 2016

LONDON, FRIDAY: Jurgen Klopps first two and a half months as Liverpool manager have not been straightforward, but there are signs he is getting the team moving in the right direction ahead of Saturdays trip to West Ham United.
A run of four matches in all competitions without a victory before Christmas was a cause for concern, but Klopps side have responded with successive 1-0 victories over Leicester City and Sunderland to improve their league position.
Liverpool begin 2016 lying in seventh place, five points outside the Champions League qualification positions, as they prepare to visit a West Ham side who won 3-0 at Anfield in late August.
Klopp turned down the chance to manage West Ham in the close season, stating that he was not ready for a new job at the time, having only just left Borussia Dortmund with the intention of taking a sabbatical.
Im not sure I should say too much about this, but in the summer I was not available, said Klopp, who eventually did cut short his planned year-long break in October to take the Liverpool job.
Klopp feels he did the right thing in moving to Anfield, even though he has quickly become aware of the size of the task he faces to make Liverpool title contenders.
The German coach was pleased with the victory at Sunderland, believing it was an indication of his teams growing strength of character - although he still feels that there is room for improvement.
You can make your life easier in games by taking early opportunities. Its important that we dont wait for the perfect game; that instead, we work for the perfect game, he said.
Klopp has not been helped by a new heel injury to captain Jordan Henderson, who hobbled off after an hour of Wednesdays win at the Stadium of Light.
It is the third separate foot injury this season for Henderson, who has been restricted to six league starts this season as a result.
In attack, Daniel Sturridges injury troubles have been even more well-documented than Hendersons, but the England striker is in contention to feature at West Ham after recovering from a hamstring problem.
Sturridge has made just 10 league starts since the beginning of last season after suffering seven significant injury setbacks, the latest of which flared up when he appeared as a substitute during a 2-0 defeat at Newcastle United on December 6.
Fellow Liverpool forward Divock Origi is out with a hamstring problem, though, as is midfielder James Milner, while Joe Allen is suffering with a sickness bug. Meanwhile, Slaven Bilic admits 2016 is an important year for West Ham with the club poised to move into a new home at the Olympic Stadium. AFP

Loeb the pretender eyes Al-Attiyah's Dakar crown

BUENOS AIRES, FRIDAY: Nine-time world rally champion Sebastien Loeb will add some extra spice to this year's Dakar Rally in which Qatari Nasser al-Attiyah will bid to defend his title in Argentina and Bolivia.
The Frenchman will seek to follow in the footsteps of Ari Vatanen, who won the Dakar in his first attempt in 1987, back when it was raced in Africa.
After Peru pulled out as one of the hosts of this edition in August, citing concerns over the El Nino weather phenomenon, the rally will be raced in Argentina and Bolivia, an 11km prologue kicking off proceedings on Saturday.
Loeb has been racing in the World Touring Car Championship since effectively retiring from WRC rallying after the last of his nine consecutive world titles in 2012.
The 41-year-old, who has made the odd appearance in rallies since quitting the WRC world championship circuit -- even winning in Monte Carlo and Argentina in 2013 -- will race a Peugeot 2008 DKR, having raced almost exclusively for another French manufacturer, Citroen.
Team Peugeot will enter three other cars, Loeb joining Stephane Peterhansel (11th in 2015), Carlos Sainz (DNF) and Cyril Despres (34th).
"The Dakar is very different from the type of racing I am concentrating on these days," admitted Loeb.
"It will be very long, more than two weeks! And I will need endurance to manage the car over such a distance. It is another approach to racing. I will learn all about it in January."
Loeb added that he had been impressed by the Peugeot car and will be accompanied by long-time co-driver Daniel Elena, who is also a rally-raid novice.
"When I test drove the Peugeot in June, it impressed me straight away. And it has evolved tremendously since then," the Frenchman said.
Man to beat
The man to beat is Al-Attiyah, the two-time Dakar champion (2011 and 2015) who will start the race in Buenos Aires as the favourite for the 2016 edition, in which he will be driving a Mini.
The Qatari won the 2015 edition with more than 35 minutes to spare over the closest competitor.
That winning form has continued, Al-Attiyah dominating the world of rally raids by claiming victory in the rallies of Qatar, Egypt and Morocco, as well as the Hungary, Italy and Poland Bajas, easily winning the sport's world cup, and taking new titles in WRC 2 and the Middle East Championship.
While a clear favourite, there are no certainties in the gruelling Dakar, where the race can be turned on its head any second even for the best car in the rally.
"Peugeot have some really good names in the team and especially some very good drivers, but I still think that the car is completely new and will take time to develop," Al-Attiyah told redbull.com.
"It will be a good car one day, but maybe now is a bit soon to win. However, the team has really looked like it's going in the right direction and we'll see at the next Dakar. Obviously I hope I can beat them."
Al-Attiyah was clear about his race tactics, saying he aimed to mirror last year's efforts when he took the lead on the second leg and ceded nothing.
"If you look at the last Dakar, there is actually a reason why we picked up a time penalty on the first day. That was so we could start seventh on day two. From this starting point we could get a really good time.
"We improved every day without any mistakes and by the finish we were leading by more than half-an-hour. It was a good plan and we'd like to do something similar at this Dakar, but every race is a different one."
Al-Attiyah will also face ferocious competition from within Mini itself: 2014 winner Nani Roma and ambitious Orly Terranova (5th in 2013 and 2014) pose the greatest danger among the record-breaking 13 crews fielded by X-Raid, including Guerlain Chicherit's "Zebra" buggy.
Toyota Gazoo features other pretenders to the crown, especially 2009 champion and last year's runner-up Giniel de Villiers. AFP

Man City eager to adapt to life on the road

WATFORD, THURSDAY: Manchester City's priorities as they begin a hectic January with a trip to Watford on Saturday are to stay in the Premier League title race and improve their away form.
Manager Manuel Pellegrini can be satisfied with the manner in which his team responded to defeat at Arsenal just before Christmas, following up a comprehensive 4-1 victory over Sunderland on Boxing Day with a 0-0 draw at fellow title contenders Leicester City three days later.
The result at the King Power Stadium, which ensured that third-place City begin 2016 three points behind leaders Arsenal, was significant for being the first time this season that they have managed a clean sheet without Vincent Kompany in the team.
Club captain Kompany, a reassuring influence in central defence, will be missing for around four weeks after suffering his third calf injury of the season against Sunderland.
The partnership of Nicolas Otamendi and Eliaquim Mangala has often looked unconvincing in Kompany's absence, and so their success in keeping quiet the prolific attacking threat posed by Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez will have offered encouragement for Pellegrini.
But despite showing signs of defensive robustness, City still have an issue with their away form, having not won a league match since beating Crystal Palace 1-0 on September 12. Pellegrini, for his part, has tried to play down any suggestions that it is a major problem, saying: "I don't divide the games that we play away or home.
"It was good to have a clean sheet at Leicester, but for me the best thing from that game was to continue playing the same way we had in the last two games, against Arsenal and Sunderland.
"We didn't win against Arsenal, but I think we didn't play a bad game. We played very well against Sunderland and I think we played very well also against Leicester.
"Maybe we have to finish a little bit better. Our attacking movement is important in that respect, but I think we are playing in the correct way."
'Reasons to be happy'
In addition to Kompany's troubles, Pellegrini's squad has been affected by a series of injuries this season, but he will be able to call on left-back Gael Clichy, who missed the draw at Leicester with a minor knee problem.
Midfielder Fabian Delph is also over a minor knock and will be available. Watford's form in their first season since being promoted from the Championship has caught many by surprise with Quique Sanchez Flores's side currently lying ninth, two points behind fifth-place Palace.
Monday's 2-1 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur came as a setback, but the manager revealed that the tears of his 12-year-old son Paulo forced him to put the result into context."I'm always thinking that we need to keep our minds and that is important because we don't want to lose our perspective," Flores said.
"But we have lots of reasons to be happy. After the last match, one of my kids, Paulo, was crying because we lost in the last minute and I found very quickly 10 reasons to be happy with Watford.
"In seconds I found maybe 10 or 12 reasons to say: 'Paulo, we need to be happy.' We are competitive, we have a good connection with the fans, they are happy, we are in a good position, we are playing well and have the possibility to win a lot. - AFP

Mathews released ahead of IPL 2016

Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, Yuvraj Singh, Dinesh Karthik, Dale Steyn, Ishant Sharma and Kevin Pietersen are some of the big names released by their IPL franchises as the deadline for the first trading window closed on Thursday. A total of 101 players were retained, while 61 were let go by the six franchises.
Yuvraj (INR 16 crores) and Mathews (INR 7.5 crores), who played for Delhi Daredevils, and Karthik (INR 10.5 crores), who was with Royal Challengers Bangalore, were the three most expensive buys at the IPL auction last year. All of them were dropped going into the new season.
Yuvraj was anything but the catalyst Daredevils hoped for as they finished seventh in 2015. He scored 248 runs from 13 innings and averaged below 20, and bowled only nine overs in the tournament as well. Mathews, too, proved a failure, tallying a mere 144 runs in 11 matches in which he bagged just seven wickets at an economy rate of 8.20.

Michael Schumacher: F1 legend's two-year crash anniversary marked with sadness
JOHANNESBURG: Michael Schumacher's former team-mates have marked the two-year anniversary of the Formula One legend's skiing crash with sadness.
Former Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said that he was really close to the German driver's family, adding that he was expecting a miraculous recovery to happen for the F1 legend.
Montezemolo, under whose reign Schumacher won a record five consecutive world championships, hadn't visited his former colleague since the tragic incident, Sport24 reported.
Echoing similar views, son of great Enzo Ferrai, Piero Ferrari, said that he felt sad to see Schumacher in such a condition, insisting that he had never imagined that fate would have this in store for him.
Schumacher, who has record seven Formula One titles and 91 race wins, was injured while skiing during a French Alps vacation in 2013 and has been going through his painfully slow recovery at his Swiss lakeside home.-

Mother mistakes daughter for intruder, shoots her

US: Police in Florida say a mother mistook her daughter for an intruder and shot her to death.
St. Cloud police Sgt. Denise Roberts said Wednesday the mother was asleep when she heard someone enter her home late Tuesday.
The mother told police she heard footsteps approaching quickly so she fired a single shot. She then discovered the person was her 27-year-old daughter.
The daughter was taken to a hospital where she died.
St. Cloud Police officials say they aren't releasing the names of the mother or daughter since a person in their household is in law enforcement, and Florida law permits the withholding of identities in such cases.
Detectives are investigating the case but say so far the mother's story matches the evidence.

Nadal confident of being 'very competitive' in 2016

ABU DHABI, THURSDAY: Rafael Nadal is confident he will be "very competitive" in 2016 after a difficult 2015 during which the world number five struggled with his early form.
The Spaniard made a strong push at the end of last season to finish inside the top-five but his results in 2015 were the worst he has recorded in more than a decade as he admitted he was struggling with confidence.
But the 29-year-old revealed he had a strong off season where he practised hard in Mallorca and is ready to step on the court at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship exhibition event in Abu Dhabi on Friday before heading to Doha for his official season-opener.
"The off season has been great. In Mallorca we had unbelievable weather and we were able to practise as much as we wanted," he told reporters in the UAE capital on Thursday.
"I had the chance to enjoy it. I'm happy for everything. I feel that I worked well enough, I finished the 2015 season with good feelings and I just keep practising with these positive feelings. I'm excited to start another new season. I feel myself well and I hope to be ready for what's coming.
"I don't know if I'll start well from the beginning but I feel ready. Then the results you never know what's going on. But I feel that I'm doing the right things, I'm playing well and I hope to start with good feelings.
"I'm going to be passionate. I'm confident that I'm going to be very competitive."
Having already successfully launched numerous comebacks throughout a career that has been marred with injury, Nadal is not viewing his current situation in similar light.
"Not a big comeback, I am number five in the world actually," he said of what he expected of himself in 2016.
"It seems like I'm number 50 or something like this. I didn't have the best season possible last year. But without having the best season possible, to be able to finish number five is actually not bad news.
"I'm happy the way I finished the season. I don't expect an amazing comeback, I expect an improvement of my level of tennis and my level of competition and if I made that happen I hope to be competing for the good things."
World number one Novak Djokovic will also commence his season in Doha next week and the Serb, whose tremendous 2015 saw him win three more Grand Slams and put together one of the most impressive 11 months of tennis in history, will be looking to pick up where he left off.
Asked if he expects another dominant display from Djokovic, Nadal said: "What Novak has been doing the last couple of years is just amazing and we have to congratulate him for that.
"If he is able to maintain that kind of level then only thing that you can say is applaud him. That's it. The rest of the players, we work hard and I hope to be competitive enough to compete against everybody this year, including Novak, and we'll see if I can make that happen." AFP

Nelson wicket has New Zealand, Sri Lanka in a spin

NELSON, FRIDAY: New Zealand were paying close attention to the Saxton Oval wicket on New Year's Day amid suggestions it could offer spin for Saturday's crucial fourth one-dayer against Sri Lanka.
Another win to Sri Lanka would level the series at two wins apiece and turn the fifth and final game into the decider.
A key piece of intelligence New Zealand took from the third match at Nelson's Saxton Oval on Thursday was a sign the pitch is starting to take turn.
They were thoroughly outplayed in that match with Sri Lanka bettering their 276-run total for the loss of only two wickets against New Zealand's predominantly pace attack.
The New Zealand bowling line-up is already destined for a shake-up with Tim Southee ruled out with an injured left foot, earning a recall for Matt Henry who took four wickets in each of the first two matches.
But consideration is also being given to dropping one of the quick bowlers in favour of pairing the leg-break option of Ish Sodhi with the left-arm spin of Mitchell Santner.
Santner, who went for a wicketless 59 off his 10 overs in Nelson, said the pitch flattened out during the day with a suggestion of spin.
"It's starting to turn a little bit so the spinners might get more of a crack," he said, but added: "It's still going to be a good batting surface so pushing that 300 mark could be a competitive score."
Kane Williamson, standing in as captain while Brendon McCullum recovers from a sore back, confirmed the two-spinner option was under discussion.
"You assess the wicket and you look at the squad and pick the team that best suits the conditions. Naturally they (spinners) will come into a chance to play in the next one."
Williamson was not impressed with the way Southee, Adam Milne and Doug Bracewell set about defending New Zealand's 276 total.
"We didn't bowl particularly well in that first 10 which didn't help our cause," he said.
"We would all admit we were off the mark there and they batted very well."
Tillakaratne Dilshan and Danushka Gunathilaka cracked 83 off the first 10 overs with Dilshan going on to make 91 and Gunathilaka 65.
Lahiru Thirimanne was not out 87 when Sri Lanka reached their target with 22 balls to spare.
Thursday was not a good day for Williamson as he watched his side crumble in the face of a rejuvenated Sri Lankan unit he also lost his place at the head of the world Test batting rankings to Australian skipper Steve Smith.
Smith leaped from fourth to first following scores of 134 not out and 70 not out in the Boxing Day Test against the West Indies, which Australia won by 177 runs. AFP

Nepal's ex-child soldier blazes ultra running trail
Mira Rai
KATHMANDU, Friday - As a child soldier with Nepal's Maoists, Mira Rai learned to fire guns, disarm opponents and race down trails, little imagining her guerrilla drills would help make her one of the world's top ultra runners.
"It is like a dream, beyond anything I ever imagined. I was just a girl from a village," Rai told AFP.
The daughter of a poor Nepali farmer, Rai was only 14 when she ran away from home to fight alongside Maoist rebels seeking to overthrow the government.
"In our society, girls are supposed to behave in a certain way. I didn't want to be confined by that," said Rai, now aged 26.
She chafed at the rules she was expected to obey as a teenage girl living in a patriarchal country and the Maoist call for revolution resonated with her.
"The Maoists gave opportunities to women, they treated us equally. I saw that women could fight like men, be brave. I built up my confidence there," Rai said.
She practised firearm drills and competed with other cadres in running contests designed to build endurance.
"I did very well, I even used to outrun the boys," she recalled.
Today, Rai ranks among the world's leading ultra runners after a record-breaking win in the 80-kilometre (50-mile) Mont Blanc race in Chamonix, France, last June, when she beat her nearest rival by 22 minutes.
But when the decade-long insurgency ended in 2006, Rai, like many Maoist foot soldiers, was left with little in the way of cash or career prospects.
Desperate for work, she prepared to leave Nepal for a job in a Malaysian electronics factory before being scouted by a Kathmandu-based karate instructor, Dhurba Bikram Malla, who urged her to stay.
Rai gave up her plans and started training -- initially doing practice runs on the capital's congested roads because she could not afford the 15-cent bus fare to the nearest stadium.
"She was very single-minded. If you told her to do something, she would just do it," Malla told AFP.
"She is very consistent in her speed (and) never seems to get tired."
- Running in $4 shoes -Rai made her racing debut in March 2014, running a steep 50-kilometre course along the hills overlooking the Kathmandu valley.
Dressed in a cheap t-shirt and shoes that cost $4, she ran for hours before she felt dizzy and stopped.
"I borrowed money to buy juice and noodles and started running again," she said.
Soon, Rai crossed the finish line, winning her first race and prizes that included a new pair of running shoes.
Since then, she has notched up an impressive set of victories, bagging gold in 13 of the 20 national and international races she has taken part in, including Italy's 83-kilometre Trail Degli Eroi.
Her victory at Chamonix vaulted her to second place among female ultra runners in the Skyrunners World Series which involves races in five continents.
Although Nepal is considered an ideal spot for trail running, racing remains a niche activity with the Himalayan nation hosting just a handful of events each year, including the world's highest marathon held in the foothills of Mount Everest.
Other Nepali athletes are making their mark in ultra running, with soldier Samir Tamang crowned Asian men's skyrunning champion after winning this year's 50-kilometre MSIG Sai Kung 50 in Hong Kong.
Both Rai and Tamang are supported by Trail Running Nepal, an organisation that promotes ultra running, but finding sponsors is a challenge for local athletes.
"Sponsorship is near impossible," Richard Bull, founder of Trail Running Nepal, told AFP.
"For trail running to grow in Nepal, we need people to organise (more) races. If it grows, then finding sponsors will be easier."
Rai, now sponsored by the multinational sports equipment company Salomon, is a rare success story, with a recent race yielding $1,500 in prize money, double Nepal's annual per capita income.
Yet she shrugs off her accomplishments, insisting she has been lucky.
"I have been fortunate to get opportunities... I want to inspire other women, tell them that nothing is impossible if we work hard," she said.
"There must be so many other Mira Rais in Nepal." AFP

Neville's Valencia still winless as Villarreal go fourth

MADRID, THURSDAY: Gary Neville remains without a win in La Liga as Valencia boss as Villarreal moved up to fourth thanks to captain Bruno Soriano's spectacular free-kick in a 1-0 win on Thursday.
Bruno found the top corner from the edge of the box midway through the second-half to allow Villarreal to edge two points ahead of Celta Vigo in the battle for the final Champions League place.
However, Valencia's ambitions of a top-four finish now look forlorn as they lie 11 points behind their local rivals in 10th.
Valencia had only managed to draw Neville's opening two league games in charge against Eibar and Getafe before the 10-day winter break. And the former Manchester United defender took a more defensive approach in a bid to at least preserve his unbeaten record with a five-man defence as Villarreal dominated the first 45 minutes.
Roberto Soldado had the best chance to open the scoring against his old side, but the former Tottenham Hotspur striker failed to connect with Jonathan dos Santos's inviting cross. - AFP

Pathankot: Gunmen attack India air force base near Pakistan border
Four gunmen have been killed in an overnight attack on an Indian air force base near Pakistani border, officials say.
Two soldiers at the Pathankot base were also killed in a gun battle lasting several hours.
Operations at the base are continuing, with some reports saying gunmen are holed up in the base.
The incident came days after the Indian and Pakistani leaders Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif met in Lahore to launch a surprise peace initiative.

The whole of India's Punjab state has been placed on alert.
The base is on the main highway leading to Indian-administered Kashmir.
Militant allegation

The gunmen wore Indian military uniforms and drove a hijacked car when they launched the attack at 03:30 (22:00 GMT Friday).

They entered living quarters at the base, but were contained there and so were unable to cause any damage to military hardware, said air force spokeswoman Rochelle D'Silva.

On Saturday morning, fresh gunfire was heard and a helicopter seen firing at an area inside the base.
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says it is not yet clear who the attackers were but suspicion is already falling on Kashmiri militant groups based in Pakistan.

Some Indian security officials suggested the Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed was to blame.
India says the group is backed by Pakistan, but Islamabad denies this.

In August seven people were killed in a similar attack when gunmen stormed a police station in nearby Gurdaspur district.
The three attackers in Gurdaspur were killed after a 12-hour standoff with police.
Pathankot air force base is about 430km (270 miles) north of the Indian capital, Delhi and is on the road linking Indian-administered Kashmir with the rest of the country.

Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a long-running insurgency against rule from Delhi, and Kashmir has been a flashpoint in relations between Pakistan and India for nearly 70 years since independence. (BBC)

Performance against India was my lowest point of 2015: Hashim Amla

DURBAN: South African captain Hashim Amla has singled out his horrible performance in the recently concluded Test series in India, especially the Delhi Test as one of lowest points of the year 2015.
Asked about the low points of 2015, Amla after his team's 241-run loss said:"I think this match (England Test) and probably one in Delhi."
Amla conceded that it was time for him to start leading from the front with the bat, attributing his continued batting woes to a lack of confidence rather than poor technique. "It started off well last year when I got some runs but not being able to maintain it has been disappointing. Certainly as captain you want to lead from the front." "Hopefully I can turn it around in the next match, start leading from the front by getting the runs on the board so that the boys can follow," Amla said. "Not scoring the runs has been our Achilles' heel for a couple of Test matches; that's probably the most disappointing. It's been disappointing for everybody," he said. "I certainly think it's a confidence thing and we don't know how long it will go on for but we hope that we are close to turning it around.
Dean (Elgar) started it off brilliantly, his hundred has been the positive light from this Test match for us.
He batted well in India and the way he batted in this game is a good lesson for everyone."
Amla started off his captaincy tenure in 2014 with series wins against Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and the West Indies, but in 2015, his record has been less rosy, with a rain-affected drawn series against Bangladesh and the loss to India last month. But there is no talk of stepping down.
Rather, Amla said his hunger and desire to captain South Africa was even more than what it was before. "I definitely do (have the hunger)," he said when asked if he wanted to continue with the captaincy. "I've enjoyed every minute of it and it's just been disappointing not to get the runs. In the middle of a Test series like this the hunger to get runs on the board is getting more." PTI

PM to amend SLC Constitution after elections

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said that the Sri Lanka Cricket constitution will be amended soon after the elections scheduled for Sunday.
Minister Jayasekera said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe intends to amend the Sri Lanka Cricket constitution after having discussions with the International Cricket Council and the winning candidate in the near future at a press briefing held at the Sports Ministry premises yesterday with regard to the SLC elections.
"The Supreme Court asked the Sports Ministry to facilitate the two camps to contest in the forthcoming AGM of Sri Lanka Cricket," the Minister said.
"For the first time in Sri Lankan history the Supreme Court sat in judgment of a cricket AGM issue. It was a historical moment," Minister Jayasekera said.
MOBILE PHONES & WEAPONS BANNED
The Minister drawing up security plans for the elections stated that mobile phones and weapons will be banned during the election period at the ministry premises. "No one can enter with private security or Ministry securities. Special security will be provided with Special Police at the Sports Ministry premises.

Reality in hands of stakeholders

Both camps are optimistic of claiming victory and there appears to be no losers at the much awaited elections to the country's richest sports body Sri Lanka Cricket which will be held at the Sports Ministry auditorium on Sunday at 10 am.
However the reality will be in the hands of the stakeholders who have mandated to vote for the most suitable candidate and their team and will wisely decide on the outcome.
As the present administration is run by an interim committee the Ministry of Sports will conduct the election under the supervision of its Director-General K.D.S. Ruwanchandra.
The two main contestants in the running for the presidency are former three-time president Thilanga Sumathipala who is also the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and Nishantha Ranatunga, a former four-time secretary and present president of Colombo Colts CC. There is Sumith Perera, president of Badureliya SC who is also contesting for the post.
Following the court order all the nominees against whom objections were raised will be able to contest their respective posts.
Yesterday and today were crucial for both parties as there will be a lot of horse trading taking place till Saturday evening.
With the coming together of Jayantha Dharmadasa and Thilanga Sumathipala, two former rivals for the presidency in the past, the Sumathipala camp appears to have a strong stakeholder backing.
THILANGA SAYS
"I was vice president for three consecutive years 1995-1997 and contested the presidency three times and each time I won more than two-thirds of the membership supported me and my team," said Sumathipala.
"At that time the only strong point was that Jayantha Dharmadasa's supporters were not with me. Today he is also with me. I can't see anybody who understands cricket and cricketing administration can even dream of coming closer to winning with our entire team.
"We are practical and have a pragmatic approach. We are definitely winning and there is no doubt about it. The stakeholders whom we have contacted have given us sufficient indication towards such a victory," he said.
Sumathipala added that his top priority was to stabilize national cricket and to appoint a top level foreign coach to ensure sustainability to improve our international rankings and to achieve better results.
"With the exit of stars Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara there are youngsters who could perform but the lack of experience deprives them from performing at that level. They need guidance at international level. So getting a foreign coach is imperative," said Sumathipala.
"Top priority will be given to national cricket and the appointment of a national coach to sustain our status in the international arena and give guidance to a number of promising youngsters to perform at the top level.
"I also plan to introduce a system to support the decentralisation of cricket in the districts by having a strong administrative and infrastructure base and also give maximum support to club cricket to enhance its status and quality so that domestic cricket becomes meaningful to cater to international cricket," he said.
NISHANTHA SAYS
"I came forward basically because of the request we got from the membership who had appreciated the development work we had done and that we have done well in our cricket," said Ranatunga.
"We were ranked first in T20s, second in Tests and third in ODIs at the time we were removed from the SLC. But during the last eight months the cricket has gone down and the stakeholders expected us to come up with a team to revive cricket.
"The majority of the members are supporting us and we are very confident of winning 96 plus seats out of the total voting strength of 147. I have been assured of this figure by the membership. We have spoken to them and they have assured us of their mandate," he said.
Having been in cricket administration for quite a while Ranatunga said that he thought it was the right time for him to come forward to contest the post as president.
"Consideting my experience in the cricket arena I thought it was the right time. I have done enough for the game to get elected to that position," Ranatunga said.
"People will analyse what we have done during the last few years. We have improved the revenue by 600 percent, our cricket has been taken to the highest level and during my term as secretary we have won one World Cup, been runner-up in two World Cups, beaten all the countries in their own soil and our cricket has gone to the top three positions in all three formats," he said.
"Administratively we have good systems and procedures in place for Sri Lanka Cricket which shows the efficiency of its management."
Ranatunga said that they have come up with a plan to develop school and club cricket which is the pinnacle of our cricket and a long term plan for district cricket.
He said that his elder brother Arjuna Ranatunga who is the Minister of Ports and Shipping coming forward to contest for one of the vice-presidency posts would strengthen them.
"More than the voting his presence will help Sri Lanka cricket. With his cricketing knowledge and commitment for cricket I am sure that will help us a lot."
Ranatunga stated that he had no personal problems with the players although there were some misunderstandings.
"Some of them didn't agree with the decisions we took. We never took individual decisions but did it with the best interest of Sri Lanka cricket and to look after the interest of the stake holders," said Ranatunga.
"The finger was pointed at me because I was the person who communicated the decisions and as secretary that was part of my job."

Sharapova to face Makarova in Brisbane first round

BRISBANE, FRIDAY: Maria Sharapova will open her Australian campaign with a match against Ekaterina Makarova following Friday's draw for the Brisbane International.
Defending champion and third seed Sharapova will play world number 23 Makarova in a rematch from last year's Australian Open semi-final.
"This was a grand slam semi-final last year in Australia," five-time grand slam champion Sharapova told reporters.
"For a first match, it's a pretty high-quality match against a pretty tough opponent."
World number four Sharapova, 28, who beat Ana Ivanovic in last year's Brisbane final, leads Makarova 6-0 in their past meetings. World number two and top seed Simona Halep has drawn a bye for her opening round but could face two-time Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka in the second round.
Spain's Garbine Muguruza is the second seed. After a first-round bye she will face either American Varvara Lepchenko or Slovakian Anna Karolina Schmiedlova.
The women's field boasts nine of the world's top 20 as well as former world number ones Azarenka and Jelena Jankovic.
In the men's draw, Australian wildcard Ben Mitchell or a qualifier are in line to become Roger Federer's first opponent in 2016.

Sports Minister makes stunning revelation

Two Sri Lankan cricketers Rangana Herath and Kusal Perera have been approached for match fixing by an individual associated with the national cricket team Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera revealed at a press conference yesterday.
This individual had approached Perera during practice to 'fix' a match during the home series between Sri Lanka and West Indies in October-November.
"I have complained regarding this matter to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID)," said the Minister.
"This person who is assisting the players during the practice sessions has links with match fixers," the Minister said.
The Minister queried as to why Sri Lanka Cricket had not taken any steps to investigate the persons involved in this kind of activities.
"This is a link for worldwide match-fixing which is a big issue. I hope this individual who is supposed to help the national players during practice sessions will be arrested shortly and an inquiry held into this matter," he said.

Targeting third Grand Slam win off Wawrinka's radar

ABU DHABI, THURSDAY: Stan Wawrinka has won more Grand Slams than Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal combined over the past two seasons but the Swiss world number four insists that adding to his Major tally is a goal that is "too far away".
Wawrinka, who handed Novak Djokovic his only Grand Slam defeat in 2015 by stunning the world number one in the French Open final, will kick off his season in Abu Dhabi at the six-player exhibition Mubadala World Tennis Championship on Friday, but said winning a third career Major was not on his list of goals for 2016.
"It's been only two years and a half, three years that I'm back in the top 10, that I'm in the top five. Yes I know I won two Grand Slams in two years but it's still something incredible for me, something not normal, so it's tough for me to put a goal to win a Grand Slam again," Wawrinka, 30, told reporters in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.
"I know how difficult it is, I know the challenge is big. That's why it's not my goal. It's too far away to put that as a goal. My goal is to give me the chance to be at my top in Grand Slams and then I know I can beat the top guys. But for that you need to do all the right things during the year."
Wawrinka spent his off season training in Geneva, where he says he worked hard on his body and his tennis, and will officially inaugurate his ATP season in Chennai next week, where he targets a fourth title there.
He remains Swiss number two, behind his third-ranked compatriot Federer, who at 34 is still in peak shape, having made two Grand Slam finals in 2015. Asked if he sees himself competing at the top level of the sport well into his 30s like Federer, Wawrinka said: "Hopefully yes, hopefully I can play for many more years. But again, I'm going to try to play as much as I can that's for sure. Where I'll be in a few years, which ranking, what level I really don't know. I will always push myself to be at my top and we'll see where it will be."
On whether he'll be teaming up with Federer at the Rio 2016 Olympics in doubles - they won gold together in Beijing 2008 - Wawrinka added: "We don't know yet. We haven't decided. We have to talk about the beginning of the year and see what we're going to do."

## Title: Top 10 TEST INNINGS of 2015
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports
## Date: Saturday, January 2, 2016 - 01:00
Top 10 TEST INNINGS of 2015
Kane Williamson - 242* v Sri Lanka, Wellington
The year started on a remarkable note for Williamson, New Zealand's rock-solid No 3, and that innings set in motion a successful 2015. The situation was thus: New Zealand faced a deficit of 135 when their second innings began, and were 75/1 when Williamson - who top-scored with 69 on day one - came out to bat. Wickets fell, but Williamson was unmoved. At 159/5 the lead was just 24, when out walked BJ Watling. What followed was a world record sixth-wicket partnership of 365 that slammed the door on Sri Lanka. Williamson's career-best effort was made from technique, application and determination harking back to an era where such innings were the hallmark of great Test batsmen. In the process of that priceless 242, he became the fastest New Zealand batsman to 3000 Test runs, beating Martin Crowe's record by three innings. When the curtain falls on Williamson's career - and Crowe had predicted him to smash all of New Zealand's batting records - that unbeaten double-century may stand out.
Ben Stokes - 92 v New Zealand, Lord's
This was England's best performance of the short two-match series at home with New Zealand, and one that spurred them onto a 124-run win in the first Test. The hosts had slumped to 30/4 inside the first hour but in the company of Joe Root, the 24-year-old Stokes launched a counter-attack that epitomised the tone of England's summer. In a partnership of 161 in 32 overs, the left-hander smacked 92 from 94 balls - at one stage he crashed 31 in 13 deliveries - and after stumps revealed that being promoted to No 6 and told to play his natural, aggressive game allowed him to bat as he pleased. For a batsman whose previous Test at Lord's contained two ducks, that whirlwind 92 against Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Matt Henry - each of whom were plundered - was a fine achievement. And it sparked something in Stokes, who came out to bat in England's second innings and achieved the fastest Test century seen at Lord's, off 85 balls.
Adam Voges - 130* v West Indies, Dominica
Voges had floated around Australia's domestic circuit for the better part of 12 years before making his Test debut at the age of 35, and he promptly became the oldest cricketer to score a century on Test debut, batting 247 deliveries for an unbeaten 130 that lifted Australia from 61/3 to 318 - a lead of 170. Support was hard to find for Voges, with only the No 11 Josh Halewood (39) scoring more than Steve Smith's 25. Leaving it all for the debutant to do, Australia were eventually indebted to Voges' hundred which set up a nine-wicket win in the first Test. It was an impressive achievement for anyone, but making it sweeter for Voges was the fact that he stood firm with his work attitude and determination to secure a Baggy Green. "I'll take it," he said after the second day's play. "People have been saying I'm the oldest guy for a lot of things. It's been a lot of hard work, so I'm very happy."
Sarfraz Ahmed - 96 v Sri Lanka, Galle
Pakistan's reliable wicketkeeper-batsman was to the fore in Galle, where his sixth-wicket stand with Asad Shafiq turned the tables on Sri Lanka. From being five down and 182 runs behind the home team's first-innings total on the fourth morning of the first Test, Pakistan were driven to a lead of 117. Central to that was Man-of-the-Match Sarfraz's approach: 86 balls, 96 runs, 13 fours. Displaying his range of strokes, some orthodox and some far removed, the 28-year-old eased the pressure off Shafiq while frustrating Sri Lanka. Critically, his tactics against Rangana Herath were eye-catching; often taking guard well outside leg stump, Sarfraz both swept and drove inside-out off the wily spinner to push the score forward. He missed a century by four runs, but the match award was just reward for his exceptional innings.
Younis Khan - 171* v Sri Lanka, Pallekele
Few would have given Pakistan chance of getting 377 after their poor showing in the first innings of the deciding Test at Pallekele. That they achieved that record chase owed in heaps to the 37-year-old Younis, who faced 271 balls in his unbeaten 171 that sealed the series 2-1 over Sri Lanka. Pakistan were 13/2 in the second innings, but with Younis and young opener Shan Masood (125) they were resuscitated and put on their way for the highest team run chase ever. This was Younis' 11th score of 150 or more, the most by a Pakistan batsman, and he also became the first batsman in Test history to score five fourth-innings centuries. "It was not easy, but I have my own expectations from myself, to do well when the team is under pressure. I take the onus on myself to take my team to victory," said a modest Younis after accepting the match prize.
Joe Root - 134 v Australia, Cardiff
The innings that shouldn't have been, but turned out to be everything for England as the Ashes started at Sophia Gardens. Overhead conditions in Cardiff strongly indicated it was a bowl-first pitch, but Alastair Cook had no hesitation in opting to bat. At 43/3, his decision looked silly. Root inside-edged his first ball onto his pads, then nicked his second delivery, a lovely curling away swinger, but was dropped by a diving Brad Haddin behind the stumps. He never looked back, driving, cutting and flicking his way to a match-winning 134 from 166 balls that helped set the stage for England to retain the Ashes. It truly was an innings worth its weight in gold, for by pushing and running constantly Root's approach gnawed at Australia and helped counter a very slow surface. England ended the first day on 343/7 and pushed on to 430, which proved instrumental in a 169-run win.

Dinesh Chandimal - 162* v India, Galle
The most counter-attacking hundred of the year, and one that turned a precarious situation into a famous defeat of India. When Sri Lanka went into the lunch interval on day three at 108/5 with a deficit of 84 runs, it appeared that things could quickly go downhill in the afternoon on a surface that was assisting spin. Instead, Chandimal denied India for two-thirds of the second session in a partnership of 125 with Lahiru Thirimanne, scored at over five runs per over, then added 89 in brisk time with Jehan Mubarak, before moving from 111 to 162 in 45 deliveries while batting with the tail. His unbeaten 162 form 160 balls was Chandimal's fourth Test hundred and his best yet, featuring bold and brazen shots - including one reverse-sweep for six off Harbhajan Singh - that toyed with India's bowling. It wasn't always pretty, but you have to salute a batsman who backs his instinct in such pressure situations. Most importantly, that innings set up a Sri Lankan win.
Alastair Cook - 263 v Pakistan, Abu Dhabi
In today's era, Cook proved that there is room for the dour, stonewalling efforts required to save Test matches. Perhaps the last Test opener with the gumption for a marathon innings where a higher price is put on defending rather that run-accumulation, the England captain played the third longest Test innings in history - a monumental effort that spanned 528 balls in 836 minutes. Pakistan's 523/8 ate up 151.1 overs, and England's best shot at avoiding a defeat was to bat out time. Cook did precisely that during his awesome 263, where the next best was Root's 85. He was seventh out with England's total at 549 in 190.1 overs, showing the way for his team-mates. In the end, England came within striking distance of an improbable win after Pakistan collapsed for 173 in their second innings. That they came anywhere close was down to Cook.
Ross Taylor - 290 v Australia, Perth
The track was flat, but to go past Australia's first innings score of 599 took something remarkable. Taylor marked his guard with New Zealand 87/2 and went on to enter cricket's record books during the course of his excellent 290 which lifted the visiting team to their highest total against the hosts in a 53-match history dating back to 1946. Foremost of those was a breaking a record that had stood for almost 112 years, that of the highest individual score by a visiting batsman in Australia. Taylor's career-best 290 from 374 balls surpassed England batsman Tip Foster's 287 scored in Sydney in December 1903 and overall, only England great Len Hutton's 364 at Lord's in 1938 stands as the highest score against Australia after Taylor's sublime effort. With Williamson (166) for company and then batting with the tail, Taylor helped New Zealand to 624 before he was last out, slog-sweeping Nathan Lyon to deep midwicket where the substitute Jonny Wells held a good sliding catch.
Ajinkya Rahane - 127 v South Africa, Delhi
Rahane's stroke-filled 127 from 215 deliveries was a critical factor in India beating South Africa at the Feroz Shah Kotla for a 3-0 win. It was also the first century of a low-scoring series and the longest individual innings of a series dominated by the ball on rank turners.
The Kotla surface was not one such, but still required plenty of application and skill, and it was fitting that Rahane was the man to reach a significant landmark for it was at this venue that he made a forgettable debut in 2013.
This excellent hundred lifted India from 66/3 to an eventual 334 all out and with it Rahane has also pushed his batting average in India from under eight to 24.85. Rahane's fluidity harked back to his sublime Lord's century of 2014, and for sheer value it will rank alongside that match-winning effort. TNN

Wenger optimistic of bright future for Arsenal

LONDON, FRIDAY: Whatever happens when Newcastle United visit the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, Arsene Wenger can be satisfied Arsenal have ended 2015 in a much better shape than they started the year.
Twelve months ago, the Gunners slumped to a 2-0 defeat at Southampton that left them in sixth position in the Premier League, 13 points adrift of leaders Chelsea -- a dismal situation that led to a confrontation between Wenger and an angry supporter during the game.
This time around, Arsenal will start the new year at the top of the league table and bolstered by the growing confidence this could be the year they deliver a first English title since 2004.
Wenger's side have grown stronger the longer the season has gone on and it would be a major surprise if they failed to record a fifth win in six league games against Steve McClaren's struggling Newcastle.
The 4-0 defeat at Southampton a week ago demonstrated the north London club still have the capacity to stumble unexpectedly.
But with German midfielder Mesut Ozil in outstanding form and Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey getting better with every game, the impact of a succession of injuries to key players including Alexis Sanchez has not been felt as keenly as they might have been.
The title race, though, remains finely balanced, with only goal difference separating Arsenal from Leicester City, who lie second with Manchester City a further three points behind. Wenger insists this is the most exciting season at the head of the table for several years and the immediate challenge for his side is to ensure they maintain their slender lead. And on that count, the Gunners manager believes Arsenal's performances have offered grounds for optimism at the Emirates. "Being top on goal difference doesn't make a big difference, it is just down to how well you play," Wenger said. "Your performances dictate all that and you have to be guided by your performances.
"After that it is reassuring to know that if your performances are right you do not need bad results from somebody else.

WORLD WELCOMES NEW YEAR DESPITE TERROR FEARS

BRAZIL: Millions of people around the world welcomed in the New Year on high security alert, with Munich stations evacuated over an imminent terror threat and fireworks canceled in Paris and Brussels, while a huge fire ripped through a Dubai hotel.
German police warned people to stay away from two of Munich's railway stations and avoid large gatherings after "indications that a terror attack" was being planned by Islamists in the southern German city.
Authorities said early Friday the threat involved a suspected suicide bomb attack by the Islamic State group. A police spokeswoman told AFP they had "reliable information" that the plot targeted festivities under way on New Year's Eve.
Elsewhere in Europe, terror fears also loomed large, with firework displays canceled in Brussels and Paris, just weeks after jihadists killed 130 people on the streets of the French capital.
More than 100,000 police were deployed throughout France to guard celebrations, as defiant Parisians turned out on the Champs Elysees to greet 2016 in the biggest public gatherings since the November 13 attacks.
In his New Year address, President Francois Hollande said France "has not finished with terrorism yet" and that the threat of another attack "remains at its highest level."
Belgian police were holding five people over an alleged New Year attack plot in Brussels, as well as arresting a 10th suspect over the Paris attacks.
In Dubai, a vast blaze ripped through a luxury 63-story hotel, the Address Downtown, close to the world's tallest tower where people had gathered to ring in the New Year.
But authorities put on a spectacular show, refusing to let the hotel blaze, which injured 16 people, disrupt celebrations.
Festivities went ahead as planned and crowds cheered the arrival of 2016 with bursts of light and colour in a massive fireworks show starting at the landmark Burj Khalifa skyscraper, even as smoke billowed from the nearby blaze.
'Choice target for terrorists'
Sydney, traditionally the first to host a major New Year's bash, kicked off the global festivities when it lit up the skies with pyrotechnics at the stroke of midnight (1300 GMT Thursday).
After Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, the chimes of midnight will finally move across the Americas.
Jakarta remained on high alert after anti-terror police foiled detailed plans for an alleged New Year suicide attack in the Indonesian capital.
Turkish police detained two Islamic State suspects allegedly planning to stage attacks in the centre of the capital Ankara.
In Moscow, police for the first time closed off Red Square, where tens of thousands of revelers traditionally gather.
"It's no secret that Moscow is one of the choice targets for terrorists," Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said ahead of the celebrations.
In Britain, Scotland Yard said around 3,000 officers were deployed across central London in what was reported to be an unprecedented anti-terror security effort.
Fireworks were banned in towns and cities across Italy, in some cases because of a recent spike in air pollution and also because of fears that sudden loud bangs could cause panic.
In Madrid, only 25,000 people were allowed into the Puerta del Sol square due to security concerns.
Party at the pyramids, on the beach
In the United States, authorities said they had arrested and charged a 25-year-old American Muslim convert over an alleged attempt to launch a New Year's Eve attack in upstate New York in the name of the Islamic State group. In New York City, despite a pledge of tight security, one million people are expected to turn out to see the Times Square ball descend.
An estimated two million people were expected to ring in 2016 on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach, with the Brazilian city hosting this year's Olympics.
Alongside the party, swarms of worshipers dressed in white were to take to the beach and wade into the ocean to leave offerings for Yemanja, the goddess of the sea in the Afro-Brazilian Candomble faith.
Cairo meanwhile was trying desperately to attract tourists to bolster the economy. The government this year staged celebrations in front of the pyramids near the Egyptian capital, with ambassadors, artists and intellectuals all invited.
Sierra Leone's capital Freetown was hoping to reclaim its mantle as host of the best beach parties in Africa after Ebola scared people away.
The city of 1.2 million was deserted 12 months ago during the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded.
"This New Year's Eve I am going to dance and party until the cock crows," said 35-year-old Franklyn Smith.
In Ivory Coast, 3,100 prisoners held after post-election violence in 2010-11 will also start 2016 on a happy note after President Alassane Ouattara announced in his New Year's address he would reduce their sentences.
