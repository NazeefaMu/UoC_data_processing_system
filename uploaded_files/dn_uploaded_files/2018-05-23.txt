NUTA dismayed at Jaffna University students
The National University Teachers Association (NUTA) has written to Jaffna University Vice-Chancellor Prof. Ratnam Vigneswaran expressing their dismay and displeasure over involvement of students from the university at the Mullivaikkal Rememberance Day observances.
In a letter to Prof. Vigneswaran, Vice-Chancellor of the University, they observed that greedy politicians were pushing the misguided youth to another reckless programme. We feel that they are abandoning the golden opportunities presented to them. We do hope that you would take our letter seriously and discuss this matter with senior responsible academics in the University. Offer guidance to Jaffna University students and teach them reconciliation and harmony.
The association cites in their letter that the Jaffna University students were acting like unofficial private army of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran and transgressing the law of the country by commemorating members of a banned terrorist organization.
They add that people in the South hold intelligent youth of the northern province in high esteem however their recent behavior showed that they are being misguided by crafty racist politicians such as CV Vigneswaran. The letter which is signed by Secretary to the Association Prof Channa Jayasumana adds that these misguided youth should be thankful to the political leadership and Sri Lankan forces that ended the armed conflict and made it possible for them to reap the benefits of higher education freeing them from battlefront.

One thousand more troops ready for emergencies
Around 300 members of the Army, together with sailors and airmen, are currently engaged in flood relief emergencies in the worst-affected Galle, Kalutara, Matara, Ratnapura and Puttalam districts as of noon yesterday, the Army media unit said.
About 25 boats of the Army have already been sent to most-affected locations in Hiniduma, Palindanuwara, Kamburupitiya, Ratnapura and Puttalam where some of the public roads remain inundated and not motorable.
Another contingent of about 1,000 Army personnel, if needed, are on standby in flood-hit areas, in close contact with the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and the respective district and divisional secretariats for any emergency.
Army troops have also assisted the evacuation of flood-hit civilians in some areas at the request of DMC authorities and also supplied cooked meals.
Meanwhile, Naval troops have already moved into the disaster-prone areas in the hundreds, along with more than 25 rescue boats. Six-hundred-and-twenty sailors and 270 airmen in the meantime are on standby to serve any emergency situation, according to the Military Spokesman, Brigadier Sumith Atapattu.
In the Western Province, the 14 Divisions General Officer Commanding Major General Ralph Nugera, under the close supervision of 141 Brigade Commander Brigadier Prasanna Ranawaka, rushed a team of about 12 Army personnel of the 8 Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI) for protection of the Kelani river bund, close to the Pahuru Oya area in Malwana, since the water has reached spill level. Troops stacked sandbags and fortified the banks against leakage and sought to avert its split. Meanwhile, 111 Brigade troops of the 11 Division of the Security Force Headquarters - Central (SFHQ-Cen) assisted the evacuation of flood victims in the Nawalapitiya area to safer locations.
Troops serving the 2 Sri Lanka Rifle Corps (SLRC) under the close supervision of the 111 Brigade Commander Colonel Sanath Aluvihare evacuated those civilians who are largely exposed to danger of landslips in the Kithulkotei, Jayasundaragama and Labuvalikotuwa areas in Nawalapitiya to Central College Nawalapitiya, Jayasundarama Islamic Cultural Centre and the Mosque at Labuvelkotuwa.
Similarly, the families residing in the Solankanda area were also moved into temporary locations, such as the Solankanda Christ Church, etc.

Sri Lanka  Singapore Free-Trade Agreement
Unlinked individuals restricted from independent movements
Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama yesterday said that there was no liberalisation of independent movements of any persons not linked to investments under the Sri Lanka and Singapore Free Trade Agreement.
He said the Agreement was endorsed by the Cabinet and Attorney-General prior to inking it. He also agreed to table a copy of it in Parliament, adding that it is freely available in the website for anybody to peruse. The ministers speech was aimed at debunking the misinformation related to the freshly-signed Free-trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore.
With regard to trading services, certain professional associations have expressed their concerns regarding the influx of professionals and other workers into the country. The movement of natural persons from Singapore has not been opened up under the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, except for intra-corporate transferees in very senior management and business visitors linked to investments, he said.
He added that corporate transferees were individuals from a branch of a Singaporean company with an investment in Sri Lanka and are also limited to managers, executives and specialists.
Business visitors will be permitted for a period of not more than 30 days for purposes such as market-scoping, business agreements and so on. Corporate transferees period of stay is also initially, limited up to two years. No movement of persons either Singapore citizens or permanent residents, have been opened in professional services, Minister Samarawickrama said.
Even permanent resident holders arriving in Sri Lanka are limited and their entry would be tied to a corresponding investment in Sri Lanka, he said while responding to claims that the agreement would lead to millions of non-Singaporean citizens arriving in Sri Lanka.
These claims are untrue. The FTA does not permit any permanent resident to work in Sri Lanka. Even corporate transferees who arrive in Sri Lanka can only work for that particular Singaporean company which they are employed at, the minister said.
The concern that engineering and architectural services have been opened, is also incorrect. The only commitment is towards cross-border services, and that is only through the use of internet and is unrelated to the movement of people. This is taking place now and it is already possible through the existing regulations and administrative framework. That has also been limited to pre-designed advisory and consultative service, and does not include practice of architectural or engineering profession, he said.
Thus, establishing a company to provide these advisory services in the country or for the movement of natural persons to provide such services, have not been permitted under the agreement. It should be emphasized that Sri Lanka has not undertaken any liberalisation exceeding the prevailing investment regime, the minister added.
He said that if a person had dominant and effective nationality in a third country, such persons had also been excluded under the Agreement. Therefore, Singaporean companies cannot hire and send citizens of another country to work in Sri Lanka, he added.
The minister, pledging to keep trade chambers, trade associations and professional bodies informed on the negotiations of the FTAs, said that entering into FTAs with selected countries is a part of the governments new trade policy.
The aim of the policy is to achieve diversification of exports as well as export markets. All these are for the progress of our country. We have to change; we cannot go on the way we have been going on before. We need new markets, new products. We are not sacrificing our people; only helping them. Our country requires a knowledge-based economy. In addition to funds, we can get know-how through Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), he said.
The minister welcomed constructive dialogue with trade chambers and professional bodies, and invited them to point out if they found anything adverse in the Agreements.
We have a period of one year after which a review can take place, and if there is anything wrong in the agreement, we can make amendments, Minister Samarawickrama said.
The minister further said the Agreement had no effect on the governments revenue as import tariffs on petroleum and gold had not been removed under the FTA.
The trade liberalisation programme has been in consultation with the Finance Ministry. At present, imports from Singapore are valued at USD 1.293 billion, out of which USD 750 million was for petroleum products and USD 228 million was for gold. These tariffs had not been removed, he said, adding that the Agreement does not allow transshipment of goods.
Speaker names Chair Panel for Parliaments second session
The Chair Panel for the second session of the eighth Parliament, which comprises of the members to preside in the absence of the Speaker, was named by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament, yesterday.
The 11-member Chair Panel includes Parliamentarians Piyankara Jayaratne, Lucky Jayawardena, Bimal Rathnayake, Edward Gunasekara, J. M. Ananda Kumarasiri, K. Thureiratnasingham, Shehan Semasinghe, Kanaka Herath, Velu Kumar, Mujibur Rahuman, and Dr. Thusitha Wijemanne.
Group of 16s concernfor public, a pretence- Dr. Jayatissa
No member of the Joint Opposition and the SLFP Group of 16, who insisted on having an urgent debate on the disaster situation and the fuel price hike, was present in Parliament when the debate was facilitated, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.
Seconding the adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Nihal Galappatti on the inconveniences faced by the public due to the sudden fuel price hike, Dr. Jayatissa questioned the absence of the JO and SLFP members in the Opposition for the debate.
Earlier, the JO together with the SLFP faction of 16, made a din in the House requesting to postpone the two Gazettes scheduled for debate in order to discuss the flood situation and the fuel price hike. The Speaker agreed to cut short the days business and facilitate a three-hour adjournment debate for the purpose at 4pm, he said.
However, MP Dinesh Gunawardena opposed it, stating that the JO wished to call for a division on the two Gazettes, and that their MPs would only arrive at 6.30 p.m. for the vote. The debate ended at 6.30 p.m. and no division was called. None in their group was present in the House even to speak a single word regarding either matter, Dr. Jayatissa added.
This gives us the impression that they were shedding crocodile tears on the inconveniences faced by the public when Parliament proceedings were shown live on TV. People must understand that their acting in front of TV cameras does not reflect the nature of their politics, he said.
JO MPs, together with the SLFP Group of 16, agitated in the House at the commencement of the meeting, demanding to take up an urgent debate on the disaster situation and the fuel price hike. However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya turned down the demand, saying that an adjournment debate on the fuel price would be moved by the JVP and that concerns on the flood situation could be raised during the debate on regulations under the Environment Act to be taken up today. Later, the JVP proposed that the concerns on the floods could also be aired during the same debate, and it was agreed by both the government and the Speaker.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, joining the argument, said all members must abide by the Speakers ruling and that if anybody wanted to challenge it, a separate substative motion should be presented. If you cannot accept the Speakers ruling, we can appoint a committee to look into that, he said.
The Speaker, in a heated exchange of words with MP Gunawardena, said that not only them (the JO), but that he too understood the problems faced by the people.
Politicians agendas changewith positions: Handunnetti
Sri Lankan politicians had obtained the largest amount of commissions from strategic development projects, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunnetti said, yesterday.
Politicians, as they change their positions from the Opposition to government and back, conveniently change their attitude towards strategic development projects, MP Handunnetti pointed out.
It is how they bend the law, he said, adding that that was how the innocent fall prey to traps.
He was addressing a debate on the amendments to the Strategic Development Project Act.
Handunnetti questioned whether the debates on the said development projects by both parties were merely done for the sake of arguing.
When the previous government brought in this Strategic Development Project Act, we, together with the United National Party (UNP), argued against it. At present, the UNP is forwarding the same act again. When the Act was initially taken up, we said the pro-act politicians were obtaining commissions and that it would destroy the country, MP Handunnetti added.
Handunnetti alleged that there had been no proper discussions between professionals and the government on the Singapore trade agreement. He urged Minister Malik Samarawickreme to hold discussions with professionals who had raised concerns over the agreement.
Mimister Samarawickreme in reply, said that the government had already held several rounds of discussions over the matter and agreed to schedule another series of meetings over the course of the following week.
Suwaseriya Foundation, Land Amendment Bills presented at Parliament
The government yesterday in Parliament, presented the 1990 Suwaseriya Foundation Bill and Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Amendment Bill.
The bills were presented for the first reading by Government Whip Gayantha Karunatileka.
The establishment of the Suwaseriya Foundation is to provide pre-hospital care ambulance services and emergency response services free-of-charge to any person. It also provides immediate and effective pre-hospital care free-of-charge in a safe and clinical working environment until a person reaches the nearest healthcare provider.
The bill to amend the Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Act is to relax the hitherto prevailed restriction on the sale of a condominium parcel situated on or above the fourth floor to foreigners, provided that the entire value shall be paid upfront through an inward foreign remittance, prior to the execution of the relevant deed of transfer.
MP Ramanathanproposed forDeputy Speaker post

The name of United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) National List Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan had been proposed for the Deputy Speaker post at the Party Leaders meeting in Parliament, yesterday.
The proposal was made by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) group in Parliament. They had told party leaders that they sought the permission of their party leader President Maithripala regarding the matter.
However, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran had reportedly opposed the nomination. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had chaired the party leaders meeting.
The government backbenchers recently argued that the post of Deputy Speaker had fallen vacant with the crossover of MP Thilanga Sumathipala to the Opposition along with 15 other members. They added that the 16 dissident MPs crossed over to the Opposition after submitting a letter which stated that they would resign from their posts.
As per the agreement between the two main parties of the national government, the post of deputy speaker should be given to an MP from the SLFP.

Petroleum Minister calls for new refinery system
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga yesterday stated that country could save US$ 400450 million per year through a new and more efficient oil refinery system.
No one has developed the refineries, the minister said. We will be able to save between US$ 400450 million dollars annually if there is a new refinery system.
A new refinery system will cost around US$ 2 or 3 billion.
We can cover the cost in six or seven years. I personally feel that the government should give priority to the refinery system, not only to expressways. Ranatunga went on to say that the best solution to manipulate the fuel prices was to establish a new refinery system.
He said his personal view is that investing in a new refinery system is better than establishing expressways.
He was speaking at the re-launch of Petroleum Resources Development Ministry website at the ministry premises in Dematagoda yesterday. Several dignitaries including Secretary to the Ministry Upali Marasinghe, Additional Secretary Hettiarachchi and Samantha Fernando graced the occasion.
Marasinghe said that they took initial steps to update the ministry website in keeping with the governments principal of the right to information. He further stated that they expect to update the website as a strategic measure in the development of the petroleum industry.

Power of equality
Head Girl of St. Lawrence Convent Sheneli Peiris has a pioneering spirit. She is also highly adventurous. Perfect Prefects features Peiris who is destined for great feats.
With advancements in technology, this era demands that the youth be futuristic. We live in an era where technology enables us to achieve dreams and goals that may have seemed impossible in the past. Peiris is ambitious and has the facilities to make her dreams come true.
My life ambition is to be an astronaut or an author. I love reading and I come from a religious family. There are so many things hidden in the Universe. I want to discover them. I feel I can achieve my dream of travelling into outer space and becoming the first Sri Lankan to do so. Even if you take human nature, there is so much hidden. I want to be a pioneer unravelling the mysteries of life, said Peiris.
Human nature
Peiris, however, has another option if her ambition of being an astronaut does not work out. She is very interested in books namely those written by Enid Blyton.
If my ambition of being an astronaut does not work out, I would like to be an author of books concerning human nature. I want to discover new things, and influence people to do the correct thing and follow the correct path by my writing. One day I can become a role model to others. I want to write for teenagers and maybe one day become the Enid Blyton of Sri Lanka. Enid Blyton wrote about 1500 words per day. I love the books she wrote  Secret Seven, Famous Five and Malory Towers. All the books are about school children and their adventures, pointed out Peiris.
Peiris has been at St. Lawrence Convent since Montessori and says that her school has had a significant influence on her life.
I want to thank my teachers and fellow students who are like sisters to me. They are like my second family. I feel no difference between my family at home and my family at school. We all support and motivate each other. Our school is all about relationships and no one can separate and divide us, said Peiris.
Peiris pointed out, that her school looks at her as someone who admirably shoulders her responsibilities.
I was the Deputy Games Captain in the primary school, and in Grade 10 I was Secretary of the Sinhala Literary Association. I was the Junior Western Band Leader and last year I was the Senior Western Band Leader. I feel now I am under close scrutiny being the head girl, said Peiris.
Equal treatment
For Peiris, it has been a long journey. She knows almost everyone in her school which has helped her build relationships.
I feel that one problem in society is that people are not treated equally. I believe in equality. And when I say that, I mean that they should be treated equally regardless of their skin colour or ethnicity. Maybe as a writer, I could promote equality. War creates such suffering. Children get affected the most. In my schools, there are so many children from different backgrounds. But we are one family. We learn together and we are in the same classes. If we are united, why cant the rest of the world be united Living together is the most important thing in the world, explained Peiris.
For her O/Ls, she got 8 As and 1B for science. So she chose to do Commerce for her A/Ls. She also says that her parents have given her the freedom to do whatever she wants to do. Perhaps for her second shy, she can pursue Science if she wants to.
Next year I will be completing my music exams and take my degree. Maybe as a part-time job, I can be a musician or I can focus on writing books. If I do my A/Ls well, maybe I can be an accountant. There are so many different paths I can choose. It is my life, stated Peiris.
Bronze medal
Peiris started music when she was in Grade 2. She can play several musical instruments including the piano.
In the primary and junior bands, she played the Melodica. I was the band leader in the Junior Band last year. I joined the Senior Band in 2012. I was the first student to bring a medal to the school by playing the Piano. I received a bronze medal from Festival of Performing Arts. After that, I got silver and gold. I can play the saxophone and trumpet. When it comes to Piano Exams, now I am doing Grade 7 and next year I will do Grade 8. Then the stages are completed, added Peiris.
Peiris message to anyone is not to give up. She says if you fail once you should try again. If you fail twice you should try harder.
When it comes to events in history what is most memorable to her is 2009, when we won the Civil War. Her father is a retired army officer.
When I see my fathers fellow officers from the army without legs, hands and so many injuries I can understand the gravity of it all and the terrible price they have paid. I have seen tears in their eyes. When you see such things, you hope that something like that will never happen again, explained Peiris.
Human telepathy
What the youth can achieve today was unimaginable in the past. The possibilities are endless in this day and age if you have the willpower and talent. Peiris says that new discoveries from NASA interest her.
When we were in the Stone Age, they never envisioned cell phones or computers. It is quite possible that voyages in space will become a reality. Telepathy between humans could be the norm making these voyages a reality, said Peiris.
Peiris also pointed out her school is a leading Catholic Girls School in the heart of Colombo and that the Principal helps the girls in everything they do and is the reason that they have achieved great heights in guiding and basketball. Guiding was started in 1954 and the school have produced many President Guides. Also in Basketball, they have become champions on many occasions during the past few years. This year itself they came fourth place in Nationals and Champions at the Zonal Level. Peiris is supported by her Deputy Head Prefect Rachel De Silva.

Ravin Wickramaratne defends himself against match fixing
A single official cannot be involved in match fixing and there is a well planned move going on to destroy my reputation using the Panadura SC vs Kalutara PCC match as an issue, said Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) assistant secretary Ravin Wickramaratne at a media briefing held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
Wickramaratne, a former Panadura SC fast bowler, captain and president and presently a cricket administrator has been accused of playing a key role in fixing the Panadura SC v Kalutara PCC division I Premier cricket match played last season to enable his club gain promotion to Tier A.
Defending his reputation Wickramaratne said, Is there any possibility of one single officer trying to fix a match without the support of the players on the field According to the Ministry of Sports recommendations only officials should be punished not the players.
However 30 players cum officials were involved in the match so why blame only me
Speaking further Wickramaratne said, I want to clarify a few matters. I never watched this match although the Ministry report into the incident mentions my name. I was not even called and asked to make any statement or for my side of the story by anyone. I have requested the SLC ExCo committee to conduct a detailed investigation regarding this matter and I will write to the Sports Minister as well.
Wickramaratne stated that he was president of Panadura SC for 10 years and left the presidency in 2015. Since then I have not been involved with Panadura Sports Club and I am not holding any positions. These incidents reveal a well planned move to destroy my reputation.
The scandal which took place in January 2017 shook the very foundations of Sri Lanka cricket but one and a half years has passed and no punishment has been handed out to the perpetrators.

## Title: Rekindling the Government Film Unit
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Rekindling the Government Film Unit
Beginning on June 3, Sri Lankan state television, along with the Government Film Unit (GFU), will launch a series of documentaries on issues of human rights and democracy in Sri Lanka. The 30-minute episodes will feature stories about topics like the Right to Information and enforced disappearances.
Director General of Government Information Sudarshana Gunawardhana sat down with the Daily News last week to discuss the upcoming series.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Can you tell me a little about this new documentary series
A: So we are the Government Information Department. Basically my position is to ensure I am the propagator for the government. But I dont have any platform to do it. Therefore, I have to work with the existing newspapers, TV stations, radio, and other channels.
Traditionally, we have been sending out press releases, or conducting press conferences, or organizing visits for journalists. But at the same time, we used to have a very vibrant unit called the Government Film Unit. We still have it, but it has lost its glory. In those days, we were the only people who could capture stuff visually. But with the advent of television, our significance has decreased. We have become part of history.
So we decided to revive our Government Film Unit, which has a strong tradition, and we decided to work with television stations and, for that matter, radio and other platforms also. We realized that nowadays broadcasting is not about the channel, but about the platform. If you produce good content, you can find different platforms to show it. You develop quality stuff, and you can use multiple platforms. You can use traditional broadcasting, or you can use satellite, cable, IP TV, YouTube or Netflix. People can receive content in so many ways, on their iPads or phones or TVs.
So we thought we should start developing content, focusing on multiple platforms. The main feature of the 2015 change, which can be called a revolution, was that the focus was on democracy, human rights, and reconciliation. The government has done a lot on these issues. But unfortunately, the government has failed to communicate and create discussion about them.
Theres a discussion about the lack of democracy, but the gains are not in the discussion. So as a government propagator, I recognize that it is incumbent on me to find, with my team, some way of broadcasting these gains. Especially, because our victories are numerous. But those are intangible. So how best do we capture these intangible differences, and how best can we link these intangibles to tangibles
Therefore, we thought that maybe the democratic gains should be discussed through artistic forms. Thats how we came up with this idea of producing a series of docu-dramas.
Q: What do you mean by docu-drama
A: Docu-drama is a genre that merged traditional documentaries and dramas. Not much work has been done in Sri Lanka in this regard. At the moment, the most popular medium, if you take television, is the teledrama. The importance of documentaries has gone down. So if one could merge these two genres in a successful manner and build a story, such as a story on the democratic gains of the government, we felt we could address the gap we have in our communication in this way. We signed an agreement with Rupavahini Corporation, the state broadcaster, and they agreed to give us time slots free of charge. We fund the production of 10 episodes, 10 different stories. Seven are produced by Rupavahini, with our financial assistance, and three are produced by the Government Film Unit.
Q: What are the subjects that you are exploring
A: We were looking at the issues, and we decided we would work with the present producers who have stature in the field, but we wanted them to focus on topics like the Right to Information, and the independence of the judiciary, and the National Human Rights Commission, or issues such as disappearances, and events such as the Rathupaswala shooting, the shooting of protestors by the previous government.
So we advised them to explore and develop a concept and a script, and produce it. We also met with various experts in the field to help the producers and work as advisors to the production teams.
Q: How far along is the production process
A: The production process is almost over. We had to delay it because of the local elections. We will have a premier show here at the department at the end of this month, and then our plan is to start showing them to the public in June.
Q: How are you handling the language issue Will versions of the documentaries be screened in all three languages
A: Thats a challenge. In Sri Lanka, whatever we do, we have this language issue. Because Sinhala and Tamil usually dont complement each other. So the idea is to use subtitles and dubbing.
Because the productions are in Sinhala, they have to be dubbed. But we will have a series of Tamil productions also, and that will be dubbed in Sinhala. And each one will be subtitled in English.
One big problem in Sri Lankan television is that all the stations are Sinhalized, except for a couple of Tamil stations. When it comes to broadcast, we have only three Tamil channels, two state and one private. All the rest are Sinhala channels, and except for one or two, they are completely run in Sinhala. We forget the fact that 25 percent of the population are non-Sinhala speakers. And if foreign tourists want to know whats happening in Sri Lanka, theres no channel. So the idea is that maybe in the process, we can produce some content in English. But thats in the future.
Q: With issues like enforced disappearances, the producers must be interacting with people who have suffered tragedies and are quite angry not just with the former government, but with the current one, too. As a state-sponsored documentary, how can you be objective and deal with critical angles
A: It has been a difficult issue, not just because of state sponsorship, but because we are a government with an agenda of reconciliation, and we have accepted publicly that there are allegations about violations of international human rights law during the last phase of the war. Not only the last phase of the war, but throughout. And we agreed as a government to conduct a domestic independent investigation. We also agreed to establish independent reconciliation mechanisms, which were devised locally after a massive consultation process not only with the victims and survivors, but also the general public, by way of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms. So various things are happening, especially regarding disappearances.
For the first time in history, the Office of Missing Persons Act, which was long overdue, was brought in and adopted. And the office was instituted and appointments were made by the independent Constitutional Council. The last budget has allocated a considerable amount of money for the issue of addressing disappearances. Also, to prevent any future occurrences, the government has ratified the International Convention for the Protection of all People from Enforced Disappearance.
All these things are happening, and we wanted to portray them. But we see at the same time theres still unrest, still protests, still people who suffer and feel that justice has not been served. So we have to keep a balance. A problem we have is that we dont have people who understand the nuanced nature of this issue. Because the people who work in the state sector have been trained to see any human rights issue as something against the government, against the country, and against the nation.
They see them as not genuine concerns, but funded and aided and abetted by international agents, or the so-called diaspora. So the problem lies in getting people in the state sector to see differently. Im not saying this is the best production were going to have, its just a first step, but in the process, people will be inspired and come up with new ideas. We want to invite filmmakers to pitch their ideas so that we can also support independent productions. So I consider this to be a first step that is long overdue.
We hope that the series will generate a lot of public discussion, because when you do this kind of work, you will be criticized by at least three quarters of the people. One is the Sinhala majority, who were running the last regime, and who are still controlling public opinion. They would attack this, saying its a betrayal. Then, from the victims point of view, it might be too mild and an attempt to whitewash government actions. The third would be people who see this as a political move, who say, OK, now the department is trying to get into politics. Because when you talk about past abuses, you have to pinpoint, and when you talk about impunity, you have to talk about people who were not apprehended. And that could be seen as a political vendetta. So we have to be prepared for attacks from three fronts.
And a huge challenge will also be to win the audience over. In this competitive television business, its always a challenge to make sure your programme is watched by a considerable number of people. Thats why I want to put this on multiple platforms, like YouTube.
Q: How can people watch, and what will the first episode be
A: It will run on Sundays, from 7:30 pm to 8 pm, on national television, from June 3. And we will have repeat telecasts, and upload it on our GFU YouTube channel, soon after the first screening.
The first episode will be on the Right to Information. Its a true story, where a particular village in the Eastern Province was deprived of their postal services, because the postmen did not want to go into that village. There was a checkpoint and the postmen would normally just deliver the letters to the checkpoint, and people had to walk there and get their mail. Their appeals to the authorities failed to get any response. And then a villager, after consulting others, filed a Right to Information application. As a result, the postal authorities ordered their postmen to go and distribute mail to that village. Its a success story. Through that true story, we thought we could create awareness, and show some gains. It may look intangible, but for these peoples lives its very tangible.

Request to stop cigarette sale on May 31
National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon requests all Sri Lankans to refrain from selling and using tobacco on May 31.
Addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday, he said the World No Tobacco Day falls on May 31 every year and this year, all Sri Lankans are being requested to refrain from selling cigarettes and smoking cigarettes on this day.
Cabinet approval has been received to ban selling cigarettes within a 100-metre radius of a school and introduce plain packaging with the pictorial warning. Cabinet approval will be received within the next few weeks to ban the sale of single cigarettes, he said.
At present, only 10 or 12 percent of the population smoke in Sri Lanka and if the country can reduce this percentage to below 10 percent, it would not be a public health issue any longer. Then it would be a significant achievement for the country, he added.

Residents urge government to repair dilapidated roads
Wahalkada residents urged the government to resurface roads dilapidated as a result of heavy vehicles transporting sand. Accordingly, they had submitted complaints to President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake, the Anuradhapura District Coordinating Committee, and Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka regarding the issue.
Furthermore, residents had requested authorities to address the issues associated with the pits present at the Yan Oya reservoir sand deposit site, which had been left unattended by sand-mining contractors.
It could to estimated that a minimum of 600,000 cubes of sand excavated from the said site had been transported during a year. Hence, the roads in the area had been damaged due to the continuous travelling of heavy vehicles.
The main roads running from Wagollakada, Wahalkada to Horowpothana and Kebithigollewa, among other byroads, are currently dilapidated, making it impossible even for pedestrians to travel.
They further said that although agencies such as the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB), Irrigation Department, Forest Conservation Departments and the Provincial Road Development Authority (PRDA) had earned large incomes through the issuance of licenses and permits, the said funds had not been spent for the development of the area.
"We appealed to the government to establish funds in order to attend to the prevailing issues in the Wahalkada division that had been a result of the Yan Oya reservoir construction and the sand deposit projects. The PRDA had earned around Rs.100 million through taxes on sand-loaded tippers," they said.
PRDA officials informed the Anuradhapura Government Agent that it had been decided to increase the present lorry tax by Rs. 900 per tipper, totalling an amount of Rs. 1,500 per vehicle.
Further, it was also revealed that the PRDA had explored the possibility of obtaining writs for sand transportation along roads within the Yan Oya sand deposit proximity.

## Title: Several World Cup arenas risk becoming white elephants

Several World Cup arenas risk becoming white elephants
VOLGOGRAD, Russia: Russia looks set to pack fans into the stadiums for the World Cup. But what happens then
Several of the 12 stadiums look set to remain largely empty after the teams have left Russia and the tournament is over.
It's a problem both for Russia  whose $10.8 billion World Cup price tag could be inflated by loss-making arenas  and for FIFA, which has a history of leaving host nations lumbered with under-used stadiums, so-called white elephants.
Club team Rotor Volgograd will occupy a new 45,000-seat World Cup stadium despite averaging home crowds of just 3,800 this season, while Baltika Kaliningrad will inherit a 35,000-seat arena with average crowds of 6,100. Sochi has a 48,000-seat stadium but no professional team.
Older fans in Volgograd remember Rotor knocking Manchester United out of the UEFA Cup in 1995, but the club last played top-flight football in 2004 and has longstanding financial problems. It's facing relegation to the Second Division South  Russia's lowest professional level.
Fans say that if Rotor is to rise again it'll need government money to maintain the stadium and sign star players.
"When we played against Manchester and Nantes, I was at those games and it's something you can't express, those golden times," longtime supporter Nikolai Seleznyov said.
Rotor could pack arenas "if there's success for the team," he added. "It all depends on the authorities here in Volgograd, and whether they help. If they don't, it can't work."
Volgograd mayor Andrei Kosolapov is hunting for a sponsor for Rotor. In Russian soccer, that often means the regional government, or else a state-owned company prepared to tolerate heavy losses. Russian billionaires typically prefer investing in glamorous foreign clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal or Monaco. "I hope that we'll resolve some issues with investors in the near future," Kosolapov said last week.
Russians are keen to see World Cup games and lead the world on ticket sales. But few go to see local clubs play.
In a country of 144 million people, the average Russian Premier League attendance this season rose to 13,971, the highest in two decades but still far below Europe's top leagues. The second tier averaged just 2,552. World Cup organizers hope new stadiums will attract fans turned off by old, crumbling facilities. "Test games" at the new stadiums had large crowds, though spectators were often let in for free.
"A new stadium instantly attracts more people to watch football," World Cup organizing committee CEO Alexei Sorokin told the AP last month, but admitted the government may have to subsidize under-used arenas.
"It could be at first, and there is nothing wrong with that, that the federal budget will help stabilize the operating situation of the stadium," he said. "I think when the situation rolls on, they will be well on their feet."
Various World Cup stadiums will cost between 200 million and 400 million rubles ($3.2 million to $6.4 million) a year each in maintenance, regional officials have estimated.
The new-stadium buzz may not last forever. Rubin Kazan saw attendances soar when it moved into the 45,000-seat Kazan Arena, a World Cup stadium, in 2014. However, they've since dropped back and this season the stadium was on average more than three-quarters empty.
That mirrors the situation in Poland, host of the 2012 European Championship, where middle-class fans initially flocked to new stadiums but were turned off by low-quality club games, argues Simon Chadwick, who is professor of sports enterprise at England's Salford University.
"In Poland, what seem to have happened is it's tailed off," said Chadwick, who has taught in Russia. "There's this misalignment between the hopes of domestic football authorities and the realities of what it means to be a football fan in somewhere like Poland and Russia. That can include anything from the weather ... right through to the quality of the football. In Russia, one or two teams aside, the quality of the football is not great."
South Africa and Brazil are still struggling to manage World Cup stadiums from 2010 and 2014.
Four cities in Brazil have under-used stadiums like the $550 million Mare Garrincha in Brasilia, which recently hosted a game for 400 spectators.
The Rio de Janeiro state government, administrators and local clubs are fighting over who should pay maintenance bills for the Maracana, which hosted the World Cup final in 2014. South Africa spent $1.1 billion on its 2010 World Cup venues, some of which are reportedly losing money. Faced with more white-elephant venues from Qatar's 2022 tournament, FIFA has praised the 2026 bid from the United States, Canada and Mexico for using existing, mostly well attended venues.
Some Russian cities are trying to adapt.
Stadiums in Saransk and Yekaterinburg have large temporary stands which will be removed after the tournament, reducing capacity and costs. The regional minister overseeing Saransk's preparations, Alexei Merkushkin, said Wednesday he hoped a gym and other commercial ventures would set up at the Mordovia Arena so it breaks even in "two, maximum three years". No tenants have signed up yet.
The stadium's post-World Cup capacity of 28,000 is large for a city of 300,000. It's also 11 times the average crowd in the Russian second tier, where Mordovia will play next season.
Almost all locals welcome Saransk's new roads built for the tournament but some see the stadium as a burden.
Merkushkin is "the minister for wasting Moscow's money," said Pavel, a Saransk resident who didn't give his surname because he didn't want to be identified criticizing the government.
After the World Cup, "who's going to watch all these backyard-level games"

The Shanthi Maargam and Courage, Compassion, Commitment Line organised a 73-day Padayatra to make people aware that they have someone to share their issues.
The awareness walk started on April 1 from Mount Lavinia and proceeded along the South Coast via Galle, Kataragama. Moneragala, Potuvil and reached the Batticaloa Gandhi Park after one month. On their way, they visited churches, schools, Samurdhi Banks, Peradeshiya Sabhas and police stations among others.
After Batticaloa, they visited Chenkalady, Kalkudha, Mankerny, Vakarai, Topoor, Foul Point, Trincomalee and Jaffna.
Councillor and Psychologist Nivendra Uduman initiated the programme in 2016 from Nuwara Eliya to Point Pedro and it took 44 days to reach its final destination. CCC Line Manager Counseling Assistant Ranil Thilakaratna and Psychology final year student Sara Nagoor assisted him.
We carry out this project for free and walk a long distance to minimise the cost. Every day about 10 people commit suicide in Sri Lanka. According to hospital sources, 100-160 people attempt suicide every day, a member said.

SMSPU to meet all religious leaders
The State Medical Students Parents Union {SMSPU} met several leading Buddhist Bhikkus and scheduled to meet all religious leaders.
But President Maithripala Sirisena, the Higher Education Minister and some other politicians have not given an opportunity for the union to meet them, State Medical Students Parents Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo on Monday.
He said the union informed Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera and Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera about the danger posed to the free education by the proposed Sir John Kotelawala Defence University Act (2017). This act violates human rights of Sri Lankans and militarises free education, he said.
The President may not be aware of the conspiracy in bringing in the new act. Prominent people who backed the SAITM are behind the issue. They try to get full advantage by bringing in the act. They tarnish the image of tri-forces while privatising the free education, he said.
We are against the private medical faculty to be opened inside the Batticaloa Campus. We do not need Muslim or Buddhist private medical faculties and fight against them.
We are against the Cabinet paper presented to recruit medical students with three simple passes to the medical faculty, he said.

Spectator transgression  bitter spoiler of champagne rugby
In full contact rugby, played at the level of intensity seen in present day schools rugby, the high run of adrenaline amongst those who battle it out in the middle is understandable. But what one cannot fathom is the moronic behaviour of senseless adults who let go of their emotions simply for not being able to satisfy their egoistic need of tasting victory, and ridiculously, at the cost of sweat, blood and effort of schoolboys, playing for the glory of the institutions they represent.
Last weekend we witnessed what most described as the best game of the current schools rugby season, thus far.
The game between Royal College, one of the two title contenders in this years league championship, and Wesley College a clear underdog who almost turned tables on the favourites, was an enthralling seventy-minute affair. Whilst 30 young lads gave the rugby loving public their monies worth, a section of the crowd was in no mood to surrender their egos to the efforts of those boys whose bodies were taking a beating in their quest for victory.
Latter part of the second half of this captivating rugby match saw a 15-minute stoppage. What was appalling to know was why the game was stopped. It is learnt that the Wesley College supporters threatened one of the touch judges. What on earth do these morons think of themselves, to feel capable of taking someones life for not assisting the officiating referee to make decisions that are to their liking! In that side of the pavilion where this incident took place, most of the Wesley supporters had jumped out of the pavilion onto the field, which was a recipe for disaster. Much to the dismay of all, organizers without getting them back behind the fences, placed Wesley prefects in front of these inebriated and adrenaline high adults. To be fair by referee Dinka Peiris, he had no option but to stop the game until he and his fellow officials and the players could be assured of their lives, and so he did.
Most who were witness to the gestures and expressions of the foreign coach of Wesley College thought they didnt help the situation either. Being a coach, one needs to be exemplary, and gesturing your own disenchantment in front of an agitated set of unruly supporters, could be nothing less than incitement.
Resumption of play after the adult psychopathic behavior saw Wesleyites smelling blood giving it their all and Royalists fighting back to save their reputation and to keep the unblemished record intact. At the end Reid Avenue boys felt a sigh of relief savoring victory with a wafer thin margin of a single point. The game ended and as often seen, there were the victor and the vanquished. The team that won in this instance was more relieved than in a mood to celebrate, and the vanquished surely held their heads high, but was no doubt disappointed that they lost a golden opportunity of creating what would have been the biggest upset of the season.
Match organizers and the handful of police officers on duty, anticipating some form of aggression from the boisterous Wesley supporters, escorted the referee and the rest of the match officials to safety. Whilst the two sets of players resigned to two far corners of the field for their warm downs, what transpired in front of the main pavilion at CR & FC grounds, right in front of the heads of the two schools, was horrifying.
A bunch of Wesley College supporters, led by an ex-Wesley first XV rugby player from the 2017 team and the CR & FC team, started mercilessly assaulting a Royalist, with plastic chairs, tables and whatever else they could lay their hands on. It was later found that the victim was Royals league championship title winning captain of 2017, Ovin Askey. Thereafter a section of Royal College supporters, as they usually do after every game, walked towards their much-loved team isolated in a corner of the grounds for their routine cheer, and quite predictably crossed paths with the agitated Wesleyites, and for a moment all hell broke loose.
In a country where club rugby is playing second fiddle to schools rugby, the adults who enjoy watching these kids play the game for the love of it and for the honor of their schools should make a conscious decision.
If their emotions cannot be controlled, they should decide to watch the game on TV in the comfort of their homes, or to get to the venue, enjoy the game and behave as responsible adults. More importantly in the future, the host schools will need to assess and provide adequate security and crowd control measures.
This is an area that the schools rugby authorities will have to introduce new regulations and guidelines that will ensure necessary measures and safeguards are in place for the safety of players, officials and spectators. It is a must, to further the game of rugby in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lankas progress towards  cloud is commendable  Oracle
The World Economic Forum in 2017 said to survive disruption and thrive in the digital era, incumbent business will need to rethink every element of their business and they need to act quickly to reap benefits.
As modern businesses and innovative IT technologies originate in the cloud, industry analysts predict that over 50% of all enterprise data will be managed in the cloud and 80% of application operations will be resolved autonomously, thanks to the significant improvements of cloud technologies.
In such context, Chandita Samaranayake, Head of Applications - Sri Lanka, Indochina and Maldives spoke with Daily News about the progress of Sri Lankas cloud journey and how far local organizations have come, helping Oracle to become an instrumental part in that whole journey.
Here are excerpts from his interview.
Q: The discussion about Sri Lankas migration to cloud has been a hot topic over the last three to five years. How do you view the progress of this journey so far
A: Five years back, we told that Sri Lanka needs to go out of the box, which meant the transformation to cloud. Two three years back, we saw a number of companies gradually migrating to cloud after realizing the potential cloud brings to businesses. A lot of things have changed today and we have seen a huge progress and interest towards cloud technologies.
When we look at the regional momentum for cloud, we are not far away from it. To be honest, Sri Lanka is one of the top countries to adapt cloud technologies in the ASEAN market. In that sense, the country has come a long way and Oracle has been able to create significant interest and awareness among local businesses about cloud.
The adoption of cloud and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) has been tremendous over the last five years. We have some big names on board with us now such as Virtusa, MAS Holdings, Aitken Spence, and Millennium Information Technologies etc. They are endorsing what Oracle has been preaching about cloud technologies. It has been an exciting journey and Oracle has the biggest cloud market share in Sri Lanka when compared to other major cloud vendors across globe.
Q: Five years back, you were preaching the importance of cloud platforms for local companies and there must have been a number of challenges in convincing Sri Lankan clients to come onboard. What have been some the key challenges and how did Oracle overcome them
A: I think what is happening globally as well as regionally is that think every company is trying to cut cost. I guess that was a turning point. Everybody wanted to keep their major costs at a very low point and move towards an OPEX (operational expenditure) model from a CAPEX (capital expenditure) model. This triggered us to build a case around the importance of having affordable cloud solutions. We discussed why companies need not to invest heavily on building sophisticated data centres and even investing on people. With that, we helped customers to understand and realize the importance of moving into an OPEX model, which is our cloud proposition that makes absolute business sense. It is not just about technology but also making a positive return on investment.
So we looked at not just one but five to ten year period and it actually made sense for a business. We also did not speak with IT personnel but with business owners as well. That was the difference. We started talking to the boards, we started talking to the decision makers and we started talking to the process owners. We listened to them closely and helped us to work within their given business framework, which aligned well with Oracles cloud strategy.
Today, in my personal opinion we have a lot of operational CIOs (Chief Information Officers). Their main job or mandate is just to keep the lights on; maintain systems. The trend I see today is that we are helping Sri Lankas IT economy to build strategic CIOs. With our solutions, we have taken the burden of managing the organizational IT system from them entirely and paved a path for them to build innovative solutions and business processes. This means that they are going to save a lot of time and spend a lot of time on strategic thinking.
Our different approach has brought business owners to the table as well since they understand the pain points of a business. We have given them an entry into the system, which makes our approach much easier with an organization. At the end of the day, we want to see that whatever we do will help them to better theirbottom line.
Q: With the local IT sector witnessing significant growth, what are your thoughts on Oracle as a key player in the local cloud market
A: It is an ongoing discussion. We have been able to build a great partner eco system in Sri Lanka with some of the biggest organizations in Sri Lanka. They are integral players of the business and digital transformation which is currently happening in Sri Lanka. Our cloud and SaaS solutions are driving these businesses forward to achieve their key business milestones. In that way, we are proud of the fact that Oracle is playing an important role in uplifting Sri Lankas IT sphere.
Q: When you look at Oracles SaaS platform, what are the opportunities that you see in Sri Lanka, given that Sri Lanka is gradually becoming one of the largest cloud markets in the region
A: With Oracle SaaS model, you do not have to go through what Singapore market or European markets went through. Customers dont have to go through a journey of a previous company and learn from the mistakes they have done. They can just go straight into the latest technologies. And that jump is easier with SaaS. It gives you that push to immediately take control of your business.
The affordability is also a key factor. Those days it was almost impossible for small and medium-sized companies to buy a cloud product from a global vendor like us. Today, we have a transformational platform; any organization can come on board with us. The same technology used in a big US company can be used by a small Sri Lankan boutique company, thanks to affordability. It enables you to do business much better and become a global player.
Q: What are some of the major cloud implementations happened in Sri Lanka over the last few years
A: MAS has come onboard with their entire HR process. There entire workforce is going to be on our cloud. So they believed in cloud, believed in scalable systems; it is one of the key things they have endorsed. They are the largest employer of the country, which is a symbolic win for Oracle in the SaaS market. We also have Virtusa, DFCC Bank, MIT and many other big names on board. We are constantly on chat with them to understand on how to leverage industry opportunities and overcome challenges.
Q: What is the contribution made by your partners namely assisting their customers to progress to cloud
A: Many of our partners have re-looked at their business model. All this time, they have been surviving on support services, maintaining a system once it is implemented. Today, they have changed their ways to be aligned with cloud strategies.
It is now about building APIs on PaaS solutions, building industry-specific solutions on top of cloud platforms, rather than managing a system. It is not a one-time effort for these organizations; it is a long-tailed approach to SaaS which adds greater value, domain expertise and innovative processes to the entire SaaS eco system. It is a different ball game for our partners today and it is great to see the excitement coming from their end as well, enabling their clients with latest solutions.
Q: What are Oracles plans in the pipeline for Sri Lanka and for companies who would like to join with the whole cloud journey
A: The momentum is already here for cloud and we are seeing how early adopter of the technology is thriving with great business results. We as a company want to make sure that every business, customer and organizationmay it be public or private in Sri Lanka gets an equal opportunity when it comes to adapting new technologies. We want to increase the awareness among people that Oracle brings greater affordability with our solutions.
Oracle also wants to bring innovation to Sri Lanka. Innovation is a key aspect and it is going to be crucial to succeed as a regional knowledge hub. Every year, we invest a huge sum of money on research and development; we want to bring those new technologies to Sri Lanka so that private and public organizations could elevate their businesses to compete with international markets.
We would take the burden of managing an IT system and leave ample space for companies to innovate further. That is Oracles vision for Sri Lanka. (SS)

Survival of Test cricket  Lanka and Windies have a role to play
After much rumblings about the tour being in danger of getting cancelled and the threat of the itinerary being pruned down to less than three Tests, Sri Lankas tour to the Caribbean after a lapse of ten years has somewhat survived the storm and thankfully will definitely go ahead as scheduled with no alterations to the itinerary.
Thus for the first time since the two teams began playing Test cricket in 1993 Sri Lanka will be involved in a three-Test series in the Caribbean. Sri Lankas past experience of Test tours to the West Indies have involved only a series of two Tests in 1997 and 2003 where they lost the series 1-0 on each occasion and in 2008 when they recorded their first-ever Test win in the Caribbean and drew the series one-all. Thus the current tour of the West Indies will be of historical value as they will be playing a three-Test series for the first time and furthermore will be looking to record their first-ever series win over there.
The reasons for a Test series between Sri Lanka and West Indies hardly attracting a world wide audience or filling the turnstiles at cricket venues is due to the absence of any superstars from either side whom people would pay money to go and watch.
Gone are the days when Sri Lanka was a force in world cricket when names such as Aravinda de Silva, Sanath Jayasuriya, Muthiah Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas, Arjuna Ranatunga, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara would attract a large audience to the grounds. These are iconic players who had stamped an indelible mark in cricket history. Cricket fans come to watch them play even in a five-day Test - that is the impact these cricketers had on the game. They were more or less game changers.
The present Sri Lanka team is still not established and following the retirements of greats like Muralitharan, Vaas, Jayasuriya, Jayawardene and Sangakkara have not quite produced an outstanding cricketer whom the fans can quite look up to and emulate as a role model. The team has an abundance of talent but there are no stand-out players like those mentioned to make heads turn and to admire. Maybe with time we could produce a few but until then we will struggle as a team to make an impact with cricket audiences.
In West Indies case the scenario is quite different. The inability of Cricket West Indies to have a control on their players has led to some of their glamour stars calling the shots and making themselves available for the national team only at their whim and fancy. Draw cards like Chris Gayle, Keiron Pollard, Dwayne Bravo and Andre Russell have all moved away from playing Test cricket for West Indies to concentrate on the shortest format Twenty20 around the world. By doing so they have weakened West Indies cricket to the extent that since the departure of iconic players like Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes, Gordon Greenidge, Clive Lloyd, Curtley Ambrose, Courtney Walsh and later Brian Lara, they have hardly regained those glory days of the sixties, seventies and early eighties. The advent of T20 cricket gave the cash strapped West Indies cricketers a leeway to make a fast buck with less effort on the field. For just three and a half hours or 40 overs of sweat they could earn twice or thrice as much money as they would playing Test cricket. Players in the caliber of Gayle, Russell and Co have been in big demand in T20 leagues across the world and draw cards because of their high success rate in this format.
Former Zimbabwe captain and coach and current coach of Kolkata Knight Riders in the ongoing IPL, Heath Streak put their success in T20 cricket down to boredom. Streak feels that the West Indies players are successful in T20 cricket because perhaps the 'powerful' Caribbeans get 'bored' playing Test cricket.
"Firstly, they enjoy it I think. They get bored by playing the long format of the game. A lot of them are playing all the leagues around the world if you look at guys like Andre and Sunil (Narine) from our team and others in the tournament like Pollard," Streak said.
"You are getting to a stage where guys are making a career solely out of playing T20 cricket.
They play in PSL (Pakistan), CPL (Caribbean), BBL (Big Bash), IPL. They've got physical attributes, the power. Guys like Pollard, Russell are physically strong even their mis-hits go over the boundary," Streak said.
The difference between the West Indies teams of the past and today is that the past greats had a point to prove to the white sahibs that they were as good if not better than them in the sport and they went all out to prove it. Under the leadership of Frank Worrell and Garry Sobers and later Clive Lloyd and his successor Viv Richards, West Indies were unconquerable with their quartet of legendary fast bowlers that dominated international cricket in the sixties, seventies and early eighties.
For Test cricket to survive countries like Sri Lanka and West Indies will have to do a balancing act with their international fixtures so that Test cricket is not outshone by the limited-over format for the sake of financial gains.

The idea was pioneered by Sam, a vegan food creatrix who recently posted pictures of her culinary creations for her 142k followers on Instagram (she also made the awesome galaxy donuts we featured recently). She made them by greasing a donut mould with coconut oil and adding cooled sushi rice before decorating the donut with black sesame, ginger, wasabi, cashew mayo and avocado.

US-Iran sanctions tussle shakes world economy
Even as the Special Prosecutor investigation of the US President enters its second year, the USs impending sanctions against Iran is provoking a global tussle between politico-economic titans that is already disrupting world markets and pushing up economic costs, especially among the host of smaller nations. Meanwhile the world community is grimly determined to attempt, yet again, to discipline Israel over its continued cruel treatment of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories  that is, if the US does not use its UN veto power to protect its protg, Israel.
And, Malaysias Mahathir Mohamed gracefully did the right thing by his one-time protg, Anwar Ibrahim, last week by releasing him from jail where he was serving sentences for conviction on dubious corruption and sexual misconduct charges. It was Mahathirs own government that had earlier imprisoned Ibrahim when the, then dynamic, young, UMNO stalwart criticised Mahathirs leadership and positioned himself as a liberal aspirant for Malaysias leadership.
Today, after he re-entered politics to unseat the increasingly corrupt and under-achieving Prime Minister Najib Razak, Mahathir, modern Malaysias longest serving and greatest leader, seems to have realised that his future best successor would be his one-time disgraced protg Ibrahim. Unlike many politicians, Mahathir has publicly acknowledged that he had been wrong to previously stymie Anwar Ibrahims bid for national leadership.
Ibrahim returns
Ibrahims wife is now Deputy Prime Minister, and Prime Minister Mahathir has promised to stay in office for only the next two years and then hand over the premiership to Ibrahim. It remains to be seen whether Mahathir will hold true to his promise of a limited tenure. Given Mahathirs record of political astuteness and seeming maturity, it is highly likely that this time table will be met. We must presume that the liberal-modernist Ibrahim, when taking the premiership, will then ensure that his wife and able political associate, Dr. Wan Azizah binti Wan Ismail, steps down from the deputy premiership so as to avoid nepotism.
New Deputy Premier Dr. Azizah has made history by becoming the first Malaysian woman to achieve this level of state office, the second highest executive position. Her own political stature rests on the success she has had on taking on the leadership of her husbands political protest movement while Ibrahim was on trial and in detention. She soon succeeded in founding the Peoples Justice Party which became the backbone of the liberal protest movement that finally led to the broad opposition coalition against former Premier Najibs failing government.
Her husband Ibrahim, remained the political icon of this movement, even after Mahathir joined the opposition coalition to lead it to electoral victory that ended the Barisan Nasional coalition which had monopolised Malaysian politics for over six decades.
Mahathir, himself, in his original career as the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) leader, spent the longest period in power as he sustained, quite autocratically, the monopoly of the UMNO-led Barisan Nasional coalition. Mahathir was well known for bending the rules of democracy to suppress opposition and rival politicians. He was also known for his Third Worldist, mildly Islamist nationalism that was useful in maintaining UMNOs ideological hold on the ethnic supremacist nationalism of Malaysias (Islamic) Malay community, the single largest ethnic group in this sprawling, upper-middle-income republic that straddles the minor seas and straits of South East Asia.
It is to be hoped that the liberal wave on which Mahathir has returned to power will be sustained in government in a manner that will boost ethnic Malay morale to a degree that will effectively reduce the growing influence of Islamist radicalism of the Daesh (Islamic State) type.
China
China is the one major power that may be disadvantaged by the return of Mahathir. Beijing seems to have made the same error it has made in many parts of the world in relying principally on very corrupt regimes that it could easily buy up in its bid to establish a major Chinese presence in those countries. The problem with relying largely on the power of bribery and kickbacks is that the projects that are initiated with such help are not as beneficial as they could be to the country concerned. In fact, as Sri Lanka, The Maldives and some African states have already found out, corruptly initiated projects have resulted in an extreme and unfair indebtedness to China.
It seems to have happened similarly in Beijings dealings with the previous regime in Kuala Lumpur. Now, the new government promises to re-negotiate all major deals with China it finds is unfairly expensive or not genuinely economical.
While Malaysia, itself, seems to be looking toward a brighter future, the rest of the world is watching with dismay as the re-launch of massive political and economic sanctions by the United States against Iran muddies the future of the global economy and weakens the global system as a whole.
Experts and think tanks across the world anticipate major economic instability once the new sanctions regime comes into operation from August onwards. This kind of international sanctions regime is ferociously imperial. When the US declares trade and other dealings with Iran are banned or suspended in all kinds of ways, the superpowers sanctions regime is enforced globally. This means that any other country or entity  a business firm or social charity or whatever  will also not be allowed by the US to carry out such banned dealings with Iran. Any such attempt results in automatic sanctions by the US against that country as well.
Of course only the world most powerful and richest country can actually hope to enforce such a globalised sanctions regime. At one time, the US was fully backed by much of the worlds powers in enforcing the original sanctions regime imposed by the Western bloc against Iran ostensibly to halt or slow down its quest for nuclear military capability.
That previous, well-coordinated, sanctions enforcement by the Western bloc, was possible because, at the time, China was not yet the world trading giant it now is, and Russia was only just beginning to reassert its geopolitical sway after the interlude of Soviet Communist collapse. Today, the rest of the world powers are staying firm with the Iran pact and have already begun their own coordination to try to ensure that the US sanctions do not succeed in undermining the Iran pact.
Iran sanctions
Sanctions will mean, for example, that  unless Washington grants a waiver - Sri Lanka may no longer buy oil cheaply from Iran, nor expand its tea exports to that once-lucrative market. Worse, current investments by Iran in development projects and business ventures will also face disruption if not complete termination.
Among the big powers, it is the European Union group that is most vulnerable since it is the US biggest economic partner in addition to being the principal geo-political ally of America. Last week, the EU quickly met to strategise and also began negotiations with Iran to examine ways that Iran could benefit from the provisions of the nuclear pact which are aimed at enabling Iran prosper from renewed ties with the global market and global investment and finance. On Thursday, the EU re-activated an old law that protected EU economies and businesses from US sanctions retaliation for doing business with Iran. However, given the EUs heavy dependence on the US, many analysts fear that Brussels may eventually buckle down to Washingtons pressure. Certainly, European corporates have already begun downscaling their dealings with Tehran rather than risk harm to their bigger scale and more lucrative business dealings with the US or with US corporates at a global level.
This will expose major Iranian economic sectors to dis-investment by Western governments and business. Unlike that first US-led sanctions regime, this time round, both Russia and China are on a stable footing and are waiting to step in to any space left by retreating western groups. If Frances Total oil group now withdraws from a new multi-billion-dollar oil and gas project in southern Iran, both Russian and Chinese firms are standing by replace it.
Nevertheless, all these are new uncertainties that are currently making world markets volatile as businesses and governments make hurried moves to offset immediate repercussions. Hence, the oil price rise and the anticipated cost rises in all industries and services that consume energy or use oil-based chemicals.
The economic benefits arising from the nuclear pact are crucial to Irans own commitment to implementing the nuclear pact. Iran agreed to the nuclear pact primarily due to the promise of immediate lifting of sanctions and the re-entry of Iran to the world market. If sanctions are successfully enforced globally by the US and this seriously harms Irans return to economic and social stability, then there is no incentive for Tehran to continue to observer the nuclear pact.

Referees Society refuses to assign officials :
Wesley College pays heavy price for hooliganism
The Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society (SLRRS) on Monday decided not to assign any referees for future matches involving Wesley College at any level of rugby.
The SLRSS said that their referee Dinka Peiris received threats from spectators after the second round inter-school league rugby match between Wesley and Royal played on Saturday at Longdon Place.
At the end of the match which Wesley lost by a point (17-18) a section of Wesley spectators behaved in an unruly manner setting upon last years Royal College league winning rugby captain Ovin Askey, who was present as an official of the Royal College team.
Earlier the match was stopped for about 15 minutes as referee Dinka Peiris wanted Wesley fans to step away from the fence during the second half. Nizam Jamaldeen, chairman of Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society (SLRRS) said. We have decided to temporarily suspend assigning referees for Wesley matches.
SLRRS has also decided not to assign referees for any of Zahira or Maliyadeva College rugby matches due to similar incidents which took place in Maradana and Kurunegala last week.
We have requested the Schools Rugby Association to take a firm decision because as the head of the Referees Association I am liable for the safety of referees, Jamaldeen said.

## Title: When facial expression fails
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Wednesday, May 23, 2018 - 01:00
When facial expression fails
Facial expressions in Indian classical dances are generally embodied in the concept of Nava Rasas. Nava Rasas are the important essence of Indian classical dances. They are not only found in Indian classical dances but also they are the most important and dominating factor in almost all the Indian classical dance forms, dramas and even in many of the Indian folk dances.
Most of the Indian dance forms interpret the meaning through beautiful hand gestures, Bhavas and Rasas. Normally, Bhava means inner emotional feelings in the Nirthya aspect of dance.
Classical Bharatha Natyam consists of three varieties of dance. They are Nirtha, Nirthya and Natya. Nirtha means the pure dance which consists of the Adavus, stands (Mandala positions), body positions, footwork, combined hand positions and hand gestures. Nirtha simply reveals the pure dance.
Story-oriented dance
Nirthya consists of expressions Bhava (emotional involvement) and essence or the substance of Bhava which is often referred to as Rasas. Natyam in dance means the story-oriented dance.
However, todays Bharatha Natyam has lost the essence of dance due to the absence of Rasas in the stage performances. If we analyze the reasons for the absence of Rasas in this classical dance form, the present mentality of students and teachers is responsible for the unfortunate situation.
Institutional methodology, syllabus-based curriculum and the craze for certificates are responsible for declining Rasas in todays Bharatha Natyam.
Earlier in the Gurukula method of imparting techniques and approach adopted by the traditional Nattuwanar gurus was totally different.
The traditional Nattuwanars were the outstanding gurus and mentors of dance.
Those days the traditional Nattuwanars took the classes with full dedication and devotion. They worked with students without considering time limits. Therefore, according to the ability, talents, interest and involvement, they spent the maximum time with students.
Even in a group class, the number of students was limited. Individual attention was paid to each student.
They tried to uplift the interest and involvement of the individual students. Hence, every aspect of the dance was taken into account and they taught perfectly.
Until the student mastered the selective aspect or piece, the guru would not move further. Hence, almost every nuance of dance was well trained, giving more attention to bring out the facial expressions. The gurus induced the students to bring out their inner feelings.
However, in todays Bharatha Natyam field the interest, involvement and the approach of students, teachers and the public are totally changed.
Most of the teachers do not understand the level of their students, interest, understanding power, IQ level and psychology.
Mechanical performances
It is the responsibility of teachers to induce the Nava Rasas in their performances. Todays Bharatha Natyam performances are very mechanical and the facial expressions (Nava Rasas) are almost absent.
Twenty to twenty-five years ago the attraction of Bharatha Natyam depended not only on the glittering costumes or jewellery but also on the interpretation of the songs through appropriate and meaningful facial expressions. Yesteryear dancers such as Abhinaya Queen Balasarswathi and Mylapore Gowriamal gained fame in the classical Bharatha Natyam due to their exceptional talents in the way of facial expressions (Bhava Rasas).
Now more attention in present Bharatha Natyam world is given to the pure Nirtha factor such as steps or adavus than that of Nirthya (Bhava and Rasas). In the present generation dance field, those who are using facial expressions are labelled as cinema type of dancers. It is a misinterpretation and misconception of the facial expression. Due to the long absence of facial Bhavas in the stage performances, most of the people feel using facial expressions is akin to cinema type of dance. This type of understanding in the present society is also one of the causes for the declining factor of Nava Rasas (nine emotional Rasas of facial expressions) in the dance field.
Nine planets
Bharatha Natyam is totally based on Hindu philosophy. In Hinduism, the word Nava plays an important role. Nava means nine in number. Navagrahas means nine planets; Nava Sakthi means nine-fold Sakthi of Goddess Durga, Navathaniya means nine different varieties of grains used for poojas.
Navarathiri means nine nights devoted to three different Sakthis. Navaratnam means nine precious stones in Tamil and Hinduism. Navamy in the Hindu calendar means the ninth day after the full moon day and the ninth day after the dark full moon day.
Similarly, in Bharatha Natyam Nava Rasas mean nine different feelings. Nava Rasas are Sringara Rasas (erotic sentiment), Hasya Rasas (laughter), Veera Rasas (heroic sentiment), Karuna Rasas (benevolence), Ruthra Rasas (anger), Bibacha Rasas (Odious sentiment), Bhayanaka Rasa (fearful sentiment), Atputha Rasa (astonishment sentiment) and Santha Rasa (peaceful sentiment).
Without the inner involvement, dance reveals the flower without the scent. The application of Nava Rasas in the performances is very much needed and such practices should not be discarded in any case.
Mostly to show or illustrate the Nava Rasas in Bharatha Natyam in the present era the Bharatha Natyam artistes only reveal the nine expressions through still photos not much in stage performances.

Who will we be without bees
The United Nations has declared June 18 as World Bees Day on the basis that bees and other pollinators such as butterflies, bats and hummingbirds are increasingly under threat from selfish human activities. An editorial in a daily newspaper has stated: Many people especially those not too concerned about the environmental issues and the vital need to maintain bio-diversity may be surprised that United Nations has declared this day on their calendar.
Some religions, especially Hinduism and Buddhism offer flowers at temples and Kovils with the expectation to gain merit to enter heaven or Nibbana. So do other religions to a lesser degree and at weddings. These are customs or rites brought down from generations to generations and have been done without any rational thinking.
I would wish to narrate my personal experience as a Buddhist. One early morning, as usual, I went to pluck flowers to be offered at the shrine room where a statue of the Buddha is placed. Nearing the flower plant which was in full bloom, I saw a beautiful butterfly sucking the nectar to satisfy its hunger, and also two bees hovering above for their food for the same purpose. As I got near, they flew away which made me sad for depriving these innocent creatures of satisfying their hunger.
Then I went to pluck a flower which was so beautiful in full bloom. Pausing for a moment, I thought, if I pluck this flower it will lose its fragrance in a few moments and deprive insects of their food. The flowers wither away preventing it to go through the process of producing a seed and a new plant of the same species. Am I committing a sin, a thought flashed through my mind Then looking at the serene, peaceful, benign statue of the Buddha, I remembered as to what he did to pay homage, gratitude and reverence to the tree which gave him shelter and shade at the time he attained Enlightenment.
According to Buddhist scriptures, the Blessed One gazed at the tree for a week. If that is the gratitude paid by the One to whom Buddhists offer flowers as gratitude for preaching the Dhamma why cannot the Buddhists follow the same, without this carnage
On further research, so to say, this practice had crept into Buddhism from Hinduism, as an Indian Buddhist monk Buddhagosa had come to Sri Lanka to read the Tripitaka, an epic, and translate it to Pali. In doing so, he may have included this rite of offering flowers in Buddhism as well. The other possible reason is that our ancient kings married Indian Princesses, built Kovils to please their queens and thus Hindu customs and religious rites entered Buddhism.
My purpose in writing is to check whether there is any possibility of convincing those who destroy nature, to stop this practice. It is rather a difficult task as religion is involved and we do not wish to break away from an age-old practice, but it must stop one day as we may lose some plants for not allowing to produce seeds to propagate and bees honey, a vital ingredient for medical treatment.

Workshop for Batticaloa councillors held
A workshop aimed at empowering Batticaloa municipal councillors and other staff, on managing finances and services to the public, was held at East lagoon Hotel in Sinna Uppodai, Batticaloa, recently.
The workshop was planned under the Sub-national Governance Programme (SNGP), which was organised by the Asia Foundation and funded by the Australian Foreign Affairs and Trade Department.
The event was presided over by Batticaloa Municipal Commissioner N. Manivannan, who said that the Asia Foundation had provided the necessary wherewithal for public access of local government services. In particular, they had provided the Batticaloa Municipality with the Electronic Citizen Report Card system (ECRC) which was implemented in 2015. The foundation enabled the computerization of revenue collection, established a tourist information centre and installed an electronic advertisement board at Gandhi Park.Sri Lanka has 341 local government bodies and their total annual income is Rs. 22 billion.
In the Eastern Province, there are 45 local government bodies of which the Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Kinniya, Kattankudy, and Akkaraipattu areas have greater potential for economic development compared to others, SNGP Project Director Dr. Gopal Thambikumar said.
Batticaloa Mayor T. Saravanapavan, Deputy Batticaloa Municipal Commissioner N. Thananjeyan, Asia Foundation Senior Technical Advisor S. Subakaran, Asia Foundation technical officers S. Jegatheesan and S. Subakaran were present.

Worlds smallest  home
Scientists have created the worlds smallest house - build on an area of 300 square micrometres - using a robotic system that can accurately assemble nanomaterials into tiny, desirable structures.
The microhouse construction, described in the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A, demonstrates how researchers can advance optical sensing technologies when they manipulate ion guns, electron beams and finely controlled robotic piloting.
Researchers from the Femto-ST Institute in France, assembled the new microrobotics system that pushes forward the frontiers of optical nanotechnologies. Combining several existing technologies, the micro-Robotex nanofactory builds microstructures in a large vacuum chamber and fixes components onto optical fibre tips with nanometre accuracy.
Until now, lab-on-fibre technologies had no robotic actuators for nanoassembly, so working at this scale inhibited engineers from building microstructures. This innovation allows miniaturised sensing elements to be installed on fibre tips so engineers can see and manipulate different components. With this advancement, optical fibres as thin as human hair can be inserted into inaccessible locations like jet engines and blood vessels to detect radiation levels or viral molecules.
For the first time we were able to realize patterning and assembly with less than 2 nanometres of accuracy, which is a very important result for the robotics and optical community, said Jean-Yves Rauch, from the Femto-ST Institute.
The researchers combined all the technological components for nanoassembly - a focused ion beam, a gas injection system and a tiny maneuverable robot - in a vacuum chamber, and installed a microscope to view the assembly process. We decided to build the microhouse on the fibre to show that we are able to realise these microsystem assemblies on top of an optical fibre with high accuracy, Rauch said.
Building a microhouse is like making a giant dice from a piece of paper, but nanoassembly requires more sophisticated tools. The focused ion beam is used like scissors to cut or score the silica membrane paper of the house.
Once the walls fold into position, a lower power setting is selected on the ion gun, and the gas injection system sticks the edges of the structure into place. The low-power ion beam and gas injection then gently sputters a tiled pattern on the roof, a detail that emphasises the accuracy and flexibility of the system.
In this process, the ion gun had to focus on an area only 300 micrometres by 300 micrometres to fire ions onto the fibre tip and silica membrane. Its very challenging to pilot the robot with high accuracy at this cross point between the two beams, Rauch said.
Using the Robotex system, the researchers are constructing functionalised microstructures to detect specific molecules by attaching their microstructures onto optical fibres. The nanorobotics team is hoping to push the limits of the technology further still, by constructing smaller structures and fixing these onto carbon nanotubes, only 20 nanometres to 100 nanometres in diameter.

BOC Nana Jaya Scholarships for A/L highflyers
Empowering Sri Lankan youth in pursuing their higher-education dreams, the Bank of Ceylon re-launches its scholarship Program for A/L highflyers as BOC Nana Jaya Scholarships to support them financially with an endowment offered monthly.
Education is the key to personal development that ultimately boosts the countrys potential to thrive socially and economically. With this very important task in mind, BOC formulated the Nana Jaya Scholarship awards to support deserving students in their higher education for a maximum time period possible. A total of Rs. 16.2 Million for 2016 and Rs. 16.3 Million for 2017 will be disbursed over 800 eligible students who have sat for A/L in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
In combination with the countrys Premier Youth savings account BOC 18 Plus, this initiative has adapted a similar platform to that which the Government has laid to encourage higher education through Mahapola scholarship programme. Students will be assisted by the Bank to cover up their additional expenses up to four years- for merit scholarships and up to three years- for regular scholarships. This will be credited to their 18+ SmartGen savings account as a monthly endowment to cover-up additional expenses that incur until they complete their higher-education. Students who have maintained Rs. 5,000/- in their 18 Plus account from January 1 till December 31 2016 and have got high Z-scores in the year 2016 are considered eligible to receive these scholarship awards on district basis.
Similarly for students who have passed 2017 A/L examination with high Z-scores, maintaining a Rs.10,000/- from January 1 2017 till December 31 2017 are considered eligible to receive the scholarship. Selection for both types of scholarships will be based on the Z-score received by the student irrespective of state or any other university entrance.
Application forms can be down loaded through www.boc.lk and a specimen application is available in newspapers. For further information you may contact your nearest BOC branch. Completed applications should be sent by registered post to Assistant General Manager, Marketing Division, Bank of Ceylon, 16th floor, Head Office, Bank of Ceylon Mawatha, Colombo 01.
Going forward from 2018, students who have sat for their A/L in the year 2018, can make themselves eligible to BOC Nana Jaya Scholarships by maintaining a minimum balance of Rs.10,000/- in their 18 Plus savings account for six months from August 1 2018 till January 31 2019.
Bringing the latest technology available in banking to add convenience, BOC opened a new phase of banking through digital transformation.

Broadening Colombo Plans reach, a priority
In a press briefing on Tuesday, newly-appointed Colombo Plan Secretary General Phan Kieu Thu addressed the public for the first time and laid out her agenda for the next four years.
The Colombo Plan has been here for a long time, but not everybody knows that, she said at an event held at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo.
Phan was formerly the Ambassador of Vietnam to Sri Lanka, serving in the position from 2014 to 2017. She was the youngest appointed female Ambassador of Vietnam in the countrys history.
The Colombo Plan is an organization of 27 countries, many from the former British Commonwealth. Its mission is to promote socioeconomic development in the Asia and Pacific regions.
Phan said that one of her priorities would be to bring more countries into the plan, especially in Central Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and grow the organisations budget.
Though the Colombo Plan was originally focused on infrastructure development, during recent years, it had directed its attention towards capacity-building.
Ambassador Phan said that she would like the Colombo Plan to focus on addiction treatment, gender and development, and environmental programmes.
Finally, Phan said she wanted to increase the visibility of the global plan through launching more community-based programmes, especially for Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lanka is the host country to the Colombo Plan, many had forgotten about it in recent years as its budget and footprint had shrunk, she said.
To that end, Phan said she would like to extend more short and long-term scholarship programmes to study in foreign countries to Sri Lankans.

The Pearl City under the Meth Sanda Sevana housing project, will be vested with the public today under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
A total of 722 houses will be handed over to the people who lived in the 87 Watte in Bloemendhal, 318 Watte in Madampitiya and those who lost their houses due to the Urban Development Authority (UDA) development projects.
The housing project will be vested with the public at a ceremony today at 3.30 pm. The investment by the UDA for this housing project is Rs. 2,888 million. The housing project consists of two 15 storeyed blocks and is located at Henamulla, Colombo 15.
This initiative has been undertaken under the Urban Revival Project Life instead of a house, with the aim of providing houses with modern facilities to low income families in the Colombo city in order to uplift their living standards. Accordingly, the UDA will commence this project to construct 50,000 houses under the directions of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
In 2016/17, the UDA successfully constructed 2,270 housing units at a cost of Rs. 9,080 million and vested them with the public. Further, all arrangements have been made to hand over another 8,903 housing units for 2018 and 2019. The investment for this project borne by the UDA is Rs, 44,515 million. An additional 9,904 housing units are currently under construction at a cost of Rs. 49,520 million.
The cost per two-bedroom unit including basic facilities and service amenities is around Rs. 4-5 million. As common amenities for the housing projects, lifts, community centres, pre-schools and streamlined garbage disposal management facilities will also be provided.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History :
#37 David Villa
During the summer of 2009 when Real Madrid broke the transfer record twice, former Spain coach Vicente del Bosque was asked who he would prefer in his lineup - Kaka or Ronaldo.
David Villa, was his terse response.
Its not easy to step into the boots of a legend such as Raul but that is exactly what David Villa did when he first broke into the Spanish national team. A veteran who has played and scored in three different editions of the FIFA World Cup, Villa eventually replaced Raul in the side just prior to an era of unprecedented success.
El Guaje (The Kid), as he was known since he used to play football with kids much older than him, did not have it easy growing up. Real Oviedo had rejected him because he was too small. A few years later, he tore them apart as a teenager finding his feet.
A serious injury in his childhood actually proved to be a blessing in disguise. A broken femur saw his leg in a plaster for weeks but it didnt stop him from having a kickabout with his father. It was how he perfected his touch on his weaker foot.
Once he became a star at Valencia, it was only a matter of time before he donned the shirt for La Furia Roja. And luckily for him, his rise coincided with Rauls decline.
Villas first World Cup was 2006 where he struck up a partnership with another young striker, Fernando Torres. The pair scored three goals each and Villa himself could have scored more had then-coach Luis Aragons not substituted him before the 60-minute mark.
It was what led him to improve his fitness so he could stay on the pitch longer. I make an effort to be ready, fit and alert in the last 15 minutes. That is when most goals are scored.
What made Villa a deadly assassin in the box was his intuitive ability to make the right runs - in behind the defence, diagonal runs, veering away to create space - he had it all.
Gifted with a sublime first touch and brilliant decision-making ability, Villa could easily shake off anyone marking him to get on the end of passes and score.
Scoring 59 international goals in 98 appearances is no joke. Spains leading goalscorer before him was Raul but he scored 44 in 102 games.
Most strikers have big egos; a necessity in players who score goals by the dozen. But Villa is still a team player who will pass if there is a better opportunity for his teammate to score.
If there is a one-two on offer, he will go for it because he really did have an eye for a pass. It is what made him the complete attacker.
2010 was easily his best World Cup. He scored 5 goals for Spain - a tournament-high, tied with Thomas Muller, Diego Forlan, and Wesley Sneijder. Although the Golden Boot went to Muller (because had more assists), Villa didnt care - he went home with the big one!
A brace against Honduras was standard but it was his goal against Chile that really lit a spark in the Spain squad. It was the final group game and, if results didnt go their way, they could have been eliminated because of their loss to Switzerland in the opening fixture.
Chile were no pushovers either. They also played an attractive brand of football and almost had Spain by the scruff of their necks early on. Right until Villa produced his moment of magic.
When goalkeeper Claudio Bravo came sprinting out of his box to prevent Torres from getting the ball, little did he know that his tackle would see the ball fall to Villa who took his shot first time from more than 40 yards out to curl it in with his weaker left foot.
Villa would then score against Portugal in a 1-0 win in the Round of 16 to end their Iberian neighbours hopes. He would also score in the quarter-final against Paraguay - again a 1-0 win. He would then keep Manuel Neuer busy on a set-piece in the semi-final so Carles Puyol could score the only goal in another 1-0 win against Germany.
All of Villas goals were crucial in Spain advancing to every round in that tournament. Most goalscorers in World Cups pad their numbers with goals against weaker opposition in predictable routs but Villas goals meant so much more.
Be it the Euros or the World Cup, Villa was one of La Rojas most important players in a squad overflowing with talent. So people did scratch their heads when he was benched in favour of Diego Costa for the 2014 edition - a player that did not suit really Spains style of play at the time.
By the time Villa got his opportunity, Spain were already out. He still managed to score against Australia in the final group game - his ninth goal in World Cups.
One would say it was his final goal for Spain but the veteran is yet to hang up his boots. In fact, he even made an appearance in a friendly match this season for Spain. Whether he really gets picked for the World Cup by coach Julen Lopetegui or not is debatable, but he did score the 400th goal of his career last week.
However, he will go down in history as one of Europes greatest strikers and a true Spanish legend. It is why he is on our list of 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk

AMAZING RECALL
Unknown to the rest of the world, maybe in Samaria, Nazareth, Judea, Galilee, Mt. Carmel, Bethlehem etc. where the Lord preached the Word of God I was later to learn, I lived with my peasant parents who tilled their land filled with corn, wheat barley etc. from the good earth. While my mother tended to the poultry, and the few dairy cows we had, father did the heavy work and together, they put bread and butter on our table. There was nothing we lacked in our simple lives. Between their loves, I spent a happy childhood filled with joy.
I seldom saw people except for the few who crossed across amongst our land to other pastures. They were the ones who reared sheep and cattle. Many a time these animals would stray across our land and was a pleasure for me to run chase them back to their folds much to the glee of their owners who had come to recognize me as the carefree girl in the meadows who loved to cuddle their straying lamb.
Through the meadows
Life was serene and beautiful as God had created which I was to learn later from my parents as I grew up. The wonder of nature fascinated me as I wandered through the meadows and woods and heard the birds sing their lilting songs on trees. When everything was quiet I sat under a spreading tree for hours on end and daydream. Waited until I heard my fathers call reverberating across the woods and knew it was mealtime.
One summer day I saw a shepherd leading his sheep. They were big in numbers I had never seen before collectively.
I guess as he led them he never saw me. I saw him regularly and with each journey, one hundred summers passed. Unaware, a miracle was unfolding before my eyes.
Amazing in his stride and gait,
Tall and striking the shepherds grace
The glow in his eyes greet the morn
After the dew has settled down
For you to gently tread upon.
And wait to see thy lovely face.
You walk the day,
When sun commences his rise.
How I adore your wondrous sight
Like the meek and mild flock
You lead on,
The gentle shepherd in my heart.
The summers slipped by to time immemorial. I did not know how old my parents were. They were simple folk who believed in God I never knew.
I jerked to reality and asked myself, Who is God my parents talked about with reverence. I had to find out. I yearned for the truth. I contemplated under a tree in solitude. I heard faint but magnificent voices rising from above. Maybe it was the answer but I was too dumb to realize that God was watching over me.
After two thousand summers, I waited to see his face with patience. I was stirred by the mystery.
Who was this shepherd
Then I saw him coming again. My heart was filled with new found joy. With excitement ran to meet him face to face.
He stopped and stretched his hand as the sheep parted and made way for me to come in contact with him.
The shepherd had been waiting for me. He had the most beautiful kind face.
Cold breeze
I stood motionless struck by his awesome smile. His eyes were pools of diamonds and felt its rays on me. For the first time, I had tears well in my eyes as they started dripping down my face. I wanted to touch and embrace him but knew I should not. By now I had come to realize this shepherd was not a mortal. I heard the same chanting voices from afar and knew he had to move on. I made room for his pathway as he moved. A cold breeze touched my face. I had fallen deeply in love with him.
He was my saviour, my creator, Lord Jesus Christ.
It had been another long day when I saw him lead his sheep for the last time. His figure became smaller and smaller into oblivion. There was an unusual calm. I stood watching him disappear as agony ripped my heart. Already I was yearning for him.
Living for 2018 years I found imagination to be a formative genre that slots the world as viewed to eternity. There is a tragedy of going back to seek the truth. I find the summer of 2018 scattered with remnants of war that saw his sheep dying all over the world, especially in the Middle East, tossing on high seas with their loved ones lost.
The ravage of war has reduced the beautiful earth to an inferno much to the anguish of Jesus who redeemed it from sin. Air crashes, snow and bush-fire, natural and unnatural disaster, flood and drought caused by leaders in search of power. When will these atrocities stop My parents have vanished but I go on in search of the TRUTH because I deeply love my Saviour.

Appeal for contributions to fund scholarships
The Syed Abdurahiman Jiffri Mowlana Memorial Trust has made an appeal for financial contributions towards its fund to grant more scholarships to deserving students during the holy month of Ramadan, the joint secretary of the trust said in a press release.
The Trust was founded in 1978 to perpetuate the memory of Marhoom Syed Abdurahiman Jiffri Mowlana who passed away in the holy city of Mecca in 1978.
The Trust has completed 40 years of service in the field of education by offering scholarships to deserving students who pursue education in medicine and engineering at state universities. Hundreds of students have passed out as doctors and engineers and are well settled; some are pursuing postgraduate studies in foreign universities too.
Although hundreds of applications seeking financial assistance are received, only a certain percentage is considered in this holy month of Ramadan. The Trust appeals for financial contributions to grant more scholarships to deserving students.
The trust is headed by Al-Haj M.A. Navaz Caffoor and the secretaries are M. Nowfal Barry and M. Fyzal Mohamed.

Central Province Chief Minister and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee member Sarath Ekanayake said that new Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) office bearers would be appointed by June 27.
He also said that until then a group of new office bearers would be appointed temporarily on June 03.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Provincial Council Complex at the Pallekelle in Kandy.
He said that a decision had been taken not to divulge the decisions reached at the Central Committee but some members who were present there only for a short period had revealed many such decisions which is wrong. He added that due to this reason a negative image has been painted on the party and government since the discussions on positive side of the government such as receiving the GSP concession, lifting the ban on fish export, getting rid of war tribunal etc did not reach the public.

## Title: Arthur Waley and his Chinese poems

Arthur Waley and his Chinese poems
Introducing the English translations of poems from Chinese sources titled as Chinese poems published by Unwin Publishers as far back as 1961, as translated by the scholar Arthur David Waley (1889  1966) an English scholar paid the following tribute: A taste for Chinese poetry is not hard to acquire. It is as easy to enjoy as chop-suey and has indeed something of the same quality, being many flavoured and subtle, yet full of honest nourishment.
I felt the same on rereading the English translations of Chinese poems running to more than 200 pieces on varied subjects as compiled into a single volume. Waley the hardworking scholar who had been tutored under gurus like Ezra Pound at the Cambridge University was known widely by the term English Orientalist.
Six volumes
Having learned Chinese and Japanese, Waley had utilised time to bring out 20 books during his lifetime. To his credit, he had brought out six volumes of Chinese poems initially in 1818, and a collection of Japanese Noh plays in 1921. Though highly inspired by various types of English poems over the years he had the knack to be sensitively closer to Chinese religious sources too. As a result of this, he brought out a work titled as Analects of Confucius in 1938 and the well known Chinese narrative of the 16th century titled as Monkey in 1942.
This narrative is now known as a great phenomenon work translated into more than 20 oriental and occidental languages. The Sinhala translation by the well-known scholar A P Gunarante was first serialised as a radio episodic drama, that followed the printed publication. Reading the various types of Chinese poems as translated in the present work titled as Chinese poems, I feel that Waley is trying his best to take the reader down the centuries of creative writing in China.
The period of commencement is marked as 900 BC. The poem is titled as Origin-Legend of the Chou tree. The poem may be of both anthropologic and historic values sandwiched in the versified narrative pattern. It is also a poetic narrative on the first ever paternal and maternal lineages in China. Flowing down the centuries, the reader comes across a number of short folk poems on varying subjects.
Handsome gentleman
In the section termed as Songs of Courtship as culled from 7th Century BC a female persona says:
A very handsome gentleman waited for me in the lane,
I am sorry, I did not go with him.
A very splendid gentleman
Waited for me in the hall;
I am sorry I did not keep company with him
I am wearing my unlined coat
My coat all of brocade
I am wearing my unlined skirt
My skirt all of brocade
Oh sir, oh my lord
Take me with you in our coach.
In the narrative time as feeling via the translation, a reader may feel the sense of expression closer to some of the oriental folk poems. Arthur Waley in his translations has taken special interest on the poet named Li Po (AD 701  762) while enveloping some of the poems in translation in the present volume, he had taken pains to bring out a work titled as Poetry and Career of Li Po in 1951.
The poems of Li Po are quite brief and come closer to a kind of visionary expressions. One example titled as In the Mountains on a Summer Day goes as follows:
Gently I stir a while feather fan
With open shirt sitting in a green wood
I take off my cap and hang it on
A wind from the pine trees trickles on my bare head.
Some of the poems of Li Po resemble the Japanese Haiku verses. One example is the poem titled self-abandonment. The lines go as follows:
I sat drinking and id not notice the dusk
Till falling petals filled
The folds of my dress
Drunken I rose and walked to the moonlit stream
The birds were gone
And men also few.
As Arthur Waley himself says he had never visited either China or Japan. It may have been due to the pressure of time and work involved as a full-time scholar. But he seems to have no regret over those taking the existence as a rapid flow of time, taking everything in the most relaxed manner in the best sense of spiritualism. Waley considers himself as a self-taught and self-inspired. Of the poems in the collection, even those on traditional themes, love and sorrow, this changing patterns and pleasures of life are grounded in awry awareness while others surprise the reader in nuances of humour and introspection. No poetic work is hard to understand as they convey some meanings related to human existence. During his writing career attached to the Oriental Section of the British Museum, he had the opportunity to meet a dancer cum like-minded orientalist named Beryl de Zoete who later became his wife.
It is said that she too had been an inspirer of Waley who towards the end of his life jotted down the poems when he dictated them one by one. The poem titled The Pedlar of Spells from the Chinese poet Lu Yu (AD 1125  1210) is one such example. I had the chance of reading the poem as included in the collection under discussion. I wish to share the intuitive vision embedded in it that goes as follows.
An old man selling charms,
In a cranny of the town wall;
He writes out spells to bless
The silkworms and spells to protect the corn.
With the money he gets each day he only buys wine;
But he does not worry
When his legs get wobbly
For he has a boy to lean on.
Arthur Waleys bulk of work still remains to be assessed in its correct perspective. I feel that the poems in the collection ought to be utilised as teaching material for two main purposes. Firstly as source material for creative communication teaching and secondly as source material for the teaching of translation methods.

## Title: Bandaranaikes 1960

## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, May 23, 2018 - 01:00
Bandaranaikes 1960
Playwright, dramatist, actor, lyricist and radio artist, Dayananda Gunawardenas first outstanding play was 'Nari Bena' (1960). Based on a folk-tale it was full of songs. Lionel Algamas music added extra elegance to this play  two songs, Kumatada Sobaniye Kandulu Salanne (do not sob beloved) and 'Ehela Malin Gas Pirila Balanna Hari Lassanai' (its a spectacular view of blooming Ehela trees in the vicinity) became extremely popular, the play continues to be staged for over fifty years.
When a few veteran stage actors sang Kumatada Sobhaniye Kandulu Salanne, in a TV programme recently, I reminisced of the year 1960, when two general elections followed the assassination of Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike a few months before.
General perception within the electorate was that the last nail into the UNPs casket had been driven in 1956. The SLFP, Bandaranaikes new party swept the polls capturing control with all senior UNP ministers losing their territories except Sir John Kothalawala, the PM. Sir John Kotalawala dissolved the Parliament hastily in March 1956 and called for fresh elections. SWRD grabbed the opportunity to form a grand alliance with a few other nationalists and left parties to meet the UNP led by Sir John and his deputy JR Jayewardene in the absence of Dudley Senanayake who bid good-bye to politics a couple of years before. He named it Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP, led by SLFP). The MEP invited the LSSP and CP, the two Marxist parties to go into a no-contest deal for defeating the common enemy at the elections.
Multi-party politics
With the assassination of Prime Minister Bandaranaike in September 1959, Ceylon as a nation faced confusion and instability. However, the well-established institution of parliamentary multi-party politics proved strong. The orderly constitutional process resolved the transfer of leadership and the office of Prime Minister was passed on to Wijaynanda Dahanayake, a non-SLFPer and leader of Bhasha Peramuna (Language front), a constituent party in the MEP, he was the most senior parliamentarian, in the absence of SLFPs second in command and leader of the house CP de Silva, who was hospitalized in London.
Policy and personality clashes among the ruling coalitions hierarchy forced the new leader to dissolve Parliament prematurely in December 1959. By this time the SLFP became extremely unpopular with the unfolding of evidence in the assassination case, that almost all the accused belonged to SLFP hierarchy.
As Sirimavo, the widow of slain PM, Bandaranaike declined the offer of party leadership; the SLFP during the elections was led by its deputy, C P de Silva. Bandaranaike, however, during the latter part of the campaign reluctantly agreed to appear on election platform. Her tears and grieving over the killing of her husbands created a wave of sympathy which drew massive crowds. The government film unit produced a well directed short film titled, Gamanaka Awasanaya (Journeys end) on Bandaranaike, his assassination and the funeral and it was shown free of charge at all film halls in the island in between the normal film show times. Crowds thronged to watch the 25-minute clip. The short-lived Dahanayake government was defeated by the UNP in the March 1960 general elections.
Sirimavos late entry, however, as an outsider was not sufficient to account for the required number, the SLFP securing only 30 seats against UNPs 50, in a 125-member House. Dudley Senanayake who was brought back to politics by the party men was sworn in as PM in a minority government.
The new Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake Governments overall parliamentary majority, in terms of the number of seats, being below the minimum requirement was defeated at the vote on the Throne Speech (Policy Statement), within a month from its formation. Then there were no jumping frogs; Also, politics was then more or less totally the province of men who were by now rich, not of those on the make, so the scope for personal monetary corruption was much less. Representatives were motivated by loyalty to the party that is untainted by the under-the-table deals.
PR system
With the fall of the UNP government, a second general election became mandatory: it was fixed for July 1960. The elections were held in quick succession in March and July, as the March election failed to elect a winning party with an absolute majority. The writer was preparing for his O/L examination when the Dudley Senanayakes one-month-old minority government collapsed at the vote on Crown Speech.
On this occasion, the assassinated Prime Ministers widow, Sirimavo Rattwatte Dias Bandaranaike, with the support of few other smaller parties with both right and left leanings, agreed to carry on the mandate of her husband. On July 20th, helped by public sympathy, the SLFP won 75 seats out of 98 fielded, though they obtained only 33.6 percent of the total votes cast. Meanwhile, the UNP contested 128 seats won only 30 but raked in 37.6 percent of the valid votes, a remarkable discrepancy that justified introduction of the Proportional Representation (PR) system in later years. The LSSP and the CP entered into a no-contest pact with the SLFP and fielded 28 candidates, of which the LSSP and the CP won 12 and 4 seats respectively. Sirimavo Bandaranaike took oaths as the Prime Minister of Ceylon and gained the unprecedented honour of being the world's first woman head of state, an exceptional distinction welcomed universally.
The second election was fixed for July 20 under a UNP caretaker government; and the campaign commenced, which used and abused the state Radio, Lake House and the Times Group the only media available then to vilify, insult and vituperate Sirimavo, who on this occasion accepted the leadership and campaigned enthusiastically for her party.
SWRDs life and assassination
Kumatada Sobhaniye Kandulu Salanne was played ad nauseam over the two channels at Radio Ceylon, the sole electronic media, and the then Care-taker government banned the short film Journeys end on SWRDs life and assassination. This gave the novice Sirimavo, the iron lady all the dynamism, vitality, courage and determination in leading the SLFP to win 75 seats out of 146, a clear ruling majority and she set an everlasting world record as First Woman Head of State.
The campaign carried out by the government in July 1960, by banning the documentary, JOURNEY'S END and abusing the state media to repeat Nari Bena song Kumatada sobhanye kandulu salnney had negative impact on them; this reminds one, the much worse abusive and discourteous strategies adopted by the Rajapaksas during Presidential elections in January 2015.
Such undignified and reprehensible methods as well as attempts to postpone elections in the past always did boomerang on the ruling party causing victory to the opposition. Will they ever learn lessons

A Bathroom and a Bathtub..!
The wife was in the bathroom staring at nothing in particular. The look troubled me; it meant trouble! I wondered whether some hair dye had spilt in the sink or the mirror had cracked under the strain of me staring at it. I dont think we need this bathtub! she said finally.
Well its a good place to have a bath in! I said lamely.
When did you last use it
Why, this morning I said happily.
I mean use it as a bathtub, not for your shower
I knew where the argument was going. Id installed it in my bathroom, dreaming of reading a book while my poor tired body soaked in the bubbles and a glass of whiskey lay just outside. Id dreamt of a getting out, totally refreshed into my bathrobe, till during the first attempt at living my dream my book fell into the tub, the whiskey, good scotch got kicked by my clumsy feet and I had got out, slipped while trying to wear the bathrobe, crawled to the door, and swore never to have bathtub dreams again.Yeah! I said, Havent really been using the tub as a tub.
So lets make two bathrooms! said the eager wife, Our neighbor downstairs has done that, why dont you have a look!
But why do we need two bathrooms I asked. Always useful in an emergency! said the doctor wife knowingly, Especially as you grow older!
I knocked at my neighbours flat and asked to see his bathroom, But you stay upstairs dont you he asked looking puzzled.
Yes! I said.
Then why dont you use your own bathroom
I explained why I wanted to see his bathroom, and his face lit up, Come! he said, Its the bathroom of the century, actually two bathrooms of the century, which do you want to see first
Its okay! I said, I have plenty of time!
This, said my neighbor with a flourish, Is what we need for our age! I looked at fully tiled walls with a washbasin carved into same wall, and a mirror stuck in! I saw the fancy commode but wondered where the shower was. Youre looking for the shower arent you asked my kind neighbor. Yes! I said, Unless its in the other bathroom
Its right above your head! said my neighbor with a proud smile, Sit n shower! is what I call it!
Sure, I said, wondering whether Id heard the word sit pronounced correctly.
At your age, standing for a shower could be dangerous! said my neighbor, Sitting down makes your experience totally safe! Just think, have you ever had an accident in the bathroom while sitting
No! I said, But I did, when I was lying down! The wife opened the door as I climbed to my flat, Where are you going she asked. To my bathtub! I said, Where I can sit, and stand and lie down, and enjoy my bath..!

Bicentennial Marx
The 200th birth anniversary of Karl Marx was commemorated recently with the third volume of his celebrated work Das Kapital introduced to the Sri Lankan audience.
The third volume is translated into Sinhalese by former Daily News Editor Jayatilleke de Silva. Professor Desmond Mallikarachchi, Dew Gunasekara MP, JVP General Secretary Tilwin Silva and Jayatilleke de Silva delivered special orations. The event was organised by the National Association of Intellectuals.
Das Kapital is a foundational theoretical text in materialist philosophy, economics and politics. Marx aimed to reveal the economic patterns underpinning the capitalist mode of production, in contrast to classical political economists such as Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill. Marx did not live to publish the planned second and third parts, but they were both completed from his notes and published after his death by his colleague Friedrich Engels.
Das Kapital is the most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.

CEAT launches loyalty program
Sri Lankas top tyre brand CEAT has elevated its relationship with the countrys tyre dealers to a new level with the launch of a structured loyalty program that confers rewards proportionate to the sales they generate for the brand.
Believed to be the first scheme of such depth and scope in the sector, the four-tiered CEAT Privilege Class loyalty program seeks to motivate dealers to achieve and maintain tier targets and to progress upwards, earning greater rewards as they increase sales.
A Rs 5 billion investment that generated revenues in excess of Rs 10 billion in 2016-17, the India  Sri Lanka joint venture CEAT Kelani Holdings already manufactures nearly half of Sri Lankas tyre requirements and is investing another Rs 3 billion to double production of existing categories and to launch new categories of tyres.
Commenting on this new initiative to reinforce dealer loyalty, CEAT Kelani Managing Director Mr Ravi Dadlani said, Dealers have always been an integral element of our sales operation and are recognised annually with awards and overseas tours for their contribution to our growth. The launch of a structured loyalty programme is a reflection of how serious we are about building on this relationship in a way that ensures there are always higher rewards for them to aspire to.
The CEAT Privilege Class scheme is designed with membership tiers of Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze, each with its own exclusive benefits. Moving up the membership tiers is governed by Privilege Points earned within any 12 month period, which are evaluated monthly and members who achieve the required Tier threshold are upgraded as and when they do. This means that dealers can be eligible for upgrades all year round.
Membership of the Platinum, Gold and Silver tiers will qualify dealers for designated rewards such as overseas tours, VVIP privileges at the companys annual dealer convention, VVIP invitations to CEAT corporate events anddesignated dedicated customer service personnel, while all tiers have the opportunity to redeem accumulatedpoints for attractive gifts ranging from the latest iPhone and Samsung smartphones, Swiss designer wristwatches, designer sunglasses and leather organisers, cosmetics, sound equipment, hotel stays and supermarket vouchers.
A new investment of Rs 3 billion over the next two years will see the establishment of a state-of-the-art plant in Kelaniya for the manufacture of Truck Bus Radials (TBRs), the first plant of its kind in Sri Lanka, the expansion of the existing cutting-edge passenger car radial tyre plant at the same location to double production, and the doubling of CEAT Kelanis motorcycle tyre production.
The company also plans to increase its focus on developing products based on functional and performance platforms such as fuel saving, long tyre life and premier performance.

CEB union engineers meet President
Members of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)Engineers Union who had met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, called on the President to initiate action against the regulator for the power sector, the Public Utilities Commission for failing to heed to the President's orders. "The President was irate that even after he had given his directive verbally and in-writing, the PUCSL called for meetings without approving the Generation Plan," said Executive Committee Member Athula Wanniarachchi.
"We too echoed similar sentiments and asked that legal action be sought. Hence, the President has sought the Attorney General's view on the matter for the way forward."
Wanniarchichi alleged that even after the President had given his permission to go ahead with the Least Cost Long Term Generation Plan submitted by the Ceylon Electricity Board on April 25, the PUCSL dragged its feet on the matter by repeatedly calling for meetings.
"Even then, the Chairman of the Commission was absent at the meeting and it ended inconclusively," he said, "We have asked for the President to intervene and bring an end to this stalemate."
The CEBEU however had suspended their work-to-rule campaign in the areas affected by the floods.

Child abuse and neglect, preventable
The recent reports of the National Child Protection Authority indicate that it has received 3,785 complaints for the past year and the majority of them had been violence inflicted upon children.
Considering the stigma and attitudes of Sri Lankan public, most cases of child abuse goes unreported. Hence, the statistical overview presented above could be just the tip of the iceberg. The international experience suggests that reported cases are likely to represent only 10 percent of total cases perpetrated
President Maithripala Sirisena has understood the gravity of the problem. Two years ago, he established a special Task Force for the protection of children. And, recently he emphasised the need to introduce a national policy without any further delay towards the protection and well-being of the children.
mPolicy and legal measures
It is globally accepted that the best way to protect children is to prevent child abuse and neglect from happening in the first place. Child abuse and neglect is the result of the interaction of a number of individual, family, and environmental factors. Consequently, there is strong reason to believe that the prevention of child abuse and neglect requires a comprehensive focus that crosscuts key sectors of society (e.g., public health, government, education, social services, and justice).
mStrategies
What we require urgently, as President pointed out, is a steadfast National Policy for the protection of children with clear-cut strategies. This writer wishes suggest four ideas for consideration.
1. Strengthen financial supports to needy families
2. Change social norms to support parents and positive parenting
3. Provide quality care and education early in life
4. Enhance parenting skills to promote healthy child development
Let us briefly analyse these four strategies.
(1) Strengthening household financial security can reduce child abuse and neglect by improving parents ability to satisfy childrens basic needs. The financial security, for example, can be in the form of temporary assistance for needy families. Such relief will reduce parental stress and depression in bringing up their children.
Family-friendly work policies, such as flexible and consistent work schedules will improve balance between work and family and make it easier for parents to provide necessary care for children.
(2) Changing social norms that allow indifference to violence is also important to the prevention of child abuse. From a sociological perspective, social norms are informal understandings that govern the behaviour of members of a society. In addition, changing the way we think and talk about the child abuse and how to prevent it (our thinking) are important in working out the policy choice.
Social norms can be changed in two different ways. First, public engagement and education campaigns using communication strategies (for e.g., social marketing, mass or social media) and community-based efforts (for e.g., public meetings, neighbourhood screenings and discussions) to reframe the way people think and talk about child abuse and neglect.
Secondly, legislative approaches can be introduced to establish norms around safe, more effective discipline strategies. To make it a success legislative approaches must be paired with engagement and education campaigns.
(3) Early pre-school education, coupled with quality child care, can improve childrens socio-emotional development. It will lead to the likelihood that children will experience safe and stable relationships both in education and home settings.
Preschool enrichment with family engagement programs provide high-quality early education and care particularly to economically disadvantaged children to build a strong foundation for future learning.
(4) Parenting skills can be honed through several approaches.
Firstly, early childhood home visitation programs can be introduced. Such programs can provide information, caregiver support, and training about child health and development. These home visiting programs may be delivered by public nurses, professionals, or para-professionals.
These programs can teach parents about positive parenting skills to build strong and safe families that protect children from violence. Primary care providers are trained to identify and address factors (e.g., parental depression, substance abuse, major stress, utilization of harsh punishment, intimate partner violence) that increase risk for child abuse and neglect.
mProgrammes
To achieve success in the above strategies, there should be appropriate programs implemented based on four main aspects - advocacy, prevention, support and research and development. Let us briefly go through them.
mAdvocacy
We must adopt and promote awareness of the importance of responsibility to protect children to all levels of society. These may include smart partnerships by the media and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the private sector and community organisations.
We must ensure that those who deal directly with children are able to identify and report cases of neglect, abuse, violence and exploitation.
We must ensure children and the community and legal practitioners, students majoring in law, educators, social workers, medical professionals, members of enforcement (such as police officers and immigration), bus and cab drivers and security officers are given understanding of children's rights under the Convention on the rights of the Child (CRC).
We must encourage the provision of a safe and healthy environment for children. We must encourage every organisation (whether public or private) to create policies and regulations on the protection of children.
mPrevention
We must establish an early warning mechanism which will strengthen child protection mechanisms at national level.
We must provide basic knowledge to the children for enable them to protect themselves from neglect, abuse, violence and exploitation as well as identify the risk to their situation.
We must create a screening system, recognition and training for those who work directly with children.
mSupport service
Broadening and improve counselling services to victims, families, adult offenders, offenders of children and communities. We must increase and expanding health services and protection to victims and families.
mResearch and development
We must encourage research and development of child protection and spreading its research findings for improvements action. This factor is very important.
This writer believes our relevant authorities have missed some of the essential practices that may unintentionally hinder the child protection service delivery.
The effective delivery of public services in child protection services is crucial for poverty reduction, well-being of all children and to achieve development goals. In order to improve service delivery mechanisms, it does not suffice to concentrate merely on supply side mechanisms. It involves the need to capacitate the demand side of service delivery by ensuring that the users/stakeholders of child protection services are informed of their rights, duties and entitlements and are enabled to exercise their rights.

Chronicled salutation
The University of Peradeniya wanted an assistant librarian. They posted an advertisement. HAI Goonetilleke who was in Madras reading for his Masters grew an interest in the job. He took a flight and tried to make it on time. But he was a few hours late. Interviews were all done and dusted.
A disheartened Goonetilleke was not the one to give in easily. He approached the Vice Chancellor of the University: Sir Ivor Jennings. The Vice Chancellor fixed another interview specifically for the latecomer. Surprise! The latecomer was chosen for the job.
University tradition
Therein lies the great narrative of the Peradeniya University and its founders. H A I Goonetilleke established a novel bibliographic tradition with the massive library of the university. He was one of the few who recorded life and times of Sir Ivor Jennings. And this essay celebrates Sir Ivor Jennings, a British lawyer who pioneered the university tradition in Sri Lanka. Although he is the founder of Peradeniya University, no single biographical work of him is available in Sinhala.
Sampath Bandara has come to the fore to fill that void. Chronicling national figures is no new challenge for Bandara who has already authored a political biography on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The idea of writing a profile of Sir Ivor was confined to a brochure at first.
The Vice Chancellor of University of Visual & Performing Arts was tasked with sculpting the image of Dr Ivor Jennings. I was tasked with providing the contents for a small biographical brochure on Sir Ivor. As I was engaged in research on Sir Ivor, I realised that a book-worthy information is available. I wanted to publish a small book based on the findings, Bandara recalled.
Token ofappreciation
The biographer disclosed his idea to Dr Dhammika Yatigammana, a close friend who is a medical practitioner passed out from the Peradeniya University. Dr Yatigammana volunteered to fund the book project as a token of appreciation for the education he received from the university. Sarasavi Publishers took on the distribution responsibility of the book.
The book contains rare photographs of Sir Ivor Jennings and the University of Peradeniya. Sir Ivors is an emotional story dealing with how he had planted certain trees with his own hands. In between the pictures, the reader has the opportunity to imbibe in that great saga of a great tradition. The readers, mostly the Peradeniya University alumna, would find a kind of memorabilia in this pictorial work.
Sir Ivor Jennings contributed immensely to British Ceylon before he left for Cambridge University as its Vice Chancellor. Although some quarters deny the fact that Sir Ivor Jennings was an instrumental figure behind the making of the Soulbury Constitution, the photographs featured on the books guide the reader through an informative journey. It reveals the correspondence exchanged between Premier D S Senanayake and Sir Ivor Jennings where the former salutes to the latter as My Dear Dr Jennings. Rare covers of the books (Parliament and Cabinet Governance for instance) authored by Sir Ivor are also included in the biography. These books have been preserved in the libraries of Lake House and J R Jayewardene Centre, according to Bandara.
Demand forbiography
You cannot call it a massive market, but there is a considerable demand for non-fiction, maintains Bandara based on the sales of his books. His biography of Ananda Coomaraswamy is on its third print. To commemorate the 100th death anniversary of the late historian, Bandara has compiled an anthology titled Sansmruti with the input from scholars such as Professor Desmond Mallikarachchi, Martin Wickramasinghe, PL Prematilake and Dr Amaradasa Weerasinghe.
Dr Amaradasa Weerasinghe deserves a special mention. As the editor of Sanskruti Magazine, he once dedicated the whole issue in honour of Dr Coomaraswamy. This is significant as Dr Coomaraswamy was not much of a celebrity figure then, Bandara noted.

CSE supporting partner at CMA Excellence  in Integrated Reporting Awards 2018
The Colombo Stock Exchange will be the supporting partner at the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards 2018conducted for the 4th consecutive year and the awards ceremony will be held on July 5, 2018 at Cinnamon Lakeside, Colombo.
The International Integrated Reporting Framework issued by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) will be used to accelerate the adoption of in Public Quoted Companies and other sectors.
Integrated reporting is a process founded on integrated thinking that results in a periodic integrated report by an organization about value creation over time and related communications regarding aspects of value creation.
An integrated report is a concise communication about how an organizations strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to the creation of value over the short, medium and long-term.
The primary purpose of an integrated report is to explain to providers of financial capital how an organization creates value over time. It therefore contains relevant information, both financial and other.
An integrated report benefits all stakeholders interested in an organizations ability to create value over time, including employees, customers, suppliers, business partners, local communities, legislators, regulators and policy-makers.
The integrated report tells the complete story of the organisation in a clear and straightforward manner. It differs from the traditional annual report, which emphasises financial reporting, in that it focuses on the ability to create value in the short, medium and long term. The report has an emphasis on: conciseness, strategic focus and future orientation, connectivity of information, and the capitals and their interdependencies.
CMA Excellence in Integrated reporting Awards has received International Recognition with the presence of the CEO of IIRC last year and this year with the distinguished participation of the President of International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) Rachael Grimes who will deliver the key note address at the awards ceremony and distribute awards.
This is further strengthened by the international panel of judges who are experts on from UK, USA, Canada, Singapore, South Africa, India and Sri Lanka supported by an eminent panel of evaluators.
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) are greatly encouraged by the number of companies that have adopted Integrated Reporting on a voluntary basis and are hopeful that many more companies will follow suit and apply for the 2018 Awards.
Overall Awards including the best 10 are granted to those who have excelled in Integrated Reporting and the sector awards will encourage all companies in different sectors to apply.
The categories include listed companies, unlisted companies, banks, finance, insurance, industry and commerce, hotels, plantations, conglomerates, state owned enterprises, NGOs and NPOs and Small and Medium Enterprises (SME).
Special Awards for the application of concepts of integrated reporting will further enhance the implementation of especially for public quoted companies.
These include Integrated Thinking, Conciseness, Capitals, Materiality, Value Creation and Strategic Focus. An award will also be presented for the Most Improved Integrated Report.

Curry Pot Restaurant opens in Clifford Avenue Kolluptiya
One of Sri Lankas most sought after healthy food restaurant chains, Curry Pot opened their third restaurant at Clifford Avenue Colombo 3 on Thursday.
The Chief Guest for the event was Minister of Tourism, John Amaratunge.
Chairman Curry Pot, Shyamal Wickramasingha said that he started Curry Pot restaurant five years ago mainly to offer authentic healthy food and it caught up. We started from Marine Drive Kolluptiya and then expanded to YMCA Fort to meet the demand mainly from the office staff.
He said that today they want to expand Curry Pot to families and tourists as well and deiced to open their biggest restaurant in a more spacious venue at Clifford Avenue. The new venue could cater to almost 75 people with a special private dining area as well.
He said he was in japan for 16 years studying management and then opened two restaurants and an entertainment venue in Japan. Then I decided to fold up this operation and launch the Curry Pot restaurant chain in Sri Lanka as I saw a void for authentic Sri Lanka cuisine. The chances of having food-related illnesses are getting higher day by day due to the consumption of artificial food. The main cause for most of non-communicable diseases is our food patterns. Our daily lives too become complex due to the modern society which becomes more and more complicated gradually. One of the challenges that we have to face throughout our busy lives is to take a healthy diet.
We at Curry Pot Restaurant are now offering organic food for healthy living and today there is a great demand not only from senior citizens but also from younger generation and tourists for authentic Sri Lankan food.
I rose up to this demand and today Curry Pot lunch menu has over 25 vegetable verities to choose form and all these are organically grown and the price for a meal is very competitive.
The Curry Pot also has an outdoor catering arm which even catered for functions hosted for President, VIP and corporate.
We also have a take away sector and soon will introduce online bookings.
He said that also plan to open one more restaurant in Colombo this year and plan to spread to outstations form next year. We are also looking at Franchise overseas.
Curry Port has also been featured in Trip Advisor and several online magazines and they are now talking to more travel agents to woo more foreigners.

A total of 18,760 dengue cases and 20 confirmed dengue deaths had been reported up to May 18 from all parts of the country, the Epidemiology Unit said.
According to the epidemiologists, the highest number of dengue cases, 2,891, had been reported from the Colombo district, while the second highest number, 2,618, had been reported from the Baticaloa district. The third highest number of dengue cases, 1,590, had been reported from the Gampaha district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported a total of 7,89 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district had recorded a total of 2,102 dengue cases. The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province was 5,601, epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever, prior to applying home remedies. All fever patients require rest and should not attend work or school.
Patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen, cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), which could be fatal, they added.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding grounds during this rainy season, in order to prevent the spread of dengue. Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed in, they said.

Disabled people with extraordinary talents succeed and contribute to the world economy every day. Imagine the world of science without Stephen Hawking. The Olympics without Tanni Grey Thompson. And the horrendous thought of television without Stephen Fry.
Many unemployed people with health challenges and disabilities face complex barriers that they must overcome to be successful in their search for work. But for many people with disabilities, the main thing they have in common with these heroes, is a strength of character and determination to succeed.

Officials of the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) discussed the forthcoming National Export Strategy (NES) and other key initiatives of the agency with top Harvard economist Prof. Ricardo Hausmann recently.
Hausmann is the founder director of Harvard Universitys Center for International Development and the guru behind the Product Space Map and Atlas of Economic Complexity analytical tools, now used by countries around the world to assess their export competitiveness and develop strategies for diversification. This analysis was used extensively by the EDB team and by public and private stakeholders in developing the NES, which will soon be submitted to Cabinet.
The NES identifies new sectors and enterprise-oriented strategies to boost export earnings and increase jobs in the export sector.The discussion with Hausmann centered on the development of the NES and its implementation. Upon hearing the progress made, he remarked, I am extremely proud of your achievements so far. I understand that exports last year have picked up.
The main thing to remember when implementing the new strategy is to not get stuck in plans, but to continually iterate and adapt, keeping in mind the objective of export diversification and growth.

England football team wives and girlfriends will be banned from staying with their other halves at their tournament HQ next month - in line with tradition.
Team chief Gareth Southgate has encouraged families to travel to Russia to show their support, but WAGs aren't allowed to stay at the same hotel, which is located in the quiet town of Repino.
Instead, they will have to stay at a hotel 30 miles away from the players' HQ in central St Petersburg, reports the Daily Star.
When the team plays their group games in Volgograd, Nizhny Novgorod and Kaliningrad, the players wives and girlfriends reportedly won't be allowed to travel with them or stay with them in the same hotel the night before the games.
Back in 2010, then-England boss Fabio Capello banned WAGs from the World Cup in South Africa, limiting visits to once a week, to avoid any distractions.
However, current manager Southgate has allowed families to spend time with players at the team hotel the day after games to help them relax.
Southgate previously said: I dont think there has ever been a tournament where the whole family has been in with us the whole time.
"But will I encourage families to come and the lads to see them the day after a game, absolutely I will.
For some, that will be really important. Sadly for my family, not so much. Im there and Im focused and I dont want to be distracted. The video will start in 8Cancel.

With its strategy to adopt an organic expansion by adding core and distinct competencies that are complementary to the secure payment industry in mind, Epic has acquired expertise in information systems and transaction security, mobile applications, content and process digitalization, said Dr. Nayana Dehigama, the Executive Chairman and Managing Director.
We began our FinTech innovation drive in early 2000s even before the banks and tech giants realised the potential in it.
In a context where the most banks in Sri Lanka were challenged with diminishing credit-worthy customers due to market hostilities and facing fierce competition for the lucrative urban market segments especially from the techno-oriented new entrants that offered more flexible and innovative products and services, we offered technology solutions for the banking and finance sector enabling them to go beyond traditional boundaries to access new markets.
This portfolio of competencies has helped Epic to create differentiated solutions for totally new verticals such as e-Governance, Document and Workflow Management, Enterprise Digitalisation and PKI Infrastructure for enterprise and communication security.
While forging ahead amidst the constant technology transformation, Epic expanded its services beyond Sri Lanka, and established its operations in Malaysia, Japan and Singapore too.
Today, Epic is renowned as a FinTech Solutions Innovator in the region. Epic also has made remarkable impact as a technology leader that provides state-of-the-art Enterprise Digitalisation and Information Systems Security Solutions. The introduction of Branchless Banking concept to the world and innovating the Asia Pacifics most comprehensive and feature-rich Priority Banking Solution Suite that enables virtual Banking experiences from anywhere in the world and new generation customer centric FinTech solutions through disruptive technologies are some ground breaking achievements Epic is proud of.
The Chief Architect at Epic, and its Group Director and CEO, Viraj Mudalige speaking on plans beyond 20 said, From the very outset our aim has been to create a unique electronic secure payment platform that facilitates processing of all kinds of banking transactions that initiate from multiple channels such as ATMs, EDC/POS, mobile phones, TABs, PDAs, and Internet Banking, which are currently being done through isolated systems.
Our mission was to be the worlds first FinTech Company, which will unify all these payment channels into one single platform, so that banks will have single platform to create and manage multiple revenue channels.
We are happy that our dream has come true today with our Epic Omni-Channel Synchronizer, which is now rapidly gaining global acceptance.
The world-class expertise and the tireless contribution of the highly proficient and passionate technocrat force of over 300 at Epic working on many flagship projects of large banks in Sri Lanka and overseas.

Exports and FDI poised  for growth - OBG
Sri Lankas plans to transition into a high-income, knowledge-based economy through ambitious fiscal reforms, new trade deals and added-value exports are explored in a new report from the global research and consultancy firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 tracks growth in the tradable sector as the country targets $20bn in export earnings by 2020, boosted by the reinstatement of EU GSP+ status which helped to improve performances in key segments such as textiles and clothing last year. While shining a spotlight on Vision 2025, the countrys blueprint for economic development, OBGs publication also explores Sri Lankas efforts to reform the tax code and rationalise expenditure following its $1.5bn deal with the IMF.
Buoyed by a combination of changing demographics and a pipeline of mega-projects, the construction industry has rallied after a slowdown in 2015 to notch up double-digit growth, despite rising input costs.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 considers the key role that international partners are playing in galvanising the sector, while also examining the positive effect that proposed reforms could have on further boosting foreign interest in local property.
Sri Lankas rapidly growing tourism offering is another focus.
OBG analyses the countrys plans to tap new markets and strengthen air routes, in line with its target of increasing visitor numbers to 4.5m by 2020. Plans to modernise its important agricultural industries and improve productivity through investment in technology are also examined, alongside the steps being taken to improve the digital innovation ecosystem and nurture high-value startups.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 contains contributions from President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, together with a detailed sector-by-sector guide for investors and the business community.Commenting after the launch, Oliver Cornock, OBGs editor-in-chief, said that positive developments documented in the new report included a new free trade agreement (FTA) with Sinagpore and a proposed FTA with China that could enable Sri Lanka to capitalise on its strategic location and support a new phase of economic progress.
Buoyed by a period of extensive post-war reconstruction and a diverse range of crop exports, Sri Lanka averaged growth of over 6% between 2008 and 2014, he said.
Patrick Cooke, OBGs regional editor for Asia, added that Sri Lankas impressive growth story, rising domestic demand and the implementation of pro-growth structural reforms had all helped to improve the investment climate last year, while plans to facilitate more public-private partnerships were expected to generate further international interest.

Extraordinary Kimono wedding dresses
Its not uncommon for modern Japanese weddings to combine Shinto wedding traditions with various elements of Western nuptials. Traditionally a Japanese bride would wear a furisode long-sleeve Kimono, but some brides are modifying their garments to add their own unique spin on the traditional Western wedding dress.
By folding the sleeves down and tying them into a decorative bow at the back, their Kimonos are suddenly turned into elegant strapless dresses. The best part is that because the alterations are all superficial, the wedding dress can easily be turned back into a Kimono. So instead of having a wedding dress that you wear once and then leave in the closet to collect dust forever, why not try something different

G. L. on the war path
President of the pohottuwa and former minister Prof. G. L. Peiris has cleared all doubts as to the position of his fledgling political party vis-a-vis the SLFP. Addressing the media on Monday, Peiris said the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna will in future contest all elections under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa and that there will be no compromising on this score. He said they of the pohottuwa party will have nothing to do with parties who were rejected by the people and that they did not want to be identified with such parties and lose the public support that was demonstrated on February 10.
He also struck a note of condescension towards the 16 SLFP MPs who quit the unity government following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by stating that the doors remained open for anyone to join hands with the SLPP led political force but they must submit themselves to the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa. This, in the backdrop of the SLFP rebels stand that although they are working towards a rapprochement between the two sides they were still with the Blue party and, what is more, support the government's good deeds and pro-people policies. They are to meet former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today and are expected to reveal their next move thereafter. Dayasiri Jayasekera has already said they were all out to bring the two sides together to fight elections as a single unit though he failed to reveal who will be the leader of the new look SLFP. This is because there can't be two power centres in a united SLFP.
How the rebels are going to get about the business of uniting the two sides, given Peiris's entrenched position, is difficult to fathom. Yesterday in these spaces we argued why such an eventuality is bound to fail. To begin with, President Sirisena has all but declared his candidacy to re-run for the Presidency in 2020 and hence any rapprochement between the two factions is doomed from the very outset. One cannot visualize the entirety of the SLFP parliamentary group abandoning the President who is the party leader, giving up their ministerial portfolios and even jettisoning their parliament seats, just to be seen in the company of Mahinda Rajapaksa, until the next election, which is nearly two years away. In any event the SLFP MPs now in the government will not take any chances in the face of the acceleration of the corruption cases against the Rajapaksas, to be stranded in no man's land.
Unification presupposes the SLFP MPs in the government quitting en masse which is not in the realm of possibility for the above reasons. Besides, as we have already argued, a mending of fences between President Sirisena and Rajapaksa too is farfetched given the degree and nature of their political estrangement. Hence, Perirs's tacit invitation to the rebels to join forces with the Rajapaksa camp is as untenable as the latter's efforts to unify the two sides of the SLFP.
Peiris, meanwhile, slipping into a sudden bout of combativeness at the press conference, declared that they of the pohotttuwa were staging a series of demonstrations, countrywide, beginning June 3, demanding that the government steps down and go for a general election so that the people will be given an opportunity to effect a regime change.
The good professor who had been the picture of dignity and decorum as a minister and parliamentarian and in his general public appearances, no doubt, has got excited and carried away by the recent local government election results.
The present government has been given a mandate by the electorate to govern for a full term, and, as Peiris, the erudite constitutional expert and scholar, is aware, there is no provision in the constitution to terminate parliament abruptly merely because the government fared poorly in local council elections. Perhaps, Peiris and the pohottuwites are fearing that the government will get its act together and remedy all the shortcomings that caused the electoral reversal on February 10.
Besides, a local government election is not a true barometer to test the pulse of the electorate in its true sense. It is widely agreed that the February 10 debacle was a protest vote by the public due to factors such as the soaring cost of living, the breakdown in the distribution of fertilizer to the farmers and the slashing of Samurdhi benefits to a sizable number of recipients. Some of the ex-ministers in the rebel group are now being accused of deliberately sabotaging the government's programmes meant for the poor to boost the vote of the pohottuwa.
It is time that the likes of Prof. G.L. Peiris, who is much respected for his academic achievements, shields himself from being spoken in the same breath as some of the riff raff in the Joint Opposition whose only aim is to enthrone the Rajapaksas back in power and bury, once and for all, all the mega-corruption charges against them and also wipe the slate of their own corrupt acts that are hanging like the sword of Damocles over their heads.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is making all efforts to educate the people on all common public issues, Public Service United Nurses Union President Ven.Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Ven.Ananda Thera said that the Government should immediately abolish the Free Trade Agreement signed with Singapore and consult the people before signing such as agreement, whenever the Government receives an opportunity to sign a Free Trade Agreement with a foreign country. He was addressing media in Colombo yesterday.
The union will take stern trade action if the Government fails to consult the people before taking crucial decisions on behalf of the country,such as, entering into Free Trade Agreements. The Government has handed over the entire sea area of Sri Lanka which is eight times larger than Sri Lanka, to Singapore through the signed agreement,the Thera said.
There is no clause mentioned in the agreement in connection with withdrawing from the agreement/abolishing it.Under the conditions included in the agreement, obtaining employment in Singapore will only be a dream for Sri Lankans. But, any person who has Singaporean citizenship can come to Sri Lanka.
This is totally unacceptable, the Thera added.

Gota should appear in Court, if not guilty - Mangala
Why is Gotabhaya Rajapaksa spending millions on lawyers to get injunction order to prevent his arrest asked Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday.
If he is not guilty, he should appear in court, he added. Responding to remarks made by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa that the former was scared of him, Minister Samaraweera said, Yes I am and it is not only I but many in this country are. I personally know what he is capable of.
Addressing a media briefing at his Ministry yesterday, the minister read the list of cases in court the former Defence Secretary is suspected to have been involved in.
He read: According to Police reports, Rajapaksa is suspected to have intervened in: the alleged facilitation of an irregular diplomatic passport for Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman, in the alleged abduction and assault of Nation editor Keith Noyar by army intelligence officers, in the alleged murder of Sunday Leader editor, Lasantha Wickramatunga by Army Intelligence Officers, for the alleged assault of Rivira editor Upali Tennekoon by Army Intelligence Officers, for the alleged abduction and disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda by Army Intelligence Officers in the alleged Welikada massacre of 26 prisoners and for the alleged shooting of pubic protesters in Weliweriya in 2013 which led to the death of three civilians.
We are not making unfounded allegations, the Minister said.
These Army officers who had no enmity towards these people. It is very clear that they were following orders, he further said.
I can clearly state that it was Gotabhaya Rajapaksa behind this, the man we should all fear. With regards to corruption, he noted Rajapaksas alleged involvement in the Avant Garde deal, the D.A.Rajapaksa memorial and the MiG deal which has an astounding USD 7.8 million allegedly being stolen through a shell company in England.
His parents should be commemorated but not with alleged stolen money. If they were alive, they would be very disappointed that their children did this, Samaraweera said.
Samaraweera also refuted allegations made by Rajapaksa that he went to meet the latter during the last Presidential election.
In October of 2014, the Rajapaksas including Gotabhaya Rajapaksa asked to meet me.I told them to come meet me if they wanted and Mahinda Rajapaksa came to my house, he said.
They allege that the Prime minister too has crimes, but he never hid. When Batalanda came up, he faced the Presidential Commission. Similarly, when he was called before the Bond Commission, he faced that too, the minister said.

Govt permits re-exporters to import Black Pepper

The Union Government has permitted 78 companies to import duty free 2,500 tonnes of black Pepper under the Indo-Sri Lankan FTA. A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting held in New Delhi on May 9 when these 100% export oriented companies approached DGFT for permission to import a total quantity of 17,254 tonnes.
However, the Commerce Ministry has allowed only the yearly quota of 2,500 tonnes as per the FTA norms with a specific direction that imports should be carried out as per the MIP notification at prices not less than Rs 500/kg. These 78 companies which process and re-export will get 32 tonnes each. A single company has filed application to import 2,500 tonnes while three applicants for 1,000 tonnes each.
In the applications, these companies have to show an agreement clause with a Sri Lankan exporter against which only the DGFT will issue license, trade sources said. Smuggling in large quantities as well as official imports of 300 tonnes at below MIP in April had hit prices. Any improvement can happen only if illegal routes are plugged, trade sources said. However, spice exporters pointed out that MIP notification has not helped improve Pepper prices in the domestic market with the rates moving southwards and hovering at Rs 360-380/kg depending on the grades.

Heatwave kills at least 65 in Pakistan

Hotter than average temperatures have killed at least 65 people in just three days in Karachi, Pakistan.
Temperatures reached a high of 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) on Monday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, way above the average daily high for May of 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit).
The situation was exacerbated by power outages citywide and ongoing fasting for the holy month of Ramadan, during which many Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours.
Faisal Edhi, from Edhi Foundation which runs Karachi's morgues, told CNN that 65 people had died, however the number was disputed by the director for the provincial disaster management authority in Sindh, where Karachi is located.
Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that so far only one person had died. He added the heatwave is ongoing and advised people to stay inside and avoid the heat.
The heatwave has also reached central and northern India. Conditions are expected to remain hot until the arrival of monsoon rains which are forecast to come in early June in southern India before moving north throughout the month, coinciding with the end of Ramadan on June 14.
This is not the first time people in Karachi have endured such intense heat. A 2015 heatwave in the city reached 45 degrees Celsius, killing at least 1,300 people, including many ill and elderly people.
Temperatures are forecast to stay in the low 40s (105 to 110 Fahrenheit) for the next few days before cooling down to the upper 30s (upper 90s to low 100s Fahrenheit) at the end of the week.
"The biggest issue is that there is no green cover in the city," said Suneela Ahmed, a Karachi based architect and urban designer.
Normally Karachi has a high humidity level, during a heat wave there is a change in wind direction which brings in dry inland winds to the city instead of moisture from the sea, (and) there are no trees to provide the green cover."
Due to a focus on housing, which has seen much of the green hinterland surrounding the city removed, "these lungs of the city have been demolished," Ahmed said.
"With the extremity of these issues and no initiative to address them, in 15 years this city won't be livable."

Now, sketches from Claire Waight Keller have revealed more of the hidden details of the veil, along with details of how it was created. Kensington Palace has confirmed that Meghan asked to have all 53 countries of the Commonwealth represented on her veil, with each countrys flowers hand-embroidered in silk threads and organza.
Workers from Givenchy spent hundreds of hours sewing the designs, washing their hands every thirty minutes to keep the tulle and threads pristine. Each flower had to be unique and detailed.
The majority of the flowers trailed the back of the veil. For the the front, Meghan had selected two favourites: Wintersweet, which grows in the grounds of Kensington Palace in front of Nottingham Cottage, and the Calfornia poppy, the state flower of California, where Meghan was born. Sweet.
Heres the full list of every flower embroidered on to the veil, in case youre curious.

IFS, Mahaweli Authority to  explore Solar power generation
Sri Lanka government entities are slow to adapt to new technological advances, said Global Industry Director for Energy and Utilities IFS Colin Beaney.
He however said this mindset in now changing and already the Mahaweli Authority has adopted IFS Solutions. Beaney said that he attend Ceylon Electricity Board Workshop in Kandy and also made a presentation on Enterprise Assisted Management to the participants. Subsequent to this the Mahaweli Authority contact IFS and then they implemented our solutions.
These solutions have helped the Mahaweli Authority streamline their water and power management systems and today they can see a breakdown well in advance and take precautionary masseurs before a breakdown.
After the Mahaweli Authority adopted IFS Solutions they once again installed additional solutions which has also has helped the Authority to streamline distribution of water for irrigation. We also hope to work with Mahaweli authority to explore the possibility of engaging in Solar power generation.
Beaney who worked for nearly 15 years has been involved in implementing and project managing IFS software into many project and Asset Intensive organisations in Europe and worldwide. These cover many industries including Energy, Utilities, Pulp & Paper, Aviation and Defense.
He said that IFS regional office was also opened in Sri Lank 30 years ago and since then it has been expanding. Lankan private companies in tea, appeals and food and beverage are adopting tier solutions.
He said that IFS is also involved in power and water management project s in India for the past 30 years. We are now looking at Bangladesh
He is therefore ideally placed to understand the real challenges faced by organisations working in the Service and Asset Intensive Industries. He is a key member of the IFS product directions board and plays an instrumental role in the decisions regarding IFS product strategy.
Commenting on globe energy trends he said that every year they are seeing a virtuous circle speeding up around renewables and 2018 will be no exception.
In 2009, it cost just under $300 to generate 1 MW of electricity using solar photovoltaic panels. In 2016, the cost was down to $100. All around the world, renewables companies are now able to offer cheaper energy alternatives. In September 2016 in Nevada, state energy provider NV Energy lost almost six percent of its customer base overnight as 15 of the top casinos and hotels in Las Vegas switched over to smaller renewable energy providers.
We also hope to work with The Mahaweli Authority to explore the possibility of engaging in Solar power generation. Meanwhile Gartner, Inc., Managing VP, Chief of Research and Chief Gartner Fellow, Daryl C. Plummer, said that though most of the companies in the world are adopting to change heritage customers (Family owned Businesses) are still not looking at new technology and cloud comfortably. This is because they still value their privacy and think that adopting technology will give away their secrets which is a myth. (SS)

Face masks have been provided for health staff. High floor oxygen (nasal cannulas) have been sent to these hospitals.
The Karapitiya Teaching Hospital Director has been authorised to purchase more high floor oxygen nasal cannulas. Over 1,000 posters have been distributed through MOHs and regional/provincial institution network in order to educate the public by displaying them in public places. I speak with the hospital authorities and monitor the situation in the morning and evening every day, he said.
Consultant Epidemiologist Dr. Samitha Ginige said complications are reported from child patients below two years and the most serious complication is pneumonia. But there are a lot of causes for pneumonia and Influenza is only one of them.
There is a slight increase in Influenza patients from all parts of the country. Dr. Ginige said persons in the high risk group such as children below two years, pregnant mothers, lactating mothers, elders above 65, persons who suffer from other chronic diseases such as diabetes, kidney diseases, heart diseases, respiratory diseases and have weak immunity should seek medical treatment and follow medical advice.
Patients with flu like symptoms should consume more liquid, keep themselves away from other family members, avoid crowded places and keep a good personal hygiene. Droplets can spread the virus within one metre. Even a healthy person can develop complications and therefore all should be vigilant about persisting or worsening Influenza condition.
The Nipah virus causes complications in the brain and it is entirely different from the Influenza virus, he said.
MRIs Consultant Virologist Dr. Jude Jayamaha said the MRI had used the PCR test to examine several phlegm samples and many of them were positive for Influenza A. The Nipah virus reported from Kerala, South India is totally different from the Influenza virus. The two viruses belong to two virus families, he said.

invest in human capital specifically in women IFC
In an effort to narrow the gender gap and increase womens participation in the economy at all levels, International Finance Corporation (IFC) yesterday underscored the need to invest in human capital specifically in women. IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives, Amena Arif, speaking at the launch of eighth Professional and Career Women Awards 2018, organized by Women in Management (WIM) in collaboration with IFC, stressed that gender equality is not just a social or moral obligation, but also an economic need.
Surprisingly, only one in three women participates in Sri Lankas formal labour force. Increasing female participation will be critical for economic growth
Globally women represent 50% of worlds population, 50% of worlds consumers and as well as 50% of worlds decision makers as far as households are concerned. Nevertheless, women represent just 41% of global workforce. In Sri Lanka, even as countrys economy expanded, female labour participation accounted for 41% in 2010 and 36% in 2016. A recent analysis done by IFC in partnership with Colombo Stock Exchange highlights that a mere 8% of women represents Board level positions in Sri Lankan organizations compared to the global average of 15%. Sri Lanka is blessed with highly qualified women who play important roles in business and economy .
Women are fundamental to transformation of global economy, job creation and sustainable development.
Equal distribution of opportunities, resources and choices for both men and women will also be critical for economic growth and also to create a diverse, fair and competitive workforce.
IFCs Women in Work program in Sri Lanka aims to create opportunities and environments to allow for increased participation for women in the economy at all levels.
Dr. Sulochana Segera, Founder and Chairperson of Women in Management speaking at the event said, Women in Management and IFC, are inviting nominations for the Top 50 Professional and Career Women Awards 2018.
Now in its eighth edition, these awards recognize Sri Lankan women who excel in their careers, businesses and everyday life, while also inspiring others. I believe that we have already achieved this years theme of Taking Sri Lankan Women to the World with the launch of the first WIM Professional and Career Women Awards in Canada earlier this year, to award exceptional Sri Lankan-origin women in Canada.
For the past 7 years, WIM has consistently identified and recognized exceptional women leaders across every level, from corporate to the grassroots and we are thrilled to congratulate the multitude of our awardees who continue to lead the charge and progress in their careers.
As the Founder of WIM, I am delighted that we have become an organization that is taking Sri Lankan women to the world.
Nominations for these prestigious awards are open till June 15, 2018. The awards ceremony itself will be held on August 7, at the Hilton Hotel, Colombo. Last year, around 100 women received the awards for achievements across multiple categories.
Minha Faiz, President, Executive Committee, Women in Management Maldives speaking at the event said, this will be the first year that WIM will hold a separate mini award in the Maldives, from which winners will be nominated to 8th Top 50 Professional and Career Women Awards Sri Lanka 2018.
The Awards in Maldives will be held on July 14, 2018.
Nominations will open separately for Maldivians and a separate judging panel that includes Maldivians as well as Sri Lankans will judge candidates.

Peries accompanied her for most the expedition, stopping at the final camp before the peak. Im really thrilled and excited that hes made it to the top, Kuru-Utumpala told the Daily News yesterday.
It took a lot of courage to go back the second time, she added. It takes a lot of courage to go once, and double to go twice.Kuru-Utumpala said she would not feel completely at peace until Peries confirmed hed reached base camp, a descent that takes about two days. The journey down is really treacherous, she said. Youre so exhausted, your body has stopped digesting food to keep your main organs alive. One mistake can cost you your life, she added. You have to be 500 percent prepared.

Kane named England's World Cup captain
LONDON, Tuesday: Tottenham striker Harry Kane will be England's captain at the World Cup in Russia, the Football Association announced on Tuesday.
Manager Gareth Southgate has shared the leadership role around since taking over as manager in 2016 but has now settled on Kane for the tournament, which begins next month.
The 24-year-old, who has scored 12 goals in 23 international appearances, was first handed the armband for the qualifier against Scotland last June and has skippered the side on three further occasions.
Southgate, who announced his decision during a team meeting at England's training base on Monday, said: "Harry has some outstanding personal qualities. He is a meticulous professional and one of the most important things for a captain is that they set the standard every day.
"He has belief and high standards and it is a great message for the team to have a captain who has shown that it is possible to be one of the best in the world over a consistent period of time."
Southgate and Kane, who burst onto the senior international scene with a goal 79 seconds into his 2015 debut against Lithuania, appeared in a live video posted on England's Twitter account soon after the official announcement.
"It's an amazing honour," said Kane. "Obviously you always dream of playing for England, growing up. To be the captain is that little bit more.
"So excited, obviously excited for the World Cup. I just can't wait to be there and experience it. To be leading the lads out is going to be special. But for me nothing changes -- I'm the same person, the same player, and it's just about the team. We've just got to do what we can and go as far as we can."
Kane's Spurs team-mate Eric Dier and Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson were seen as the other likeliest candidates for the role. The standout star in England's inexperienced squad, Kane will travel to his first World Cup full of confidence after another outstanding season in which he passed the 30-goal mark for club and country for the fourth season in a row. - AFP

Lady with class
It is a remarkable inspiration to each and everyone, young or old, professor or a student, to follow this young Doctor. She is Heshani Karunathilaka, currently attached to the Panadura Base Hospital, in charge of the NCD Unit. She takes special care of the disabled and the youths under 20. Dr Karunatilake has been in the practice for over 18 years.
Dr Karunatilake held her 12th consecutive creative exhibition at the Lagoon View Hotel, Moratuwa, recently. Her creativity began with just a needle and a thread, but with a theme.
The theme of the 12th exhibition coincided with the International Womens Day. The products displayed were handy kitchen requirements such as tablecloths, serviettes, jug holders and fridge holders.
I dont believe, and also not used to, these modern sewing machines. I use my grandmas sewing machine to sew the helm of the cloth. Whatever I plan the patchwork or any design it is the plain needle and my thimble, Dr Karunatilake said.
The lady physician does not use her precious time at the hospital for sewing work. She gets into an empty bus and sit in a corner and attends to her passion. At home, she looks forward to the night to apply the finishing touches. She would go on sewing until she falls asleep.
Oftentimes I felt that my best friend is the needle and thread. My happiness is the outcome of the sewing. This happiness is second only to the feeling I get whenever I see a patient of mine leave the hospital cured, Dr Karunatilake mused.
Dr Heshani Karunathilake is a practising Christian. Whenever a patient enters her cubicle, she would first place her fingers on the patient and chant a small prayer before prescribing any medicine. This she would continue to do whether her patient is Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim. She treats every patient with a warm smile. The patients, on the other hand, get to see the elegant products on a side.

Mangala invites MR for debate on loan repayments
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera challenged Kurunegala District MP, Mahinda Rajapaksa to a public debate on the countrys current debt and economic situation.
The minister who completed one year since taking over the ministry said he wont bring up the corruption and other crimes.
As a former Finance Minister himself, he should be able to debate this with me.
The economy has come a long way since he was Finance Minister, Samaraweera said addressing a media briefing at the Ministry yesterday.
Refuting allegations made by Rajapaksa on the countrys debt, the Finance Minister stated in the next 12 years, the majority of loan repayments came from loans taken before 2015.
In 2019, the government will face a Rs 4.2 trillion in debt repayment, 77 percent are loans from the Rajapaksa era. Of this, Rs 970 billion was only taken after 2015 and 48 percent was to repay earlier loan instalments, he explained.
In 2020, the government will have loan repayments to the tune Rs 3.7 trillion (77 percent from the Rajapaksa era) and in 2021, it will have to pay Rs 3.4 trillion in repayments (83 percent from the Rajapaksa era).
The minister noted that his government had also faced a continuous drought and other disruptions to government but they have also scored many an economic victory in the last three years.
The Opposition has been harping about an unbearable cost of living and people have started to believe this lie told so many times. But in reality, the cost of living today is much less compared to that of 2014 (during the Rajapaksa regime), the minister said.
He noted that the price of diesel, petrol and gas was much lower than during the Rajapaksa regime. In the first 100 days of the Yahapalanaya government, the salaries of government servants were increased substantially- to be specific, a 107 percent increase will be seen by 2020 (when compared to 2014).
The Minister went on to further highlight the prices of essentials such as: white rice from Rs 78 in 2014 to Rs 80 in 2018, white nadu from Rs 88 in 2014 to Rs 90 in 2018, flour to be Rs 97 in 2014 to Rs 89 2018, price of potato from Rs 108 to Rs 100 in 2018, Big onion from Rs 90 in 2014 to Rs 85 in 2018, dhal from Rs 170 in 2014 to Rs 145 in 2018, a can of tuna from Rs 230 in 2014 to Rs 228 in 2018. Sprats however increased from Rs 504 in 2014 to Rs 750 per kilo in 2018.
Some have increased slightly but most when compared to earlier have not increased.
The minister said over the last three years they have laid a strong foundation for a vibrant economy. Government tax revenue in 2014 stood at 10.3 percent was increased to 12.6 percent in 2017. In 2017, overall government earnings rose to 13.8 percent.
Government expenditure in 2017 was brought to a manageable 19.4 percent and since 1992 for the first time in 2017, the budget primary balance reported a surplus.
The Government will be able to hereafter cover all recurrent expenditure on its own.
2017 was also the year with the 4.2 percent unemployment rate, the second lowest rate in history. The government has also increased the Samurdhi expenditure from 3.1 in 2014 to 3.4 at present. In 2018, we were able to obtain the status of an upper middle income country. With a per capita income of USD 4,065, said the minister.
The Poverty Index in 2012 which was at 6.7 percent was also reduced to 4.1 percent in 2016.We scored these victories with a heavy debt burden, Minister Samaraweera said.
He said the government hoped to increase the allocation for education to 6 percent of GDP by 2025 and health expenditure to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next few years.

Addressing the media in Colombo on Monday, he said that the union informed Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera and Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera about the danger posed to free education in the country by the proposed Sir John Kotelawala Defence University Act (drafted in 2017).
This Act violates the human rights of Sri Lankans and militarises free education. Perhaps the President was not aware of this conspiracy to bring in this new Act. Popular and prominent conspirators who backed SAITM are behind this issue. The conspirators are trying to kill two birds with one stone by bringing in this Act. They are tarnishing the image of the Armed Forces of this country, while privatising free education, he said.
We are also against the private medical faculty to be opened at the Batticaloa campus. We do not need Muslim or Buddhist private medical faculties in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we will fight against all of these. We are against the Cabinet paper to recruit medical students into the medical faculty on the basis of three simple passes, he added.

The Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara has instructed the police to take all necessary measures to safeguard the properties and belongings of those who are displaced due to the bad weather conditions in the country.
Due to the inclement weather, thousands of families have been forced to vacate their homes and live in makeshift shelters. The minister noted that while Sri Lankans are generally prepared to assist others in a time of need, there are also certain unscrupulous groups who target these abandoned homes and wait for the opportunity to loot the valuable belongings of these families.
Although Sri Lankans are known for their generosity and helpfulness, there are also a few who disgrace the rest of the people by taking advantage of such untoward situations.
Therefore, I have instructed the police to take the strictest action against such unscrupulous elements and drug addicts who engage in such thefts. In this regard, all police stations have been instructed to entertain complaints about such thefts round the clock, the minister added.
He requested the general public to notify the nearest police station if such activities are observed as it is a social responsibility.
He said that the police had been instructed to ensure that such persons will be arrested and severely punished.

Highlighting the locations most congested, the senior traffic police officers told the minister that around 200 tipper trucks enter the Colombo city daily and especially in the Orugodawatte area, Inguru Kade junction, Negombo road and Kiribathgoda on the Kandy road, traffic congestion is most severe due to containers.
Therefore, they sought the assistance of the RDA to resolve this issue.
When suggestions were sought to address the issue of the traffic congestion, the senior police officers suggested the renovation of the Wattala-Bopitiya road through Elakanda to ease the congestion on the Negombo road and the renovation of the Makola-Biyagama road to ease congestion on the Kandy road.
Accepting this proposal, the RDA Chairman vowed to expedite the development work on these roads.
The minister also questioned the police as to why the points reduction scheme is not implemented to make drivers more disciplined. It was disclosed that the main obstacle is the lack of computerised connectivity between the Police, Motor Traffic Department and the Courts. Therefore, the minister ordered his officers to take immediate measures to mobilise this system.
The police said they collected a sum of Rs. 278 million in fines from traffic violations last year in the Colombo city alone. The police had been able to credit Rs. 2,379 million to the consolidated fund through fines from island-wide traffic violations.
However, Minister Maddumabandara noted that collecting of fines was not the main intention but to take measures to create disciplined drivers and establish a methodical traffic system in the country. Hence, he ordered the relevant officials to implement the recommendations discussed at this meeting.
The minister also said he intends to utilise the assistance of the Moratuwa University in making the transport system more efficient.
The meeting was attended by Ministry Secretary Padmasiri Jayamanna, Chairman of the Road Development Authority Nihal Sooriyarachchi, officials of the Moratuwa University, DIGs and senior officers of the traffic police.

Removal of unauthorised constructions at Mirissa :
MTBOA requests public to aid affected persons
Mirissa Tourist Business Operators Association (MTBOA) Patron Edwin Silva requested the public to help those who had lost their livelihoods following the measures taken by the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department to demolish unauthorised constructions on the Mirissa beach.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Sunset Beach Hotel in Mirissa, last Thursday (17).
The beachfronts of certain hotels on the Mirissa coastal belt resembled a battlefield a week after officials from of the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department, together with the police, demolished all unauthorised structures on May 11, Silva said, adding that the owners and staff of 23 such hotels and restaurants, had illegally expanded their establishments without.
Through the said measure, the Mirissa beach would be more attractive once the rubble is cleared, he said.
Under the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Act No. 57 of 1981, which was amended by Act No. 64 of 1988 and Act No. 49 of 2011, the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department has the power to remove all unauthorised temporary or permanent structures within the coastal zones of Sri Lanka. It is imperative that a permit is obtained from the department prior to the commencement of any development activity, be it for tourism, housing or business purposes within the coastal zone.
The coastal zone is defined as 300 metres inward from the mean high waterline, 2 km seaward of the mean low waterline, 2 km measured on a perpendicular straight baseline towards the land from the entrance points of any water body thus connected to the sea, and 100 metres inland from the periphery of that water body.
Although the department had made an announcement regarding the demolition of unauthorised structures on the Mirissa beach on several occasions, the MTBOA appealed to the relevant ministers, to intervene and postpone the programme in hopes that authorities would further review the situation, Silva said.
A few days prior to the demolition programmes initiation, we held discussions regarding the matter with the Presidents Secretary, who then consulted the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department Director General, the MTBOA Patron said, We requested that the department highlight which structures were required to be removed and provide the owners with a notice of eviction. Later, we scheduled an appointment with the departments director general. However, the director general later cancelled the meeting, Silva added.
Mirissa Tourist Business Operators Association President Donald Weerasekera said Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha said agreed that if the said unauthorised constructions were demolished, many people would lose their livelihoods.
Sunset Hotel Owner Damith Sisira said the department had given him notice in 2012, to remove unauthorised structures on his premises.
They had not specified what buildings were considered unauthorised and we were under the impression that they were constructions that were within 5 metres inward from the high water line, he said.
On May 11, authorities had demolished the seaward wall of the hotels swimming pool and kitchen.
They did not provide me with the opportunity to remove my belongings; they demolished the kitchen with equipment worth over Rs. 4 million, he said, However, the seaside wall of the swimming pool was on the boundary of the 5 meter line. Hence, they had the authority to demolish it.
Helma Gunasiri, wife of Nissan Hotel Owner P. H. Gunasiri; one of the hotels which were demolished during the programme; said, The hotel was our sole livelihood and we invested all we had in it; my husband invested most of what he saved by working as a welder in Japan to commence the hotel in 2001. It was a three-room hotel situated on a 12-perch beachfront land.
The Nissan Hotel had survived the 2004 tsunami and was also the establishment at which the Mirissa Beach Party was held every Thursday, during tourist season.
We employed a staff of 35 persons and the hotel was my only source of income. It is with this money that I provided for my wife, two children, and my 80-year-old mother, Gunasiri said.
If President Maithripala Sirisena considers our appeal for aid, Nissan Hotel would be on the top of the list, MTBOA President Weerasekera said.
It was the opinion of those present at the press conference, that the losses would have been minimal if authorities had demolished unauthorised constructions as soon as they were erected.

Najib quizzed over financial scandal
MALAYSIA: Former Malaysian leader Najib Razak was questioned by anti-corruption authorities Tuesday over a financial scandal after his shock election loss, as the countrys top graft fighter revealed he faced harassment and threats during an earlier probe of the controversy.
Najibs coalition suffered a defeat at the May 9 poll, beaten by a reformist alliance led by Mahathir Mohamad, which broke their six-decade stranglehold on power.
Mahathir, who first served as premier from 1981-2003 and came out of retirement aged 92 to take on Najib, campaigned on claims that the former leader and his cronies looted sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.
Billions of dollars were allegedly stolen from the fund in a sophisticated fraud, and used to buy everything from artworks to high-end real estate.
Najib and his reviled, luxury-loving wife Rosmah Mansor have had a swift fall from grace. They have been barred from leaving the country, and police have seized handbags, jewels and cash during raids on properties linked to the couple.
Public disgust at the corruption allegations swirling around them at a time middle-class Malaysians were suffering due to rising living costs and stagnant salaries was seen as a major factor in Najibs defeat.
The ousted leader arrived at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, walking through a scrum of about 100 journalists.
Najib was summoned by the MACC to give a statement over claims millions of dollars from SRC International, an energy company that was originally a subsidiary of 1MDB, ended up in his personal bank accounts.
It is just one small part in the graft scandal, which is being investigated in several countries. As speculation swirls about an imminent detention, the new MACC chief, Shukri Abdull, said Najib would not be charged on Tuesday.
The toppled regime went to great lengths to suppress scrutiny of the problems surrounding 1MDB, closing down domestic probes, sacking critics from government, jailing those who spoke out and muzzling the media.
Shukri, a long-time senior figure in the anti-graft agency who retired but has been brought back by Mahathir, shed tears at a press conference as he told how he came under tremendous pressure during an earlier probe into 1MDB.

NDB offers special solar loan scheme
A joint study done by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) found that Sri Lanka has the potential to deploy 16 GW of solar power and cover its power demand entirely with renewable energy by 2050. However, the initial cost in installation of the solar panels is rather costly.
To breach this gap NDB Bank had introduced NDB Solar Vantage - a loan facility designed to provide financial assistance in setting up solar energy systems for domestic use and to allow households to switch to solar power without worry.
The NDB Solar Vantage loan scheme will be offered at a special rate of interest with a flexible repayment tenure that can go up to 7 years. Furthermore, it is a customized, structured facility for households that consume over 200 units of power or incur over Rs.15,000 per month in electricity bills, in order to ensure efficient payback on the customers investment.
NDB Solar Vantage offers a host of added benefits including expert advice on tailoring the loan based on the monthly usage and energy produced in order to ensure the maximum benefit to the customer, recommended domestic solar system providers that have been screened and authorized by the SLSEA, free onsite feasibility studies and advisory services from NDBs strategic partners providing the solar units.
The Bank is geared to provide expert advice on tailoring the loan based on the loan value, monthly usage and the energy produced in order to ensure the maximum benefit to the clients.
NDB has made considerable strides towards the Sri Lankan banking and finance sector, expanding and evolving a range of products and services accessible through its growing branch network.

External Debt and Reserves
Need to identify not only borrowings but also debt repayments
A misleading news item has been disseminated in relation to Sri Lankas foreign reserves and external debt servicing, states a Central Bank press release.
The contents of the news item portray a misleading picture of the countrys external position.
While stating that around USD 8.9 billion of borrowings by the government were absorbed to Central Bank reserves during 2015-2018, the article provides no consideration on the significant debt repayment effected by utilization of reserves during the period, which the Central Bank is obligated to as the official debt manager of the government.
Since 2015, the government has serviced external debt of around US$ 7.5 bn as capital and interest payments utilizing external reserves. Simply put, gross official reserves as at end 2014 amounted to US$ 8.2 bn. If there were no further borrowings or non-borrowed increase of reserves, the external debt servicing of around US$ 7.5 bn would have resulted in gross official reserves depleting to US$ 0.7 bn by now. A country such as Sri Lanka, with a persistent current account deficit of the balance of payments has had to rely on external borrowings to build up reserves over several decades. The countrys Gross External Reserves currently amount to USD 9.1 bn. They are expected to increase to about USD 11 bn by mid-June 2018. (Pl see previous CBSL Press Release).
It should also be stated that the countrys debt is serviced over a number of years. The weighted average time to maturity on the USD 8.9 bn debt referred to in the news items is 5.1 years. As of end April 2018, the average annual external debt servicing in 20182022 is USD 3.9 bn. The country, therefore, has sufficient reserves to meet its external debt servicing obligations.
In assessing the cost and benefits of external borrowings, it is important to consider the returns generated by such inflows through investment in infrastructure and basic services. Although government borrowings can supplement investment necessary for economic growth, it is important to ensure that such investment is productive and provides a substantial return. Such returns can be in terms of a wide array of socioeconomic benefits. However, if government borrowings are invested in unproductive infrastructure, which does not generate sufficient returns to repay the debt with interest, the government will have to continue to borrow to repay its obligations. Financing unviable projects using borrowed funds, therefore, results in accumulation of unsustainable public debt. Central Bank purchases borrowed foreign exchange from the government by issuing rupees for the government to meet local expenditure. It is not expected to generate a return equivalent to the borrowing cost of the government through its reserve management.
The primary aim of reserve management is to preserve the level of reserves without unwarranted losses from high risk investments that deplete reserves. Hence, Central Banks adopt a conservative approach in reserve management. Therefore, it is extremely misleading to compare the cost of borrowing with the rate of return on investing the reserve portfolio, as the main motive of reserve management by a Central Bank is safety rather than making profits from its investments.
The news item also states that the CBSL earned a higher return on the investment of its external reserves during 2010 2014 than in 20152017. The high rate of return in the earlier period was due both to the increase in the price of gold and substantial capital gains of bonds as Central Banks around the world cut interest rates, subsequent to the global financial crisis. The latter period has seen lower gold prices and the global interest rate environment has been reversed
following the rate hikes in the USA.
The CBSL is currently following prudential reserve management policies, including obtaining assistance through the World Banks Reserves Advisory and Management Programme.
High priority is being given to avoiding speculative investment which exposes the countrys reserves to undue risk. The risk appetite is being calibrated to what is expected of a Central Bank when managing its external reserve portfolio. It would be inappropriate for a Central Bank to take on the same risk as a commercial fund manager. Accordingly, the Central Bank maintains a balance between safety, liquidity and return in relation to its investment of foreign reserves. The reserves portfolio of the Central Bank is managed against a basket of internationally accepted benchmarks.

New economic growth prospects among nations in Asia
As pointed famously by the great master. Albert Einstein that  compounding is the greatest mathematical discovery of all times, there is indeed a magic in compounding, when applied to Gross Domestic Production (GDP). Its enabling possible welfare impact on human population is what this magic can finally enlighten us. Let us see how it is expected to work.
The magic of compounding rate of growth of GDP
According to compounding the rate of increase, using the old rule of the thumb call rule 70,if a quantity increase at 1 per cent per annum, it takes 70 years for that quantity to double itself. Then if the rate is 2 percent per annum it takes 35 years to double itself, i.e 70/2 and so on, 70/3, 70/4 ... 70/x where x is the annual percentage increase of a quantity. If then a country-s GDP increase likewise, one can easily visualize what can be the outcome of that to the country-s GDP if the rate of increase is 7 per cent per annum, then its GDP would double itself in ten years. If the rate is 10 percent per annum, it will double itself in just 7 years. Take an example, assume Sri Lankan GDP is US dollars 85 billion and it increases at a rate of 7 per cent per annum, steadily each year, then Sri Lankan economy would be 170 billion in a decade and if we can up it to 10 per cent, then in just 7 years Sri Lankans would experience the impact of doubling the country-s GDP, thus taking the high road to high income status within a few decades, to enjoying high living standards, provided of course , we can manage the environment and other possible issues related to rapid economic changes in several areas of production and distribution. People at different income levels and employment would experience a rise in their level living standards, by being able to consume a wider range of quality goods and services, generally satisfying conditions of life and work. This is how a stable political condition, under a strong political leadership to manage the countrys political economy and its strategy for long term transformation can work, countries like Malaysia and Singapore are good examples. This 70 rule of compounding rate can be stated as 2 Q= 70/X p,c. Where 2 Q is the doubling quantity, seventy year rule compounding and X is the rate of percentage increase. The magic of compounding is obvious. However, two important implications for the magic to work itself and show its power are , first the rate of increase must be substantial, e.g 7 to 10 per cent annually in order to get short-term substantial growth, without having to wait for long to reap a rise in incomes, consumption and satisfying living standard in work and life and secondly the increase must be sustainable over time, the economic growth must be on a high level upward path, without serious break or fall. This implies a crucial requirement of an appropriate strategy and economic management, underlining undoubtedly a strong and stable political leadership which is committed and development and steady change.
The success stories of Far East and South-East are there for one to learn for managing affairs of a state. The economic history of the 1980s and 90s show many instances and settings to illustrate this aspect. For example Japan and South Korea have had steady development and growth to reach the status on high incomes within short period of time and both countries are today members of OECD the rich country club.
Economic development and growth
Many factors are responsible for the size and growth of GDP over time. These factors are obviously  the human resources and their quality (human capital), the natural resources, land and water plus minerals and the stock of capital, which includes machines and tools, the infrastructure and finally the technology deployed. Given these factors which are vital for development and growth of the economy of a countries, there are other enabling factors or facilities which help the economy to move upward steadily over time. These factors include institutions relating to law and order, property rights and legal environment facilitating enterprise, technology and education, research and development efforts in industry and trade. Perhaps the most crucial factor is the government strategy and policy in economic management and its consistency and sustainability, politically. It is in this context that political stability and good governance come in to play enabling conditions for the steady growth and development of the economy.
Long run consequences of growth among states
Different growth rates and growth prospects matter very much when we consider world view and what can possibly follows in future. It is noted that in the last 300 years developed, what is now considered as global division of labour and its intensification, identified by economic historians as industrial revolution and related expansion of commerce and trade among nations in the west initially. Following this, led by UK and other West- European states and later joined by USA developed, what came be called the Atlantic Economic core area, while Asia, Africa and Latin America as the periphery, to be much exploited for raw materials, labour, initially as slaves, later as cheap labour and finally the whole region to become the markets for mass produced goods of the of the developed core area.
This was the pattern of development and growth in the last two centuries into what came to be called European hegemony in world affairs. The development was never peaceful, conflicts and wars among them followed in succession, besides the material improvements to living standards globally through new knowledge and technology used in production of new consumer goods and services, distribution and in organizational management. By 1950s change in the affairs of States was taking place following conflicts and wars leading to development and growth of the economies of states across the world, particularly those in Asia, which happened to be the largest continent, containing some of the oldest world civilizations.
The global economic map has been changing continually, new centres of activity and growth, replacing the old and creating new changes and trends in economic development and growth among states. Today for example we witness the rise of miracle economies in Asia, first Japan after the second world war, then the- tiger economies, the newly industrialising centres of Hong Kong, S.Korea, Taiwan and Singapore and later followed by Malaysia and possibly Thailand.
Most recently the re-emergence of China, considered the dragon economy of gigantic proportion and the potential economic dynamism of India. In the period 1980 to 2003 China has recorded the highest economic growth rate exceeding well over 10 per cent. This remarkable high rate of growth of Chinas mammoth economy continued through 2007 until 2008 global financial crisis when most economies dipped dramatically. China appeared t o have recovered fast , to grow 7 to 8 per cent. The export share of Chinas GDP increased from 38 per cent in 2002 to over 50 percent in 2016. Then China became the world largest manufacture- producer, the largest agricultural producer and finally the worlds largest exporter of merchandise and second largest importer.
Following these developments China became the worlds biggest consumer of steel, aluminium, copper, zinc and nickle, hence creating a large market for these mineral producers. Through its labour intensive production and its ability to keep the output prices low in international markets, China earned massive surpluses in foreign exchange thus becoming a strong creditor nation in international trade and investments. It has emerged as the second largest economy in the world and is vying for world leadership. The rapid economic development of China is outstanding in the history of development. Sixty years ago China was a poor country with wide spread poverty and even occasional food shortages experiencing floods and droughts in the country, pressed with a massive population to cope with. This Chinese record of achievement in economic development and growth, in such a short period is indeed unique, not recorded anywhere in world history before. Besides this inspiring China development, today we witness a number of emerging economies  groups, with acronyms such BRIC, MINCTS, and CIVETS, each letter in the acronym signifying a country emerging as countries of rapid economic growth global. For example in the acronym, BRIC, stand for Brazil, Russia, India and China, and in MINCTS, M stands for Mexico, N for Nigeria, T for Turkey and in CIVETS, V stand for Vietnam, E for Egypt ,and S for South Africa. These groups of countries emerging as growth prone economies clearly indicate what the shape of global economic map is going to be, i.e. becoming and not become yet and therefore the key appropriate words for describing the expected global economic map are, flexing and fluxing processes. In fact the global economic map that has evolved over time in the past, display some striking characteristics. Firstly the volume of trade exceeding output production, worldwide. Further the net work of worlds merchandise trade that has developed strongly in last few decades show a growing trends of trading among neighbours rather than with far-off states. This leading to neighbourly logistic developments and clusters of complementary- economic activity near geographic regions, giving rise to development of logistic hubs and promoting of trade agreements and preferential tariff agreement among neighbouring states.
Hence giving rise to a crop of economic agreements among nations in for trade and industry. This can promote co-operation and understanding among nations and promoting world peace. In this geographic setting of the of global economy, the following are note worthy: Europe still remains the world-s largest trading region accounting for 39 percent of global trade , of which 70 per cent is among the neighbours in Europe itself. Only 13 per cent is with Asia and 7 per cent with America. Asia is the second most significant trade region accounting for 16 percent of the world trade and of which 57 percent is intra-regional, i.e. among neighbours in Asia and only 12 per cent with Europe and 9 per cent with America. North America accounts for only 16 per cent of the world trade and conducts 38 per cent of trade internally. The other most significant feature of the global economy is the rise of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). (This is direct investment across national boundaries, to buy a controlling share of a foreign firm or setting up a new affiliate to produce goods. Up until 1985, FDI grew in parallel to trade worldwide but subsequently FDI grew faster than trade. This significant divergence of trade and FDI is attributed to a development of a mechanism of interconnectedness within the global economy in trade and investments involving newly emerging communication technology and arrangement systems in business organizations, the key player being the Trans-National Corporation, which has come to play a major role some economies, particularly those for small economies, below 100 billion dollar GDP economies. The importance of FDI to national economies varies widely across countries. For example in 2012 for India, the FDI share of GDP was only 12.2 per cent, Indonesia it was 23.4, Malaysia it was 42.6, and for the high income Switzerland it was 100.7 per cents of each respective GDPs. Despite this variability the FDI has grown over time in most cases. Unfortunately the inward flow of FDI to Sri Lankan economy has been weak and unsteady following political instability and uncertainty, particularly after 2015.
Investors pursue profits in safe havens is a fact of life. That is why countries with political stability under strong leaders tend to attract FDIs and they contribute to economic development and growth process in several ways. Many economies in the Far-East demonstrate this clearly. Both in technological change and transfer of technologies and market expansion FDIs play a crucial role as illustrated by success stories from Easts Asian economies
Finally it is gradually being realised that the State and its strategies play a crucial role in economic development and growth, despite the conventional wisdom based on the faith of neo-classical market forces. The rise of miracle economies of South Korea, Singapore and now China are good examples to show how the role of State matter very much in development and economic growth process in their respective countries. In all three countries the strategies for development and growth were based on strong political leaders who were highly committed nationalistic leaders. This is well illustrated by the statement made by Chinese President Xi Jinping before the Chinas Peoples Congress. China will sustain high economic growth, will protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign investment companies. China will never close its doors to the outside world. This statement expresses Chinas strong commitment to growth and development in the coming decades together with her Open Door Policy. The case of China shows clearly what a strong political leadership can achieve, in economic development in a short period even with such large population of over a billion people, in a country much of it not so fertile.
The pivotal change came only in1979 and since then the country came to be guided a strong political leadership. The State and its political leadership matters very much in economic development and growth, irrespective of the size of the country. Chinas strong desire to expand its old trading links well beyond its ancient silk route and to spread her development initiatives to other nations is indeed, both praiseworthy and challenging. Chinese President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is a most ambitious project, reflecting Chinas new vision in modern world, perhaps diametrically opposite to what the Great Wall in her history signified. This BRI project planned has two main components, one land based travel rout to run through six corridors covering most nations in Asia and Europe, to facilitate trade and industry flow across countries to link with China. The second component is a Maritime Shipping route in the east and south involving the development of shipping harbours, hydrocarbon refineries, and industry parks in large number of various nations enroute on the planned shipping routes, based on the projects, the development of the Hambantota Harbour and Colombo Port City are part of this multi-nations project. When fully developed and functioning these projects in world trade and industry development would surely lead to a very different global economic map from what it is today.
Hence the expected massive shift of the global economy to Asia in the coming decades. Many a political change are to be expected ,either accompanying or following this shift and the recent political change in Malaysia reflecting the need for strong political leaders of good track records, perhaps signify the new trend emerging in politics of Asia, accompanying this shift in its economy.

New houses handed over to estate workers
The only thing ministers and Parliamentarians who crossed over to the opposition did while they were in the government was to inconvenience the government from within at every turn, Up Country New Villages, Estate Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaram said.
As such, the government was now better off without their presence, he said.
Minister Digambaram was addressing a meeting after handing over 20 new plantation houses built at Fulbank, Hatton to the beneficiary estate workers families on May 20. Each house had been built at a cost of Rs. 1 million.
Minister Digambaran said the President and Prime Minister should march forward together during the balance one and a half years of the governments term of office. Unless they did so, all parties representing the government would fall into dire straits, he said.
He added that the government had now completed 6,000 houses under the plantation housing programme.
Nuwara Eliya District Parliamentarian Mylvaganam Thilakaraj was also present on the occasion.
