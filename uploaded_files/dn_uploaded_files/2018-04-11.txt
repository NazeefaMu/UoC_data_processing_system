Galle MC inaugural meeting suspended for 10 minutes
The inaugural meeting of the Galle Municipal Council had to be suspended for 10 minutes yesterday due to issues in language interpretation.
When the Council convened, Mayor Priyantha Sahabandu had delivered a speech but Councilor M.M.Rihana complained that it was in Sinhala and that she could not understand it. Rihana asked for translation services to be provided to her. She pointed out that her fundamental rights had been violated due to a lack of translation services available at the council.
Accordingly, the meeting was suspended for 10 minutes but it took over one and a half hours for the council to reconvene.
The Council sought temporary assistance from a Muslim clerk working at the Municipal Council for interpreter services to continue with the business of the day.
The Councilors had four Standing Committees appointed with the Joint Opposition heading all of them.
The UNP councilors informed the media that though they had been chosen to work in these committees, they would not be attending their meetings.

Launch of Handbook on Good Governance for Chairmen and Board of Directors of Public Enterprises
Govt envisages new initiatives  to reform public sector - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday revealed that Sri Lanka has suffered a whopping loss amounting to Rs. 25 billion over the years, owing to loss making public sector enterprises.
Speaker Jayasuriya was speaking at the launch of the handbook on Governance for Chairmen and Directors of Public Enterprises. The event was held at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
Underscoring the importance of reforming and evaluating the public sector performance for the betterment of the economy as well as the general public, Jayasuriya stated that the government, since 2015, has taken several far reaching initiatives to restore transparency, accountability and good governance in managing the public sector.
These measures include appointing various independent commissions, enactment of the Right to Information Act and the proposed National Audit Act, Public Finance Act and many more.
Public Enterprises play an important role in the public delivery system. Some of them are essentially infrastructure developers and related service providers. Their development expenditure essentially reflects Government vision and the public investment strategy. They are an integral part of the National Budget and as such, funding arrangements are met from both domestic and foreign sources. Some of the enterprises are dominant players in the banking and financial services industry.
They are trend setters in that sector. Some operate in other important areas such as education, health and social security whilst others are predominantly service providers in the agricultural industry, engineering, construction and trade, Jauyasuriya said adding that; their products and services need to be at fair price while ensuring profitability, viability and accountability of the enterprise. Jayasuriya also urged the need to appoint, non -politicized independent, professional board of directors in managing public enterprises to provide a better service for the country.
Speaking at the event, World Bank Country Director Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough stated the total turnover of 55 strategically important state owned enterprises in Sri Lanka amount to Rs 1.5 trillion, which is equivalent to 13 % of GDP in 2016.
Around 400 State owned enterprises are operating in Sri Lanka today. Public enterprises represent major part of public sector institutions and therefore, their governance matters the most.
However, Riddihough quoting a survey done by the World Bank to ascertain the general public perspective on services provided by the public sector in Sri Lanka, said that the summery of the results showed that many Sri Lankans are not happy with the performance of the public sector as well as the quality of the services provided by these institutions.
She also urged the need for the Sri Lankan government to adopt a holistic approach to instill good governance practices in public enterprises and to come up with speedy and proactive reforms to improve the quality of essential services, cut red tape, and reduce bureaucracy to garner desired social and economic targets.

Guidelines handbook launched on good governance for state enterprises
The government yesterday launched the official Handbook on Good Governance for Chairmen and Boards of Directors Public Enterprises" as a guideline to be followed by Chairmen and Directors running state enterprises.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who attended the Official Launch at the CA Auditorium in Colombo 7, said it was a timely directive by the Prime Minister given to NIHRDC to develop this Handbook of Good Governance in collaboration with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
Public Enterprises in Sri Lanka refer to public corporations, boards or bodies which are established under any written law including companies incorporated under the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 in which, the Government or a public corporation or local authority directly or indirectly holds fifty percent or more of the shares of that company. This includes institutions converted under the conversion of Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Corporations Act No. 22 of 1987 and conversion of Public Corporations or Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Companies Act. No. 23 of 1987.
Public enterprises play a vital role in the public delivery system and are major contributors to the national economy and their development expenditure essentially reflects the government vision and the public investment strategy, said the Speaker. Since Enterprises are established under statutes, their performance has to be in compliance with such statutory requirements subject to the provisions of the Constitution and other laws as may be applicable. Hence these enterprises should be professionally managed, he added.
The President has appointed a high level committee to examine and to recommend nominations to the boards of public enterprises and guidelines have been issued specifying the eligibility requirements of candidates for the appointment to such posts.
The Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in its recent reports to Parliament has expressed serious concerns about the management of public enterprises due to: a lack of transparency and accountability, lack of professional management of public enterprises, financial indiscipline, irregularities, manipulations and malpractices including large scale frauds and corporate failures, non-compliance with statutes, rules and regulations, inefficiencies leading to heavy losses, lack of proper management information systems, ineffective progress review and performance monitoring, ineffective internal controls, risk management practices and audit, delays in tabling annual reports and accounts to Parliament, inadequate disclosures in financial reporting, non-declaration of assets and liabilities by directors and loss of public confidence in financial reporting and auditing.
Boards of directors of public enterprises must be able to interface with all stakeholders. They must make sure that sufficient time is spent to deliberate board papers, especially those in relation to specific development projects and related activities, so that timely implementation of such projects is assured.
In pursuing its key purpose, a Board faces a uniquely demanding set of responsibilities and challenges. The Board must: seek to ensure the financial viability of the enterprise, collectively direct the affairs of the enterprise, monitor and control executive management, meet its stakeholders appropriate interests and ensure its moral and ethical commitment in areas such as bribery, corruption, political activity, gifts, etc.
As the custodian of public resources, the Board should exercise its mandated rights and responsibilities with integrity and in good faith, within the legal and regulatory framework governing Public Enterprises under directions and control of the Minister/Ministry of Finance or the Treasury (Department of Public Enterprises) under the direct supervision of the line Ministry.
This handbook on good governance directed to chairmen and boards of directors of public enterprises would serve as a guide to manage the affairs of those institutions effectively, noted the Speaker.

Indias economy grows at 6.6% in FY18, down from 8.2% in FY16
With the twin shocks of demonetisation and the goods and services tax (GST) disrupting economic activity, Indias economic growth slowed to 6.6 per cent in FY18, down from 8.2 per cent in FY16 (Chart 1).
But as seen in Chart 2, growth did pick up in the third quarter of FY18, rising to 7.2 per cent from 6.5 per cent in Q2FY18, suggesting that the effects of demonetisation and the GST are fading away. And while both manufacturing and investment activity slowed in FY18 (Chart 3), there are some signs of a revival in both.
On inflation, there is reason to cheer. The headline retail inflation rate has fallen from 6 per cent in FY15 to 3.5 per cent in FY18 on the back of falling food prices. But as seen in Chart 4, core inflation continues to remain sticky.
On the external front, there is reason to worry. The current account deficit, which had declined from 1.3 per cent of GDP in FY15 to 0.7 per cent in FY17, is expected to climb to 1.6 per cent in FY18 (Chart 5).
Credit Suisse estimates that it could rise to 2.6 per cent of GDP over the next 12 months. On the financial front, despite repeated assurances that the worst is over, non-performing loans continued to accumulate, rising to 10.4 per cent (of advances) at the end of Q3FY18, up from 7.09 per cent at the end of FY17 (Chart 6).
Bank credit continues to remain depressed with delays in the resolution of the twin balance sheet problem (Chart 7).
The stock markets though remained ebullient despite lacklustre earnings. But as seen in Chart 8, small- and mid-caps continue to outperform large-caps.
The primary markets have also soared back to life.
As seen in Chart 9 the number of IPOs almost doubled to 200 in FY18, up from 105 in FY17, while the issue size has risen from Rs 290.5 billion in FY17 to Rs 837.6 billion in FY18.

Injured Cummins ruled out of IPL, in doubt for England
Sydney: Fast bowler Pat Cummins was ruled out of the Indian Premier League Tuesday with a back issue and is in doubt for Australias one-day tour of England.
Cummins has a long history of back issues and experienced soreness during the recent fourth and final Test against South Africa. Australian team physiotherapist David Beakley said follow-up scans showed he had bone oedema in his vertebrae.
It is important that Pat has time off bowling, to prevent the injury becoming more serious and consequently we have made the decision to rule Pat out of the IPL, he said.
Cummins was bought by the Mumbai Indians but missed the opening match of the IPL season.
The latest setback also puts him in doubt for Australias five-match ODI series and a one-off T20 against England in June.
Pat will now undergo a period of recovery and rehabilitation and we will look to re-scan him in a few weeks to assess the healing, said Beakley.
Following this we will be in a better position to decide on Pats return to play timeline, including participation in the limited-overs tour of the UK.
Cummins shone on the troubled tour of South Africa, capturing 22 wickets despite Australia losing the Test series 3-1.
He was widely praised as a potential future leader for his conduct during the series that was marred by a ball-tampering scandal that saw former skipper Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner sent home and banned for a year. AFP

## Title: Insufficient appetite for Rajapaksa return
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, April 11, 2018 - 01:00
Insufficient appetite for Rajapaksa return
The outcome of last weeks failed No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe has established a few political ground realities. Firstly, it was a massive overreach by the Joint Opposition (JO), which failed to make the parliamentary vote even a relatively close one and in no uncertain terms took the gloss off their much better performance at the local government polls. It was in fact a point made by a JVP speaker in Parliament, who attributed the lackluster JO effort, to the division of opinion between the two rival sibling camps of Basils and Gotabhayas within the Rajapaksa comeback project.
Rajapaksa camp divided
The Joint Oppositions failed No Confidence Mtion demonstrated a stark reality, which is that Mahinda Rajapaksa will never again be president of Sri Lanka. The 19th Amendment has term limits and that fact will never be changed. Even if the executive presidency is abolished, clauses that bar two term former presidents from being prime minister has already been mooted.
Preventing Mahinda Rajapaksa from being number one has sufficient and adequate support within the political elite to ensure that he personally cannot hold the top most office. That reality means that deciding whether brother number one or brother number two (no pun intended), becomes the standard bearer has created factions and is causing friction within the JO. While the friction is not yet a fracture it can get there and has the indications of getting worse.
Further complicating matters is that defeated President Rajapaksa himself would prefer a more pliant standard bearer, totally dependent on him and with no independent national support base, both for his own clout post a future election and to keep the path clear for young Namal.
Accordingly, a GL Peiris or even a Dinesh Gunawardena, whose personal pocket boroughs in the Moratuwa and Panadura areas for the former and Maharagama for the latter, is barely sufficient to elect them to Parliament and of no consequence nationally would be preferred over either brother. Both Basil and Gotabhaya are independent minded and in the event of being elevated to high office, would certainly not be pliable in the hands of Mahinda. All these are a drag on the Rajapaksa comeback project.
Rainbow Coalition holds together
The second political ground reality which the failed No Confidence Motion demonstrated is that essentially the anti Rajapaksa coalition which coalesced to end Rajapaksa rule in 2015, still essentially holds true, though understandably to a slightly lesser extent than it did in 2015.
In 2015, it was Rajapaksa verses the rest and the presidential election was essentially 52% to 48% against Rajapaksa. What the NCM of 2018 demonstrated was that Rajapaksa and the JO has not won over any new allies, no real new constituency, just some of those SLFPers who after the UPFAs presidential election defeat deserted the sunk Mahinda ship for Maithri and are now once again flirting with the idea of switching back to Mahinda.
Consequently, they are running with the hare and hunting with the hound. But in January 2015, the SLFP / UPFA was solidly backing Rajapaksa and he lost. Even if the twenty-six absent MPs voted for the No Confidence Motion, the motion was defeated by a solid majority of one hundred and twenty-two against it, with no SLFP votes. It is still Rajapaksa verses the rest and it portents that the contours of such a coalition can hold and win in 2020. Further Ministers such as Duminda Dissanayake, Mahinda Amaraweera, Mahinda Samarasinghe and veteran AHM Fowzi are all adamantly opposed to the Rajapaksa comeback project.
The JVP which independently backed the candidature of Maithripala Sirisena in 2015, did support the NCM on the limited and clearly articulated grounds that the Government and hence the PM had failed to implement various aspects of the good governance mandate, a charge which even close political friends and allies of the good governance coalition, echo both in private and even in public. But it was scathing in its criticism of the former Rajapaksa regime.
The Government parties as a whole have basically acknowledged that it was non-delivery of promised reforms and the absence of a good governance dividend which caused an erosion of support for the government at the past local government elections, rather than a particular nostalgia for a return to an authoritarian, near racist, and corrupt Rajapaksa rule.
The other interesting point is that the minority parties, representing the Muslim and Tamil communities solidly backed Prime Minister Wickramasinghe. As Opposition Leader Rajavarothian Sambanthan stated, the mandate of January 2015 and the unfinished tasks of that mandate require to be fulfilled and not destabilizing the government mid-term.
The Rajapaksas are great believers that every MP has his price and especially vulnerable are members from the smaller minority parties. Despite near unlimited amounts of money available and on offer, there were no successful cross overs except from the SLFP group which has been divided post 2015 and only the contours of that division have changed. Somewhat towards Rajapaksa, but still less than the 2015 level, when it was essentially solidly behind him and he still lost.
A pledge on reconciliation and reforms
The other feature of the NCM was the occasion, especially by senior government front benchers such as Minister Mangala Samaraweera for a reiteration of the governments intent to advance the process of reforms and reconciliation.
Processes which had considerably slowed down as the local elections approached and other political considerations took a toll on implementing the mandate.
Noteworthy was the challenge from the governments constituent partners that supporting the government in return for advancing the interests of their constituencies was somehow either anti-national or at least anti-Sinhala.
It is an insidious and near fascist political philosophy which argues that the views of a majority of the majority community, which may for its tribal and parochial reasons be less than a majority in the country as a whole, somehow has precedent over the numerical majority, just because that majority includes minorities.
The reality is that now post war, ethnic minority political parties are coalition building on issues and advancing their goals through a process of democratic engagement.
The issues so advanced are those which seek to make Sri Lanka to be more inclusive, pluralistic and accommodative of diversity. The Rajapaksa / JO vision is a Sinhala Eelam, where Sri Lanka is a mono as opposed to a majority ethno-religious Sinhala Buddhist entity, with all other people groups as honoured guests but not equal partners. Fortunately, that is a thesis as yet rejected by a majority of Sri Lankans.

The Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to end the political marriage he is having with Sri Lanka Freedom Party and become independent.
President Sirisena received 6.2 million votes on January 8 which went down to a 1.3  1.5 million in the recent election. He should understand that people have distanced themselves from him. Why has the general public distanced themselves from the President A distance was created between the UNP and the President.
He should end this political marriage with the SLFP and become independent, and secure his honour as the President, Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya (JSS) observed.
Speaking of the no confidence motion which was recently presented against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, JSS Vice President and Media Spokesman Sunil de Silva made these observations at a press brief held at JSS headquarters, Pitakotte yesterday.
De Silva said the SLFP ministers who voted supportive of the no confidence motion should step down from their posts. They should step down and let others who can work, to continue with their work. They should act according to the expression they gave from their votes." he said.
It should have been the UNP who should have refused to participate in the Cabinet meeting today, not the SLFP. Even though the Joint Opposition presented the no confidence motion, it was some of those in the SLFP who promoted it. The general public seems to believe that even the President was behind this whole thing. It is important not to let the country drift towards anarchism. All should work for the betterment of the people in this new year eve, De Silva also said on behalf of JSS.

Kingswood down Antonians 27/12
Kingswood proved there is still life in their rugby after beating St Anthonys comfortably in their fourth match of the seasons first round schools league rugby championship by 27 points (2 goals, 2 tries, 1 penalty) to 12 (1 goal, 1 try). At half time the scores were tied at 12-all.
This match that was postponed due to bad weather and ground conditions earlier was played at Nittawela yesterday. The match began early as 3.30 pm due to early fading light. It was played in ideal rugby playing conditions, and the ball handling of both sides was up to the mark.
The line outs were somewhat scrappy but the Kingswoodians enjoyed a good amount of possession in the second half, in that half the Antonian performance was disappointing.
They lacked the finish on several occasions and fumbled in a desperate attempt to penetrate the Kingswood defence.
Both teams got off to a good start with the forwards playing with determination and the score read 12-all at half time. But the real scoring chance for the Kingswoodians came in the second half, when the backs started some threatening moves.

Lanka hospitals to invest Rs 200 mn for medical centers overseas
Lanka hospital will be investing nearly Rs. 200 million to open medical centers overseas and in Sri Lanka.
Director Medical Services, Dr Sunil Ratnapriya said that they will open two centers in both the Maldives and Seychelles.
We have observed that fair amount of our foreign patients are from these two countries and these centers will perform Lab tests and also felicitate patient transferred to Lanka hospital Colombo as well.
He said in addition they will open three local medical centers as well and Panadura, Kurunegala and Batticaloa have been identified as locations.
Lanka hospital formally known as the Appolo Hospital is also looking at building another wing in their present premises in Narahenpita to meet the additional demand for bed space from patients.
Commenting on the new drug policy he said that they welcome this move. However he said that the government must study the proposal to offer one rate for particular treatment (Eg caesarian child birth) for all private hospitals. This is not practical as professional fees from doctors differ from one doctor to another and other overheads also vary.
He said that the best option in this regard would be grade the hospitals similar to hotels and then it would be easier to offer one health package minus professional fees. Asked how a uniformed rate for tests was offered for dengue, he said that it was done since it was a national cause. (SS)

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday advised the people not to panic over certain newspaper reports on the importation of disease spreading shrimp species.
Addressing the media at the Fisheries Ministry yesterday, Minister Amaraweera while totally refuting these media reports said that people have begun to panic due to some misleading media reports which has resulted in a drop in shrimp prices.
Minister Amaraweera said this situation has also had a drastic impact on shrimp exports. The National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) has taken measures to introduce a shrimp species, named Pacific White Legged Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) for shrimp farming.
According to NAQDA Chairman Upali Mohotti, the reason for selecting this particular species is the high growth rate. The shrimp species currently used for aquaculture is the tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon).
This species had been imported after taking an International Medical Certificate which certified that these species is free from 10 types of diseases, he added.

Mitra Innovation launches  squirrel bucket list app
Squirrel is the ultimate bucket list app, created by former Australian bankers and a travel marketer, that has taken the world by storm.
The app enables members Squirrelers  to create, plan and achieve their bucket list goals in life, set budgets against their goals and have savings targets to achieve those goals.
Squirrel features a highly intuitive interface and seamless connectivity with major social platforms such as Facebook and Pinterest.
The app was first developed and launched as a minimum viable product (MVP) in Australia in 2016 and soon gained a loyal followingwithactive users in more than 60 countries, particularly in North America, China, UK and Australia. It was only available for download on iOS devices however, which left millions of eager android users unable to access the app.
Squirrel founder, Mandy Andrews, said: We ran a couple of Facebook campaigns that went viral and the overwhelming device that we saw being used by our target customers was Android. So, we prioritised an Android version of Squirrel on our development roadmap.
Mitra Innovation knew they could help and were excited to begin work on the Squirrel app. Using React Native (a Java Script framework for building user interfaces), an agile approach to delivery, and strictly following Acceptance Test Driven Development and Zero Dev to QA Defect Leakages the development team made fast progress. In under three months they presented the Squirrel team with a new Android version of Squirrel.
Andrews commented, We are thrilled to be able to expand the user base of Squirrel and be able to offer a seamless experience for both Android and Apple users. It is very exciting!
Dammika Ganegama, Managing Director at Mitra Innovation thinks the Squirrel partnership has been new and exciting. He said, A lot of the projects we get involved in are with big, global companies and governments. Working with an innovative, bootstrapped business means we have to work harder than ever to deliver smart, cost efficient, quality results.
Since Squirrel launched the Android version of the app growth has taken off, said Andrews, In the first five months weve seen our customer base increase 250% and we havent even started promoting yet. We know android would be popular but not even we were expecting that type of growth.

Part 1
The Muslim  Sinhala divide: A DILEMMA
Research tells us that if high population growth is coupled with low economic activity, resource scarcity becomes a prime concern and it becomes an ideal breeding ground for political and ethnic conflict. Sri Lanka has been no exception to the rule.
There have been close to 50 incidents of racially motivated clashes between the Muslim and Sinhalese community since Independence, said Prof. M.A. Nuhman, a retired professor in Tamil at the University of Peradeniya. Prof. Nuhman having written scores of literary papers and books on the Muslim community in Sri Lanka noted that every single time such a clash occurred, it almost always revolved around business.
The Muslims, be it the Arab and Indian traders or the Malay soldiers who came to the island, have for centuries been regarded as a mercantile class in the island.
During the Buddhist revivalist movement and even earlier, this image did not sit well with many in the majority community who were also getting into trade and a new Sinhalese middle and merchant class developed.
Sinhalese nationalism was deep rooted among the majority by Anagarika Dharmapala and that image still continues, explained Prof. Nuhman.
Dharmapala, a Buddhist revivalist, whilst reawakening the national conscience against the British also painted a picture of the Muslim as an alien who profited off the Sinhalese through Shylockian methods. This imagery stuck long enough to be the embers that lit the first Sinhalese-Muslim riot in 1915.
In my point of view, even today the underlying problem is more commercial. The competition has always been between the mercantile classes. In the meantime, the problem has taken a different shape following extremist activities carried out by some Muslims, continued Prof. Nuhman.
Galle, Puttalam and Mawanella
Prof. Nuhmans theory is backed by research done by Dr. Farzana Haniffa and Vijay Nagaraj in Towards Recovering Histories of Anti-Muslim Violence in the Context of Sinhala-Muslim Tensions in Sri Lanka. The study which looks at the political, social and economic contexts of anti-Muslim violence in Puttalam in 1976, Galle in 1982, and Mawanella in 2001, stated, Puttalam, Galle and Mawanella must be understood not merely as randomly localised violence against Muslims but as reflective of competition over political economic spaces.
The incidents of violence in Galle, Puttalam and Mawanella centred on conflicts between local businessmen or traders of the two ethnic groups which later inflamed into a wider ethnic conflict.
Haniffa and Nagaraj explain it thus: The bazaars in Galle and Puttalam and Mawanella more generally were intense concentrations of Muslim trading capital surrounded by a large Sinhalese hinterland. In both Puttalam and Mawanella there were also pockets of Muslim small-to-medium manufacturing or industrial capital and in the outskirts of Puttalam also estate capital, all of which employed Sinhalese as workers. But these were also markets relatively narrow and small and Muslims had a far stronger foothold in it. An emergent local Sinhalese bourgeoisie seeking to expand its economic footprint, with tacit or overt state support, had the greatest incentive in the erosion and displacement of Muslim capital by violence rather than its defeat through market competition. The contradictions in the economic relations between the local Muslim bourgeoisie and the Sinhalese working class provided a crucial locus of mobilisation and incitement.
Hence one way to understand the instances of anti-Muslim violence is to see it as being driven by the ethnicisation of the vertical conflict between working class poor Sinhalese and the Muslim bourgeoisie that simultaneously induces horizontal conflict on ethnic lines within the working class poor and vertical alignment between classes on the lines of ethno-religious identity.
Also central to the mobilisation of the Sinhalese working class and poor, was the alliance or alignment, most visible in Puttalam and Mawanella, between the Sinhalese bourgeoisie and the temple or the Buddhist clergy buttressed by local Sinhalese political interests who commanded muscle power. The involvement of the local Buddhist clergy was critical in both legitimising anti-Muslim sentiment as well as in providing a physical and spiritual-religious locus for such sentiment and its eventual translation into violence.
Economics not so great
Interestingly, every time such violence broke out, be it in 1982, 2001, or even during 2013 when there was increasing animosity towards the Muslim community, they were periods where the countrys economy was struggling. In 2013, the real GDP growth rate had drastically dropped to 3.4 percent from 9.1 in the previous year. When we had one of the worst clashes in Mawanella in 2001, the economy recorded a negative growth rate of -1.5 percent. The last four years have suffered economic stagnation with the GDP growth rate resting around 4 percent mainly due to high debt repayments, low economic activity, and the worst drought in 40 years.
Whilst the attacks during periods of low economic productivity keeps to theory, the question still remains as to why it is the Muslim population of the country that have won the perception of being successful when everyone else is struggling. Prof. Nuhman pointed out that whilst Muslims were targeted based on their economic status, not more than 20 percent of the Muslim population in Sri Lanka was wealthy and this was the same with every community.
In his book, Sri Lankan Muslims - Ethnic Identity within Cultural Diversity, Prof. Nuhman quotes the Ceylon at the Census on 1911 report to show that Ceylon Moors for the most part were small farmers cultivating their own land; 21.6 percent of Muslims were engaged in commerce and more than 35.5 percent were employed in agriculture, contrary to widespread belief that Muslims were mostly traders.
Further for decades, he pointed out, there was widespread poverty within the Muslim community which had led to the low level of education within the community. If you take a walk in the slums of Colombo, there is a higher number of Muslims than any other group, added Vice President of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL) Hilmy Ahamed. But the perception is that we are a very rich community. According to him, it was perception that has become the biggest problem.
You see a small number of very rich Muslims driving around in flashy cars and having big weddings. So people think all Muslims must be rich, he said.
A major factor driving this perception is also the fact that the Muslim community over the past few decades have resorted to isolating themselves from the majority,
The current generation of Muslims are not interacting with non-Muslims. This is mainly due to the education system we have. We have Muslim schools and Muslims find it very difficult to enter non-Muslim schools. Then they go set up international schools and segregate their children. Currently, Muslim children are growing up without knowing a non-Muslim. As a result no party has an understanding of the others religion or ethnicity, said Ahamed.
Director Research of the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES), Kandy, Prof. Tudor Silva reiterating Ahamed, said the Sri Lankan education system was at its core, ethnically segregated.
There is a need for more interaction among young people and an inclusive identity should be promoted, he said.
Without such inclusivity, the present education system, on the other hand, is highly influenced by racial ideas, added the Professor.
However, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who took initiatives to change the prevailing education system met with great opposition and no progressive decisions were made. At the time, it was reported that the former President received criticisms from the Sinhala nationalists for trying to create an equal space for students irrespective of religion or the culture they follow. Today, anyone who wishes to change this status quo is bound to face attacks from all sides of the spectrum.
Prof. Silva who placed little hope on the current initiatives for change, emphasised that there was a huge problem of us versus them and it played a major role in our society.
These misunderstandings coupled with the changing religious and political environment in the country have become a hotbed for ethnic conflict in the country.
From class to ethnicity
The class struggle between the communities has been transformed into an ethnic struggle. Now the ethnic division is more strong and powerful than the class division, observed Prof. Nuhman.
In the late 19th century, the elites in all communities who were ethnically sensitive and politically motivated led their respective communities to the modern era through their revivalist activities, writes Prof. Nuhman in his book on Sri Lankan Muslims.
The dominant Sinhalese elite sought their identity in Buddhism and their imaginative historical mythology and their Tamil counterparts sought their identity first in Hinduism, especially in Saivaism, and later in their glorious linguistic and cultural heritage. Similarly, the Sri Lankan Muslim elite sought their identity in Islam and their glorious Islamic historical past.
Muslim revivalism, Prof. Nuhman noted, was also pushed in reaction to the revivalist movements of the Sinhalese and Tamil communities, and later on, we see a similar trend in communal politics taking centre stage in the Muslim community with the development of Tamil militancy in the North and East.
Their hostile attitude towards the Muslims since 1985 created a strong feeling of insecurity among Muslims and intensified their ethnic sentiment. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress under the leadership of late M.H.M. Ashraf sparked off this sentiment by its verbal militancy with religious overtones to become a major political force in the East.
In both instances, Prof. Nuhman pointed out, Muslim elites were the decision makers  they took all decisions pertaining to the Muslim community and it has both negative and positive effects on Muslims and their co-existence in the country.
The second wave of development of Islamic awareness, according to Prof. Nuhman, came in the form of the establishment of a large number of Arabic Colleges and dawah movements from the 1950s onwards. Jamaat-e-Islami, Tabligh Jamaat and Tawhid Jamaat were all established during this period - each of them proposing a more purer form of Islam to its followers. Adding to this, in 1973, Jaamiya Naleemiya initiated a different kind of madrasa education - it was the only Arabic College affiliated to the International Islamic University of Islamabad and proposed to combine traditional religious teaching with non-religious education. At the end of their education, young boys are qualified to preach in mosques around the country.
Unfortunately however, Prof. Nuhman noted, In all these Arabic colleges, the main component of teaching the Arabic and Islamic component is mostly on the conservative, traditional line. They give more importance to sharia as a sacred and static doctrine of Islamic law without the proper understanding of its evolutionary nature. They do not take account of the ever-changing nature of society and are unable to interpret Islam as a religion suitable to the contemporary modern world.
This would mean that progressively over the years, the spiritual outlook of the community would change and become more insular.
Dr Akbar S Ahmed, the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at the American University in Washington DC, states that the Muslim response to Western colonisation which developed in the 19th century and persists until this day, can be divided into three groups; the modernists, literalists, and mystics.
The modernists of the 19th century sought to adapt Islam to Western modernity and promoted the learning of science and attempted a programme of reform to adjust to the times.
The literalists, the second category, also arose in the 19th century, but instead of attempting to balance Islam and the West, they sought to draw boundaries around Islam. They saw Islam as under attack from the West and attempted to preserve its purity by going back to the holy texts and attempting to interpret them literally. This included attempts to exactly emulate the behaviour of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) of Islam, for instance, by dyeing their beards. The literalists drew their inspiration from thinkers like the 14th century scholar Ibn Taymiyya of Damascus, who wrote as the Muslim world reeled from the Mongol invasions and believed that Muslims in every generation must revert to the holy texts rather than applying mindlessly the teachings of current scholars.
The third category is the Sufi mystics who see the love of God as the reality underlying all things. Intellectually and spiritually they transcend distinctions of religion and nationality. Their message of sulh-i-kul, or peace with all, resonates with people across the social and economic spectrum in Muslim societies and indeed even in non-Muslim ones.
In Sri Lanka today, like in many parts of the World, the literalists are winning the day.
Muslim religious leaders in Sri Lanka are very conservative, said Dr Nuhman. The stalling of reforms to the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Act (MMDA) is the best example of it and they are the culprits. They enjoy all novel technologies, but ideologically they are backward.
The All Ceylon Jammiyaththul Ulema (ACJU) earlier was against English education, but now they do most of their activities in English. Before they were against taking photographs  now they even do videos. They enjoy every technology, yet maintain their conservative stance to propagate their ancient ideas. Muslims give more importance to their religion and consider it as their identity. No one is ready to interpret Islam in a modern way.
To be continued tomorrowThe Sri Lankan education system was at its core, ethnically segregated.

Title: Elmet 
Author: Fiona Mozley
Pastoral idyll, political expos, cosy family saga and horror tale, it reads like a traditional children's story that turns into a gangster film: Hansel and Gretel meets The Godfather' Sunday Times
Daniel is heading north. He is looking for someone. The simplicity of his early life with Daddy and Cathy has turned menacing and fearful. They lived apart in the house that Daddy built for them in the woods with his bare hands. They foraged and hunted.
Cathy was more like their father: fierce and full of simmering anger. Daniel was more like their mother: gentle and kind. Sometimes, their father disappeared and would return with a rage in his eyes. But when he was at home, he was at peace. He told them that the little corpse in Elmet was theirs alone. But that wasn't true. Local men, greedy and watchful, began to circle like vultures. All the while, the terrible violence in Daddy grew.
Brutal and beautiful in equal measure, Elmet is a compelling portrayal of a family living on the fringes of contemporary society, as well as a gripping exploration of the disturbing actions people are capable of when pushed to their limits.

Oil prices seesaw on US trade  dispute with China
Oil prices dipped on Tuesday, easing after strong gains in the previous session when hopes that trade disputes between the United States and China could be resolved buoyed global markets.
Despite a softening of trade concerns, oil markets still face an abundance of supplies that puts pressure on producers to keep their prices competitive in order not to lose market share.
U.S. WTI crude futures were at $63.26 a barrel at 0031 GMT, down 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their previous settlement.
Brent crude futures were at $68.52 per barrel, down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent.
The dips came after a more than 2 percent rally on Monday during European and American trade hours.
Oil prices rose sharply (on Monday) as a weaker U.S.-dollar and easing concerns about the trade war saw investor appetite return, ANZ bank said.
Reports that back-channel talks over the trade dispute between the U.S. and China are ongoing helped soothe investor angst, it added.
Concerns of a prolonged trade dispute between the worlds two biggest economies and uncertainty over the supply and demand balance of global oil markets have resulted in volatile yet range-bound recent trading.
Oil prices remain rangebound with WTI oil right in the middle of the $60-$65 per barrel range that has largely held since January of this year, said William OLoughlin, investment analyst at Australias Rivkin Securities.
U.S. oil inventories had been rising for the past couple of months but the data released last week showed an unexpected draw. This weeks data may be crucial for determining the direction of WTI, he added.
The American Petroleum Institute is due to publish oil storage data later on Tuesday while official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due on Wednesday.
Oil markets have generally been supported by healthy demand as well as supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
However, soaring U.S. crude production, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.46 million barrels per day (bpd), is threatening to undermine OPECs efforts to tighten the market and prop up prices.
The United States late last year overtook top exporter Saudi Arabia as the worlds second biggest crude producer. Only Russia pumps more crude out of the ground, at almost 11 million bpd.
In a sign that oil supplies remain ample, Chinas Sinopec, Asias largest refiner, plans to cut Saudi crude imports in May by 40 percent, instead buying from alternative sources, after Saudi Aramco set higher-than-expected prices, a company official said on Monday. (Strait Times)

Pirith chanting in  Anuradhapura for rain
A pirith chanting ceremony will be held at the Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Boodhi to evoke blessings of the Triple Gems and the deities for adequate rain in Rajarata.
Agriculture Minister Daminda Dissanayake said President Maithiripala Sirisena has instructed him to organise the meritorious act under the advice of incumbents of the Atamasthana headed by Atamasthanadhipathi Ven. Dr. Pallegama Siriniwasa Nayaka Thera.
The Minister said dry food ration bags valued at Rs. 5,000 each were distributed to 137,000 affected families and sediment in 250 tanks are removed at a cost of Rs. 1,500 million.
"An insurance scheme was effected for the Yala season 2018 and Rs. 40,000 is paid per acre for a full crops failure. Farmers do not have to subscribe to join the scheme. Earlier, only a Rs. 10,000 compensation was paid and farmers had to subscribe to get it," the Minister said.
Minister Duminda said the farmers would receive compensation up to Rs. 40,000 per acre for crop damages caused by the wild elephants under the scheme.
"Around 20,000 affected farmers during 2017/18 Maha season in the Anuradhapura district have appealed for compensation, and they were granted Rs. 40,000 per acre. Rs. 650 million was allocated for the purpose. Compensation would be granted batch by batch," the Minister said.

## Title: Power generation   and energy costs   will hold sway in future corporate profits
## Supertitle:

Power generation   and energy costs   will hold sway in future corporate profits
We remember the times where the cost of power and energy sources were not even considered as a key economic factor for the achievement of desired profit targets. With the ever increasing demand for power in both peak and off peak times, especially from the industrial sector and the households, the local power generators are working round the clock to meet such demand by either generating or buying power. The unit cost of electricity is higher than the unit price charged to the consumers in most power sources. State electricity authorities are always seeking upward price revisions to minimize the losses incurred. Increased prices can create havoc in business circles with the drastic effects on the industrial sector which will have the chain effect of many rounds of higher cost of living for the General public. Right now, the petroleum authorities are making substantial losses on domestic fuel supplies. So, it is up io all corporate entities, state instituitions, non corporate business sector, households and the other consumers of electricity to plan now on a very priority basis to prepare solid electricity consumption methods to minimize the impact on electricity price increases in time to come. The prolonged dry weather in catchment areas will add to the problem. During the last few years, the country had to face these dry conditions from time to time and this became a severe strain on the finances of state electricity authorities. Main sources of power generation are through Hydro sources, Thermal, coal, Solar, Dendro, Wind power.
Recently, the LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) came into consideration on an enhanced scale. Major LNG producing countries in the world include Qatar, Australia and Malaysia. The setting up of LNG power plants in Sri Lanka on a larger scale is being considered to arrest the situation and also to meet the ever increasing power demand and of course with the view of reducing the losses of State electricity Authorities. We have to lower the unit cost of electricity supplies also to either match or lower the unit selling rate of other countries in the region and also in other parts of Asia. This will hold key to new Foreign Direct Investments to our country. With the predictions of global oil supplies available only for the next three decades, we have to introduce power from other sources. Already Qatar & Malaysia are into the production of energy from Gas in the run up to crude oil quotas and limitations of supplies in the future.
We have to seriously consider the Economic Growth Levels planned for the next decade in the light of our debt service requirements and local and foreign debt repayments. Energy availability and its prices will have a major bearing directly on the economic growth levels of our country. With this objective in mind, I have written this article for the benefit of all sectors, especially the corporate and state sectors. The corporate sector of course will employ sound measures for power saving while the problem lies with the state sector, where the employees holding a weak approach for savings in electricity costs as there are no compulsions on them in most state instituitions. The households will also keep a tab on their electricity consumptions. We have to wake up now to ensure continued and uninterrupted supplies of electricity at affordable and business friendly rates.
The state electricity Authorities are also talking to foreign investors in trying to set up power stations generated from sea-waves as we have to now serve power to new sea ports, airports, free trade zones, hotels and other foreign and local investors who wish to set up business in Sri Lanka. Further, we now have many TV broadcasting stations and channels, radio stations, cable and satellite TV channels, internet and other electronic and telecommunication equipment or communication and other purposes.
There is lot of opposition to power generation practices which are not green. Public protests in respective areas usually take place where the environment is affected due to power generation. Electricity tariff rates are designed in such a way that high end users are charged more on a progressive scale and a tariff structure.
Office layouts should be designed in such a way that an increased number of staff are accommodated in different departments by the provision of specially designed tables, chairs, filing cabinets and other equipment. These arrangements could be sourced out from either abroad or from local manufacturers. This will have an immediate impact on electricity consumption and will lower the costs. In the alternative, the staff will have to be located in two or more locations requiring additional power sources which results in higher electricity costs. In the near future energy will become a precious commodity for all corporate, business, state and domestic environments. Synergy effects could be made use of, for different departments in the use of office and other equipment, to cut down costs.
In the twentieth century, the major oil producing countries were from the Middle East and from Africa. The production levels have now come down in these areas, due to high cost of extraction and production costs. The total costs cannot be recovered due to lower selling prices. Total costs exceed us $ 100 in certain countries and it is not economically prudent to engage in large scale production.It has now become cheaper to import oil and gas. Oil prices went past US$ 100 in 2007 to 2008 due to heavy demand from China and India. China held the 2008 Olympics and India was in an economic boom. Both countries developed their infrastructure facilities in a big way during this period. World oil prices started dropping after 2009 to lower levels and is on the rise again from last year. This has placed world economies in turbulent situations. This cycle takes place periodically and the corporate and others should devise afloat strategies to tackle vagaries in energy prices.
For the benefit of especially the corporate sector, a number of power saving measures are enumerated below.
Carrying out of a monthly energy audit and making adjustments to usage patterns and times
Reduction of paper usage and print outs. As a result, the expected usage life of the printers, photo copiers and other equipment will also increase
Replace existing bulbs with CFL and LED bulbs. Capital costs may be higher but there will be savings in electricity costs over the years and there will be definite savings in the long term usage.
Use Hibernation feature of computers and laptops. This feature allows saving of the work load at the end of a working day and continue from the same point next day. Scheduling of all work stations to switch to Hibernate mode after working hours and during weekends and holidays
Establish energy efficient practices such as divisional meters, incentives and power saving contests among different divisions
Acquire programmable thermostats. Thermostats have the capacity to automatically adjust the temperature of the workplace when no one is working and present in office, or example during lunch and tea breaks and also during meeting times. This results in cost savings in air conditioner usage.
Switch off equipment when not in use. Common examples are printers, scanners, microwaves, photo copiers, air conditioners, tea or coffee vending machines, as these equipment continue to draw power even if they are plugged in.
Buy energy saving and efficient devices. A cost/benefit analysis be carried out comparing the capital costs with savings in electricity bills to arrive at effective decisions
Look out for small drafts that may leak air. Even a small draft can result in lower cooling levels. Proper air sealing will eliminate drafts.
Control over heating and cooling at desirable times. Keep the temperature 4 degrees down during winter and colder times. This measure will save electricity by a fair percentage.
Minimize usage of skylights. Artificial lights conserve power while skylights are free. Use maximum day light and use artificial lights in dark areas. Use daylight for stairs, corridors, reception, lobby and other areas if possible, which are not so important to the working of the organization and corporate entity.
Employ energy saving features for entire office and factory - educate staff on energy saving methods
Replace out dated equipment with new appliances. The equipment which are not in maximum working order and efficiency could draw unnecessary and non productive power.
Installation of solar panels as solar energy is a free, cleaner and renewable source of energy. Although the capital costs are higher, lower maintenance and savings in costs will more than compensate for the initial costs.
Where the office and factory buildings are located in a large area, planting of trees will ensure a regular blowing. This will become effective during power cuts/failures and will save generator usage costs also
Taking of suggestions of the employees to cut down power costs
Procure tax benefits in the form of capital allowances and buy energy saving equipment after consulting the finance division when liquid funds or cheaper sources of funds are available.
Usage of latest technology to hold meetings. Technologies in the form of Webex, Skype, Tele-conferencing, can make a sizable contribution towards fuel and energy savings. This include travelling, air conditioning and the opportunity costs of travel time and lengthy meeting and conference times.
Permit employees to work from their residences. An employee can connect to office network
Using safe security measures by using the VPN technology. However, it is recommended to restrict this practice to selected employees.
Do away with the practice of providing cooked meals from the company kitchen as daily electricity.
Consumption is higher in using kitchen equipment and utensils. Costs will come in the form of gas, electricity, salaries, food and beverages, water, food wastage, pilferages and of course the cost of capital equipment. As an alternative measure, meal vouchers could be provided to order meals from a nearby external caterer or the provision of a meal allowance which is added to the monthly salary of the employees, so that they can bring their own home cooked meals.
Avoid working during weekends, holidays and after hours unless permitted by divisional managers with the approval of the directors
Eliminate the internet facility from the computers of staff members other than the senior executives and directors as most staff members in offices resort to the practice of surfing internet for purposes not connected with their work and even during working hours.
The above are only some of the points for a typical office environment and additional measures may come into light and practice in other types of organizations based on type of industry they are in. In a manufacturing environment, cost of power and energy will be higher and needs prime attention as there is every possibility of unit cost of final product going up due to electricity and other energy costs going up. The increased product cost may not be passed on to the ultimate customer due to a variety of sensitive factors such as prices of competitors, customer willingness to accept the upward price revisions, effect on niche markets, export sales and other factors. In this type of scenarios it is advisable to cut down on the variable component of the electricity cost by well planned strategies. Fixed portion of the electricity cost could not be brought down due to its inherent nature. So it is the variable part which needs continuous attention both in the factory and at office. Higher electricity and energy costs may be passed on to the customer, if the manufacturer has a monopolistic situation over the sale of the product due to higher quality or the absence of substitute products. However, there will be a point to which the price could be increased as it may become cheaper to import the product rather than manufacturing. This will have drastic results on the economy by way of:
Loss of employment to workers/staff
Loss of tax revenue to the government
Loss of income avenues to suppliers of all categories
Non availability of product in all domestic markets periodically due to late shipments from overseas
Loss of foreign exchange from exports and the need for additional forex for imports.
Further enhancement of our trade deficit. Our trade deficit has been affected recently due to higher costs on fuel imports
Possibility of lower quality imports at cheaper prices. If the products are of a consumer nature, lower quality may well result in health hazards for the consumers forcing additional health bills also
Possible brain drain of skilled workers and staff
Dependence on imported products rather than the locally produced products
10.Overseas suppliers may increase prices at short notice citing sundry reasons.
The above factors show the gravity of the problems involved in raising selling prices of locally manufactured products. The energy price factor is of paramount importance in stabilizing the overall costs and to avoid upward price revisions. Manufacturing concerns should always be engaged in a continuous search for avoiding price increases. The united states of America has now developed improved technology to extract and produce fuel at lower costs. This has given them great advantage over the other global oil producers. Technology can assist lowering of unit cost of any product or service in the long term. It is much advisable to acquire latest technology now and improve the quality and lower the unit cost of any product or service rather than facing competition in years to come. The initial capital cost could be obtained by way of a syndicated long term loan at a lower rate of interest favourable to the borrower. Certain loans of banks and financial institutions are re-financed by state financial authorities and banks. The manufacturers should always be on the lookout for value addition to their businesses with a long term view in mind. The technology to be acquired be energy efficient with higher productivity levels and with a good warranty period and a reliable after sales service. It is prudent and advisable for the manufacturing concerns to utilize a pre-prepared matrix showing the impact of electricity on overall costs at different levels of productivity and at different electricity tariff levels. By this way a manufacturing entity can look forward to the future with confidence at a higher level.
The span of control at both factory and office will also have a direct bearing on the cost of energy. The span of control should complement and support the productivity levels and also in keeping the energy prices under control at different stages of the financial year to achieve the profit targets budgeted. As far as possible, workers and staff should always be employed in checking on energy usage as a matter of daily routine.
This measure will increase their direct interest in the profits and will also improve attendance and avoid all types of conflicts within an organization. Let us not forget the difficult times we had in 1996,where even the clock had to be put forward by half an hour to control the electricity consumption of the country. Energy costs have already ruined the economies of many countries. In summing up it should be stated that Power savings will hold the key for profit targets and continued corporate success.
We should immediately draw up an energy production, procurement, usage and conservation forecasts and prepare a National Energy Plan for the next 5 years at least, until we come out of the current national debt problem.

Protesters descend on Chennai stadium ahead of IPL match
NEW DELHI, Tuesday - Protesters burned merchandise and jostled with police outside a cricket stadium in Chennai on Tuesday, demanding Indian Premier League matches be cancelled as the southern city reels from a water crisis.
Hundreds of demonstrators, some wearing black t-shirts and waving black balloons, gathered near the venue shouting slogans ahead of the Chennai Super Kings match against Kolkata Knight Riders.
Police tried to force protesters on to buses outside the stadium in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, where the Kings are to play their first home match since a two-year ban for illegal gambling was lifted.
The drought-prone state has witnessed mounting protests in recent weeks over a disputed accord with neighbouring Karnataka on how to share water from the key Cauvery river, a hot-button issue in southern India.
We want all seven IPL matches in Chennai to be cancelled until our demands are met. We will also ask the spectators to boycott the match, said one protester sporting a black T-shirt.
The state government had recommended IPL games be moved out of Chennai because of the protests but said they would provide security if they went ahead.
Around 4,000 police personnel will stand guard around the ground. We have covered all bases to make sure that nothing goes wrong, a Tamil Nadu police spokesman told AFP.
The Chennai stadium is scheduled to host the IPL matches between April 10 and May 20.
The Super Kings have also told the sellout crowd that they will not be allowed to take mobile phones, bags or other electronic devices into the ground.
Some state politicians and activists have lashed out at the Board of Control for Cricket in India for holding IPL matches in the state at a time when sentiments were running high.
Tamil cinema superstar Rajinikanth has also weighed in on the controversy, urging fans to support the protesters.
If they (organisers) dont cancel the matches, at least they should allow players and spectators to wear black badges, he said.  AFP

Rosy meets Sri Lanka Tourism to discuss Colombo Tourism Development Plan
A delegation from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, headed by its Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka, held a discussion with Colombo's new Mayor Rosy Senanayake on revitalizing tourism related sectors in the commercial capital.
The meeting was initiated by Senanayake as part of larger plan for Colombo city development.
During the meeting, both parties agreed to develop the Colombo Fort as a major tourist attraction in the city. Senananayake said the Colombo Fort area, with its iconic heritage buildings and newly established hotels and restaurants, had immense potential to boost tourism industry.
She also stated that relatively fresh concepts such as theme parks should be incorporated into Colombo's tourism development plan.
'Most tourists who visit Sri Lanka only pass over Colombo without spending a night or two in the Capital city. We want to turn Colombo into a vibrant place where every tourist visiting Sri Lanka will spend a couple of nights - with good food, shopping and entertainment activities," SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka said, appreciating the Mayor's interest in the tourism sector.
The SLTDA Chairman also added the importance of a comprehensive approach from all sides, ranging from top government ministries to garbage collectors on the streets, to uplift the tourism sector as the industry is well-positioned to become the country's largest forex generator by 2020.
The tourism authorities also stressed the need for attracting new investments to develop tourism-related industries in Colombo, especially hospitality.
Senanayake said they, as the municipal authorities, would walk an extra-mile to encourage such projects and facilitate their implementation.
The two parties also agreed that domestic tourism is another important segment that will drive up and support economic activities in Colombo.
The SLTDA and the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) pledged to work with mutual cooperation when it comes to the tourism development in Colombo and engage in a continuous dialogue on the ongoing projects concerning the industry.

Ruck record as Aussie swimmers finish on high note
GOLD COAST: Hosts Australia produced two astonishing relay fight-backs on the final night of the Commonwealth Games swimming Tuesday as Canadian teenager Taylor Ruck bagged a record-equalling eighth medal.
Olympic champion Kyle Chalmers mowed down Englands Ben Proud on the final leg, the freestyle, as the Aussies won an absorbing 4x100 metres medley relay to finish with 21 gold medals on the Gold Coast.
Chalmers stopped the clock in a Games-record three minutes, 31.04 seconds, just seven-hundredths ahead of Proud, who led at the turn after strong legs from Adam Peaty and James Guy, but just ran out of steam.
The womens medley relay was every bit as close, Canadas teen sensation Ruck turning for home on the anchor leg almost half-a-second in front, only to be pipped by Bronte Campbell as Australia won in 3:54.36.
We watched Bronte come over the top of the other girls in that womens race, so I knew that I wanted to do the same thing, said Chalmers. To do it with these boys is awesome. Ruck, who prepares for races by drinking espresso, equalled countryman Ralph Hutton and Australian swimmers Susie ONeill and Emily Seebohm for the most medals captured at a single Commonwealth Games -- but apologised for being too young to know who ONeill was.
Im just so honoured to win that many medals, Ruck told AFP. I dont think its sunk in yet and I dont know when it will. History-maker Chad le Clos, who completed a butterfly hat-trick on Monday to become the most decorated Commonwealth Games swimmer of all time with 16 medals, was elated with his bronze in the 4x100m medley relay.
It was as important as important as the butterfly golds, said the South African pin-up after picking up a 17th medal. It was a dogfight but we pulled our weight. Its the best night for me for sure.
Australia won six of Tuesdays seven finals as they preserved a Commonwealth Games win streak in swimming that stretches back to Edmonton in 1978.
Jack McLoughlin crushed fellow Aussie Mack Horton to win 1,500m freestyle gold, denying the Olympic 400m champion a Games hat-trick.
McLoughlins clocked 14:47.09 to beat Welshman Daniel Jervis and Horton as Australia won the event they used to dominate for the first time since Grant Hacketts 2002 victory in Manchester.
Mitch Larkin won the 200m individual medley final in 1:57.67 and, having already completed the backstroke treble, ended the Games with five gold medals after leading off the 4x100m medley relay.
Scotlands Duncan Scott, who produced arguably the swim of the Games to win the blue riband 100m freestyle at the weekend, took silver for his sixth medal of a breakout meet.
Australian teenager Ariarne Titmus bagged her third gold medal by romping to victory in the womens 400m freestyle in a Games record of 4:00.93 -- and won an unusual bet she made with coach Dean Boxall.
Dean said if I won, he would get his hair in braids so Im really excited, said the Tasmania-born teenager.
He said if I went under four minutes, he would shave his head -- we will save that for another time!. AFP

Syria 'chemical attack': Russia warns US against military action

Russia has urged the US to avoid taking military action in response to an alleged chemical attack in Syria. "I would once again beseech you to refrain from the plans that you're currently developing," Moscow's UN envoy Vasily Nebenzia said on Tuesday.
He warned Washington that it will "bear responsibility" for any "illegal military adventure" it carries out.
But Western leaders say they have agreed to work together to target those responsible for the attack in Douma.
French President Emmanuel Macron said any strikes would target Syrian government chemical facilities.
The warning from Moscow came during a divided meeting of the UN Security Council in which a proposal to open a new inquiry into the alleged attack failed to pass. Russia vetoed the US-drafted resolution and China abstained.
A counter-measure proposed by Moscow also failed to garner enough support.
The US proposal called for an independent investigation into claims that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime carried out the suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Syria - which receives military backing from Russia - denies being behind any chemical attack.
A team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is due to deploy to Syria "shortly" to determine whether banned waepons were used in Douma.
But the OPCW will not seek to establish who was responsible for the attack.
The UN session was the latest in a series of showdowns between Russia and the US and saw harsh words exchanged between the countries.
Nebenzia accused the US of "planting this resolution" as a "pretext" to justify military action. "We could find ourselves on the threshold of some very sad and serious events," he said. US envoy Nikki Haley responded by calling the vote a "travesty".
"Russia has trashed the credibility of the council," she said. Will there be a military strike US President Donald Trump has promised a "forceful" response, and has spoken of numerous military options. He cancelled his first official trip to Latin America to focus on Syria.
His Defence Secretary, James Mattis, has also cancelled travel plans. Trump's decision to cancel his Latin America trip suggests the US response may involve a larger military operation than a limited strike, says the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington.
Last April, after a Sarin nerve agent attack killed more than 80 people in a Syrian opposition-held town, Trump ordered the firing of dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian government air base from US Navy ships in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against forces commanded by President Assad. Since Saturday's incident, Washington has been in discussion with Britain and France, raising the prospect of co-ordinated Western military action.
A US Navy guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean. What happened on Saturday Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics allege that bombs filled with toxic chemicals were dropped on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital Damascus, by Syrian government forces.
The Syrian-American Medical Society said more than 500 people were brought to medical centres with symptoms "indicative of exposure to a chemical agent". It said this included breathing difficulties, bluish skin, mouth foaming, corneal burns and "the emission of chlorine-like odour".
The estimates of how many people died in the suspected chemical attack range from 42 to more than 60 people, but medical groups say numbers could rise as rescue workers gain access to basements where hundreds of families had sought refuge from bombing.
The French representative at the UN Security Council said poison gas had deliberately been used as it could seep down to the basements. Following the alleged attack, Syria and Russia reached an evacuation deal with the Jaish al-Islam rebels, who up until now have been holding Douma.

## Title: Test cricket the sacrificial lamb for a few dollars more

Test cricket the sacrificial lamb for a few dollars more
A cursory glance at the itinerary released by Sri Lanka Cricket for South Africas cricket tour here in July-August gives one the impression that the SLC is rather keen to make a few extra bucks at the expense of a Test match. Test cricket for them is the sacrificial lamb. So instead of a three-Test series with the current second ranked Test team in the world that would have given our cricketers the much needed exposure at top level we are confining ourselves to playing just two Tests with them with the third Test being traded for a five-match One-Day International series and a one-off T20 international.
The reasons for the change is quite obvious as Sri Lanka Cricket knows that they can never make a profit out of Tests especially playing against a country like South Africa that does not have the same draw card magnetism in this country as India, England, Australia and Pakistan. Apart from these four nations the rest of the full ICC members are commercial losses to Sri Lanka Cricket. Thus if Sri Lanka Cricket is looking at the tour from a profitable point of view then the changes made to the itinerary are quite acceptable but from a long term perspective it would have its repercussions on the up and coming players and their future.
Fifty-over cricket and Twenty20 cricket may draw the spectators and fill in the coffers and the stands but it is not the answer to forming a formidable team to beat all and sundry. Test cricket is the base for all the other innovations of cricket that has now come to surface and is affecting the growth of a cricket nation. Countries like Bangladesh who gained Test status in 2000 have still not come to terms at the highest level. Now with the advent of newcomers like Ireland and Afghanistan to the Test fold one dread to think how far they can compete as a Test nation when the international calendar is overloaded with limited-over cricket  T20s and fifty-overs.
Sri Lanka has been competitive at Test level only to a point. They have yet to win a Test match in Australia and in India having been a full member for the past 36 years. They have never reached the Test ranking above third place and the reasons for that are twofold. One is that they dont play Test cricket regularly as other countries do for a year and two, is sacrificing Tests to play one-day matches. The last time it happened was also against South Africa in 2013 where a three-Test series was replaced by a two-Test and the tour split in two - the first two play five ODIs and three T20Is and the second to play two Tests.
Sri Lanka Cricket cannot have the cake and eat it, either they must balance the number of Tests and one-day matches played during a year or forget about the nation ever becoming a force in Test cricket. If money is their prime concern then we will see the death of Test cricket very shortly in this country, which if it happens will be the saddest day for Sri Lanka cricket.
For years the country fought a losing battle with the ICC to obtain Test status until a messiah came in the form of late Minister Gamini Dissanayake who eventually managed to convince the ICC hierarchy that Sri Lanka should be admitted as a full member of the ICC which they finally achieved in June 1981. However with the winning of the Cricket World Cup in 1996 and subsequently the World T20 in 2014, successive cricket administrations have leaned heavily towards filling the coffers at the expense of Test matches.
This is certainly not a good sign. With Test cricket being threatened globally by the influx of T20 matches not only by bilateral series and tournaments but also by each full member trying to ape the Indian Premier League (IPL) by having their own version of it, it is imperative that countries like Sri Lanka dont forego Test cricket for the sake of trying to make every tour to this country a profitable venture.
Sri Lanka is due to commence their own version of the IPL by hosting a Lankan Premier League (LPL) in August and September this year. The only one they hosted in 2012 fell flat on its face after franchises breached payment deadlines. How far and successful the scheduled one will go is a matter of conjecture.
However the bottom line is that Test cricket cannot and should not be traded with ODIs and T20Is but given its due place in the international calendar. There is a cry that Test cricket worldwide is dying because of countries like Sri Lanka who are prepared to sell it down the river for a fast buck.

U.S. sells guided missiles to Qatar
US: The United States approved a deal to sell Qatar $300 million in guided missiles Monday, on the eve of President Donald Trump's White House meeting with Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.
The Gulf emirate is a long-standing American military ally and host to the largest US air base in the Middle East, but ties have been clouded by a crisis with its Arab neighbors. Led by US allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Qatar's regional rivals launched a diplomatic and trade blockade last year, and Trump initially appeared to take Riyadh's side.
Saudi and Emirati officials have accused Thani's government of cozying up to Iran and funding Islamist extremist groups. Qatar denies this and Washington wants to mediate a truce. The emir met US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday and is due to meet Trump on Tuesday. His visit comes after Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman conducted a successful three-week US visit.
As a warmup to the visit, the State Department approved the sale of 5,000 Advance Precision Kill Weapon Systems (APKWS) to Qatar, including 5,000 high explosive warheads.
"Qatar is an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Persian Gulf region," the agency said.
"Our mutual defense interests anchor our relationship and the Qatar Emiri Air Force plays a predominant role in Qatar's defense."
During the Saudi prince's visit, the US government confirmed more than two billion dollars in arms sales to the kingdom.

USAID, YouLead partners with  World University Service of Canada
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Youth Employment and Business Start-up (YouLead) program signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the World University Service of Canadas (WUSC) Advancing Specialized Skills for Economic Transformation (ASSET) project. This collaboration will strengthen the vocational skills training sector to meet market-driven job requirements. The MoU will emphasize womens participation in the workforce.
USAID is pleased to cooperate with WUSC and the Government of Canada to support productive employment for youth in Sri Lanka, said Reed Aeschliman, USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives. YouLead is a four-year, $12 million project funded by USAID, implemented by the International Executive Service Corps and administered by the Volunteers for Economic Growth Alliance.
YouLead and WUSC Sri Lanka will work together to reinforce the capacity of the Industry Sector Skills Councils under the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training, thereby helping to increase youth entrepreneurship, particularly among young women. The partnership will also collaborate on a joint social marketing campaign designed to change perceptions related to careers in skilled trades such as construction and hospitality, as well as shift cultural biases related to gender-appropriate employment.
The YouLead social marketing campaign will combine its resources with WUSCs widely viewed Ekata/Onraa campaign to substantially increase their joint reach and impact. Launched in 2017, the Ekata/Onraa national campaign aims to address the issue of skilled labour shortages in growing sectors of the Sri Lankan economy by raising awareness about the value and importance of vocational careers in these sectors.
The MoU is not only an effort to avoid duplication between two projects  ASSET and YouLead  but, and more importantly, it is an agreement to build on the strengths of the two organisations to the benefit of the Sri Lankan youth, said Claude Goulet, Counsellor (Development) and Head of Development Cooperation of the Canadian High Commission for Sri Lanka.

Varied forms of  Literary Criticism
Over the years approaches to literature has taken new forms. There are several branches or methods of criticism, literary scholars and historians say.
Take for instance what the New Critics of America believed over a nearly 100 years ago. Their prescription of close readings of the texts has now become old hat in certain other important respects. At present, we look into historical and cultural considerations that shed light on the text we read. The critics of the past assumed that neither history nor culture requires much interpretation. To them, literary works form the central focus of study, whereas contexts are largely inessential to literary criticism. History can and culture can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on our point of view. And our view can deepen and enhance our understanding of the text.
The idea of intentional fallacy (a mistake to interpret a text in light of what we suppose the author intended to do in writing it) is not fashionable now say some critics. The contemporary critics belief that the literary text is its own objective thing that exists independently of merely personal concerns
It is true we still need to read closely and think critically and yet we must take context much more fully into consideration.
There are interrelated ideals involved in judging literature and literary studies which is the traditional method. Great literature is, for instance, must have a universal appeal and a permanent stature. It depicts and reflects life in a variety of interpretations. It is basically an individuals creative ability. It transcends petty politics. We become better enlightened and more humanized people as readers when we read and appreciate great literature. There is an abundance of goodness and beauty in the world that we can all find it and share it as readers of great literature.
The idea of intentionalfallacy(a mistake to interpret a text in light of what we suppose the author intended to do in writing it) is notfashionable now say somecritics. Thecontemporary critics beliefthat the literary text is its own objective thing that existsindependentlyof merelypersonalconcerns 
There is now not only English Literature but Literatures in English. This has broadened our vistas and we appreciate different cultures via English.
I remember a critic saying this: Literature is permeated with traces of cultural, ethical, and political conflict, to say that it rises above these conflicts is to miss out on how it engages them. To study works of literature but ignore the conflicts they address, and often disguise, is to fool our self- and others, too, if we are teachers or critics
One other point that I agree with Dr Jay Stevenson is that--- Literature scholars of today face interpretive challenges every time they turn around. There is the text, the context, the relationship between the two, and the relationship of both to the scholar and the critical context. Even the significance if the project of scholarship is subject to debate. Any and all may be more or less important as a focus of interpretation.
Talking of different cultures, one remembers the Marxist critic Raymond Williams (1921-1988} definition of culture: Culture is one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language because of its long and varied history and its importance as a concept in a variety of different fields 
We shall now see what Multiculturalism means in the eyes or think of some scholars: It is, on one hand, the fact of diverse cultures, within society as in Lanka and, on the other hand, an array of debates over how to understand and respond to this fact. It is nice to be respectful of diversity.
Literature is subject to different interpretations. Context and perspective are crucial to in the literary study. There is no single correct meaning of any literary work or literary context. In fact, literary study, like literature, itself, is permeated by culture, shaped by history, and driven by politics.

Veritas Technologies hosts partner  enablement event
Veritas Technologies, a leader in multi-cloud data management recently hosted a partner enablement event for Veritas partners and customers, together with its partner in Sri Lanka, Avian Technologies.
Veritas Technologies has successfully transformed itself from a traditional back-up and recovery company to a multi-cloud data management player and brought a 360 data management strategy to life. Building on this approach, Veritas offers a comprehensive array of data management solutions for the multi-cloud  ranging from data visibility and protection, to storage optimization, business continuity and compliance readiness.
Speaking during his visit for the partner enablement event, Balaji Rao, Managing Director for India and SAARC stated, We conductedthe partner enablement event in Sri Lanka to introduce the new products as well as to discuss the key challenges faced by the industry. With Sri Lanka being part of the India and SAARC region, we are focused on strengthening our footprint in the local market, in tandem with our partners. In our interactions with partners, the challenges faced by customers in the multi-cloud era, especially with the exponential growth of data, is high on our priority list.
The agility in moving data between clouds is another challenge faced by organizations with the expansion of the multi-cloud system.
Ideally, a company would like to have the flexibility to sign up with multiple cloud vendors, depending on their varied requirements.
Data hoarding is yet another common issue for many companies. According to the Veritas Databerg Report, 52% of all information currently stored and processed by organizations around the world is considered dark data, whose value is unknown. A majority of companies are guilty of data hoarding and strict processes need to be put in place to avoid this.
Veritas provides customers with a holistic 360 data management tool through a comprehensive array of data management solutions. The knowledge, metadata management, techniques and skills that the company has built over the years are steeped in both depth and breadth, for a single service provider, commented Balaji.
Customers are able to receive the technology of Veritas in two ways.They can use the consulting services where the Veritas team would analyze their environment and provide reports and recommendations, which in turn can help them with their business decisions and policies.
Sri Lanka is an important market for us in this region. We look forward to share the experiences and skills we have in India, especially with the banks and telecommunication service providers, with our Sri Lanka partners, to help them add value when they deliver our products to their customers, he added further.

## Supertitle: Tribute to Padma Edirisinghe:

Tribute to Padma Edirisinghe:
We are made of you
A land-line phone number that rings on and on with no one to pick it up. A mobile phone that tells me the number you dialed is not in use. A house with its doors and windows tightly shut. A vague rumour that you are no longer living in Sri Jayawardenepura, Kotte. Where are you How could I find you I searched so hard ever since last September, wanting to place my new novel in your hands, to go down on my knees and worship you, to show you the first page of my book in which I thank you, shower you with gratitude for moulding me into the writer I am today
I never got the chance to do so. When I read the WhatsApp message telling me you have moved onto another world  a better world no doubt, my eyes misted with tears, a dark cloud shrouded my heart...and yet I tossed my head back and smiled. Defiantly.
You wouldnt have wanted me to cry. After all that was one of the first lessons you taught me. Be brave! You can do anything if you make up your mind to do so.
I remember meeting you shortly after your seventy-eighth birthday. You told me then that an astrologer who looked at your horoscope said he cant see anything beyond your seventy-eighth birthday. You laughed, kept your hand on my arm and said, My future is blank after my 79th birthday. That could mean only one thing. I would die on my next birthday.
Remarkable resilience
But you didnt die at 79. You defied the astrologer in the same way you defied the villagers who came to the funeral of your sister when you were young and lamented that the fair one had died when it should have been you, the dark one who should be lying in that coffin.
With remarkable resilience, Aunty Padma Edirisinghe (she forbade me to call her Maam on my first meeting with her) weathered all the storms that lay on her path. A graduate of the University of Peradeniya her career that began as a teacher, culminated when she became the Director, Colleges of Education. She was the pioneer of the Creative writing project for children and the All Island Teacher Writers Club. She has written numerous articles for Sinhala and English newspapers, was the editor of the Royal Asiatic Journal and won three state awards as well as the Presidential Award for the best translation for her translation of Prof. A. V Suraweeras Heimmaruwa.
Her impact on the younger generation of writers was invaluable. For those of us who made that special magical connection with her, she became a lovable, kind aunt who was always there to encourage us, steer us in new directions, praise our efforts. It was Aunty Padma Edirisinghe who gave me one of the best compliments I have ever received as a writer. Once when I confessed to her that an article I wrote on such and such a topic turned out to be rather boring, she said, I dont believe you. You cant write anything thats boring even if you wanted to. This was lavish praise from a veteran journalist whose own writing surpassed the work of most others of our era.
Avid storyteller
An avid storyteller, time used to fly whenever I was in her presence. On one dark night she spent with us in a planters bungalow in Thalawakelle she recalled travelling in an empty railway compartment in the night when she suddenly saw a saravita man seated in the adjoining seat. When she looked again he had vanished. In the morning when we gathered at the dining table for breakfast having spent a sleepless night recalling her story she informed us in a matter-of-fact voice that she had found the French windows in her room which she had closed before she went to sleep, wide open in the middle of the night. It was clear she saw a story in that mysterious incident, in the same way she saw the story of our last queen, Queen Rengammal who as she phrased it hangs in a gilt-framed glass case adjacent to a drawing of the last king of Lanka... She believed every human owns a story. At least the story of his or her life. It could be an interesting story or a dull one, a happy story or a sad one or a mix of both elements. Even each house or a building for that matter has its own story and of course each village, town, city and country...
Those of us who loved to read her columns in the Sunday Observer or the Daily News would know that she had a keen eye for social injustice, as well as an unforgettable sense of humour. In one article she criticized the health service of our country in her unique sarcastic style. In her eyes the doctors today, when we consult them in private hospitals are so efficient they spend very little time with the patient. They diagnosed the patient, she said, from the sound of the patients footsteps as he or she walked to the doctors office.
Among the many subjects we discussed whenever we met ranging from history to holidays abroad to contemporary Sinhala and English literature a topic that occurred often was death. As she later recorded in her autobiography, Looking Back and Beyond she believed the world will go on whether we are in it or not. Generations succeeding the previous. The old gradually fading out and completely getting effaced from the earths surface. No complaints. Who wants to live forever Does anybody wish for an immortality pill Not likely...but will those who have roamed this earth disappear completely, she asked. And gave the answer by quoting from the Bhagavat Gita. An apt quote to end this tribute to a writer whose impact on the craft of writing for the past six decades of our country is immeasurable.
Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all those kings. Nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.
Dear Aunty Padma, until we meet again, I bow my head to you with reverence. You were so great a writer you made others feel great too. You made us who we are today.

Addressing a press conference held at the Organisation of Professionals Association (OPA) building in Colombo, yesterday evening, he said the act, which would be introduced by the Defence Ministry, would welcome substandard degrees to the countrys education system. It would also overpower the Sri Lanka Medical Council and all similar professional regulatory bodies.
According to Alwis, if the said act is passed in Parliament, students from international schools including SAITM admitted to the Kotelawala Defence University, could easily find employment, while state university students would still be continuing their studies.
The Union would not let this happen; it would firm unions of all parents including schoolchildren, he added.

Asia Cup shifted to UAE over India-Pakistan cricket row
KUALA LUMPUR, Tuesday - Crickets Asia Cup has been moved from India to the United Arab Emirates over Pakistans refusal to cross the border, as relations simmer between the arch rivals, the Asian Cricket Council said Tuesday.
The biennial event was due to be held in India in September, sparking protests from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) who called for the event to be relocated.
This years Asia Cup is moved out of India to UAE and will be held from September 13-28, Sultan Rana, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) development and event manager, told AFP.
India has suspended bilateral cricket ties with Pakistan since the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, which New Delhi blamed on militants based across the border.
However India has continued to square off with Pakistan in international events like the 2016 Asia Cup in Bangladesh, the World Twenty20 at home and the 2017 Champions Trophy in England.
The Asia Cup has been marred by strained Indo-Pak relations since its inception when the UAE hosted it in 1984.
Two years later, India pulled out of the event in Sri Lanka, while Pakistan refused to send its team to India when it hosted the cup in 1991.
With Pakistan and India unable to host, Bangladesh held three straight Asian Cups from 2012 to 2016.
Rana said six Asian teams will compete in the 50-over Asia Cup.
India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the five top teams while, there will be a qualifying round to select the sixth team, said Rana, a former Pakistan first class player.
Meanwhile, the ACC Emerging Asia Cup was also jeopardised earlier this month when India refused to send their team to Pakistan to compete.
Emerging Cup will now be hosted jointly by Pakistan and Sri Lanka in December this year, said Rana.
India will play its Emerging Cup matches in Sri Lanka.  AFP

Berendina Micro Investments  Company launched
Berendina Micro Investments Company (BMIC), essentially a poverty-focused, development-oriented, was ceremonially launched recently with State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne as the Chief Guest and C. J. P. Siriwardane, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank as the Guest of Honour.
Charitha Ratwatte, Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister was the key note speaker.
Since 2007, Berendinas microfinance services were provided by the Berendina Micro finance Institute (Gte) limited. In keeping with the Central Banks new licensing requirements, the microfinance services are now operated by a new company Berendina Micro Investments Company (BMIC). By formally launching as a Micro-Finance company, BMIC will be offering an array of Micro Finance, enterprise development and social protection solutions to the low income population in Sri Lanka.
BMIC is owned by Berendina Development Services (BDS) a highly respected NGO, providing numerous services to the under-privileged of the country. BMIC currently serves over 107,000 families in 10 districts of the country, both in rural and plantation areas.
Berendina has come a long way and done lot of work to reduce poverty in the country, over the years. But we have not spoken about or publicized what we have been doing, which must change. We must now take our message out to the people, so we can do much more, getting closer to our ultimate goal of completely eradicating poverty from Sri Lanka, stated Jagath Godakanda, Chairman of BMIC, in his welcome address.
BMIC is providing loans at the lowest interest rate among the NGO and private sector micro-finance institutions (MFIs) in Sri Lanka. (The effective interest rate is 26% per year, as opposed to over 40% as in the case in most other MFIs in the industry). The loan amount disbursed in 2017 is over LKR 3.5 billion.
BMIC works mainly in high poverty divisions in high-poverty districts in the country and also provides training, business counselling, product marketing and business information, required by low-income individuals and provided by a dedicated and well-trained, full-time staff (over 46,000 people trained in 2017).
BMIC has also embarked on few initiatives which goes beyond monetary assistance, one of which is to provide scholarships for the bright children of BMIC clients and 3,000 scholarships were given by Berendina in 2017 out of which 445 scholarships were funded by BMIC).
Another feature is providing cash grants in the event of hospitalization and for funerals (more than 4,000 families supported in 2017).
"All the services offered by us such as the loans, training and capacity building, social benefit schemes and savings will be started after the obtaining of the licence from the Central Bank are Micro Investment opportunities for the poor and low income people commented Anura Attapattu, Chairman of Berendina Development Services (Gte) Ltd., & Berendina Employment Center (Gte) Ltd.
The profits earned by BMIC are possibly very much lower than many other MFIs, due to the low interest rate charged for loans and the cost of various additional services provided by BMIC.

Burying the hatchet
The No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and its aftermath is still causing reverberations within the unity government, throwing it into further confusion. The UNP is sticking to its guns and wouldn't settle for anything less than the resignation of the 16 ministers, state ministers deputy ministers who voted for the motion to oust the Premier. The SLFP/UPFA, on the other hand, is a divided house, with some members in favour of continuing with the unity government while others have opted to quit, despite the President's determination to stick to the status quo. It is also reported that those wishing to opt out were in a majority though they have vowed to remain with the SLFP under the leadership of the President and function as an opposition group in parliament, as opposed to joining hands with the Joint Opposition.
Bringing matters to a head, all Cabinet ministers in the SLFP faction of the unity government were to boycott the first Cabinet meeting, post NCM, yesterday in an expression of solidarity with the 6 SLFP ministers who voted for the NCM, on account of the UNP's determined efforts to oust them, according to UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. In the same breath he says that the unity government will continue under a new lease, with added strength, following the New Year, where immediate steps will be taken to fulfill all the promises made to the people. He also said that the prevailing uncertainty in governance is not good for the country and therefore a speedier solution was vital for them to move on, adding that the President was expected to give his consent to the rebel SLFP ministers to resign from their portfolios (they were insistent that only the President could remove them) in a bid to resolve the political uncertainty that has developed since the defeat of Wednesday's No Confidence Motion.
It is not clear if Minister Amaraweera will also be among the SLFP ministers who will be boycotting the Cabinet meeting, in a bid to express solidarity with his colleagues. If that is the case, the government will be further pushed back from effecting speedy solutions to the problems affecting the country, as desired by the President. Boycotting Cabinet meetings, by ministers, is a serious issue and can only deepen the existing fissures between the partners of the unity government. As we mentioned in these spaces yesterday, time is running out for the government to meet its pledges made to the masses at the elections. A Cabinet boycott by a section of ministers can only delay development work and hamper progress.
A divided Cabinet is also not going to inspire investor confidence and the stock market is bound to take a further beating and the rupee plummet still more vis-a-vis the dollar. In any event, the renegade ministers have already hinted at stepping down, within this week. Hence, there is no logic in Minister Amaraweera's claim that the boycott is to express solidarity with them. Besides, these ministers were working at cross purposes while remaining in the government, undermining the authority of not only the Prime Minister but also the President, who is the head of the government. Like Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said, the right course for them to have adopted was to step down immediately after the defeat of the NCM, since thereafter they could not morally claim to be members of the government, whether the President wanted them to stay or otherwise.
It is hoped that the new dispensation that will emerge following the New Year will get its act together and work in unity to deliver on the pledges made to the people. With the exit of the disruptive elements that was a stumbling block for the smooth running of the administration, the President and Prime Minister, no doubt, will have a clear field to implement their programme of work for the benefit of the populace. The squabbling within the government had not only made it lose focus but also brought the state apparatus to a standstill and the public thrown into a state of confusion.
While the SLFP half of the unity government is thus cleansed, it is also incumbent on the UNP to not make things difficult for the Prime Minister. Regrettably, the Grand Old Party which was once a monolith, known for its discipline and integrity, under leaders such as J.R. Jayewardene and R. Premadasa, has today developed fractious tendencies. One cannot recall the existence of the likes of the Range Bandaras and Thevarapperumas in the heyday of the UNP where the leadership was challenged. It is vital that discipline be restored within the party, to go hand in hand with the reforms programme currently underway. All party MPs should speak with one voice and abide by the decisions of the leadership.
Now that a new course in the UNP-SLFP relationship is about to be chartered, post New Year, and the warring parties ready to bury the hatchet, it is hoped that all those involved in the January 8 revolution would join hands with the new order to take the country forward and towards progress.

President Maithripala Sirisena had informed Cabinet of his intent to make a reshuffle before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
The President had made an indication that the subjects of ministries would be re-organised in a scientific manner during the Cabinet reshuffle.
A Cabinet minister, who took part at the meeting yesterday, told the Daily News that there are proposals to merge several ministry subjects to bring all relevant institutions under one arm. Accordingly, it has been proposed to amalgamate the Education, Higher Education and Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministries.
Similarly there was a discussion to combine the two Ministries handling the subjects of plantations. There is preference for the merging of the National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry and Reconciliation Ministry as those are inter-connected, he said.
The President stated that he wont be able to celebrate the Sinhala New Year with a free mind without completing the Cabinet reshuffle and re-stressing the path of Government, he added.
No SLFP minister took part in the Cabinet meeting yesterday in line with the SLFP Central Committee decision on Monday night.The Cabinet meeting, chaired by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, commenced at around 10 am at the Presidential Secretariat with the participation of ministers representing the UNF and lasted for about one and half hours.
This was the first Cabinet meeting following the defeat of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the PM in Parliament on April 4, during which 16 SLFP members in the Government ranks including six Cabinet Ministers voted in favour of the motion. The SLFP Central Committee chaired by the President was unable to reach a collective agreement on the partys future course of action during late night talks on Monday. The SLFP CC is to meet again today at 7 pm to reach a final decision as to whether they remain or quit the National Government.
A meeting between Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and UNF leaders has also been scheduled for 11 am today.
Following the Cabinet meeting Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said the President and Prime Minister will sort out the existing problems of the Government in the next couple of days.
Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera told the media that the UNF is ready to work together with the SLFP faction which prefers to stay with the Government.

Work to rule protest by CEB Engineers Union
It is reported the CEB Engineers Union is threatening to go on a partial strike  work to rule, which doesnt appear to be a strike. The Work to Rule by other trade unions such as the GMOA demanding wage increases embarrasses the government.
In this case, the CEB Engineers Union is accusing the authorities for the non-responsive attitude with regard to their proposals on executing Long Term Generation plants and Liqueified Natural Gas (LNG) power plants.
The serious allegation appears when it says CEB authorities show a lethargic attitude to install a long term power generation plants but are interested in plans to buy electricity from profiteering private companies and gain commissions. This question of approving the Long Term, Least Cost Generation Plant has been going on for years with no solution due to PUCSL interferences and also various consultants and experts advising the President, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Power and Energy separately, pulling in different directions.
The CEB Engineers Union appears to be genuinely interested in serving its consumers, help the national economy and also its own establishment (CEB) by pressurising the authorities to accept the Generation plant.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylons innovative and refreshing use of social media to engage with target audiences has won the Bank the prestigious accolade of Social Media Brand of the Year 2018 from the Asian Customer Engagement Forum (ACEF). 
This special category award was presented to the Bank at ACEFs 7th Global Customer Engagement Forum & Awards in Mumbai on April 7. More than 620 entries were received from around the world for the different categories of awards, but Commercial Bank submitted just one and won its category. 
The award recognises Commercial Banks prodigious success in engaging with potential and existing customers with a largely non-commercial approach on five social media and messaging platforms  Facebook, Viber, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn. 
We are delighted to win this award because it illustrates our ability to effectively adapt to changing trends, Commercial Bank Managing Director Jegan Durairatnam said. Banks used to be viewed as conservative and traditional, but the phenomenon of social media has made it imperative that we learn very quickly how to use such media to reach out to next generation customers in particular. 
Jettisoning the messaging approach it adopts with traditional media, Commercial Bank has carved a unique niche within the social media space to reach relatively younger audiences with inspirational concepts.
Instead of promoting its products and services via Facebook in particular, the Bank provided an opportunity for fans to interact with it by two-way communication, providing relevant, useful and motivational information that would make a difference in their lives.
According to the Bank, this resulted in Commercial Banks Facebook Page achieving the highest organic engagement ratios for a Bank in Sri Lanka.

Committee to propose common salary structure for non academic staff
An independent committee will be appointed by Higher Education Minister Kabhir Hashim to propose a common salary structure for the university non academic staff that is on strike over several demands.
The Co-Chairman of the University Joint Trade Unions Alliance Gayan Nimesh Perera said the independent committee is to forward its proposals to the minister within three months.
Perera was speaking at a press brief held at the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya headquarters in Pitakotte yesterday.
He said that 98% of the issues raised by the strikers have been met with solutions following a series of meetings held with Minister Hashim and other responsible parties. The strikers are not agreeing with the 10% salary arrears being given from April onwards. They want it to be given from January this year. That is one issue.

The Postal Department will establish an e-commerce platform to sell products from the village to the world. The project is known as Beyond Post and will come under the domain www.bepost.lk
The Be Post system will be implemented soon. It will connect the online community of the world to the villages, said Postal Minister M. H. A. Haleem.
He was addressing the press at the Postal Headquarters, yesterday.
The project is implemented by the Postal Department without any motive for profit, said Postmaster General D. L. P. R. Abeyratne. We can also fulfill 14 of the Sustainable Development goals through this project. Entrepreneurs will be able to sell their homemade products such as food, clothing, handy craft items and sweets. We will not keep a big profit margin because the Postal Department is not profit motivated, he said.
The project will be launched with the cooperation of the National Enterprise Development Authority.
We have over 300 development officers working in villages and they will recognize and provide the entrepreneurs to us. The entrepreneurs will be monitored during the first six months and if the authority is satisfied with the quality, the authority will provide the entrepreneurs with the SLSI certificate and a certificate for Good Manufacturing Practice, said National Enterprise Development Authority Director Lakshman Wijewardana.
When asked about funding, the Postmaster stated that no state funding was used for this project and the project will be a public-public partnership between the Posts Ministry and the National Enterprise Development Authority.

EU Parliament delegation visits BOI Katunayake zone
A delegation consisting of 6 members of the European Parliament visited the Katunayake Export Processing Zone following an invitation by the Management of Board of Investment of Sri Lanka(BOI).
The delegation consisting of Jan Zahradil Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and Leader, MrSajjad H Karim( MEP), Paul Rubing(MEP), David Martin (MEP), David Campbell Bannerman (MEP), Ramon Tremosa-i-Balcells (MEP), officials of the EU including MarttiKalaus, Andrea Cepova-Fourtoy, Felix Lutz, UrsaPondelekas well as representatives of the European Union Embassy in Sri Lanka such as Roshan Lyman.
The visit was coordinated by Roshan Lyman, Deputy Political, Trade and Commercial section EU mission in Colombo with Nilupul de Silva, Director (Promotion), Dilip S Samarasinghe, Director (Media and Publicity), Himali Urugodawatte, Director (Legal) Industrial Relations of the BOI.
The visit began with a briefing at the BOI Administration office by M K D Lawrance, Acting Executive Director (Zones) whospoke on the role of the Export Processing Zones within the BOI. Thereafter Himali Urugodawatte made a presentation on the Katunayake Export Processing Zone.
BOI also arranged for the delegation to visit several factories. The first was to the factory of M/s Flintec Transducers (Pvt) Ltd which is engaged in the manufacture Sensorsused in weighting scales. This company located at KEPZ is a Swedish investment and manufactures advanced components using high technology methods.This was followed by an inspection visit to M/s Global Sports Sri Lanka (Pvt) Ltd factory that is involved in manufacturing Kites, sails and kite bars.
The company is an important player that manufactures for industry leaders such as North Kite boarding and North Windsurfing.
GSL has a workforce of 650 skilled workers. The company managers stated to the Parliamentarians that since Sri Lanka is just 8 North of the Equator easy access to markets for such products was a key selling point. GSL has supplied 29,000 kites, 13,000 sails and 24,000 kite bars to 46 countries.
This company is an Austrian investment and also promotes these leisuresportsin Sri Lanka notably in Kalpitiya and in the Eastern Province. The final visit of the delegation was to the M/s MAS Active Trading (Pvt) Ltd and M/s MAS Kreeda Nirmaana Division which is engaged in the manufacture of sportswear and also the designs of sportswear for leading brands.
British MEP for North West England Sajjad Karim stated One of the ideas that many in Europehold is that manufacture is really entered in the West and not done entirely in Asia and in particular countries such as Sri Lanka. However, we have seen with our own eyes that this is not a case and that in some instances even R & D is being conducted in Sri Lanka, which implies that new products will be developedhere in the future.
Kareem further stated thatwhen referring to the MAS Kreeda Nirmaana Division that he was reminded of Lancashire in the United Kingdom, where he had grown up, which had once been a leading global centerof apparel manufacture. That industry, he added, was now relocated in Asia in countries such as Sri Lanka and he said that he was enthusedby seeing high standards of production in Sri Lanka.
David Martin British MEP for Scotland added the Economic Zones of BOI housewithoutdoubt the cutting edge of Sri Lankasindustry but their very high standards should not be an exception. They should be the norm for all industry in the country. David Martin also added the factories of BOI which the delegation visitedwere clean and dedicated in maintaining high standards and the quality of their products.
Ramon Tremosa-i-Balcells (MEP), from Barcelona/Spain stated I enjoyed particularly the visit to the MAS Kreeda Nirmana Division which combined in its corporate imageon the one hand Sri Lankan tradition and on the other hand modernity and high technological standards. It is alsovery clear that Sri Lankas industry treats its workers well and is not exploitative.
The visit to the Katunayake Export Processing Zone therefore provided for the European Parliament with a very clear insight into Sri Lanka potential and also highlighted the very high standards maintained in the country in general and more specifically in the BOIs Export Processing Zones.
