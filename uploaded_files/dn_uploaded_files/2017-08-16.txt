GMOU against private medical education
The Grade Medical Officers Union (GMOU) opposed private medical education including SAITM and Kothalawala Defence Universitys Medical Faculty. Talented university students do not have money to obtain private medical education, GMOU Secretary Dr. Niroshan Premaratne said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the organisations, groups and persons who oppose SAITM has hidden agendas. Their opposition is fake. But the GMOU is against all types of private medical education, including the Medical Faculty at Kothalawala Defence University. Other organisations did not utter a word against Kothalawala Defence University when the Medical Ordinance was amended, the GMOU Secretary said.
According to Dr. Premaratne, some do not oppose private medical education if required standards are met, but the GMOU is against all types of private medical education. Sri Lanka does not need private medical education. The country is not matured enough to have private medical educational institutions, he said.
The GMOU held discussions with the then Finance Minister and managed to include in 2015 Budget proposals that `the government assists private medical education except private medical faculties, Dr. Premaratne said.

SLMC slashes surgical part from GMOs licence
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) issued the licence to Grade Medical Officers to practise medicine and surgical procedures. But after 2004, the SLMC issued the licence only to practise medicine. It dropped the surgical part from the licence, Grade Medical Officers Union (GMOU) Chairman Dr. Ruchira Saranapala said.
He was speaking at a press conference held at the CSR in Colombo yesterday.
The Grade Medical Officers Union (GMOU) has presented 12 demands to the Government, he said.
Over 90 percent of the doctors are Grade Medical Officers, but some associations put us forward, obtain various privileges and share them among their officials and consultants. They fight for irrelevant matters but not for the issues of doctors, he said.
Dr. Saranapala said the GMOU supported around 15 doctors to regain their benefits. They had been the victims of revenge. Now all doctors transfers are done through the Public Service Commission . In the past, doctors were given negligible increments and at one time, it was only five rupees, he said.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, being a doctor, understands doctors issues well. He is a former trade union leader and knows hardships that doctors undergo. He was able to win several benefits for doctors in the past. Vehicle permit and private channeling are but two of them, he said.

Anura Tennekoons impeccable technique
ANURA TENNEKOON was in a class of his own: stylish, elegant and graceful. He stood tall and scored a lot of runs during the Pre-Test cricket era and did his school , S.Thomas College, Mount Lavinia, his club Sinhalese Sports Club and then his Country Sri Lanka proud.
A right handed batsman, he wielded the straightest of bats when at the wicket and safeguarded his wicket as though his life depended on it. He jealously guarded his wicket, made bowlers work hard for his prized scalp and scored runs on a regular basis for school, club and country.
TENNEKOON had all the strokes from the book with the on drove being his main scoring stroke.. He had his early polishing that is so vital for progress from that famous coach of that era at St. Thomas' the famous and likeable Lassie Abeywardena from whose stables came out several winners and of whom cricketers, who went through his teaching and showing ,still talk about.
Basics from Abeywardena
After learning his basics from Abeywardena at the beginning of his career, he had the good fortune of coming under that, arguably that coach of coaches who every cricketer would have been yearning to have a stint under ----with Bertie Wijesinha, also a proud, distinguished and illustrious Old Thomian. Bertie made ANURA the complete cricketer. The writer was one of the fortunate few to be blessed with Wijesinhas coaching at St.Bens in the early 1960s when WIJESINHA had a successful run for a few years.
TENNEKOON who had a successful run in school cricket was also winner of the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. His batting was well organized, disciplined and the hall mark was that he always offered a straight bat and it is a far cry from the modern day batsmen who play some weird and ungainly looking strokes like the reverse sweep, switch hit, the scoop or the helicopter shot.
TENNEKOON is the only cricketer to captain the country in two World Cups played in England  the inaugural one in 1975 and the second one in 1979. That is a record he can certainly be proud of. The right hand batsman who was also a hawk eyed fielder close to the wicket was born in the sacred city of Anuradhapura before moving to Colombo and gaining admission to STCML where he grew in stature and where in cricket he began to show signs of being one o the best batsmen produced by the country.
Baptism of fire
TENNEKOONS baptism of fire in the big league came when he was still not out of his teens. After his harvest of runs in school cricket the selectors noticing his unlimited batting talent pitted him as a 19-year old schoolboy against Mike Smiths MCC team in 1965 in a one dayer.
Although making an unbeaten 4 runs batting in the middle order, the experience he gained from that first big game and the atmosphere in the dressing room and the pressure on the field was enormous and stood him in good stead for the remainder of his career that stretched for 14 years, captaining the country for five years.
TENNEKOON had the rare ability to concentrate for long periods when striking. In addition, his technique was exemplary and playing long and big innings came naturally to him. From batting in the middle he moved to the number three position that is the most difficult position to bat in, because most times you have to face the new ball. His approach, technique, immense concentration and the ability to withstand pressure and thirst for runs which was unquenchable made him the man for that responsible position.
Momentous and memorable
Of the many big innings and the bagful of runs TENNEKOON scored in his glittering international career as batsman and captain for five years was the momentous and memorable unbeaten 169 he scored. This was against a strong Indian team led by one of Indias most successful captains Ajit Wadekar in a Test match at his home ground SSC when Sri Lanka was facing a certain innings defeat.
As Captain with trust, responsibility and determination he defied a strong Indian attack led by paceman Panduran Slagaocar which innings saved the country from the ignominy of an innings defeat. In his long innings which was faultless he had good support coming from his school and SSC team mate the all rounder one and only H.S.Mevan Pieris who kept his end up with a stubborn, high class defence and Old Nalandian Jayantha Seneviratne another eye catching batsman who supported TENNEKOON. Pieris later on came to be tagged the king of swing.
Then TENNEKOON excelled in that famous Prudential World Cup game against Australia partnering Michael Tissera and facing the life threatening pace of Denis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in 1975. Australia had made 328 and reply Sri Lanka made 276 for 4 in 60 overs. Had not Thomson struck out Sunil Wettimuny and Duleep Mendis the margin of defeat would not have been that big. TENNEKOON missed a half ton and Tissera scored a half century.
Enough is enough
TENNEKOON said enough is enough after playing for the country for 14 years. However he continued to serve the game and was the first manager when Sri Lanka made their first tour to Pakistan in 1982 after gaining Test status. His assistant was my school team mate Ranjit Fernando and I had the honour of being the first journalist to tour with the team describing the tour for the Daily Mirror, Times and Sunday Times.
TENNEKOON also added administrative feathers to his cricketing cap by being a selector, chairman of selectors, secretary of the Cricket Board, Chief Executive Officer of the Cricket Foundation and CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket.
I would like to modestly mention I had the opportunity of playing against TENNEKOON in two games. Firstly at the SSC in a Sara Trophy game between SSC and Saracens. When I had made 32 he caught me in the slips when I edged a bowler off my kind leg spinner Lareef Idroos. That game ended in an exciting draw in favour of Saracens with Mevan Pieris holding the fort with a stubborn unbeaten innings.
As ANURA TENEKOON strode the cricketing fields, he distinguished himself as a Gentleman Cricketer who naturally fits in today as a classy cricket Legend that generations will remember

The besieged and the besiegers
The besieged and the besiegers
King Sitawaka Rajasinghe made a determined effort to drain the lake into the marshes on the east of the city by cutting a deep ditch across the elevated land that separated the lake from the marshes. This he finally accomplished, stranding the vessels in the lake.
He delivered several attacks on the city with all his forces, but the defenders succeeded in repelling them. A mine was dug from the Sinhalese lines to the bastion of St. Sebastian, but the besieged countermined it; and this led to constant and almost daily encounters in which, however, the Portuguese always managed to thwart the plans of the besiegers.
Constant warfare 
The city is cut off from provisions, the people were faced with famine, but the authorities in India dispatched supplies which helped the city to hold out expeditions were also sent out from Colombo to ravage the towns on the coast and bring provisions.
When the siege had thus lasted a year and ten months and both the besieged and besiegers were worn out by the constant warfare. Mathias de Albuquerque arrived in Colombo with a force of 300 Portuguese determined to dislodge the enemy.
The Portuguese sallied out in several detachments from different directions simultaneously and fell upon the encampments of Rajasinghe. When several Sinhalese generals and captains were killed, the soldiers took to flight, and Rajasinghe succeeded in leading the survivors across the river before the Portuguese could pursue. A solemn procession in Colombo celebrated the successful issue of the long protracted and determined siege of Colombo.
Rajasinghe now turned his attention to the Udarata. Its king, Karalliyadde Bandara, had obtained a small Portuguese force for his protection, but one of his chiefs. Weerasundara of Peradeniya assisted Rajasinghe, who, thereupon, marched with a large army and routed the Udarata army at Balana.
Portuguese company
The King and his court fled with the Portuguese escort and were conducted to Trincomalee where the refugees were joined by another Portuguese company. The Udarata submitted to Rajasinghe, who thus became sovereign of a larger tract of territory than any other Sinhalese king of the century. Karalliyadde Bandara who had received baptism under the name of Don John died of small pox, having entrusted his nephew, Yamasingha, and his, infant daughter, Dona Catherina, to the Portuguese, who took them to Mannar where they were brought up with great care.
Having annexed the Udarata, Rajasinghe was, intent on capturing Colombo and devoted heart and soul to the preparation and equipment of a besieging army, consisting of the fighting forces of the many states now subject to him.
For this purpose, he first reduced the status to his will by mercilessly putting to death all those whom he suspected of any disaffection to him, including the greater part of his kinsmen.
Foully murdered
Virasundara who had betrayed the Udarata to him was foully murdered, and his son Konappu with his followers fled to Colombo.
Rajasinghe sent embassies to foreign princes hostile to the Portuguese to solicit their Cooperation-and ask for arms and ammunitions.
The Malabar pirates were persuaded to intercept relief from Goa, while the country around Colombo was carefully guarded so that no provisions might reach the city. Foraging parties scoured the environs of the city, to sack and plunder the villages friendly to Don Juan and Portuguese.
Subjects embittered
But the rigorous and despotic exactions and executions, of Rajasinghe, embittered his subjects to such an extent that they attempted to destroy him by poison. He promptly executed a1i suspected of complicity, without sparing even the Buddhist monks.
Finally, after offering many sacrifices, even of human, lives, as was believed, for the success of his venture, he had a large and fully-armed force from Sitawaka in several divisions, and arriving before the walls of the city, encamped at Boralugoda and on the elevated portions of the marshes of Dematagoda which in consequence are still known as Maligawatte and Maligakanda respectively.
Joao Correa de Brito who had succeeded to the captaincy of Colombo viewed this advance with great trepidation. The city had been cut off from all traffic in merchandise from which its scanty revenues were drawn. Provisions were obtained with great trouble and in quantities scarcely sufficient for the 60,000 souls within the walls.
The fighting force consisted of only 350 Portuguese, counting the old and the weak, assisted by some lascarins; and the fortress was insufficiently-stocked with ammunition and artillery. The captain, therefore, sent urgent messages to Goa and began to fortify the city as well as his resources permitted. The first fortifications built in 1505 withstood the previous assaults but had suffered much from hostile attacks and from the monsoon rains.
Exposed to attack
Brito, therefore, made haste to repair the landward, bastions of St. John, St. Thomas and St. Stephen. The bastion of St. John, which was the principal one most exposed to attack, as it guarded the bay on one side and commanded the plain on the other, was repaired and raised in height and secured by a ditch ending in the sea, and in this ditch-were placed 'pada' boats to serve as parapets for the defenders.
The level plain, 125 paces long from the bastion to the sea, was walled in and raised five fathoms high with battlements, spikes and good artillery. The bastion of St. Thomas was strengthened with thick walls, so that under cover of St. John's it might defend the seashore.
The bastion of Stephen which commanded the plain of St. Thomas (Jinthupitiya), and Galpotha and flanked two bastions on one side and four on the other, was strongly fortified with watchtowers and gun platforms. Portuguese and Sinhala officers of Don Juan, including Konappu Bandara, the son of Weerasundara of Peradeniya who had become a Christian under the name of Don Juan of Austria, vied with one another in erecting fortifications and defending the posts.
Rajasinghe now resumed the work of draining the lake which he soon accomplished by reopening his former ditch and cutting another. Having drained the lake dry, he brought the approaches within four paces of the city walls and entrenched himself with stakes, revetments, portlets, and trenches, while his artillery kept up a continuous fire on the city. To direct him a naval expedition set out from Colombo and devastated the coast towns.
Sinhalese troops
Four general assaults were made on the city of great daring and impetuosity and an array of elephants of war, under the personal direction of Rajasinghe, but they were all successfully repelled by the Portuguese.
Rajasinghe, therefore, attempted to attack the city by the sea, but of the four galleys commanded by foreign mercenaries and carrying Sinhalese troops that set out from Mutwal, two were sunk and the rest forced to flee.
The siege, however, continued without interruption, reducing the city to great straits by famine and disease. The three bastions on the landside were repeatedly and desperately attacked and even mined but were gallantly and successfully defended.
The Portuguese, who had received some scanty reinforcements, ravaged the sea coast towns in search of provisions, plundering and destroying temples.
In the course of one of these marauding expeditions, the famous Vishnu Dewalaya of Dondra was destroyed and sacked by Thome de Souza.

## Title: Blueprint for higher education hub
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, August 16, 2017 - 01:00
Blueprint for higher education hub
According to the Ministry of Higher Education, Sri Lanka aims to be an international hub of excellence for higher education by 2020.
Before we progress further, let us try to define the term education hub. A hub involves attracting a large number of students, providers and research centres for cross-border education, training and research. A higher education hub can include different combinations of domestic and international institutions, branch campuses, and foreign partnerships, within the designated region.
There are many reasons why a government opts for a higher education hub: (1) to internationalise and modernise its educational system, (2) build a skilled workforce, (3) attract foreign investment, and (4) increase education competitiveness.
In the West, this term is not widely used. Instead they use such terms as cross-border education, trans-national education, off-shore education, and the global student mobility market.
Advantages
This writer believes that it would be more practical to re-phrase the vision as one of the preferred destinations for higher education by 2025. Aspiring to become an international education hub is a good thought and a challenging vision. But it takes a lot of time for the preparation and implementation of a practical and workable strategic plan to make the vision a reality. Even the countries like Singapore and Malaysia with all their dedication took over a decade each to arrive at reasonable progress.
Of course, we do have a number of advantages to offer to become a preferred destination for higher education. Those include our strategic location, our cultural diversity, and a relatively stable socio-economic environment.
Also, we have reasonably good infrastructure offering good amenities and facilities. We are a middle-income economy where English is widely spoken in urban areas. Our standard of living is more affordable than in many advanced countries. And above all, ours is a peaceful country without warfare or riots.
Southeast Asia
Growing global interdependence within higher education has been recognized for decades, usually seen as international education and having its primary manifestations in student and faculty exchanges between countries. Over the last two decades, especially after the General Agreement on Trade in Services - which all members of the World Trade Organisation are signatories to - came into effect, higher education began to be recognised as a tradable commodity, and the amount of globalized education started increasing.
With a strong intention to enhance the competitiveness of their higher education systems, governments across the world, and especially those in Asia, have engaged in the quest to achieve different forms of hub status such as hubs for higher education, talent and information technology.
By late 90s, some developing countries in Southeast Asia understood the importance and effect of the highly competitive knowledge-based economies speeding up in the developed world. To face the challenge, they began to place particular emphasis on enhancing the quality of higher education for their citizens. They knew that high-quality talent will support their standing in the globalizing economy.
They also realised that it could take a long time for higher education requirements to be fulfilled if only local universities are relied upon.
Instead, the best solution left for them was to open up the education market and allowing leading non-local institutions to offer programs or run offshore campuses.
Thus, they invited foreign universities to set up local campuses and provide more higher education programmes. At the same time, they also encouraged overseas universities to offer different kinds of higher education programs to meet the pressing demands of their countries, given that the publicly funded universities still maintain a stringent quota of control over student enrolments. Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong are success stories.
In Singapore, at the planning stage, the Government carefully identified major gaps and crucial disciplinary areas that Singapore lacks and also will need for future economic development.
Thereafter, invited the world-renowned universities in those fields to set up local programs or campuses. For example, international business and finance, creative arts and culture, and liberal arts education, have been strengthened through partnering and co-branding with leading global institutions.
The Singapore government has played the role of market generator, not only in setting out the strategic direction, but also by proactively orchestrating developments in transnational higher education to meet its national agenda.
No easy task
If Sri Lanka wants to create a higher education hub, first of all, our universities need to make a thorough survey about the gaps in their curricula and their existing capacities in order to redesign their systems to lure foreign students. This requires the development of a multi-faceted strategy to implement radical changes within the university system to suit the international market.
It's no easy task. There will be many obstacles and challenges to overcome, including language barrier, social and cultural differences and conflicts, knowledgeable staff etc.
If Sri Lanka wishes to reach the level of those in Singapore, China, Hong Kong and South Korea, higher education institutions must focus on the quadruple helix  the cooperation of academia, industry, the government and the people to help spur the countrys quantum leap.
This writer believes that we could learn a number of lessons from the Malaysian experience of how proceed and progress with this difficult task.
Among the rapidly developing countries, Malaysia has emerged as a top study destination for students all around the world. Malaysia had a total of over 150,000 international students enrolled in 2015. By the year 2020, the Government intends to increase that number to 200,000.
For those wondering what makes Malaysia a viable study destination, lets look at the key factors.
Four stages
We can identify four stages of Malaysian Higher Education Hub policy:
Stage 1 (1990): Towards the end of the 1980s Malaysian Government realised that over 75,000 Malaysian higher education students were studying overseas. This caused a huge financial and also human capital or brain drain outflows. The Government was concerned and decided to take action.
Thus, the Malaysia education hub concept was initially conceived in terms of primarily developing a local education market to better cater for domestic needs and also as a strategy to reverse education internationalisation.
As the first step, the Government drafted the new educational requirements of the First Industrial Master-plan.
Stage 2 (1996) : The Government promoted not only the privatisation and marketisation of its higher education in landmark policy initiatives (including the National Council of Higher Education Act and the Private Higher Education Institutions Act), but also a vigorous internationalisation strategy which followed mainly focused on the twinning arrangement between local private colleges and university colleges on one hand, and on the other foreign universities, also mainly from the UK and Australia.
Thus, these higher education policy initiatives of 1996 represent the second key stage in the emergence of the Malaysian education hub model.
Malaysian government decided to allow the private higher education sector to lead the way at this stage in making higher education, technical training and professional education more accessible to the population in terms of national human resource or manpower projections.
Stage 3 (2001): The 9/11 incident was the impetus for Malaysia to go beyond extending its domestic market and link its higher education policy focus to the real prospect of reversing the earlier export model. With the US and other western countries less accessible to Muslim students from the Middle East and elsewhere, Malaysia became a more attractive option for such students. In this way, around 2003 and 2004 there was renewed interest in Malaysia in the idea of attracting international and especially postgraduate students to come to Malaysia to study.
Indonesian and Chinese as well as Middle Eastern students have thus come to represent the main sources of overseas students in Malaysia. It was in this period that Singapore was also particularly active in promoting its own version of an education hub policy  but from a quite different trajectory of interest.
Stage 4 (2010): The Malaysian government announced that higher education would become a National Key Economic Area with a critical role to play in the Malaysias 2020 plan to strive for developed country status.
This would translate into an estimated US $ 138 billion annual gain to the national economy in terms of a projected US $ 6900 per student each year. With this policy projection linked directly to a longer-term Education hub model, such an announcement represents a culmination of various stages in the development model first conceived in the 1990s.
In April 2015, the Malaysian Ministry of Higher of education released a 10-year strategy plan, the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025. The Blueprint discusses the strategy and goals and deduces the plan to three main aspects referred to as the three Bs: (1) Bakat(talent): Higher education is to nurture domestic talent and be of a quality that attracts international students from the region; (2) Benchmarking to global standards: Malaysias goal is to be in the top one-third of nations in the world for education, (3) Balance: Malaysias university graduates are to be equipped not only with skills and knowledge, but a moral, spiritual context in which to put them to use.
Malaysia offers two other advantages to students:
Affordable higher education
The affordable cost of quality higher education is one of many good reasons why international students choose Malaysia. For example, a student can acquire a UK engineering degree (three years) in Malaysia through a 3+0 franchised degree programme at less than half of the cost of the host university in the UK.
High quality of life at a low cost
Another pull factor for international students is the balance between a high quality and affordable way of life. According to the HSBC report, the average cost of living in Malaysia for international students is about 25 per cent less than UK.
Lesson
The fact is, theres still a long way to go for Sri Lanka to be globally prominent as a hub for higher education. Priority number 1 is a Higher Education Sector Blueprint. It should include the provision of a robust action plan to address the challenges of the higher education sector to make Sri Lanka a leading education hub at the international level.
The Blueprint should be inclusive, up-to-date in terms of current developments (national and international) realistic and most importantly, can be implemented effectively. Needless to say, the participation of public and stakeholders are vital in the preparation of the document.

Broad backs Anderson to fire in Ashes
London: Stuart Broad is very confident longstanding new-ball partner James Anderson will play a big part in Englands upcoming Ashes defence in Australia.
Anderson recently turned 35 and there are concerns a five-Test series Down Under, which starts in November, could be a tour too far for Englands all-time leading Test wicket-taker.
The Lancashire paceman has taken 487 wickets at 27.90 apiece in 126 Tests but his 43 on Australian soil have come at a more expensive average of 38.44, although Anderson was a key member of the England touring side that won the 2010/11 Ashes.
And Broad, speaking ahead of Englands home three-Test series against the West Indies, had no doubt the swing specialist could be a central figure once again, whatever the conditions.
Im very confident, said Broad at an event staged by England-West Indies series sponsors Investec on Monday. The last couple of years hes averaging 14 or 15 with the ball in England, so we know how dangerous he is when the balls moving around like that.
But when we go to Australia, the wobble seam he bowls is a great weapon to have in Australia -- take (Australias) Stuart Clark as an example. Were certainly fortunate to have him going strong and I certainly expect him to play a big part in Australia.
There was even talk Anderson could double up as England bowling coach if the current incumbent, Ottis Gibson, takes over as head coach of South Africa. That was suggested really sarcastically by Jimmy in the changing room, said Broad. It would be a tough one for him because hed have to mit to himself in the mornings which wouldnt be easy! Jimmy is almost a bit of a bowling coach anyway with his great experience.
Anderson and Broad are already established as one of Englands greatest new-ball pairings, having taken a combined 720 wickets in 94 Tests together.
Asked about the possibility of extending that figure to 1,000 wickets, Broad said: Itd be pretty special, but wed have to see how long the old bloke (Anderson) wants to go on for.
Ive been lucky to bowl at the other end to him and I know if I hadnt done, I wouldnt have as many wickets as I have got. Broad himself is now just five away from surpassing Ian Bothams mark of 383 Test wickets and so becoming Englands second-most successful Test bowler. Obviously he (Botham) is the biggest player English cricket has ever had probably, said Broad. Anyone whos done what he has against Australia Ive got a lot of respect for, added the 31-year-old, whose father Chris, an opening batsman, starred alongside Botham during Englands victorious Ashes tour of Australia in 1986/87.

CCC welcomes Htota Port PPP
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce appreciates the steps taken to develop the Hambantota Port as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) as it marks an important step towards the goal of positioning Sri Lanka as a full-service maritime hub nation.
In addition to the much-needed boost to the countrys foreign reserves, the reported scale and size of the investment is expected to generate meaningful FDI in port-related activities, as well as businesses around the port.
At a meeting held recently with members of the Ceylon Chambers National Agenda Committee on Logistics and Transport and other private sector stakeholders, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Ports and Shipping, Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and H. A. Wimalasoorya, Executive Director of the SLPA, briefed attendees on the concession agreement signed for the development of the Hambantota Port.
The Minister elaborated on several areas that had been of concern to various stakeholders, including on how the selection of the concessionaire was done, how national interest, prevailing law and security considerations have been addressed, and how the two new companies (Hambantota International Port Group and Hambantota International Port Services) have been structured.
Observing that international rating agencies had been quick to highlight the positive effects of the transaction, industry representatives noted further that the consequent economic benefits arising from a growth in industrial activity, would create more employment opportunities in the region and also provide sizable impetus to propel growth in the maritime related services and logistics sectors around the Port of Hambantota.
The Chamber now expects the implementation of the agreement to be effected in a manner that would serve the best interests of our country. Later this month, the Chamber is convening a seminar for its members on the subject of the Hambantota Port development, with key officials.
The seminar will provide an opportunity to hear more details and seek clarifications on the obligations assumed under the agreement and the plans for implementation.
While recognizing the circumstances in which this PPP deal was required to be finalized, the Chamber urges the Government to ensure that the principle of collective responsibility is respected, so as to inspire confidence in the final decision taken. Sri Lanka needs to enhance its reputation as a business destination that has a credible and predictable investment regime. This imperative is challenged when seemingly conflicting sentiments are expressed by responsible Government sources.
The National Agenda Committee on Logistics and Transport comprises of leaders in the private sector and public sector with experience in the maritime, shipping, and logistics sectors. Since last year, the NAC has been continuously lobbying to fast-track the development of the East Container Terminal (ECT) and the development of an e-Hub for trade facilitation, all aimed at boosting Sri Lankas position and status as a vibrant hub.
This Committee is part of five National Agenda Committees functioning as thought-leadership groups at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, developing insights and advocacy on key strategic economic themes.

Central Bank clamps down
The Central Banks Monetary Board (CB) suspended the primary dealership of Pan Asia Banking Corporation (PABC) for six months yesterday.
The Monetary Board which met on Monday decided to take regulatory action on PABC, a Primary Dealer, based on the findings of an investigation carried out by the CB, a press release issued by the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions and Public Debt Department said.
This regulatory action restricts PABCs access to the primary auctions for government securities. It does not affect any of the other activities or services of PABC, the CB statement said.
Following this announcement, the trading of the PABC in the Colombo Stock Exchange was halted pending announcement from the company. This was stated in the CSE website.
It was revealed at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Bond issues last month that the PABC played an intermediary role to EPF and the Perpetual Treasuries Limited in Bond transactions, and that the PABC had bid on behalf of the PTL at the questionable auction held on February 27, 2015.
The PABC had been used as an intermediary because both the EPF and PTL could not trade with each other due to trading restrictions on counter-parties.
PABC Deputy General Manager Richard Dias testifying before the Commission last month revealed that the bank mediated between the EPF and the PTL under the instructions of former PABC Chairman Nimal Perera. Perera had left PABC in March this year. Following the revelations, the CB last month interdicted Saman Kumara, a senior officer of the Central Banks EPF Department, who dealt on behalf of the EPF in secondary market transactions with PTL.
The CB in its statement yesterday further stated the regulatory action taken on the PABC does not in any way affect the companys ability to carry on banking activities set out in Schedule II of the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988 as a Licensed Commercial Bank.
Accordingly, PABC may continue to deal in government securities to the extent permitted under schedule II of the Banking Act. Action will also be taken by the Central Bank to safeguard the interests of the customers and counterparties of PABC in the government securities market, in an orderly manner, it added. The Pan Asia Banking Corporation in a statement yesterday confirmed that PABC has been advised by the Central Bank that its primary dealer licence has been suspended for six months.
The Bank wishes to clarify to the general public that this action restricts only the banks access to the primary auctions for government securities, the statement said.
The PABC said the banks regular banking activities or its ability to deal in government securities in the secondary market are not impacted or limited in any manner due to the Central Banks decision.

General business sentiment remains somewhat subdued and the insurance market is fiercely competitive. Nevertheless our continuing emphasis on business fundamentals and judicious investment strategies enables us to maintain the momentum.

Dont write West Indies off yet, warns Garner
London: Joel Garner has warned against writing the West Indies off too early ahead of their upcoming Test series against England.
A three-match campaign starts with the first day/night Test ever staged in England, at Birminghams Edgbaston ground on Thursday.
England, fresh from a 3-1 win over South Africa in a four-Test home series, will start as huge favourites. Not only have the West Indies lost their last six Test series, they have been beaten in 14 of their most recent Tests in England and drawn the other three. But fast-bowling great Garner, now the West Indies team manager, said Monday: Its going to be some interesting times. I think people are writing the West Indies off too early and it could be at their own peril.
And with a fast-bowling attack led by Kemar Roach and Shannon Gabriel, allied to a new work ethic being installed by Australian coach Stuart Law, Garner believes his side, who have played a day/night Test -- a hard-fought defeat by Pakistan in Dubai in October -- could yet upset the odds.
Cricket is played in the middle at the end of the day, Garner added at an event staged by series sponsors Investec in London on Monday. I think the fellas have got talent.
Its who makes the greatest adjustment in the day/night game. Games between England and the West Indies are competitive. I wouldnt completely write them off.
West Indies, however, have arrived in England without several star players including Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Darren Sammy -- the legacy of a bitter dispute with West Indies cricket officials and the fact that the Caribbean Premier League Twenty20 tournament is going on at home at the same time as the Test series.

Emirates A380 makes smooth take off from BIA
An Emirates A380 Aircraft landed at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) Katunayake, helping Sri Lanka and the airport achieve an aviation milestone.
Take off and landing on the Emirates one-off Airbus A380 Dubai-bound flight EK 655 from Colombos Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was smooth.
The BIA runway was recently upgraded by extending its shoulders on either side by 7.5 metres which enables larger plans to land and take off smoothly.
Emirates flew its third-generation A380-800 aircraft bearing registration A6-EUB which is relatively new  just 12-18 months old with 5,000 flying hours.
Sri Lankan Captain Udaya Tillekeratne and Emirati First Officer, Saeed Almheiri led the Emirates A380 one-off flight to Colombo 
Flight EK 654 from Dubai touched down at BIA early evening on August 14. The aircraft returned to Dubai as flight EK 655 at 10.10 pm with smooth take off.The aircraft carried a full load of passengers in all three classes: 14 in First Class, 76 in Business Class and 429 in Economy Class.
Flight deck crew were Captain William James and First Officer Marcelo Lobato.
Commenting on the runway and take off, Captain James said, Nice new runway. A complete retrofit. Good conditions for take off.
Emirates hopes to deploy the A380 on scheduled services from Dubai to Colombo and beyond to Singapore which has easy connections to Melbourne with just a hours transit at Changi Airport.
Sri Lankas Minister of Transport and Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva MP was at the airport to greet Abdul Hameed Abdul Fattah Kazhim Al-Mulla, UAE Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Emirates' Senior Vice President Commercial (West Asia & Indian Ocean), Ahmed Khoory who were among the VIPs on the flight, the first A380 commercial flight to the country.
Welcoming guests Ahmed Khoory said, This one-off flight reflects the strong relationship we have with the market and our commitment to the destination. It signifies that, when demand for the destination grows, as it definitely will, to the point that scheduled A380 flights are feasible, Emirates will be ready to operate one.
For the BIA, this event signals that it is A380 ready, and that the worlds largest A380 operator  Emirates  has already operated a commercial flight. Given the Sri Lanka governments focus on developing tourism, this is an important development.
For local aviation enthusiasts it is a matter of pride that their airport has joined the ranks of leading international airports in the A380 league, he added.
Abdul Hameed Abdul Fattah Kazhim Al-Mulla, Ahmed Khoory, Minister of Transport and Aviation,Nimal Siripala de Silva MP and senior officials exchange gifts.

Entry fee to be charged at Unawatuna beach
A special entry fee is to be charged from both foreign and local tourists entering the picturesque Unawatuna beach area shortly by issuing entry tickets. This decision was taken by the Habaraduwa Development Committee at a meeting held at the Habaraduwa Divisional Secretariat auditorium on August 14.
This followed a proposal made by Habaraduwa MOH Sundara Mudalige. Committees Co-President Habaraduwa UNP Chief Organiser Chandralal Abeygunawardena presided. Mudalige said a special levy charged from tourists would help facilitate environmental protection as well as safeguarding the health of visitors to the tourist spot.
Abeygunawardena, who directed officials to implement the proposal, suggested that an entry ticket could be priced at least Rs. 20 each.
The environment could not be protected through popular decisions. Such decisions had to be taken in public and environment interest even though it would be unpopular, he added. Habaraudwa Divisional Secretary Tharanga Wickramaratne, who said that it was a very important step, promised to implement it without delay.

Eshan Pieris secures 3rd place in X30 Challenge Cup, Japan
In another exciting performance, young Eshan Peiris was placed 3rd at the X30 Challenge Japan Cup, last Sunday (06) at Mizunami in Japan.
Once again Eshans extraordinary performances in Japan did Sri Lanka and his home track, the Sri Lanka Karting Circuit (SLKC) Bandaragama proud as he marked another red-letter-day in Sri Lankas motor sports history just a mere three months since he won the Round 3 of the Rotax Max Asian Championship in Malaysia. Making him the first Sri Lankan to win a race in the most competitive Asian go karting championship and firmly placing Sri Lanka on the international karting map.
On Sunday morning, Eshan was off to a great start for his finals at the X30 Challenge having secured fourth position in the pre-finals. During the X30 Challenge Japan Cup finals, Eshan did one better and finished 3rd after snatching the lead midway through what was a very close race. And for good measure, Eshan also set the fastest lap time. y to celebrate on his first foray into racing in Japan.
It is certainly a great boost for local motor-sports and Sri Lanka to see a Sri Lankan go kart driver competing successfully in Japan and have our national flag up on the podium.
This win is even more commendable as Eshan only started racing at the late age of 14 or so. Most go kart champions, who then go on to F1 careers, start at around the age of 8. His success was clearly the result of very hard work, focus, passion and dedication, especially as he is juggling a full racing calendar while pursuing his education at Monash University in Malaysia.

Exhilarating flow of natural beauty
Communion with Nature is not only a characteristic trend with the Romantic English Poetry of the 19th century but also the Aha Naanooru poetry of the Sangam Period Tamil Literature of the pre-Christian era. Even in the 21st century, we enjoy relishing the poems of Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Blake and even Coleridge.
Even present day Lankan poets write in the style of the Romantics. One such writer is Yasmin Jaldin who also writes short fiction. I picked up her collection of poems with the title Flowing Waters. The evocation of flowing waters brings in a nice sensation as water is the life blood of all beings- human or otherwise.
Yasmin Jaldin is in the field of Lankan English Literature hailing from the Malay community. This 82-page book published by Sarasavi publishers contains 65 little poems. It is priced at Rs.275. As Sachitra Mahendra says in his note Whether she has accomplished her mission the reader shall decide
Although contemporary poetry in English in the outer world and even in Lanka has gained depth and finesse, one needs to encourage her efforts.
I shall, therefore, pick out some lines in her poems which I felt were fresh in expression and evoke feeling. After all, the felt experience of the poet must be understood to identify the individual talent.
* Missing your footing was carried away by the gushing waters The river was our friend but now I see it as my foe
* Enraptured by a lilting voice echoing far beyond the hills, I trekked expeditiously to glimpse the singing echo You have encountered an apparition who visits this site every full moon, she said.
* Beauty blooms and freshness lingers for a limited time, the petals would asunder and wither rapidly.
* The world is the masterpiece of Gods creation, it is a crumble and also one of sheer delight
* By the side of a fountain was a pure lily with petals so sleek, standing tall on a gentle stalk drooping her head in shyness resembling a young lass; it looked so forlorn that I dared to pluck it. White lilies adorn sacred places and bouquets of brides to be, their abundance is certainly a florists posy.
* (Please read the poem titled Lost Joy. Not all her poems are all Romantic and some are personal reminiscences narrated)
* Fame she craved and that was the cause for her bane
* Pushed steadfast on the steep rocky hill stands a stupendous waterfall  resembling the long tresses of a maiden combing her lustrous wavy hair. The laughter of a bevvy of girls equals to the ripples of gushing waters; little cascade, you are unique and breathtaking.
* (The poet Yasmin Jaldin is not a mere dreamer or lover of nature per se, but she is also an observer of the degrading things outside. In that, she is a public poet as well, although she doesnt vociferously condemn such crime except to leave them to good virtuous judgment to prevail)
* (The poem Children for instance was not poetry but an ethical sermon on children)
* (On the contrary, The Drought  is precise in narrating with vivid description)
* (in A Mothers Anguish, as an ageing man I was moved by the last line  Your money and clothes are not my essentialities it is your frequent presence that would give me much delight
* (There is pathos in the poem Reminiscence Holidaying in Switzerland a decade ago; my little girl was playing hide and seek in the snow. Alas. she was buried under deep snow and was no more)
* Drinking in the beauty of the scene
* Friendship is like rich glassware costly rich; once broken can be mended but still, the crack is there
* Ferocious as it came, it softly calms down its waters returning to the mighty ocean, like the man losing his temper, regretting later for causing harm to another.
All in all Yasmin Jaldins poems are beautiful tributes to the wonders of Nature written in a language that anyone can understand and there are a few other poems that describe the vagaries in human nature. While some are positive in interpretation some others have a melancholic tone.

Expressing love through lines of liyawela
Jayasiri Semage discards the brush and pallet:
Painters all over the world use vivid colours and different media in expressing their beautiful thoughts. For instance, Leonardo Davinci painted Mona Lisa on canvas using oil paints while Michal Angelo and Pablo Picasso adopted the same technique in their time-honoured works.
Those who painted the walls of Ajanta, Karle and Ellora have found walls as their canvases and used colours of their choice to communicate aesthetically rich imaginations.
While so much emphasis is made on colours, I wonder why the line was not given that much prominence asks Kalasuri Dr Jayasiri Semage, Sri Lankas international art ambassador. Lines can be equally expressive even standing alone. In fact, the earliest experiments in drawing-art were made with lines. Colours, of course, add value to lines yet the use of colour has made many artists to underestimate the significant eloquence of line which is the basic tool of art. He adds: The use of line has been practically reduced to cartoons and illustrative drawings.
Arguing thus for the powerful aesthetic and communicative value of the line, Kalasuri Dr Jayasiri Semage has made it a practical challenge for himself. He was, so far, known for his effective mastery of brush with balanced use of colour. As a matter of fact, the use of appropriate colour had been his greatest asset. His media had been canvas and other surfaces including walls. His paintings depicting love, peace, innocence, lust and religious themes are well known both in Sri Lanka and abroad. Now he is preparing to show us how he has revolutionized his own technique in creating beautiful sentiments in our minds at his next exhibition. No brush, no colours, simple lines. As a matter of fact, I have chosen liyavela as my language in this series of paintings, says Semage. However, his usual themes like love, lust, compassion and joy have not being forgotten. They have found equal emphasis even in this simple application of black, yet poetical lines with a bit of added shades occasionally.
Nevertheless, one should not misunderstand that Semage is reducing his paintings to simple line sketches. For instance, a couple embracing each other and kissing passionately could be drawn as a line sketch. That is what, in fact, most artists do before they fill their works with colour. One can detect such outlines in almost every eastern painting. We can notice even in Semages paintings very clear and bold line drawing he has made before adding appropriate colours. Those are just sketches. What Semage is going show case in his next exhibition is not a collection of such simple line sketches. They are perfectly finished works of the different genre. The pictures he has drawn are effective aesthetic expressions generated with a high command of lines that almost always converge into traditional decorative liyavela motifs. The stylized flowers, leaves, buds, animals, and basic motifs like galbindu, liyapota, arimbu and palapethi found in traditional liyavelas are incorporated into beautiful depictions of human and animal life. His rhythmic ascending lines depicting various life forms culminate beautifully into such traditional motifs. In this new technique, Semage, evidently, has had the close influence of stylistic liyavela designs found in paintings of ancient Buddhist temple walls. His intimacy with traditional Buddhist paintings both in Sri Lanka and India has definitely enriched his vision to a great extent.
When closely observed almost all line drawings he has made for the exhibition appears to begin as simple lines but develop into rhythmic, creeper-like curves that become beautiful creatures full of life and ascend to a climax of converging either to a leaf or a flower. Such visualization, as a matter of fact, is rare achievement only possible to arise in meditatively trained methodical and insightful mind. The mind must follow the path of developmental line in a continuous, unbroken and confident way. Driven by concentrated and confluent mind the lines will form into beautiful curves impregnated with sweet and romantic feelings. Lines so formed will take shape of love, compassion and joy.
This, of course, is a rediscovery of the rich potential of line. Traditional art in the East shows that the artists who painted frescoes and murals had strong faith and trust in mastering lines. Before venturing into serious commitments of creating expressive, communicative and aesthetically enjoyable art, the students of art had to obtain perfect mastery of line. Anyone can notice this in Ajanta and Sigiri paintings. However, this fact is more or less forgotten or overlooked by many young artists today. They do not seem to have sufficient mastery in line, and therefore, they depend on the excessive use of colours and heavy use of brushes. According to Semages opinion, any aspiring artist has to begin with drawing liyavela and liyapota. Then he or she has to continue his practice drawing increasingly difficult motifs systematically until he is capable of tiringitalaya. Then he will be comfortable in mastering and apply any style of painting creatively.
It is natural for any artist, who can draw well, to get more attracted to sentimentally pleasant romantic visualizations. Even the poets tend to prefer romantic depiction of beauty. A good example is Selalihini Sandesaya by Venerable Sri Rahula. He has described in beautiful and even suggestive language the beauty of city girls and village damsels. Even the author of Guttilaya found occasion to depict physical beauty in describing the occasion of celestial apsaras descended to earth to dance to the music of Guttila. An artist who wishes to translate the imagery of these poets into paintings of hypnotic beauties has to visualize angel-like perfect physical images and has to meet the challenging task of bringing such beauties into life, doing justice to their romantic curves, laughing eyes, dancing lips and all sweetness. This is exactly what Jayasiri Semage has achieved even after leaving aside his brush and pallet (temporarily, of course!). He not only depicts physical beauty but also paints their sweet love, affection and joy as well. As a matter of fact, his revolutionary and restrictive technique of translating his imaginations to liyavela lines has made the task complicated and difficult, yet being a maestro of lines he has reached salutary heights.
About 200 paintings of dancing liyavela lines made without brush or paints will be on display at his forthcoming exhibition will be held at the Semage Gallery, No. 3, Lillian Mawatha, Mount Lavinia from Aug 8 to 31.

Five drugs found in Woods system after arrest
Los Angeles: Tiger Woods had five drugs, including the opioid painkiller hydrocodone, in his system when he was arrested in May on suspicion of driving under the influence, according to a toxicology report released Monday.
A urine test revealed four other medications along with hydrocodone which is sold under the brand name Vicodin. Also present were the powerful painkiller hydromorphone; anxiety drug alprazolam (also known as Xanax); sleep drug zolpidem (also known as Ambien) and THC, which is a chemical component of marijuana. The Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office made the results public on Monday.
As I previously said, I received professional help to manage my medications, Woods said Monday. Recently, I had been trying on my own to treat my back pain and a sleep disorder, including insomnia, but I realize now it was a mistake to do this without medical assistance. I am continuing to work with my doctors, and they feel Ive made significant progress. I remain grateful for the amazing support that I continue to receive and for the family and friends that are assisting me. The 41-year-old Woods was arrested early in the morning May 29 in Jupiter, Florida. Police found him asleep in his Mercedes-Benz by the side of the road near his home.
He later said in a statement that his condition was the result of a reaction to mixing several prescription drugs. It was not immediately known if Woods had prescriptions for all of the medications. Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving and agreed to enter a diversion program that will allow the 14-time major championship winning golfer to clear his record if he completes the program.
In June, he completed a treatment program to help him manage medications he was using to combat back pain and insomnia.
At the time of his arrest Woods was unable to tell officers where he was, stumbling through a field sobriety test. Woods told officers he was taking Vicodin and Xanax to deal with pain from April back surgery. The diversion program would call for Woods to spend one year on probation, pay a $250 fine plus court costs, attend a DUI course, perform 50 hours of community service and attend a workshop where victims of impaired drivers detail how their lives were damaged or affected. Woods has 79 career PGA Tour victories but isnt currently playing after his latest back surgery -- his fourth overall.
He won 14 majors, but the last one was in 2008 when he won the US Open at Torrey Pines by outlasting Rocco Mediate in a memorable 19-hole playoff. AFP

Sydney: Australias track cycling fraternity was Tuesday mourning the sudden death of former Olympic and world champion Stephen Wooldridge, aged just 39.
The former star team pursuiter, from New South Wales state, won gold for Australia in the 2004 Athens Olympics, was also a four-time world champion in the discipline and the 2002 Commonwealth Games champion.
Stephen was an exceptional cyclist and Olympic Champion who will forever be remembered, said Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates in a statement Tuesday.
He was always very giving of his time to the Olympic movement, helping out with fundraising efforts whenever he could for the Australian Olympic Team over the years.
Cycling NSW said it was deeply saddened by the news, adding: Stephen was an inspirational figure in track cycling, particularly in his home state of NSW.
There were no further details about when and how Wooldridge died. One of the cyclists good friends and mentors, Phil Bates, penned an emotional tribute to the Olympic champion after receiving the news. His infectious smile, gentleman attitude on and off the bike made him a very special person, Bates wrote in a letter published on the website of RIDE Cycling Review magazine.
We are better for knowing him and worse off for losing him. Australian track cycling legend Anna Meares wrote on Twitter that she was terribly sad to hear of Wooldridges death. Bates said Wooldridge had left behind a son and daughter and other family members. AFP

In 1946, just months before independence, carnage unimaginable in ferocity and unprecedented in scale broke out against Hindus in Muslim-dominated East Bengal and against Muslims in Hindu-majority Bihar. The great campaigner for freedom from Britains imperial yoke, Mohandas Gandhi, spent weeks in both theaters of what he described as almost a civil war. He was determined to quell sectarian violence with his own life if need be.
Gandhi never accepted the Two Nations theory, which saw a sanctuary for the subcontinents Muslims in a future Pakistan and a natural home for its Hindus in a Hindu rashtra, a Hindu nation. On Aug. 15, 1947, as India won its freedom and the new nation celebrated its new dawn, Gandhi did not join the celebrations in New Delhi. He was in Calcutta, where sectarian riots had disfigured life, even as bloody carnage had left hundreds of Hindus dead in East Bengal and Muslims, likewise, in Bihar.
Freedom had come with the partition of the country on the basis of religion. Gandhi described the day as meant for celebration but also for sorrow.
Hindu and Muslim rioters
Calcutta broke into bloody riots within days of independence. Gandhi fasted against the violence. Kill me, kill me, I say, he told a Hindu mob. The men who ransacked his dwelling almost killed him but his courage and lack of fear stayed their hand. Hindu and Muslim rioters cowered before Gandhis moral force. I will not leave you in peace, he told the violent, the hate-filled, the crafty.
He then went to Delhi, the new nations capital, which was also seething with the rage of Hindu refugees fleeing from a Pakistan that had no time or place for them. On Jan. 30, 1948, a man who believed Gandhi had betrayed Hindus did to Gandhi what he had always been prepared for. As the leader fell to three bullets fired at point blank range, all hope for religious concord in India, seemed to vanish.
Indians, like people anywhere, do not want to hate. They do not want to hug suspicions, fears. But there are those, very political, ambitious and selfish people  men, mostly  who want to use incipient suspicion and fear to control their fellow citizens, turn India into a Hindu rashtra. And bigots on the other side, extremists using the name of Islam, feed Hindu communalism with just what extremists need to stay in business: the violent other.
And they love to foment fear. Some fears are real as, for instance, the fear of terrorism, of armed attacks from across borders, of externally orchestrated insurrection. But many other fears are fiction, such as the fear of a Muslim population explosion, a Muslim Jihad. And Pakistans unpredictable militaristic politics, ever keeping an already conflicted Kashmir in ferment, helps the fire burn.
Two ways of life face India today. A path that wants Indians to have freedom of conscience, thought and speech so that the best ideas and energies can be devoted to raising up the poor, the marginalized and the discriminated and making India a republic for all its citizens.
Nonviolent resistance
And the road that wants India to be dominated by one political and religious order, one majoritarian grip on all, making India a nation of stark uniformity, a Hindu rashtra.
Who are the Indians seeking a Hindu nation They are the followers of the Hindu part of the Two Nations theory. Hate, they say, the one who wears clothes different from yours. Mistrust the one who eats foods different from yours, speaks and writes differently, sings songs that are not yours and  most crucially, who prays to a god not yours. If he does all that and even questions some of your beliefs, he is anti-national, so just tell him to get out. So it goes, the new majoritarian rhetoric.
Democracy is about majority rule, not majoritarian tyranny.
What is under attack in India is not just Hindu-Muslim concord, but the right of all minorities  ethnic, linguistic, regional, political, social and cultural  to be themselves, to be equal, to be free. Dissent, free speech and the freedom to choose with confidence and without fear are under strain.
On Gandhis 75th birthday in 1944, Albert Einstein wrote in a book of felicitations, Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. When Einstein said will scarce believe, he had in mind Gandhis distinctive capacity for nonviolent resistance.
Einstein knew of Gandhis having been pitched out of a train in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, because of the color of his skin. He knew that Gandhi led the subsequent resistance by Indians in South Africa against discriminatory treatment, and he knew of his nonviolent ability to suffer persecution and humiliation without physical retaliation.
Gandhi bore no hatred for his oppressors, did not speak or write a harsh word about them but, with his large and growing band of associates, offered the toughest resistance through what he called satyagraha, or soul force.
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela found this capacity in Gandhi compelling, exemplary and even sublime.
Gandhis satyagraha
Gandhis satyagraha was famously illustrated in the Salt March in 1930, when he walked 240 miles with his followers to the village of Dandi on the Arabian Sea in western India. The British had banned the villagers from making salt through seawater reclamation unless they paid a tax. Gandhi, who described it as a battle of right against might, lifted a fistful of salt and auctioned it, repudiating the tax and challenging the empire.
At the saltworks nearby, colonial police attacked Gandhis nonviolent followers. An American reporter, Webb Miller, who witnessed them being struck with murderous blows from lathis, or police batons, wrote, So far as I could observe the volunteers implicitly obeyed Gandhis creed of nonviolence. In no case did I see a volunteer even raise an arm to deflect the blows from lathis. Gandhis march and breaking the prohibition on salt shook the Raj.
Was Gandhi a perfect man or leader Certainly not. Ask Mrs. Gandhi, he would say. He was his own most exacting critic and wrote frank admissions of his flaws and failures. The Gandhi of a hundred battles, scarred but not fallen, is facing his greatest challenge in India today.

Google now recognizes Sinhala, Tamil
On Tuesday morning, search-engine giant Google announced that it was expanding itsspeech recognition capabilities to support Sinhala and Tamil, among 28 other languages. Thisbrings the total number of supported languages to 119.
In a post on the companys blog, The Keyword, Daan Van Esch, Googles Technical Program Manager for Speech, wrote that the language expansion would cover more than a billion people previously unable to use the technology, and that the expansion was part of its quest to make the internet more inclusive.
Esch explained that the company used an authentic process to be sure its speech recognition technology operates effectively.
To incorporate 30 new language varieties, we worked with native speakers to collect speech samples, asking them to read common phrases. This process trained our machine
learning models to understand the sounds and words of the new languages and to improve their accuracy when exposed to more examples over time.
Google will soon be incorporating speech recognition capabilities for these languages to its Cloud Speech API, and is currently working to incorporate them into other company products and apps, such as Google Translate.
In addition to supporting new languages, Google now supports searching for emojis with speech.

Government ignored better proposals over Hambantota Port Project: Former Speaker
The Government failed to pay attention to even better proposals regarding the operation of the Hambantota Port Project, Parliamentarian and former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing a meeting attended by his party membership at the Budhirajarama Viharaya Sooriyawewa on August 15.
He said Joint Opposition (JO) members main concern was the manner the resources of the country could be safeguarded and used for the benefit of the future generation.
Rajapaksa said handing over these facilities or selling them to companies for long terms thereby harming national interests is not JO objective, he said.
Chamal Rajapaksa said foreign collaboration was required for developing the country. But that should be obtained without causing harm to national interests. The conditions that the Hambantota Port was leased out was inimical to countrys interests, he said.
Although better proposals were given for the project, they seemed to have been ignored by the Government, he said.
They feared now that a similar fate would befall the Mattala Airport. The 99-year lease was totally unfair and when people led by the Maha Sangha took to the streets to protest against the Hambantota Port Agreement, they were set upon by thugs brought down from Colombo. Such an unfortunate fate would not have befallen the Hambantota Port if the Government heeded the public opinion, he said.
The former Speaker said the Government need to take further action against the bond scam without trying to save its face.
Rajapaksa said Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was a person who took decisions in keeping with the national interest. As a person born in Hambantota, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has a right to express his views on the Hambantota Port, he said. The most strange thing was the complete silence of the two ministers representing the Hambantota district over the whole issue, the former Speaker said.

Govts promise of improved market access for 3 mn people not realised
The Sri Lankan governments promises made on improved market access to three billion people are not yet realised except for GSP Plus, says Rohan Samarajiva, founding Chair of LIRNEasia.
According to Samarajiva, Sri Lankas goods exports havent diversified enough and market access is still spoken ofin the future tense.
Sri Lankas exports have gone down in relation to its competitor. During the period 2000-2014, the countrys goods exports increased by 2.1% while Vietnam goods exports by 9.5%.
Sri Lanka has only received FDIs in non-tradable sectors such as real estate and telecom during this period, while Vietnam managed to attract export-oriented FDIs.
The composition of goods exports has too remained stale with over reliance on garments.
Asia is where the growth is going to be. In Asia, the largest unexploited market would be around Bay of Bengal. However, our ability to explore emerging opportunities has been stalled by lagging FDIs and labour shortage. Even if we get this market access, the country is not in a position to respond because local industries do not have the capability to expand due to lack of FDIs and labour shortage.
In this situation, we cant think in the same old way or walk with the 70s and 80s focus on innovation.
According to him, Sri Lanka needs to re-examine and modify under-utilized tax incentives that were put in place a few years ago to promote R&D while encouraging domestic high net worth individuals and firms to enter into angel and venture financing. Samrajiwa further noted that Sri Lanka could easily emerge as a regional leader in innovation and become a home to Sri Lankan and global firms in diverse industries who research, design, innovate and test world-class products and services in a highly competitive business environment.

Harry Potter's wizarding property is on the market
If you're a Harry Potter fan, you might like this house. You might like it anyway. It's quite good. De Vere House, which featured in the seventh, penultimate film in the movie adaptations of the famous wizarding saga, is one the market for just under 1 million.
The Grade I listed property appears in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part one. It's the birthplace of Harry, and is the place where the young hero's parents were murdered.
We doubt the building, which is situated in the quaint Suffolk village of Lavenham (it poses as the fictional West Country village of Godric's Hollow in the fantasy series), will be short of suitors, despite its price tag. De Vere House will set you back 995,000.
Still, the money gets you 3,165 sq ft, six bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a stable. It's a stark contrast to the Dursley's more modest home in Privet Drive  where Harry lived under the stairs for a time.
According to its previous owners, various shots were taken of the building and its surrounds that were then edited to create Godrics Hollow. The facade looks as it does in the film, though, so expect fans regularly flocking to your front door to catch a glimpse. Its doorway is the second most photographed one in the UK  pipped to the post only by 10 Downing Street.
The property is currently listed on Rightmove and is being marketed by Carter Jonas. Sky News

With a heart humble
Head Prefect of Dharmaraja Chandula Nanayakkara is an honourable and humane student leader who values warm relationships rather than seeking power. Perfect Prefects speaks to Nanayakkara who sees his post as more of a gift.
A healthy mind and body are essential when taking up a leadership role in any school community or in any society as Nanayakkara points out. We need to look at any issue or problem from various angles and viewpoints and take into consideration the view of others. So we have to communicate with different students. At Dharmaraja you get students from all walks of life. So this is a multilayered society and you need to examine all viewpoints. And looking at multiple views is Nanayakkaras speciality.
Big brother
He maintains a close relationship with the students. You could call him a big brother. They can confide in him and talk to him about any problem they have.
That is the secret of my leadership. Yes, I am a leader but at the same time, I am a friend to all. I am not a puppeteer. I dont pull students strings and give orders. My title is not merely a role I enact or perform. It is more of a relationship I have, said Nanayakkara.
In a leadership role intelligence and strength are important. One thing Nanayakkara insists on is treating people as people and not as machines. When controlling the students you need to think intelligently because you are dealing with human beings, not machines. They have their own personalities and you need to understand fine distinctions and subtleties.
But a school is not only composed of students. There are teachers and the administration. They are another set of personalities you need to appreciate. So you need to see through your mind and heart. As a leader, I must know how to communicate and share ideas with students, teachers and administration. So these are all different personalities, explained Nanayakkara.
No easy job
Strength is important as well. Because at the end of the day being a Head Prefect is no easy job. You need inner strength as well. You need to be forceful and determined, because if you are strong then people will respect you. And at the end of the day, they will respect your role and they will respect you. That is the combination you need.
Emotion is the main thing. You need to have a certain temperament and you need to know their temperament as well. You have to be able to empathize. You need to be kind and have empathy, pointed out Nanayakkara.
As a Head Prefect, there is an influx of information. Nanayakkara points out that he needs to be discerning and give priority to what needs to be done and make the best possible choice under the circumstances. I need to be fair by everyone but I need to be fair by myself as well. So I try my best, said Nanayakkara.
Nanayakkara is a man of his own. He sets targets for himself and does not follow anyone in particular. He has long term goals and works towards them. A man who insists that he has a mind of his own, he copies no one, understanding his own unique strengths and limitations. He has courage and passion. And that is enough for him.
Warm relations
I want to earn money and I want to enjoy my life. At the age of 30 I want to be completely self- sufficient. By that time I will have become wealthy and I will not need to depend on anyone. I have done Airline courses and I am secure about my future. I am sure I can go where I want to go in life, added Nanayakkara.
Warm relations is something Nanayakkara strives for. Helping others comes naturally to him. Befriending someone in need is second nature to him. I am always trying to help other people. I have always been like that. Even during my younger days, I have tried to look out for others. That is the first thing my parents taught me. To the juniors I meet I tell them to help others, said Nanayakkara.
His resume is impressive. He has played cricket and rugger and done weight lifting. He is in the Interact club and nature club. His goal is to breathe life into dead clubs. He wants to revive them and make them active again. He has a number of posts.
He is the President of travel and tourism club and the archives club, Vice Treasurer of the Interact club, Vice Treasurer of English Literary and Drama Association, Media Coordinator of the Sports Council, Web developer of IT club and Treasurer of the Buddhist Student Association.
I am interested in these psychological books about the human psyche. Especially about the sub conscious mind and bodily functions. I read up on deep issues such as spirituality. I also watch all kind of movies, said Nanayakkara.
Outright dislike
As mentioned before he has a great heart. He understands the difference kindness can make in someones life. To touch someones heart is to give that person hope. Sometimes indifference and neglect can do more damage than outright dislike. Those are the making of a great leader- love and affection.
To be a leader you need to consider your personality. They need to understand what love is. Love and affection are important attributes in ones personality. If we can love others and give affection we can make a real difference in their lives. We can touch their hearts. We need to also improve our knowledge. Because knowledge is power, summed up Nanayakkara.

Heart, the only book
Quite a number of terms have been handed down the centuries, depicting the visionary views of people who matter. Among them, the religious communicators have played a vital role in moulding the society at large for a better state of living. Fables, parables, similes, sayings, anecdotes are a few terms that are used to denote the quality of the views presented. The lay and clergy pupils of great teachers have devoted more time to collect the sayings of their teachers, as a devotion to the memorable teachings.
One of the pupils of Ajahn Chah, named Thanissaro Bhikkhu, has devoted most of the time collecting and compiling the 108 Dhamma similes translated from Thai into English titled as Its Like This. The compilation comes as a publication of the Abhayagiri Monastery Foundation printed for free distribution in 2013. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Ajahn Chah was a master at using the apt and unusual simile to explain points of Dhamma in a memorable way, sometimes to answer questions, something to provoke them.
Packed with creativity
He was talented at explaining and exploiting the open-ended nature to the simile, in which some similarities are relevant and others are not. He uses a particular image to make one point in one context, and a very different point in another. As a reader of these 108 similes, I found some of them quite creative and packed with an inner vision.
I wish to quote one such example.
Whether we are happy or sad, feel pleasure or pain, cry or sing, as long as we are in the world, these things happen in a cage. We dont escape from the cage. Even if we are wealthy, we are in a cage. If we are poor, we are in a cage. If we cry we are in a cage. If we dance, we dance in a cage. What is the cage It is the case of birth, ageing, illness and death.
From here onwards the simile is extended in the following words.
It is like a mourning dove we keep in our home. We simply listen to its song, and we praise it. How do we praise
How pretty, the sound of my dove! My dove has a low voice. My dove has a high voice. Thats how we praise the dove. Btu we never ask our dove if its enjoying itself or not. We give it rice to eat and water to drink, but everything is in the cage. And yet we see and feel that the dove is satisfied.
Gathering stress
Then the simile rises to a point of illumination in the following manner, when Ajahn Chah raises a question and tries to respond to it.
Have we ever stopped to think If someone gives us rice and water and put us in a cage, would we be happy In the same way, we are caged in the world. But do we really know our condition Actually we are gathering stress and suffering into ourselves, because we dont look into the dove at the cage.
It looks as if the dove is living comfortably. We feel that it can eat rice and drink water and we feel then the dove lives happily. The condition is compared to the living condition of ourselves. We live in a cage.
Ajahn Chah concludes in the following words.
Even though we live in extreme pleasure and comfort, once we are born, we will then have to grow old. When we are old we will then have to grow sick. We will then have to die. This is suffering. This is the way we suffer.
Inner turmoil
The simile titled as In the Cage looks like a mini parable applicable for all times. The study of similes may lead one to the understanding of the inner turmoil of human existence. In turn, the simile and the parable may lead to the creation of fables, now rediscovered as a new form of narrative.
Ajahn Chah utilises other forms of similes too. On the flattering of mind, he says: Stillness of mind without discernment is like a leaf that flutters when stirred by a breeze. In other words, the stillness of mind, without discernment is dark and then brought back and forth. It is like a person who eats meat and gets a piece stuck in his teeth when he pulls it out he feels better. But when he is hungry, he eats more and get another stuck in teeth. It hurts him again. But again and again, he pulls it out and feels happy.
There is pain. Then the pain is relieved. IT brings happiness for a moment. The condition of the mind is nothing but a fluttering one. The mind is made to flutter over and over again. The reader enters into a world of vision. Like in there are questions raised by the king and responded by Venerable Nagasena Thera.
State of the mind
Take for example the simile of the One Mango Explained. It goes as follows.
A question is raised.
This mango is first small, then its half ripe. Is it the same mango as the small one When it comes out as a flower, its the mango. When it is small, it is the mango. When it is big, it is the same mango. When it is half ripe, it is the same mango. When its ripe, it is the same mango.
The explanation is as follows as applicable to the state of the mind.
The same with virtue, concentration and discernment; virtue in simple terms is abandoning evil, a person without virtue is hot. If he abandons evil, he cools down, for he has no guilt. That lack of quilt is the reward of virtue. It makes the mind peaceful. The mind gets concentrated.
When the mind is concentrated, Ajahn says:
It is clear and clean. You can see lots of things in it. Its like the water with no ripples. If you look into it, you see not only the reflection of your face. You can see all the way to the roof above you. When birds fly past, you can see them too.
The climax of this vision goes as follows.
So these things are all the same thing. Like the one mango!
In many ways, I felt that I am rediscovering a series of new creative communication technique in the teaching of Dhamma, without using the high-flown technique.

Horizon campus offers Biotechnology programmes in tissue culture
Offering benefits such as saving space with less storage to preserve germ plasm, creating uniform off springs, reducing risk of pests and diseases, speeding up breeding , providing the ability to produce an endless amount of plants from one cutting, minimal daily care and allowing for year-round propagation, plant tissue culture has today become the standard for commercial nurseries and many commercial-scale cultivators.
Breaking the barriers of this exciting and futuristic industry is Horizon Campus, who now offers Biotechnology programmes in collaboration with Nilai University, Malaysia, to include Plant Tissue Culture Techniques as a key module in its curriculum.
The comprehensiveness, industry relevance and high calibre of the degree has resulted in the programme being enthusiastically endorsed by the Ministry of Primary Industries, who has requested Horizon Campus to conduct workshops for selected staff from the existing tissue culture laboratories on low cost CSUP technique applied to pineapple.
Having recently concluded the first workshop of this nature with a resounding success, the Ministry has requested Horizon Campus to conduct similar workshops, with the intention of taking this technique to village level.
The workshop led and facilitated by M.D. Piyathilaka, Consultant, Ministry of Primary Industries, focused on best practices with special emphasis on high quality planting material production using low cost technique used for in vitro establishment, multiplication, rooting and acclimatization which creates an efficient and continuous planting material production.
The participants completing the workshop were awarded with certificates by the Secretary of the Ministry of Primary Industries, Eng. Bandula Wickramaarachchi.
Professor Sriyani E. Peiris, Senior Professor Horizon Campus, expressed  With the increased worldwide demand Plant Tissue Culture will be fundamental for engineering different plants species in order to increase its diversity, lower the price of marketing, enhance the production efficiency and thereby increase cultivation efficiency. We at Horizon Campus are happy to lend a hand to the Ministry of Primary Industries to train their officers on low cost CSUP technique, who are already engaged in tissue culture, which can bring the cost of production down by 5 fold. They can apply this technique to propagate any crop species. Thereby they contribute immensely towards production of high quality planting material which we believe will drive the future of agriculture.
Professor Peiris giving a further insight into their current degree explained that it is focused on preparing students for immediate employment in the plant tissue culture industry and developed their skills to examine, analyze and understand the theoretical and practical principles of cell culture and its applications as well as teaching them the diagnostic and problem solving skills and the scientific verbal and writing skills appropriate for the field.

Hundreds killed in Sierra Leone floods, mudslides
SIERRA LEONE: At least 312 people were killed and more than 2,000 left homeless on Monday when heavy flooding hit Sierra Leones capital of Freetown, leaving excavators to pull bodies from rubble and overwhelming the citys morgues.
An AFP journalist saw several homes submerged in Regent village, a hilltop community, and corpses floating in the water in the Lumley West area of the city, as the president assured emergency services were doing all they could to tackle one of the worst natural disasters ever to hit the city.
Red Cross spokesman Patrick Massaquoi told AFP the death toll was 312 but could rise further as his team continued to survey disaster areas in Freetown and tally the number of dead.
Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world, according to UN indicators.
I counted over 300 bodies and more are coming, Mohamed Sinneh, a morgue technician at Freetowns Connaught Hospital, told AFP, having earlier described an overwhelming number of dead at the facility leaving no space to lay out every body.
Many more of the dead were taken to private morgues, Sinneh said.
President Ernest Bai Koroma said in an address to the nation broadcast on television late Monday that an emergency response centre had been established at Regent, the worst-affected area. He appealed for unity from a nation still struggling with the legacy of Ebola and a long civil war.
Our nation has once again been gripped by grief. Many of our compatriots have lost their lives, many more have been gravely injured and billions of Leones worth of property destroyed in the flooding and landslides that swept across some parts of our city, he said.
Every single family, every single ethnic group, every single region is either directly or indirectly affected by this disaster, Koroma said.
He announced that centres would be set up across the city to register those made homeless and praised the military, police and Red Cross volunteers, deployed in an all-out effort to locate those trapped.
Images obtained by AFP showed ferocious, churning dark-orange mud coursing down a steep street in the capital, while videos posted by local residents showed people waist- or chest-deep in water trying to cross the road.
The Sierra Leone meteorological department did not issue any warning ahead of the torrential rains to hasten evacuation from the disaster zones, AFPs correspondent based in Freetown said. Deputy Information Minister Cornelius Deveaux earlier confirmed Koroma had called a national emergency, and said his own boss, Information Minister Mohamed Bangura, was in hospital after being injured in the flooding.
Deveaux said hundreds of people had lost their lives and had properties damaged, and promised food and other assistance for the victims.
He called on the public to remain calm with rescue efforts underway.
The scale of the human cost of the floods only became clear on Monday afternoon, as images of battered corpses piled on top of each other circulated and residents spoke of their struggles to cope with the destruction and find their loved ones. - AFP

I dont know: Shiranthi
Former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa pointed to her staff when questioned yesterday about the Land Rover received by her from the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society in 2011 as the head of the Siriliya Saviya Foundation. While speculation is rife about the possible role played by the vehicle in the abduction, torture and murder of national rugby star Wasim Thajudeen in May 2012, the former First Lady was not confronted directly with this evidence, it is reliably learnt.
She was interviewed by the police Criminal Investigation Department at length about the Land Rover Defender vehicle which she had received as a gift on August 11, 2011, from the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society nine months before the murder of Wasim Thajudeen in May 2012.
Police were tight-lipped about the questioning, but sources close to the investigation said she responded with a stock I dont know to most of the questions put to her by investigators, diverting blame on many probing questions to members of her staff.
According to court reports by the CID, the 28-year-old national rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was sadistically tortured and murdered after being abducted late in the evening of May 16, 2012. The CID has yet to formally comment on the precise role, if any, allegedly played by the Land Rover vehicle that was officially given to Rajapaksa ostensibly for the use of her Siriliya charity.
A separate investigation is underway over the police cover up of the May 2012 murder, which the then Senior DIG of Colombo Anura Senanayake had allegedly declared as a traffic accident. Senanayake is currently on bail after being remanded for over one year on suspicion of obstruction of justice and destroying evidence of Thajudeens murder.
The Judicial Medical Officer who conducted the initial post-mortem examination, Ananda Samarasekera, is facing possible arrest for allegedly falsifying medical records, after a fresh post-mortem report indicated several critical flaws in his report, and also the disappearance of several of Thajudeens bones that he kept in his custody.
An exhumation and a fresh post-mortem examination in 2015 showed that Thajudeen was repeatedly hit on the head, his teeth and pelvic bones broken, his ribs fractured and the thighs slashed using a broken glass bottle indicating sadistic torture. There were also signs that he had been repeatedly assaulted with a blunt instrument and then put inside his own Toyota Vitz car which was then set ablaze at Park Road, Colombo.
There had been speculation that the murder was also linked to a love triangle involving Thajudeen, a Rajapaksa son and a woman who had been given a diplomatic posting and sent off to Australia by the former regime, however investigators ruled out that theory during investigations. The CID have homed in on another possible motive linked to the control of the Havelock Sports Club in which Thajudeen was a powerful figure. Members of the Rajapakse family were allegedly trying to secure control of the club against Thajudeens objections, according to people close to the Thajudeen family.
Telephone calls from the former Presidents office
Minutes after Thajudeen was killed, the Officer In Charge of the Narahenpita police, where the accident took place, had received several calls from telephone numbers connected to the Presidential Secretariat. It is believed that a massive cover-up operation had been initiated without delay, and investigators also found that note books of presidential security men had vital pages destroyed. Several of them are unable to account for their movements during the period Thajudeen was abducted and killed. These bodyguards of the former president are under investigation in connection with the abduction and murder.
Red Cross vehicle allegedly used for murder
The Sri Lanka Red Cross had admitted that the vehicle had been gifted by the organisation to Shiranthi Rajapaksa following a request from the then government.
The head of the Sri Lanka Red Cross, Jagath Abeysinghe, who was questioned extensively by the CID, said he was asked to make the donation and had posed for photographs with the then first lady and the vehicle.
Abeysinghe, a close friend of the former first family, has maintained that he authorised the gift of the Defender to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation.
It was not clear on what basis the Red Cross, a member of the Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, gave the vehicle to Siriliya and subsequently took it back after Rajapaksa lost elections in January 2015.
The Sri Lanka Red Cross in a statement posted on its website said the then Social Services minister Felix Perera had requested them to give the vehicle to Siriliya and that they should consider it a privilege to be able to gift a vehicle to her.
Accordingly a Defender bearing the number plate WP - KA 0642 was handed over to the Chairperson of the Siriliya Saviya Foundation Former First Lady Mrs. Shiranthi Rajapaksa on the 11th of August 2011, the Red Cross said.
Investigations are continuing and official sources said several high profile arrests were imminent.

Implementation, a national economic development imperative
We need to move beyond policy dialogue and economic summits, towards time-bound action plans and implementation. There clearly is a mutually respectful dialogue between the public and private sector, today. The debates, arguments, criticisms, bouquets and brickbats, in any private or public fora, the analyses on electronic and print media and at the many workshops, seminars, and summits, demonstrate a healthy dialogue - in essence, people are empowered. That is a key component of good governance. However, we must recognize that time is of the essence.
1977 - an open economy begins
As we celebrate 40 years of an open or market economy today, the cumulative years of a middle-aged man or woman, we recall the period during which, our own, home-grown President J.R. Jayawardene ignited our transition from a closed, inward-looking, insular country, to an open outward-looking, export-led economy.
We set up free trade zones, and established the Greater Colombo Economic Commission; we modernized our harbour, built a new airport, and damned the Mahaweli and much more. India can only celebrate 26 years of an open or market economy, just 7 years past teen age (when I last made this comparison in print media, I referred to India as a 14-year-old teenager), although now we listen intently to them, whether about economic reform and liberalization, SOE reform, PPPs, bank reform (many months ago I was at the Central Bank, listening to the Chairperson of the now transformed State Bank of India), and much more. I admire them all.
1989-1994
As I recall the culture of a dialogue between the public and private sector, on economic policy, strategy and implementation and on investment and fiscal incentives commenced during the time the current Prime Minister was Minister of Industries during the President Premadasa era, when many of us in the private sector joined hands with the then Minister to develop the strategy for industrialization.
SL Economic Summit 2017
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), as they do in exemplary fashion each year, concluded the Sri Lanka Economic Summit, a key annual event of the 'voice of business' on July 26. I attended the event to be a part of and to encourage the participation of almost 18 senior bankers of the Bank of Ceylon. Chartered Accountant Lakshman Watawala was the pioneer of this annual event in 2000, when I was also on the Main Committee of the Ceylon Chamber and I recall being a presenter and panelist at many summits. It was as always, a pleasure to meet and talk with the many wonderful people of the CCC.
Indian thought leaders
While listening to the speakers from overseas, particularly the gentlemen from the public and private sectors in India, telling us what we have told ourselves many times before and what many presenters from overseas at many Annual Economic Summits previously had advised us, I performed a quick Google search of the topics and presenters of CCC Economic Summits, over the last 12-15 years. I noticed that several speakers and several topics were revisited. I then happened upon an example about India's private sector leaders, which I had shared with readers as far back as in December 2005, through the print media.
I thought this lighthearted article may yet be relevant today, for politicians both in government and opposition, policy planners, public officials, academics, protesters, detractors, and private sector leaders. Hence, I reproduce, below, that article in its entirety.
JRD Tata and lessons for Sri Lanka, By Ranel Wijesinha
During the course of an assignment for the Asian Development Bank, connected with the North Eastern State Roads Project, working along with road engineers, road planners and transport economists from Australia and New Zealand, where my role was on financial management assessments and institutional development and capacity building, I was stationed in Shillong, Meghalaya, one of the eight states of the North Eastern Region of India, which border China, Bhutan, Myanmar and Bangladesh.
I often stayed at the Taj Mahal at Mansing Road in New Delhi. Many Sri Lankans who have stayed there would agree with me that it is an indigenous Indian hotel that provides world-class service on a consistent basis, which perhaps prompts even other hotels to talk about it. No wonder then that political leaders, business leaders and celebrities of all types stay there.
JRD and the House of Tatas
This, of course, is not the only achievement the House of Tatas is famous for. Apart from diverse business interests, the Tata Group had great thought leaders. Presidents and prime ministers of India interacted closely with them.
Political leaders of India respected these business leaders for their objectivity, honesty and integrity and, above all, their leadership in thinking and doing. Reading Indian newspapers or Indian magazines, is always an intellectually stimulating experience for me.
On one such occasion a few months ago, I read an interview JRD Tata had given the Times of India in July 1981, which the Taj magazine, the magazine of Taj Hotels, Resorts and Palaces, had reproduced with these opening words from Fatma R Zakaria, now its Editor: "Twenty Four years later, the issues discussed and the views of JRD Tata are as relevant as they were in 1981. We therefore publish the long and comprehensive dialogue so as to initiate a debate on the subject once again."
What JRD said in 1981
Poverty alleviation Free the economy and see the difference. In response to a question as to what the private sector's contribution to tackling poverty would have been if the private sector was allowed to play its legitimate role during the preceding 30 years and the Government had a more flexible policy towards it, JRD's view were as follows:
Private and public sectors are parts of a single dynamic organism.
India, after it became independent, practised what was then termed a mixed economy - where private enterprise would play an important and continuing role and the private and public sectors would be looked upon not as separate entities but as parts of a single dynamic organism. From the mid 50s to the 60s the mixed economy concept was good. Industrial production rose at an annual rate of 8 to 9 per cent.
Ideological opposition to private enterprise crippled the economy
Subsequently "due to an ideological opposition to private enterprise and misconceived interpretation of socialism, drastic policy measures and controls crippled the economy. For the misdeeds of a few, the business community as a whole was blamed and anti-private sector propaganda gathered momentum. The nationalization of major industries; government monopoly over finance; an absurd obsession about the dangers of concentration of economic power in private hands, etc., restricted initiative, investment and growth. With a flexible and pragmatic approach, the economic scene would have been different."
In particular, he says, "Investment in industry would have been much greater; employment would have grown more quickly in all sectors; production would have increased considerably and shortages removed; Government revenue would have materially increased, which, in turn, could have been used in development programmes. And these conditions could have gone a long way in alleviating poverty. In short I say free the economy and see the difference."
Rapid employment generation requires massive programmes of public works
When asked whether, in order to generate rapid employment, a Government has to protect the small sector - the cottage sector JRD had this to say: "I hold the view that the quickest way to provide extensive fresh employment in India is for Government to undertake massive programmes of public works - roads, water projects, afforestation, and building works. The forests of this country are being devastated; afforestation is a prime need all over the country. Housing - buildings of various kinds, schools and hospitals, all would require largely unskilled work. Generating massive and rapid employment by creating industries in every village is not a practical solution. Any industry however small needs skills. You have to first train and develop people. Develop them as fast as you can but it will still take years"
The role of foreign capital and technology in accelerating economic growth
India needs to open its doors more widely to foreign investment, he had said. "Unfortunately successive Governments have been reluctant to do so. The economic scenario for the next 50 years will call for massive investment but not all of it could be financed by domestic savings, which at 22% is already high for a developing country. Government has to liberalize its approach to attracting foreign direct investment if India is to grow as fast as it can."
Foreign collaboration is key, do not reinvent the wheel
In addition he had said technological progress is a worldwide process and interchange of which between nations is wholly desirable. Foreign collaboration was important in avoiding having to 're-invent the wheel' and in transferring evolving technology.
Local entrepreneurs prefer a competition free protected market
"Many of our entrepreneurs bask happily in a protected market," he had said. He had gone on to say, "There would be little risk and much to gain in allowing foreign capital to contribute to this great endeavour of ours. All the assets and jobs created would be Indian. The improved technologies brought by foreigners would automatically advance our own, and would release a large proportion of our own resources for employment intensive development, particularly in agriculture and agro-based activities, essential to the rapid development of our rural areas."
A growth rate of 6% annually for 50 years is quite possible
As far back as 1981, JRD had apparently recommended, a 6 % annual growth rate for the next 50 years. When asked whether in the light of the fact that the annual growth rate in the last 30 years was only 3.5%, this target was feasible, his view was that India had stagnated at 3.5%.
If this was what was achieved despite faulty planning; poor implementation; neglect of rural India; excessive priority given to heavy industry; restrictive economic policies often based on ideology rather than on pragmatic considerations; restrictions on the growth of the private sector through all -embracing controls and licensing; the poor performance of the public sector; frequent breakdowns in infrastructure, then achieving 6% was quite feasible.
In contrast, he had said that South Korea, Israel, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Singapore Taiwan and Hong Kong, had in the last 30 years achieved a growth rate of between 6 and 9 per cent. Japan during this time had a 10% growth. He had gone on to say that, all these countries had relied on private enterprise and that Governments in these countries were geared to encourage and support private enterprise.
To improve performance of the public sector, stop Government interference
On the topic of improving the quality of the public sector, his view was that one of the biggest handicaps of public sector enterprise was that they were run largely by the ministries and were constantly interfered with. There is no continuity of management. Poor performance in the public sector is partly due to the manner in which they are treated and controlled by the Government. It creates in them a sense of insecurity and fear. This kills initiative and no one wants to take a decision. He goes on to say that (perhaps at that time) in France, Germany and Italy Governments treat public sector enterprises as private sector and leave them alone. If management does not produce results then they sack them.
I thought I must also reproduce the section captioned "About the Author" in that 2005 article, since there was a potent reason to write then, which is relevant even today, when there are protests on the streets daily and distractions and disruptions, to a nation's journey. Here is that section, reproduced as food for thought for today's generation of speakers, presenters, analysts, critics, entrepreneurs, policy planners, politicians, and thought leaders:-
The "Thought Leadership Forum" - An Awareness Enhancement Initiative
The Thought Leadership Forum was launched by the author, Ranel Wijesinha, in memory of his father, Attorney at Law, Late E.G. Wijesinha, on November 16th, 2005. The launch of this initiative was pursuant to restrictions placed on the author's freedom of expression by the Ministry of Commerce, which was apparently misled to do so by an invitation to interfere with a professional association, by a group of professionals of that association, aligned to a Presidential candidate, during the Presidential Elections held in late 2005.
The above article, titled J.R.D. Tata and lessons for Sri Lanka was a part of a series of articles published by the author, to build awareness among a voting community that the "anti-open economy, anti-market economy, anti-public sector reform, anti -private sector, anti-private enterprise, anti-foreign investor, anti western-nation, anti- multinational, anti-multilateral, anti-world bank" sentiment, which was the thrust of that election campaign, was purely rhetoric to win votes rather than economic strategies, to build a better nation.

He is ranked in the top three as a bowler in Test cricket, is a wonderful all-rounder who can bat six and scores hundreds in Test cricket.
It is unlucky for John Hastings with his injury but Ravi is a wonderful cricketer for us to have at a crucial point in our season.
It is a really important last few games in the Championship and to have someone of his class is a huge boost for the club. Ashwin has taken 286 wickets in 51 Tests, including five wickets in an innings on 26 occasions, 150 ODI wickets and 52 in T20Is. AFP

Krishnapatnam Port starts trans-shipment, vies with Colombo, S'pore

Andhra Pradesh's Krishnapatnam Port has become the second port on India's eastern coast after Vizag to have trans-shipment facility.
Krishnapatnam Port Company Ltd's (KPCL) plans to become a trans-shipment hub by catering to the ports on the eastern coast. A trans-shipment terminal is a hub which will attract smaller feeder vessels with containers that then get loaded onto larger ships for transportation to final destinations abroad.
Exporters and importers benefit hugely as larger vessels bring about economies of scale and lower the cost of operations.
At present, around one fourth of total containers from India are trans-shipped through ports outside the country, mainly Colombo in Sri Lanka and Singapore. Apart from these locations, Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates, Salalah in Oman and Port Klang in Malaysia are other ports used for trans-shipment.
Almost 78% of total containers shipped from the ports on the eastern coast are trans-shipped either through Colombo or Singapore.
Hence, there is a need for establishing trans-shipments hubs within the country.
"We have also started trans-shipment of containers. On the east coast of India what happens is that most of the containers that either come into India or go out of the country are not going directly to the destinations, they are trans-shipped at either Colombo or Singapore. It's a great national loss," KPCL chief executive Anil Yendluri told DNA Money.
Lack of large ports with trans-shipment facility is also a drain on foreign exchange as for trans-shipment at other ports like Colombo or Singapore, the cost comes to around $100-300 per container.
"We thought why not have it in India with an efficient handling and where direct liner port calls happen. For example, if containers are for/from Indian ports we hardly charge $40 to 50. In India, we don't charge in dollars, but in rupees. This helps in foreign exchange remaining within the country," said Yendluri.
"At present, containers from Kolkata and Haldia are coming to Krishnapatnam and from here, they are going out. In future, we would like to cater to all other ports on the Bay of Bengal rim."
Promoted by the Hyderabad-based CVR Group, the port started operations in September 2012. Now, there are plans with KPCL to expand its port operations by having 44 berths from 11 at present.
The port has 18.5 metre draught in its harbour that helps in accommodating Capesize vessels. Along with a rollout of expansion plans, the draught is likely to be increased to 22m.
There is no congestion in the navigation channel, a problem faced by some of the major ports of India.
The initial investment done was Rs 8,000 crore, to commission the port on a build-operate-share-transfer basis for a period of 50 years. At the moment, major works for the second phase of expansion are through. The third phase will be rolled out after a few years to handle 200-million-tonne per annum capacity. Presently, the port handles 70-million-tonne per annum.

Kumbuk tree planting to protect water resources
The inauguration ceremony of the kumbuk tree planting programme organized by Thuru Mihira Sabaragamu Tree Planting Movement for the benefit of water catchment areas will be held at Godakawela in Ratnapura on August 25.
This is under the direction of Vocational Training and Skills Development Minister Karunaratne Paranvithana.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department, Deputy Minister Paranavithana said through the tree planting movement it is planned to plant 100,000 kumbuk plants this year.
Under the first phase of the programme, kumbuk saplings will be planted along the river banks and basin of Kalu Ganga, he said.
The Kumbuk tree planting programme will be implemented with the involvement of public officials, schoolchildren, Police, Armed Forces and civil society organizations. Plant nurseries are established to produce 100,000 kumbuk plants, he said.
The Deputy Minister highlighted the importance of protecting water catchment areas which provide water resources to the island by growing more trees. These water resources supply the country's demand for drinking water.
He stressed the importance of introducing more public-oriented programmes to create public sensitivity and to enlist their cooperation for the protection of water resources from pollution.

Lankan motor industry heading for natural death- VIAL Secretary
The Sri Lankan motor industry was heading for a natural death unless corrective steps were taken by the government immediately to rectify the situation, said Keerthi Gunawardena, Secretary, Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka (VIAL).
It is important that there should be a fixed market for vehicle importers and it was essential that foundation steps be taken from this years budget for that and the implementation of a practical taxation system for the vehicle industry. This should be carried out for some time without change, he opined speaking to Biz Motor.
The Central Bank restriction of loan value (LTV) ratio on leasing facilities on vehicles was not acceptable to the industry. Due to the LTV restriction people buying vehicles for the first time find it very difficult affording the capital because 50% of the vehicle cost has to be available in the customers hand at the time of purchase. Gunawardena recalled that there was a time that 100% of the price of the vehicle was allowed to be provided by the finance company. Due to this 50% LTV restriction on vehicles the government has totally discouraged first time buyers from purchasing cars for which constitute to 40 %, because they were unable to afford a huge lump sum payment. As a result the Sri Lankan motor industry was heading for a natural death, he reiterated.
Gunawardena said electric vehicles suit Sri Lanka very much because it does not contribute to air pollution.
In European counties when people purchase electrics vehicles the government refunds the duty to the end user, but in Sri Lanka the government collects substantial amount of duty from electric vehicles. What they suggest is that the duties collected from electric vehicles be returned to the end user at the time of registering the vehicle not as a physical refund but by giving the customer a solar power unit.
The customer can charge the car from the solar unit and the balance units could be obtained to the national grid free of charge by the government. He also said by introducing hybrid vehicles the air pollution in Colombo has gone down drastically. The VIAL Secretary said when consider the number of road accidents happening safety features was essential for vehicles and at least Euro standard safety features were essential for Sri Lanka . But there are some vehicles that are coming into the country without a single safety feature and without a single euro standard. Therefore safety standards such as ABS brakes, airbags, auto gear and pre-crash safety systems are a must for a country like us, he said.
Gunawardena also alleged that customers have to face difficulties due to unethical activities of personal importers. He said they were not against these personal importers of vehicles but the problem arises once these personal importers start selling the vehicles. He said permanent importers have to maintain their business with overheads. Hence they had made suggestions to regularize these imports and to implement Rs 15,000 at the time of opening LCs for motor cars. But this is just a charge now. By implementing this nothing happen, he said. Still the personal importers are engaged in various ways to import vehicles, he alledged.
Gunawardena said changing policies on vehicle industry regularly should not be done and the government must keep one policy for a period for at least five years. The biggest challenge the industry faces is these irregular government policies, personal imports which is not for personal use and the issue of permits, he said.
Gunawardena said they prefer vehicle clearance done in Hambantota and not Colombo. Even though the distance is far away they prefer Hambantota because they were instrumental with the former minister and the port authority people to implement systems in Hambantota Port for smooth vehicle clearance.
There was a good set up for vehicle clearance in Hambantota with minimum pilferage and damages to vehicles because there was ample space for parking. You were able to get a vehicle out within a day because of the good system there in Hambantota, he said. In Colombo the port authority people also find it difficult to find space to park vehicles. Colombo Port is very much congested and there are more opportunities for pilferage and theft in a big scale, he said. Gunawardenasaid they have experienced that before and were heading towards that disaster again by shifting vehicle clearance to Colombo . Gunawardena said the Trincomalee harbour which is about the same distance to Hambantota could be developed for vehicle transshipment and if the government can develop the Trinco habour for vehicle transshipment it will be good for the country as well as vehicle importers.
Also the government must create a level playing field for all vehicles importers, the VIAL Secretary cautioned. Franchised holders take the advantage of a much lesser valuation but VIAL has to import on a very much higher valuation, he alleged. Gunawardena said there are a lot of irregularities in the issuing of valuations by franchise holders and even the Customs depend on them at times. He said they had met the new finance minister and requested to carry on with the existing duty system for awhile without increasing it and they also had requested to streamline the valuation system and to introduce a unique rate to all vehicle categories for the purpose of the calculation of customs duty on vehicles. VIAL therefore urged the minister to go by unit rate based on the engine capacity method for all vehicle categories and do away with the higher valuation system completely.
Vehicles of the 1,300 cc to1,600 cc engine capacities suit Sri Lankan road conditions very much and the expected economic fuel efficiency levels, Gunawardane added.

Lion Brewery posts Rs 5.43 bn turnover in 1Q
Lion Brewery has recorded a turnover of Rs. 5.43 billion and a pre-tax profit of Rs.315.79 million for the first quarter ended June 30, 2017.
The pre-tax profit includes Rs.608.70 million received as a part payment against the business interruption insurance claim made, on account of the flood of May 2016.
In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of Rs.316.65 million on a turnover of Rs 5.61 billion. The Companys performance in the quarter is a reflection of industry woes stemming from the multiple tax increases imposed on soft alcohol since October 2015.
During a 14-month period since then, excise duty on beer was increased by 70% and a can tax was introduced only for the beer category.
During this same period, the tax on spirits was increased by a much more palatable 25%.
VAT too was re-introduced although this covered all alcobevs. As a result of these multiple taxes, the price of beer increased by as much as 75% over a 14-month period. Thus, beer is now unaffordable. This has compelled consumers to shift to cheaper, value for money alternatives such hard alcohol, toddy and illicit alcohol. All three alternatives are more harmful to consumers than the milder beer.
Further, government derives no taxes from illicit alcohol and only a small percentage of what is due from toddy. Due to the effects of pricing, beer industry volumes have declined.
Companys sales volumes too have declined in line with those of the industry. Since the decline in volumes closely follows substantial investments on account of a major expansion and an acquisition, the challenges posed are significant. Management is currently working on re-structuring initiatives including cost reductions across the value chain. Company faces a challenging financial year. However, companys business is built on solid foundations - strong brands and distribution systems, world class beers, state of the art technology and a committed team  and therefore capable of overcoming the turbulence it faces at present.

Nadal delighted at return to No. 1, sorry Federer out
Cincinnati: Rafael Nadal was thrilled Monday to learn he would return to world number one for the first time in three years but sorry it came because Roger Federer withdrew from this weeks ATP Cincinnati Masters tournament.
Third-ranked Federer said he injured his back in Montreal, where he lost in Sundays final to Germanys Alexander Zverev in a key hardcourt tuneup for the US Open.
Federer, this years Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, was the only player who could have denied second-ranked French Open champion Nadal the top spot in next Mondays rankings. For me to be in that position is something very special, Nadal said. I have the passion and love for the game. Thats why Im able to be back in that position again. Its the first time Nadal has been number one since July of 2014.
The 31-year-old Spaniard, who won his 15th Grand Slam title this year at Roland Garros, will overtake Britains top-ranked Andy Murray, who withdrew from Montreal and Cincinnati with a hip injury.
Nadal, who has spent 141 total weeks in the top spot, has struggled with knee injuries since first becoming world number one in August 2008 after a Cincinnati semi-final run. He admitted doubting he could ever regain the top spot after so many years.
If you dont have doubts, its because you are very arrogant and Im not very arrogant, Nadal said. Theres a young generation up and coming. Its very tough to come back and be number one.
Nadal knows that while he will claim the upper hand no matter how he fares this week, the years final Grand Slam event starting in New York on August 28 will have a major role to play in the fight with Federer for number one. Roger and I are having great seasons, Nadal said. One of us will have the chance to have that position for more weeks. Im going to try and do my best this week and see what happens.
Federer, a seven-time champion on the Cincinnati hardcourts, apologized but said he needed to rest with the US Open so near.
I am very sorry to pull out of the Western and Southern Open as I always enjoy playing, Federer said. Cincinnati has some of the best fans in the world and I am sorry I will miss them.
Unfortunately, I tweaked my back in Montreal and I need to rest this week.

Nations Trust Bank 1H PBT up by 27%
Nations Trust Bank closed the first half ending June 30, 2017 with a pre- tax profit of Rs. 2,977 million (Mn) up by 27% over the corresponding period in the previous year.
Post tax profits increased at a lower rate of 12% as a result of the increase in the effective tax rate stemming from higher financial services VAT as well as the additional tax provision of Rs. 90 Mn for the inter company dividend transfer which impacted the Group bottom line growth. However the dividend income received from the subsidiaries resulted in a higher profit growth for the Bank and further strengthened the capital base of the Bank. Performance was driven by the momentum achieved in the Banks core activities which posted a revenue growth of 21% while the operating expenses increase was kept at 11%.
The resulting improvement to operating margins were somewhat subdued by higher impairment charges for the period under review. Net interest income increased by 19% as the volume growth outperformed the impact arising from the narrowing of NIMs.
Interest income increased by 45% whilst interest expense increased at a faster rate of 70% as deposit rates in the market continued to increase due to tight liquidity.
Net fees and commission based income recorded a growth of 32% primarily driven by cards and trade related products. Other operating income also recorded good growth due to non trade related FX income. Net trading losses for the year amounted to Rs. 267Mn which is reflective of the swap cost arising from an increase in the funding FX SWAP book and unfavorable movements in forward premiums.

Northern violence no threat to national security: Army chief
Recent violent incidents against police and a high court judge in the North were local issues. The situation does not constitute a threat to national security, Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayaka said at a press briefing in Colombo yesterday.
Senanayaka faced questions from reporters about increased police and military presence in the region. Security officials have increased patrols following the murder of a policeman in Jaffna in July and an attack on two more in Kopai a week later.
The Army Commander did not deny the heightened police and military presence in the North. But he said the attacks were local incidents, and should not be considered as part of a wider movement.
Everyone is trying to link each and every isolated incident to national security, he said.
Speaking about the man accused of attacking the judge and killing a police officer, yes, he had an LTTE background, he said. But he was in the organisation in 1996.
Senanayaka said if similar attacks took place in the South, no one would think they were connected to a wider national security issue.
These are natural things that happen in a society after a war, he said.

Palisena grilled on PTL CALL recording system
The Treasury Bond Commission yesterday directed a series of questions at Perpetual Treasuries Limited CEO Kasun Palisena on the call recording system installed at his company.
Earlier, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathillake pointed out to the Commission that three other entities had provided the Commission with proper recordings inclusive of information on dates, numbers and duration.
He questioned as to why Perpetual Treasuries could not do so. He said that the investigating officers were being overloaded with information by Perpetual Treasuries.
Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue, Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri asked Palisena if it is possible for the PTL to provide telephone call recordings corresponding to specific transactions which are probe worthy.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena informed the Chairman of the PCoI, he will have to speak with the PTL IT department. He also said it might be possible to do so but approximately one month time will be taken to go through all the recordings.
Palisena also said the call recording system does not identify incoming or outgoing calls separately or the caller numbers.
Justice Chitrasiri then asked Palisena if the telephone recording system provides a facility to filter specific transactions, to which Palisena said he will have to check it with his IT expert.
Justice Chitrasiri pointed out Palisena that he was given sufficient time to attend to the matter.
Counsel for PTL Nihal Fernando pointed out to the PCoI that it will take so many months to go through all the recordings and find specific conversations corresponding to specific transactions.
Chairman Chitrasiri told Fernando PC to allow him (Palisena) to answer the questions. He is the CEO of the company.
Palisena then explained how the telephone calls are recorded and saved in folders named accordingly to dates.
According to Palisena the telephone call recording system was installed in June 2015, under his supervision and the instruction of his IT team.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake at several occasions has pointed out to the commissioners that voice recordings provided by the PTL only have dates but no other specific details. DSG Gunatilake has also pointed out to the PCoI that when bank of Ceylon and Pan Asia Banking Cooperation provided the PCoI with call recordings, no such difficulties occurred.
DSG Gunatilake has several times suggested that the PTL is trying to overload them with information which will not assist the PCoI when investigating.
Counsel to Palisena later on informed the PCoI that they will provide answers to the series of questions directed at his client through an affidavit.

Pliskova, Halep lead five-woman fight for No. 1
Cincinnati: With sidelined Serena Williams about to have a baby, five players have a chance to grab the world number one ranking at this week's US Open tuneup event in Cincinnati.
Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion who announced her pregnancy and the end of her season in April, owned the top spot for 186 consecutive weeks through last September, matching Steffi Graf for an Open Era record, and traded the spot with Germany's Angelique Kerber earlier this year.
Defending Cincinnati champion Karolina Pliskova took over the top spot five weeks ago but will lose points from her title run, opening the door for rivals to overtake her. Romania's second-ranked Simona Halep, world number three Kerber, Ukraine's fourth-rated Elina Svitolina and fifth-ranked Dane Caroline Wozniacki could claim the top spot.
"Nothing has changed. I have a big responsibility. I'll do everything as I have before," Pliskova said. "I do think it's a huge thing but I don't want to do anything just because of the rankings. "I don't try to behave differently. I try not to see the pressure."
Pliskova has won titles this year at Brisbane, Doha and Eastbourne but anything short of a repeat gives Halep a chance to reach number one by winning the title.
"To be number one in the world is a big thing. It shows you have been consistent. You have won the place. If I deserve the place, for sure I will win it," Halep said.
The Romanian however remains haunted by a French Open finals loss to Jelena Ostapenko in which she was up a set and a break before squandering a chance at her first Grand Slam title and number one.
"I still have bad dreams about that," Halep said. "I still suffer." She's also trying to forget a 6-1, 6-1 loss to Svitolina in the Toronto semi-finals, one for which she apologized to spectators on Monday. "I was really disappointed. It was a horror match for me," Halep said. "I couldn't feel the ball. I can't say I wasn't ready to play. It never happened to me before, not like that." Svitolina, 22, has won titles this year in Taiwan, Dubai, Istanbul, Rome and Toronto. She credits Dubai with inspiration but improved in her Canada title run last week. "The title in Dubai really gave me that push. I played great," Svitolina said. "But this tournament in Toronto showed me I can go there not playing my best and fight back and still be able to win the title.
"I know this but I try not to put so much pressure on myself. Of course to be number one is a goal of mine. The important thing is to play well," Svitolina said.
Kerber and Wozniacki need Pliskova to crash out in her opening match to have a chance at number one this week. AFP

Public awareness programme on MSG should be initiated: Rathana Thera
Presidential Senior Advisor, Parliamentarian and Vasa Visa Nethi Ratak Programme Anushasaka Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday said a public disclosure and awareness programme should be initiated on the ill-effects of Monosodium glutamate (MSG), popularly known as Ajinomoto, which is widely use as food additives across the country.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, Ven Rathana Thera said the Health Ministry had a responsibility to formulate regulations to prevent MSG from importing and using in Sri Lanka.
MSG does not consist of any nutritional value, but it stimulates taste buds by exciting the brain cells. This is available under the variety of brand names all over the country, the Thera said.
MSG is now being used in large quantities for food preparation at restaurants, takeaway food outlets and household kitchens. This may harm peoples health. MSG is mostly added to the instant noodles, soya and savory foods, snacks, packet soups and potato chips, Rathana Thera said.
The Thera said people get addicted to these foods due their strong flavour.
Researchers have found several bad impacts of MSG on human health, including headache, facial pressure, chest pains, burning sensation, wheezing, and difficulty of breathing. A list of ingredients should be present on labels of products and customers should check the quantity of MSG added to the products, the Thera said.
Since Sri Lanka has a plenty of natural spices, there is no need for artificial additives. But people are addicted to most of the artificial flavours. That is why there is an increased demand for processed food. Our food culture is now focus on profit and not about peoples health, the Thera said. The best option is to using natural ingredients instead of using artificial flavouiring. Sri Lanka reportedly imports nearly 2000 MT of MSG worth of Rs. 500 million annually, the Thera said.

Rainforest Alliance to introduce good practices to plantation sector
The Rainforest Alliance in a bid to introduce good practices to the plantation sector has continuously increased investments to Sri Lanka.
Since the Alliance started working in Sri Lanka since 2008 investments have grown from $350,000 in 2015 to almost double of that amount this year ($682,000).
These include several workshops, training sessions and also testing facilities in tea estates said Vice President of RainForest Alliance, Ana Paula.
Speaking to Daily News Business, after attending the Sri Lanka Tea Convention, she said that they introduced several good practices and new technology to two estates in Up county and they have yielded good results.
In addition we have conducted training facilities for over 75 government field officers, 17,500 Tea Smallholders so far and this program is ongoing.
Commenting on the use Glyphosate she said that it was first approved for use in the 1970s, and as of 2010 was labelled for use in 130 countries. Between 2013 and 2015 it was banned in El Salvador, Bermuda, Colombia and Sri Lanka.
The Netherlands and France prohibits sale of glyphosate to individuals for use at home. A vote on the re-licencing of glyphosate in the EU stalled in March 2016.
Member states France, Sweden, and the Netherlands objected to the renewal. A vote to reauthorize on a temporary basis failed in June 2016 but at the last-minute the license was extended for 18 months and will be re-evaluated at the end of 2017.
She said that she feels it can be used in smaller values. Glyphosate can irradiate only three types of weeds but there are 20 more that has to be removed by hand.
She said some weeds have to be retained in the plantation. Sri Lankas tea sector has long relied on agrochemicals to battle weeds, but the smallholders who participate in Rainforest Alliance training learn a approach by avoiding weedicides, not only do they protect forests, wildlife, and their own health, but they also reduce expenses, generate more bio-mass (which decreases the need for fertilizer), and increase crop production.
Commenting on the wages for Sri Lanka tea sector she said that they were satisfactory when compared to the region. Both India and Bangladesh pays less.
"One of the participants of the program D.W.C. Amaratunge, smallholder in Uda Karawita had said that the program was very helpful. In the past, many bushes were prone to termite attacks but, amazingly, we dont see them now."
"I believe this is due to ground cover and healthy bushes.

Seven JO MPs to support President
Seven MPs presently aligned with the Joint Opposition will support President Maithripala Sirisena to further strengthen the SLFP, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said yesterday.
These seven parliamentarians have already expressed their consent to lend their helping hand to the President to strengthen the party to face the forthcoming elections, Bandara said addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters.
These seven parliamentarians will join the President soon and discussions are still on he said.
Asked who these seven members are, Bandara refrained from revealing names but said their decision is confirmed.
The Joint Opposition is shattering now.There are internal disputes within it and it is deteriorating he said.
Bandara said an independent survey carried out by the Youth Front has revealed that the political power of President Sirisena is increasing gradually day by day.
It has been revealed by the survey that members, who support the President is increasing significantly he said.
He said that candidates are being selected for the forthcoming elections including the Provincial Council Election.
It is not ethical to level allegations on the President because he is not responsible for the delay in holding the Local Government election.The delay is because the Local Government Elections Act was amended.The amended Act will be presented to Parliament on August 24. No sooner it is passed in Parliament, the LG election will be held,Bandara said.
With the 2012 LG poll, at which Bharatha Laksman Premachandra was killed, people called for a new electoral system without the preferential votes.Therefore, the LG Election Act was amended accordingly, Bandara said.

Sierra Leone mudslide: At least 600 still missing in Freetown

At least 600 people are still missing following a mudslide and flooding that devastated parts of Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, a spokesman for the president has told the BBC.
President Ernest Bai Koroma earlier pleaded for "urgent support", saying entire communities had been wiped out.
Nearly 400 people are confirmed dead after a mudslide in the Regent area and floods elsewhere in Freetown on Monday.
The Red Cross has warned it is a race against time to find survivors.
A mass burial of victims is planned on Wednesday to free up space in mortuaries.
Presidential spokesman Abdulai Baraytay told the BBC that bodies were still being pulled from the mud and rubble.
"The entire community is now in mourning. Loved ones are still missing, well over 600 people," he said.
The UN said its teams in Sierra Leone had mobilised and were supporting rescue efforts.
"Contingency plans are being put in place to mitigate any potential outbreak of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
Homes in the hilltop community of Regent were engulfed after part of Sugar Loaf mountain collapsed following heavy rain early on Monday. Many victims were asleep in bed when disaster struck.
President Koroma fought back tears as he toured Regent on Monday and said the devastation was "overwhelming us".
"Entire communities have been wiped out. We need urgent support now," he said.
He urged people to stay away from the affected areas.
"This tragedy of great magnitude has once again challenged us to come together, to stand by each other and to help one another," he said.
Flooding is not unusual in Sierra Leone, where unsafe housing in makeshift settlements can be swept away by heavy rains.
The rains often hit areas in and around Freetown, an overcrowded coastal city of more than one million people.

"The entire nation's honour is due to the valiant war heroes who sacrificed their lives to defeat terrorism completely in 2009 after a 30 year war," said Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G Jayasena, addressing the gathering at a ceremony held at the Dehiwala Zoological Gardens to mark the handing over of a lion cub to the Sri Lanka Army Sinha Regiment to be used as its mascot recently.
The lion cub was officially handed over by the Deputy Minister to Sinha Regiment Commander Major General Boniface Perera.
Deputy Minister Jayasena said the people could today move about without fear due to the great self sacrifice made by the war heroes to defeat the cruel terrorists.
Nearly 3,862 men belonging to the Sinha Regiment alone had sacrificed their lives in the war against terrorism.
A lion cub was presented to the regiment in the past too to be used as its mascot. Since that cub was now too old and feeble, the new club was presented to the Regiment on request to be trained as its mascot.
She said Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera had asked her to convey his best wishes to the event as he was unable to attend the ceremony due to an urgent official engagement.
Although the lion cub was handed over to the Regiment, its health and food would be monitored by the Zoological Department.
Director General of the Department of Zoological Gardens Dhammika Malsinghe and Assistant Director Anoma Priyadarshanee were also present on the occasion.
The lion club presented to the Regiment was one among the four cubs born to a German lioness by Chinese lion Sula at the Hambantota Safari Park.

The SLFP, then and now
The Joint Opposition, which is an offshoot of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, is going to great lengths to explain to the public that the reasons for their exit from the blues was due to the party deviating from the policies of the SLFP. The latest Joint Opposition member to add his voice to this chorus is JO firebrand and Ratnapura district MP Ranjith Zoysa. He was quoted by an English daily, saying that the Joint Opposition members have decided to boycott the SLFP Anniversary Convention, scheduled to be held at Campbell Park on September 02. The MP further went onto say that the SLFP had ditched the policies of its founder S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, adding that, selling national assets was not the policy of the SLFP. Hence their decision to distance themselves from the party.
Other members of the JO are not so much concerned about any policy drift of the SLFP. All they want is for the blues to part ways with the UNP, with whom it is presently in a coalition. These members want the formation of an SLFP government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, not so much the sale of national assets. This latter group representing the JO, no doubt, has come to terms with reality. They know that the open economy which entails free enterprise and public private partnership is today a fait accompli, not least because the SLFP had been following the same system since 1994.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, no doubt, seized on the reality and took the revolutionary step of breaking with the inward thinking, isolationist the policies of the SLFP of the past, to make it attuned to the new order of things. True, during her election campaign, CBK promised to give the open economy a human face, which gained acceptance with the old guard, who, well knew, that the socialist economy would be a hard sell to the masses, a vast majority of whom still retained bitter memories of queues, shortages, rationing etc. and other hardships the regressive polices placed on them in the 70-77 era.
However, CBK warmed to her task with the zeal of a true convert, even outdoing the UNP in embracing the market economy, warts and all, with all that was vile and obnoxious to the country over which people like Mahinda Rajapaksa staged pada yatras and jana goshas, only to himself embrace the system with equal panache once installed in office as President. The extent of CBKs shift could be gauged from the fact that she even invited the Shell Company, to which her mother showed the door, when she was Prime Minister in the early sixties, having to contend with only the feeble protests among those of the old guard in the PA coalition, particularly members of the LSSP and CP. The changes effected were of such a magnitude that it prompted Dullas Alahapperuma, an SLFP MP heavily inclined to the Left, to remark in parliament that aanduwa vamata signal dala dakunata haravanava (the government is signalling to the Left and turning Right).
It is understandable, though, the conundrum facing SLFP politicians such as Ranjith Zoysa, hailing from the rural outbacks, who are stuck with the populist slogans of the SLFP of the past. They have to appease their supporters with the appropriate rhetoric, nay, play to the gallery. Regrettably, some of the SLFP ministers in the Yahapalanaya government too has caught the disease and are making common cause with the JO, in questioning the sale of national assets but kept mum when large chunks of real estate was sold outright in Hambantota, for Shangri La and Port City project, to name a few. These members, obviously, are playing footsie with the Rajapaksas while choosing to remain with the government.
President Sirisena should not hesitate to take to task Ministers and MPs within the government, in the SLFP camp, who talk and act differently on the policy decisions taken collectively. A young member, a deputy minister to boot, from the SLFP, recently, even in parliament, spoke in disparaging terms against the government. This certainly is not on. Perhaps, such members desire the TV mileage they get by such utterances, to keep them in the good books with their voters. In the meantime they could cause much damage to the unity government before they make an exit, as is being speculated.
Be that as it may, the government should make a more concerted effort to counter the anti-government propaganda that is now gathering steam, perhaps with an eye of the impending Local Government elections. It should also give more exposure to its development projects which are going largely unreported, mainly due to the more sensational news currently dominating the political scene. The other day, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera too raised issue with a state media channel over the work being carried out by the government in the rural areas being overlooked, with only voice cuts of MPs being aired. This is an area the government should direct its attention to.

SriLankan achieves success in crackdown on human trafficking at BIA
Human Smuggling, theillegal transfer of people over national boundaries, is a huge problem worldwide. A considerable portion of this illicit traffic takes place through international airports, despite the many stringent measures in place to prevent these activities. Colombos Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) is no exception, with criminal elements in the region making many attempts to pass passengers bearing incomplete or fraudulent documents through its portals.
Sri Lankas National Carrier SriLankan Airlines, has achieved considerable success in recent times in its concerted efforts to crack down on illegal travel through Colombos airport by passengers using forged or altered travel documents, often supplied by organized criminals running human trafficking rings.
As the sole ground handling operator for all airlines that operate to BIA, SriLankan plays an important role in detecting passengers with forged or altered passports, visas and boarding passes who are attempting to travel overseas. The National Carriers airport and security staff are especially trained in document checking, with training provided by several foreign embassies in Colombo. The airline also works closely with other authorities at BIA, including Immigration, Customs, Airport & Aviation Services and the Sri Lanka Air Force to thwart the efforts of these criminal gangs. In recent weeks alone, SriLankan staff detected five persons with forged passports who were attempting to board flights at BIA.
Human trafficking is a serious challenge for airlines around the world. When such persons evade detection and are discovered after arriving at foreign airports, the airline that carried them face stiff fines from authorities, especially in Europe. Fines range up to 5,500 euros per passenger (approximately LKR 900,000) in some European countries.
Airlines must also bear the cost of the detected persons return by air to his or her country of origin, are liable for the cost of detention rooms at foreign airports, and sometimes even investigation costs borne by the concerned authorities. SriLankan itself recorded a 46% reduction in fines for such illicit travelers in 2016, in comparison with the previous year.
SriLankan is targeting zero violations in this regard, but faces an uphill task due to the organized nature of the human trafficking rings that operate on a global scale. Illicit travelers include Sri Lankans and persons of other nationalities, who are usually attempting to travel to Europe, the Middle East, the Far East Australia, and even the North America, often lured by the prospect of employment in those destinations.
Many ignorant travelers are duped into paying massive sums of money to human trafficking rings who supply them with forged travel documents or documents of other people.
In addition, there are also passengers who are ignorant of necessary valid documentation, expiry dates etc. and often attempt to travel abroad without meeting the required criteria.
SriLankan Airlines urges all genuine travelers to check the visa and travel document requirements with their travel agents or else via the srilankan.com website prior to making travel plans.

Thisara Perera and Siriwardana recalled for ODIs
Sri Lanka has recalled all-rounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana and included left-arm bowlers Malinda Pushpakumara (spin) and Vishwa Fernando (pace) in their 15-man squad to face India in a series of five One-Day Internationals and a one-off T20 International.
These players were overlooked for the last ODI series against Zimbabwe which Sri Lanka lost 2-3.
Perera has been busy representing English county Gloucestershire in the T20 Blast while Siriwardana gets a call after playing his last ODI against Bangladesh in April.
Fernando and Pushpakumara both figured in the recently concluded Test series against India but neither has played in an ODI or T20I.
The rest of the squad is the same that played against Zimbabwe.
Upul Tharanga who will lead Sri Lanka in both formats has issued a statement through Sri Lanka Cricket urging the nations cricket fans to rally round the team and have confidence in them.
Every team goes through a rough patch, said Tharanga. This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are. Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years  dont forget we are now going through a rough patch.
Obviously there are some things we cant openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes  however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith.
Sri Lanka has always been stronger in the white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent and we have the skill.
We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too. The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to the 20 million people in this nation  so your support is something that matters greatly to us.
Yesterday (Monday) despite the defeat, we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us  this is what we need. It inspires us to fight harder too - so as the captain of the ODI and T20 teams, I want to appeal to each and everyone to rally round us and give us the strength.
Sri Lanka has not won a bilateral ODI series against a full member country since beating West Indies 3-0 at home in November 2015 and has slipped in the rankings to number eight. However in the ICC Champions Trophy group match they pulled off a stunning seven-wicket win over India chasing down a target of 322 at the Oval. The first ODI against India commences at Dambulla on August 20.

Under my shade
[Short story]
The leaves were not waving or dancing, but wrestling. How boisterous and rowdy the sound was! It was not a soothing sound for the ears; they were fierce, harsh chords of music. The withered and the dead brown leaves rocketed, not knowing where they were bound to. Some plummeted like parachutes. Some flew like aeroplanes. They were scattered all over the ground. Little birds found it difficult to fly straight. They were being taken out of their route by the gushing wind. It was a sudden rough wind that came from nowhere. I was watching the sudden change.
I am a living thing, people say. But I have no feet to move. I was stuck to the ground. I have been here for years and years watching the changes taking place around me. A long time ago I watched the villagers walking on the narrow gravel road carrying things on their heads or if they were too big, in small push carts. At times push-bikes too helped with the carrying. These bicycles had a small luggage unit fixed at the back. As the gravel road became wider, they carried their goods in carts drawn by bulls which gave the roads a new name - cart road. Now they are wide enough for their goods to be transported in lorries. How much the present environment has changed from the one I encountered years ago!
I still remember the day, long, long ago; when someone from the village looked at me and said that I have a kind of a lustre which the others of my species did not possess. I was very young then. He showed me to the other villagers too. Then they cleaned the place around me and started offering flowers at my foot. Gradually I gained special attention from the villagers. They started believing that a deity had made his palace abode on me. People not only from this village but also from the neighbouring villages started visiting me. They offered flowers, and then lighting oil lamps at my foot, knelt down and worshipped me. Later when they built a shrine under my shade the number of visitors too increased. This was how this devale came up, little by little. Sometimes they appealed for my help in finding a lost cow or finding suitable husbands for their daughters and so on.
With the development of their life style, they too became more fashionable. Yet, their faith and trust in me did not diminish much. In fact, I sometimes feel that it increased instead of diminishing. The only difference was that their appeals became rather commercialised. After all, it had to be, hadnt it The society has changed and so were their interests.
I was just contemplating my past when I saw a big commotion taking place in the village, not far away from where I was.
Fire! Fire!, they were shouting. Martins house is on fire!
Not only men and women but also the dogs, faster than even men, were running towards Martins house. All were in a hurry. Some people were carrying buckets too, may be to help in throwing water to control the fire. Some women were still in their night clothes. Some were carrying their little ones, still naked  may be they had no time to find some garment to cover their nakedness. In such a hurry they were!
I saw the rising smoke. May be the sudden winds had worsened the fire. From my height, I could see people throwing water on the flames while some men and even women carried water from the wells nearby. They were all as busy as bees. One quality I admired in these villagers was how they all got together and helped each other in a grave situation like this. True that they often found fault with others and carried tales, spreading rumours and gossiping and fighting at the simplest provocation. But when in a situation like this they forget everything else and get together.
Soon it became quieter and they all walked back leisurely talking about the fire as if they had been eye witnesses to everything. How funny! But that is village life. Only the dogs were still running back. Dogs hardly walk slowly, they always run  it is said.
There were many conclusions, as they say, to this fire. I heard them say, Martin was going to put up a new grocery. Solomon who already had a grocery close by did not like anyone else opening another one. So he had taken the sudden winds as an excuse to set fire to the shed Martin had built up a few days ago. This shed was a small one made up of planks and it had a thatched roof - things that could easily catch fire.
Solomon is a very jealous man. How can he cheat us and earn profits like this if another boutique comes up
Martins daughter is carrying on an affair with Dicksons son. Dickson is against it. I am sure it is he who had done this.
It is good that this happened to Martin. He is inches above the ground now that his daughter has got through the exam.
These are only what I heard. How many more rumours were there, I did not know.
In the afternoon, Seelawathie, Martins wife visited me with Thusitha, her daughter. They had come here to appeal to me to find the culprit. Seelawathies sister Karuna joined them and they started talking about the incident.
Is it true that you were going to open a grocery asked Karuna. I heard that Solomon had set it on fire because of it.
We do not know who started this rumour. We never had any idea of doing any business in this village. Our son is going to work in a grocery in the town from next week. But somebody has distorted and twisted this news to form a vicious rumour like that. In fact, Solomon himself told us about it. He was feeling sad and angry too. He said that he was going to visit the devale to curse those who had created this story.
Aunty, didnt you hear any other rumours queried Thusitha.
Havent you heard dear that a fence can be built around a country, but not around a mouth
True, Aunty. A jars mouth may be stopped: a mans cannot.
I was smiling to myself.
The next day, I was surprised to see the mother and daughter visiting me again. They had brought some garlands too to hang on my branches. They seemed to be happy. They worshipped me and thanked me for finding the culprit. That surprised me as I myself did not have any idea as to how the fire broke out, or who the culprit was.
Fortunately, it was a conversation between Thusitha and her friend Amali who was there with me at that time which revealed what had really happened.
My younger brother had been watching the winds and the leaves flying about, said Thusitha. He was so taken up by the scene that he wanted to set fire to a piece of paper and send it flying. It had gone straight on to the thatched roof which at once started going up in flames.
What!
Yes, Amali. He had seen it catching fire. But he was scared that father would punish him and had kept quiet. Last night he had told my mother.
Anyway, it is the Deity on this tree who helped us to find out what happened. We came here last evening and begged Him to find us the culprit. We came here again today too to thank Him, said Seelawathie.
Oh! I said to myself. It is good if one can help somebody. I too was feeling happy.

UNP leaders concerned over delays of judicial enforcement: Minister
Expressing concerns about delays with regard to instituting legal action against fraud and corruption committed in the past, United National Party heavyweight and Cabinet Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera yesterday said, UNP leaders have raised their concerns about Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha. Minister Perera said, As a government with responsibility to fight corruption and to empower key government institutions and the Judiciary and commissions of inquiry on corruption or crime-related offences to assist that fight, there should be a commitment on the part of the government to prosecute the corrupt on a priority basis.
Minister Ravi Karunanayaka matched the governments words with deed by resigning from his post to safeguard the governments commitment to anti-corruption, so that investigators evaluate allegations against him and ascertain the truth, he said. He set an example, the minister said and added, Parliamentarian Thilak Marapona has been appointed as the Foreign Affairs Minister, the post held by Karunanayaka. On an earlier occasion, Marapona resigned from his portfolio pending an investigation, of which he came out with a clear name. Asked if there is a possibility of presenting a no-confidence motion against Justice Minister Wijeydasa Rajapaksa, Minister Perera said,  the party leadership has not discussed such a move against Minister Rajapaksha. The UNP has voiced that the cases of the infested past too be brought to light, he said.

## Title: VIRGILS INCREDIBLE AENEID
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, August 16, 2017 - 01:00
VIRGILS INCREDIBLE AENEID
Those who read S T Coleridge's Ancient Mariner will find a similarity between the mariner and Aeneas both whom encountered illusions on high seas and finally to reality in their different ways. We find AENEID as a part of Hardy's background and a little bit of Milton's.
To know nothing of Virgil is to miss clues to English poets from Chaucer onwards at one time or another had some words or incidents strike their minds. Admittedly Virgil is very remote from the last quart-century to the twenty-first century we live in. It is a way of saying that to readers accustomed only to subject-matter and literary treatment of today whose sense of human dignity go beyond any particular age, will discover only an arid strangeness as the computer is quick to establish.
But Virgil (70 BC - 19 BC) has always been a trauma to me. I never understood him nor do I today the way he is revered as the great poet who wrote THE AENEID. Yet, it is something far closer to us than any abstraction based on determinism found in the heads and minds of German philosophers. No doubt he represented their hope and of the people scattered around the Mediterranean.
Destiny appeared more of a challenge and it came as a surprise that in the Christian epoch which took root few years after his death, Virgil's apprehensions were in some way approved by the Church.
Livys history
When nation after nation looked back, he stood steadfastly between the ancient world and the mediaeval world which drew out of decay. This led Dante way back to 1300 in an attitude to co-opt figures of Livy's history as well as the Holy Bible in the same vivid reality found in the Old Testament. This makes today's reader unlikely to be attracted and denounce Virgil as a poet of the Imperial Rome of the day.
We Christians believe in the coming of the Messiah as found in the New Testament that Virgil never knew. Therefore, his Aeneas was in consultation with subsequent visits to the underworld when he encounters with the future heroes of Rome as they pass before his eyes.
At this point, the reader must realize this is not reality but pure fiction found in the mind of Virgil and translations over centuries, may have given different twists to the original horror found in his painful, unwinding poem the world of literature came to know as THE AENEID. There have been many attempts to re-tell the story in part as well in its original form but the ever-complicating mass of subjects found in THE AENEID, the versions became exaggerated and some ending in 'blank verses'.
The first and the best was by a Scot, Gavin Douglas (1476 - 1522) from the original script to be followed by the first English version by the Earl of Surrey (1517 - 1547) with many more poets attempting translations but the most brilliant is unquestionable was by John Dryden (1631 - 1700) which he carried through to vigorous and cracking pace. This version had over-shadowed the original THE AENEID and perhaps had Virgil lived to read it, may have amazed him had he known English.
British invasion
I am a poetry person but this one-mile long poem rattled every bone in my body. To Virgil 's credit, every line coined - up with the following and linked in meaning.
It is as though he wrote a horror movies script, from hell to underworld mystery. No doubt Virgil was influenced and inspired by the outstanding historical events during his lifetime beginning from 70 BC. There was the invasion of Britain by Caesar that resulted in the outbreak of Civil war between Caesar and Pompey.
After the Battle of Thapsus and Pompey's death in Egypt. Next in line was the Dictatorship of Caesar and his assassination (15th March, 44 BC).
The murder of Cicero and the death of Brutus and Cassius. After the marriage of Antony and Octavia, the Empire was divided between Antony's and link to Cleopatra, he divorces Octavia and in the Battle of Actium, Antony and Cleopatra are defeated. These events are well known to literature people who studied Antony and Cleopatra as well as Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare.
'There was an ancient city with Tyrian colonists,
Carthage, across the sea of Italy.
And the Tiber delta, a prosperous city it was
With tough fighters who understood their business
Juno preferred it before all other lands
Even Samos itself: here was her armoury
Here was her chariot, and her intention was
That it should rule the nations of the earth
If so the fates allowed, with her support
She had, however, heard of another race
Which had its origin from Trojan blood
And was one day to wreck the Tyrian stronghold'.
Long narrative
Virgil revelled in the rich variety of beautiful and resonant names found in THE AENEID much like all ancient poets amongst mythology and history. So he includes all such characters and the long poem is brimming and overflowing in their essence. Greek Gods taking charge, Shakespearean characters in input and warriors at the battle. Sadly, once the reader has finished with this long narrative, he is left perplexed without a story or fable. Finally, there is a cast of thousands in sweeping historical narration and most are mentioned only once and they are the less important ones.
For me reading THE AENEID was a challenge and still is. I still do not know where it started and when and where it ended. I was urged by my lecturer, Prof. Ashley Halpe to read the text in an effort to induce my mind to grasp ancient history as well as (loosely) translated English he guessed I would need in the future for writing knowing where my aptitude lay. THE AENEID was unfinished when he died but was hailed as a classic and a rival to Homer's ILIAD and the first Roman Emperor, Augustus declared it as an immortal masterpiece and a glorious gift for him in his reign.
He was the most famous living poet in Rome writing prestigious literary works.
Powerful resonance
The Fall of Troy that Virgil mention in the poem narrated by Homer is the inevitable result of the ILIAD. The Greek antiquarianism and Roman folklore had acquired powerful resonance in Virgil's lifetime. Virgil was only two years old when the very young Julius Caesar stood up in the forum and delivered a funeral speech in praise of his aunt. When the same Julius Caesar destroyed the Roman Republic and became the supreme ruler of Rome. The narrative is cyclical in pattern and pervade the meaning and somewhat potentially beneficial in nature like the return of the Golden Age. However, the poem refuses to gloss over the catastrophic toll while celebrating the foundation of the Roman Empire in the process of both the victors and the vanquished.
THE AENEID acts out a systematic series of exclusions in constructing its picture even in an imperial race. Virgil may have invented THE AENEID and its colossal and spectacular literary essence for poetry to carry forward to the future and no one appeared even at a striking distance to him.

Wave of the waters
In Indian classical music, numerous varieties of musical instruments are in use. Most of the musical instruments are made out of wood, metal, leather strings and bamboo. Different variety of strings and different thickness of strings are used for different string instruments. Among all the instruments Jalatharang is an exceptional and unique Indian musical instrument. Like Jaltharang, Kasht-tarang and Kanch Tarang are almost similar to Jaltharang. All these instruments are made out of glass or porcelain. This particular Jaltharang instrument is called by different names in different Indian regions. In North India, in the Hindi language, this particular instrument is called as Jaltarang, and in Urdu it is called Jal-tharang.
In South India, especially in Tamil Nadu, this instrument is called Jaltharangam.In Tamil Jala means water. The instrument which uses water as the main source, due to that it has got the name as Jaltharangam in Tamil. It brings out the sound of water waves.
Wave sound
Originally this instrument was practised and played in South East Asian region. Especially this was practised in Bali, Java and Myanmar. It originated from Gamelan orchestra in South East Asia. The Gamelan orchestra was an old traditional music of Balinese music. Gong of Gamelan was used with metal made tools, in different shapes for music. To bring out the sound, two thin bamboo sticks were used.
The instrument Jaltharang literally means water waves. This instrument is always used as the main instrument with two or three accompaniments. It is not used as an accompanying instrument like other wind, leather and string instruments. Normally it consists about eighteen different size porcelain bowls in the same shape but in different sizes. All the bowls are arranged in such a semi-circle manner in front of the Jaltharang player. The bowls are arranged in a half circle manner. Different size porcelain containers are arranged in a systematic manner (especially from big to small).In the left side of the Jaltharang player, bigger size bowls are kept and smaller size bowls are kept on the right side.
All the eighteen china bowls are filled with water in different levels. Earlier the total number of china bowls used for this instrumental music was more than the present era. Today the even total number of bowls used by the artists varies from one another. But today the maximum amount or the total number of bowls used for Jaltharang is not more than eighteen.
Some of these porcelain bowls are filled with water at rim level. The filled water porcelain bowls are played by the artist by holding two slender sticks with both hands. When the bowls are filled with more water, the pitch or the tone level would be low.
According to the pitch level, the water level of the bowls should be adjusted by the players (artistes). Many of times to adjust the pitch level of the Jaltharang, the player does numerous adjustments with the water level of the porcelain bowls. Excellent melodious tunes could be brought out or obtained when the bowls are stuck with sticks.
Slender sticks
Jaltharang is popularly used in Indian music, but practising this musical instrument is quite rare as compared to other musical instruments. This instrument is often used in South India with Mirdangam. In North Indian music even the gats of Sitar also could be beautifully played in this Jaltharang musical instrument. Many of times in North Indian music Jaltharang is accompanied with Tabla.
Many of times Jaltharang is used with some other string and air instruments when it is used with numerous other instruments ultimately the gentle melody of the Jaltharang is strongly affected.
Normally medium and fast tempos are well maintained by this instrument. In South Indian music the most outstanding artistes in Jalatharangam were Subbiar and Harihara Bhagavathar. Still, many more young artistes are learning and playing this instrument with great enthusiasm. All the excellent nuances of music are invariably brought out in this water based bowl instrument.
Outstanding artistes
Indian classical music both Carnatic and Hindustani are quite popular in Sri Lanka, but unfortunately, no Jaltharang musical instrumental artiste has entered yet in the Sri Lankan musical field.
Due to the penetration of western instrument key board, many of the traditional oriental instruments are slowly and slowly vanishing from the scene.

What ails Sri Lanka cricket
The Sri Lanka cricket team performances has not fallen to such despairing levels at home where they have apart from being white-washed 3-0 lost all three Tests well inside four days, the last Test played at Pallekele in particular in two and a half days to say the least.
What weve seen in this Test series is a decline in batting performances where from scoring 291 in the first innings at Galle, they have shrunk to 183 at the SSC and 135 at Pallekele. Their only saving grace was the second innings at SSC where they showed some fight after being asked to follow-on and ran up a score of 386, but still lost by an innings.
No one expected Sri Lanka to beat India, the current number one ranked Test side but losing in this manner without a fight is something that even their most ardent fans will find hard to stomach. The failure of Sri Lanka to last the distance (five days) in all three Tests is a major cause for concern.
What that meant was that the batsmen were not geared to play out session by session and wear out the Indian bowlers who bowled with much control and discipline and to their well set fields playing on the patience of the Lankan batsmen who eventually succumbed to it.
What the series revealed was that the talent was there but it is the system through which they come that is not strong enough for the players to bridge the gap between first-class cricket played at home and Test cricket. The first class structure needs to be seriously revamped and upgraded to a level where the competition is high and competitive.
Two Sri Lankan cricketers one past and the other present have shown concern on the current first-class domestic structure and voiced their personal opinions.
Sri Lanka Test opener Dimuth Karunaratne said: India play a lot of good cricket. Theyve played a lot of IPL and first-class cricket. In Sri Lanka we only have 8 to 10 domestic matches in first-class. Then we have five one-dayers. Thats it for the season. We have to play more first-class cricket and then we can find more players who can dominate the game. Thats the thinking  what Sri Lanka Cricket has to work on for the players.
Former fast bowling ace Chaminda Vaas who is the fast bowling coach of the current side also spoke on similar lines when he said: We cant be satisfied with the way first-class cricket is played. We need to make first-class cricket work for fast bowlers. We talk a lot about what ails first-class cricket, but no matter how much we talk, the issue hasnt moved forward.
If we want to develop our cricket and increase the number of fast bowlers we have  if we want to do justice to our cricket - we need to make pitches that are suited to fast bowlers. If we do that I trust that our bowlers would be better off than they are now.
It was a shame to hear Indian cricketing legend Sunil Gavaskar make the comment on television that the present Sri Lanka side may not be able to compete even against a Ranji trophy team  Indias first-class domestic tournament. To such a low depth has the national cricket teams standards sunk.
These are serious comments that the administrators who run Sri Lanka Cricket must sit back and take notice of quite critically and try to address the plunge before it is too late and fans start losing interest in the national cricket team and look for something elsewhere to spend their money and day.
The damage has already been done by diluting the first-class domestic system and the school system and what we see today is the result of it. There is no point blaming the poor cricketers for their failures on the cricket field when they have not been provided with a strong filter system to make it to the top from schoolboy level to the national team.
Another area that administrators must address is the specialised coaches they have under their wing who have been given extended runs regardless of their performances. By employing coaches for longer periods there is no new input coming into the system. When the game is making great advances in techniques all over the world coaches need to be on the ball so that they can keep their noses ahead of their opponents. The performances of the coaches need to be reviewed every two years and changes made if he has not shown any level of improvement.
Sri Lanka Cricket talks so much of the support they have received from Asian neighbours India and Pakistan so why not seek their advice on how best Sri Lanka arrest this downward trend. India didnt become the number one ranked Test side overnight they made changes that were necessary and put certain things right in their system to become the team they are today.
Sri Lanka can learn a lot from them, but only if they are concerned and committed.

## Title: Why Nehru matters more than ever

Why Nehru matters more than ever
An ordinary first speech given by Indias fourteenth President, Ram Nath Kovind, would have gone unremarked, except for one notable omission. The name of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, arguably the foremost leader of the freedom struggle and Indias first prime minister, was spectacularly missing from the inventory of prominent Indians listed by the President. Though the Government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi had gone to extraordinary lengths to eliminate references to the architect of democratic India, we expect the Head of State to stand above partisan party politics. There is cause for disappointment.
A few days after Kovinds speech, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) published a largish booklet to celebrate the birth centenary of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. In the section on great leaders of India, Mahapurush, the names of Nehru as well as Mahatma Gandhi are conspicuous by their absence.
The historical perspective
Almost 10 lakhs of senior school students in Uttar Pradesh are forced to study the booklet, appear for an exam and be rewarded if they perform well. Many of the great men listed in the booklet have never taken part in the freedom struggle and had never been jailed for combating colonialism, unlike Nehru and the Mahatma. But their names occupy pride of place in oral and written histories authored by the BJP. Leaders who had fought for the Independence of the country are simply written off.
The belittling of Pandit Nehru is odd, because the standing of the current Prime Minister is not validated by writing out a previous Prime Minister from the annals of history. The future would judge both leaders on their own merits, their successess or their failures in managing a complex and plural society, their credentials as democrats and their political, economic and strategic visions. Both have a place in modern India. What that place is, would be decided by history. The current dispensation should take the art of history writing seriously and not reduce it to pamphleteering. History is important for collective self-understanding, because it enables us to understand where we have come from and how we got from there to here. Without competent histories that allow us to understand our collective past and present and help us generate visions for the future, entire generations would lose their bearings.
What philosopher Jrgen Habermas calls the public use of history should be for this reason, subjected to strong evaluations. Since the craft has a bearing on the human condition, we ought to distinguish between histories that inspire a democratic, critical sensibility to contain and challenge authoritarianism, from those that feed appetites for absolute power. History of course, must narrate tales of tyrants and despots, so that we take care not to repeat the errors of the past. But it must also chronicle tales of the triumph of the human spirit and inspire us to struggle against totalitarianism and suppression of individual freedom.
For the ruling class, history should be important, because it reminds them that absolute power, often won at the expense of human freedom, does not endure. Unexpected moments arise in the life of a society when its members clamour for change, when existing gods are brought down and new ones erected in their place, condemned to wait for their own downfall. All of us should be wary of changing the tides of fortune.
Fortune, wrote the 16th century political theorist of Florence, Niccol Machiavelli, is unpredictable and inexplicable. She is an active sharer in mans making of history, she produces the unforeseen and she will never be dominated, but would dominate men. That is why Machiavelli advised the Prince of Florence to study history. The public role of history is to remind rulers that fortune is fickle. After all, Nehru, who once led India to freedom, is vilified in his own country by the benighted cyberspace industry. This is short-sighted, because to forget the man is to forget that there is an alternative to narrow and energy-consuming nationalism.
Despite all attempts, Nehru continues to be remembered by many for his contribution to the institutionalisation of democracy, establishing institutions of excellence and his conviction that poverty and inequality in India could not be tackled by the market. There is however, more to a good society: solidarity with struggling people within and outside the country.
Nehru, as one of the most distinguished leaders of Third World solidarity, reached out to the rest of the colonised world and forged a joint front against colonialism and a reinvented imperialism. He was, by temperament and experience, a cosmopolitan. His frequent visits to Europe, his deep familiarity with the past and his understanding of the contemporary ideologies of the day, from liberalism to Fabian socialism, to communist internationalism, had convinced him that the future of India was incomplete without the liberation of other colonies.
Role of intellectual journeys
Nehrus commitment to the independence of the Third World, had been shaped by intellectual journeys through history, as well as participation in a number of international conferences such as the Congress of Oppressed Nationalities in Brussels in 1927. He played a prominent role in the 1955 Bandung Conference, which set the stage for the emergence of a new bloc and a new ideology in global affairs. Representatives of 29 countries from the global South, comprising well over a billion people, met to consider and debate on how they could help each other to neutralise the harmful effects of colonialism and bring economic and social well-being to their people. Towering over leaders who had won their political spurs by piloting their countries to independence, were Nehru, Kwame Nkrumah, the Prime Minister of Ghana, Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, Zhou Enlai, the Premier of China and Ho Chi Minh, the Prime Minister of Vietnam. The agenda included every topic over which the colonised and the newly decolonised world had agonised for decades - religion, colonialism, sovereignty and world peace. The Bandung meeting sparked off reflections on the distinct attractions of non-alignment, and of the strengths that a movement of the non-aligned could acquire in global forums.
A deep cosmopolitanism
Interestingly, if one strand of anti-colonial nationalism focussed on the idea and the imaginaries of the nation, the second moved away from processes of closed identity formation towards other ways of being in the world. Nehrus cosmopolitanism acknowledged that our political identities are forged in and through conversations not only with people who are like us, but people who belong to other cultures, other countries, other societies, and other traditions, but who are like us in many ways.
Contemporary history has not treated this statesman kindly. This is a great pity because todays generation might know what globalisation is, but not what cosmopolitanism is about. Even as our society globalises at a frenetic pace, it has turned inwards and become claustrophobic. History must remember Nehru, he taught us to look outwards, to express solidarity and to become, in the process, cosmopolitans. We must remember him because we have lost out on something that is rather important, teaching our children that our imaginations and our energies should be harnessed to the cause of the oppressed over the world, that closed-in societies lead to stagnation if not to certain death, and that such societies circumscribe imaginings and truncate visions. We have, perhaps, become lesser human beings.

Why Sri Lanka sought Chinese investments in ports : China focus
Despite being a staggering US$1.12 billion investment, the recent agreement between Sri Lanka Ports Authority, China Merchant Port Holdings, and the Ministry of Ports and Shipping has left many considering Chinas investments in the Hambantota Port with unease. However, it is often conveniently ignored that it is the successive governments of Sri Lanka that actively sought Chinese investments. Therefore, it is important to examine why we sought Chinese investments in the first place.
During the last decade, China has heavily invested in ports across the world. In South Asia, they built the Gwadar port in Pakistan and the Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. China has been a forthcoming and non-interfering alternative to funding from international financial institutions and Western donors. They have the excess capital and the capacity to take high risks, and they financed the construction of the Hambantota Port at a time when no other country or development partner was willing to invest in it. Now a Chinese company has come forward to further invest in the Hambantota Port to develop it rather than let it squander its immense potential while generations of Sri Lankans serve the debts on a non-performing port. From an International Relations point of view, China also serves as a counter balance against the regional hegemony of India and other influences on Sri Lanka.
Therefore, rather than solely criticize China for their opportunistic investments, it is important to recognize that it is our governments that have voluntarily and actively sought these investments and exercised their (our) will when they reached out to China to fund a massive port project among other infrastructure projects.
An investor, a donor, and a trade partner
Since the turn of the century, Chinas exponential growth and increasing influence in many regions spanning Australia to South America have attracted the attention of the world. China has not spared South Asia in its unquenchable thirst for resources, search for strategic locations, and reach for emerging markets.
According to the Heritage Foundations China Global Investment Tracker, from 2005 to 2014 China spent US$870.4 billion in worldwide investments and contracts, out of which US$8.9 billion was invested in Sri Lanka. In contrast, according to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is part of the World Bank group has made cumulative investments worth US$596 million in Sri Lanka.
Even though Chinese investments in Sri Lanka are a small fraction compared to their global investments elsewhere, taken in context and compared to other global investors, these are considerable figures, and Chinas investments in infrastructure are prominent.
Chinese investments, grants, and trade are all intricately interlinked. In Sri Lanka, China is the biggest source of FDI pumping in more than US$400 million in 2014. China has been involved in projects such as the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, Mattala Airport, Katunayake Expressway, Moragahakanda Project, and the Southern Expressway.
As the largest donor since 2009, China extended US$1.2 billion worth of assistance in the form of grants, loans, and credit amounting to 54% of the total US$2.2 billion committed by foreign countries and multilateral agencies. China provided Sri Lanka US$5 billion in aid over the last decade. Some of Chinas lavish gifts to Sri Lanka include the BMICH, the Superior Courts complex, and the Lotus Pond (Nelum Pokuna) Performing Arts Theatre. China also fulfilled 65% of its total pledged assistance to Sri Lanka.
China surpassed the United States as Sri Lankas second-largest trading partner behind India in 2013. In the same year, Sri Lankas bilateral trade with China exceeded US$3 billion. All these growing aid packages, trade relations, and investments indicate Chinas increasing involvement in Sri Lanka and its lasting footprint in the region.
From String of Pearls to One Belt One Road
Foreign policy analysts have explained Chinas expansion in South Asia with diverse arguments. The string of pearls theory examines the intention of China in building commercial and potential naval bases along the Indian Ocean region, including countries encircling India.
Earlier this year, China turned the string of pearls theory propounded by the west on its head with the launch of One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. With OBOR, China is building infrastructure connecting China, Asia, Europe, and Africa through ports, highways, railroads, pipelines, power and other networks.
Unlike multilateral institutions and western countries, which impose conditionalities based on human rights, democracy, and good governance, when extending development loans, China does not interfere in the internal workings and sovereignty of loan/investment recipient countries.
According to former Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona, the Chinese government believes that low-key communication and mutually beneficial dialogue, carried out on an equal footing is more efficient than the US approach of distributing money and exerting pressure. According to Kohona, Asians dont go around teaching each other how to behavethere are ways we deal with each other - perhaps a quiet chat, but not wagging the finger. His words clearly manifest one of the main reasons why Sri Lanka prefers China as a development partner.
Sri Lanka becoming a middle-income country in 2012 also precluded concessionary loans and forced the country to find alternative sources of funding. Further, Western countries distanced themselves from Sri Lanka post 2009 based on war crimes allegations. During the tenure of President Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka moved away from its traditional funding partners and moved closer to China. Though the present government initially seemed to distance itself from China in 2015, soon it realized that the West does not have the kind of resources that China invests in Sri Lanka, and that Chinas tentacles in Sri Lanka are too deep. Besides, in the new world order, China is too big a player to take for granted anyway.
Unlike other donors who are reluctant to invest in large-scale, high-risk infrastructure projects, China is forthcoming. They are willing and able to take long term risks and invest in countries with higher political risk. During a 2010 interview with Singapores Straits Times, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, take Hambantota Port. It was offered to India first. I was desperate for development work. But ultimately the Chinese agreed to build it. Several large China-funded infrastructure projects in South Asia are high-risk ventures in which no other multilateral organisation or Western donor country wants to be involved in.
China has also emerged as an expert in construction and engineering which has influenced many countries to choose China, particularly for port projects. All these have played a role in Sri Lanka choosing Chinas involvement in building port infrastructure.
A counter balance for India and external influences
India has long seen itself as the natural leader in the Indian Ocean region and wants to ensure that its namesake ocean remains Indias Ocean. However, many countries consider that the Indian Ocean is not only Indias backyard but also a region to which both littoral states and outside powers have a claim. With increasingly strong ties with the US and aims to curb Chinas expansion in the region, India threatens to become an ever-greater hegemon. Countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka are strengthening their ties with China to counterbalance the regional hegemony of India.
China has also been a formidable friend to Sri Lanka in diverse international fora. In 2012, China was strongly against the US backed UN resolution against Sri Lanka. Though not openly admitted, when Sri Lanka reaches out to China to fund development projects, it is also driven by the fact that closer ties with China will be a way to balance power with India and prevent the influence or interference from other global players.
Achieving long term development goals
Chinese investments are also justified as a means to achieve long-term development goals in terms of infrastructure development, employment generation, and trade expansion. One of the main targets at the end of the war was to catch up on thirty years of lost development opportunities. China with its multi-million-dollar investments to put in place much-needed infrastructure became a dependable friend. When the Hambantota Port project was started, the then government claimed it would bring in prosperity to one of the least developed regions of the country, create job opportunities, and boost the economy.
The recent agreement for Chinese investment in Hambantota is endorsed with expectations of skilled employment generation, regional and national economic development, stabilising the Sri Lankan rupee, and the reduction of national debt percentage. Further, better transport infrastructure will provide better access to regional markets.
Whats in it for China
There are a number of strategic, political and economic reasons for China to be interested in the Indian Ocean region and South Asia in particular. Though a Chinese naval base in Sri Lanka is far-fetched, China is interested in maintaining its presence in the Indian Ocean because of its strategic, economic, and political importance.
As the worlds leading manufacturing hub and the second largest economy, China needs to secure energy and goods supply routes along the Indian Ocean as alternatives to the Malacca strait. Located at the centre of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka is ideal for this and to refuel vessels and for crews to rest and recuperate.
Further, these projects provide Chinese companies opportunities to engage in large-scale investments and earn revenue for decades. They provide employment opportunities for Chinese labourers and opportunities for Chinese companies to export machinery used in these projects. They boost Chinas soft power strategies by creating a presence and by being a catalyst for development. The growing economy of Sri Lanka also provides a market, albeit small, for Chinas manufactured goods.
It is based on all those interests that China is making large-scale investments in maritime infrastructure in Sri Lanka and the region, and they insist that their investments are purely pacific and based on goodwill between long standing friends such as Sri Lanka.
