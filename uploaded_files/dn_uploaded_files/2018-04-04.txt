Tourism Minister assures support  to strengthen tourism in Kandy
Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga held a discussion with the Kandy Hoteliers Association, a representative body of hotel owners and operators in Kandy to discuss ways in which the industry can be strengthened in the area.
The meeting, held at the Ministers office in Colombo, was significant as the tourism industry in Kandy, a top tourist destination in Sri Lanka - was impacted by the recent violent incidents in the Kandy district. The minister and the hotel operators discussed at length the measures through which the tourism industry in the area can be strengthened despite the damage caused by some isolated incidents of violence.
The Minister said a comprehensive approach was needed from all parties to further strengthen the tourism industry in Kandy and to make the tourists aware of the importance of visiting the hill capital of Sri Lanka.
The Minister also thanked hotel operators in the district for seamlessly supporting the industry by ensuring safety of tourists. The Minister particularly commended some hotel operators who allowed tourists to stay in their hotels free of charge until the violence ceased.
He also added that the hospitality industry stakeholders were instrumental in mitigating the damage the Kandy incident caused to the tourism industry-at large.
Such gestures, he said, go a long way in shaping the global image of Sri Lanka.
Sharing their viewpoints, the association urged the tourism authorities to hold more promotional activities in Kandy to attract more tourists to the hill capital. The Minister and the tourism authorities present at the meeting agreed with this request and said they would take speedy action. As part of this programme, they said, the diplomatic community in Sri Lanka should also be made aware of the importance of Kandy and its current situation.
Another point they stressed was to improve connectivity between Kandy and other parts of the country. They also urged to expedite the construction of the internal airport in Digana and the central expressway - two main projects involving the Kandy district.
The Minister, in his response, said he would take up the matter with transport authority and discuss speedy implementation of the two projects.
He also pointed out the importance of strengthening areas such as Adventure Tourism and assured that he would work with tourism institutions to offer necessary support from the government.

Two more bilateral trade agreements soon - Malik
Sri Lanka will be having several bilateral trade agreements to promote trade, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama.
We are close to concluding two more bilateral trade agreements, an Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement with India and a Comprehensive FTA with China. This will be followed by FTAs with Thailand, Bangladesh and Malaysia.
As you know, we also recently regained the GSP Plus trade concessions to the European Union, which gives duty free access on over 6,200 tariff lines.
He was addressing a business delegation of the German Industry and Commerce in Colombo last week.
These initiatives are being complemented by comprehensive trade policy reforms. In the last budget, protectionist para-tariffs on over 1,200 items were removed, with the rest slated for removal this year and next year. To leverage on our location and to expand market access, we are expanding our trade and investment links with a diverse set of countries US, EU, India, China, Singapore, Japan; and we also are signing a number of trade agreements.
The Minister said that Germany was more resilient than other Euro area economies, and bounced back quicker. Because you undertook tricky but important reforms to the business climate, to labour laws, etc., much earlier on.
He said that sets the foundations for a strong economy. Even now, we see how Germanys economic growth has been an anchor for the economic recovery of the whole European region.
Our Government has taken numerous initiatives to stabilise and re-orient the economy, from a growth model that was heavily dependent on debt-fuelled public spending, to one driven more by the private sector, trade, and FDI. We have taken many measures to build strength and resilience in our economy.
The minister said on monetary policy, the Central Bank has moved towards a market-determined exchange rate regime and is proactively keeping inflation in check.
We just passed a new Active Liability Management Act, to ensure national debt is cleverly and credibly managed. And last year we passed a new Foreign Exchange Act that brings very contemporary and business-friendly approach to managing foreign exchange.
Across the government, we are focusing on reform initiatives to catalyse growth and create better jobs for our people.
He said that the government was committed in improving the ease of doing business and by mid this year, the time taken to register a new business will reduce from six days to just one day. Finding land and registering property will be halved from 51 days to 26 days, and the procedures reduced from nine steps to 2 steps, he said.
We are also introducing an Electronic Single Window that will link together dozens of state agencies dealing with international trade. Through the new Colombo International Financial City and Port City projects, we are creating a unique business climate that is globally-competitive and will provide an attractive operating environment like no other in the South Asian region, he said.

## Title: Universities are for education, not for strike!

Universities are for education, not for strike!
Universities are the highest educational institutions in any country. They take the leading role in imparting knowledge to students. There are 15 National Universities in Sri Lanka. Universities have not been functioning for more than one month due to the strike of non-academic staff. It is a well-known custom in the Sri Lankan university culture that the university staff or students will close the universities for months and months without thinking about the adverse consequences of the strike.
Once the universities are closed nearly 200,000 are affected. The government also pays off millions of rupees as salaries for the university academic and non-academic staff for the sole purpose of educating the students in the universities. On contrary, these universities are frequently closed down by university staff, non-academic staff and students at different intervals. Who will bear the loss by closing all these universities
University education
In fact the remunerations of university staff and non-academic staff are paid during the strike or after the strike with arrears likewise, the Mahapola and Bursaries are paid for students monthly during the strike. The academic activities of the universities are withheld. This is very unfair for Sri Lanka. Having spent millions of rupees on higher education, neither the country nor people are benefited from the huge expenditures which the government every year allocates from the public fund. There should be an end to these endless strikes. Last year, the university activities were handicapped due to the SAITM issue. After the issue, all the universities were open along with the intake carried out. No sooner the university intake over once again the non-academic staff declared an untimely strike.
Who is responsible for this strike: government or strikers Whoever responsible for the on-going strike should immediately settle. Indeed both parties have wasted the valuable time and money. More importantly, this concerns the precious future of the students. When we compare our university model with overseas universities, the former is entirely different.
No university is closed in the world like our local universities. Students in other foreign countries comparatively earn their first degree much earlier than our universities. Indeed a student completes his first degree at the age of nineteen or twenty whereas in our country at this age they are seeking admissions to universities. In that case, we are late in completing the first degree and these monstrous strikes are making further delay in earning or obtaining the first degree.
The delay in obtaining first degree creates various problems in the life of students and parents. On one hand, the students have to spend a number of years on university education and once he completes his degree it is too late for him to find employment. On the other hand, the parents spend a lot of money on their childrens education. They expect the children to fulfil some commitments in the family. But the children are not in a position to fulfil their commitments because by the time they pass out from the university they themselves are at the marriageable age that will bring an extra burden for the parents. This is a serious problem in the society.
Serial of strikes
We have just taken it for granted that these strikes  a serial of strikes  create serious problems in the practical life of many parents. Another serious issue connected with these strikes is the girls who study at the universities. They have to put off their marriage date until they complete their degrees. Hence these university strikes make various practical problems in the socio-economic and cultural context of the common people. We are obliged to focus on the fact that these students have been selected to universities through a fierce competition of their Advanced Level examinations.
That means only a thin percentage of students get selected to universities from a large number of students who sat for the Advanced Level examination every year. Thus these students are the best of the best thousands of students whose knowledge and skills should be utilized for the betterment of the people rather than of the country at large. So the expectations of parents, government and students are just a dream because of the incessant university strikes. The Sri Lankans have travelled a quite a long way in the journey of university education since its first inception in 1942.
We are still unable to prepare a solid framework for university education.
Is it the fault of the university or government Still, they are unable to fix and permanent terms and conditions with regard to the remunerations of academic and non-academic staff and ethical and moral framework for university students who should follow these moral virtues during their stay in universities. These strikes, on the other hand, will affect the academic activities of overseas students who are to complete their undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral studies in Sri Lankan universities.
All in all, the activities of 15 universities have come to a standstill due to this on-going strike. Therefore, this is the responsibilities of the university lecturers and staff to give due pressure to the responsible authority to reopen all the universities and resume all academic activities immediately. University students should also behave responsibly.
When they demand something they very often tend to strike untimely and close all universities.
When the universities remain closed, they should raise their voice to reopen the universities if they are really interested in their studies.
Thus we earnestly request the government to solve the crisis of the non-academic staff of universities, on the other hand, the non-academic staff should also give more on the education and future of students who are in a stranded position between the government and the university.

A statement released by the UNP said that they would finalise decisions on the party reform process during the above meeting and a committee would be appointed to monitor the progress of their implementation.
The Prime Minister will hold discussions with the Party Chairman, General Secretary and Treasurer with regard to the process of appointing the committee and thereafter communicate their decision to the UNP Parliamentary Group.
If those constitutional changes are required we are looking to make changes to the UNP constitution,he added.
UNP Puttalam district MP Hector Appuhamy said MPs who criticise the government holding ministerial posts should resign.

Unprecedented political dramas of the 1970s and 80s
JR Jayewardene, MP Colombo South who resigned on May 13, 1975, protesting against the extension of the period of Parliament by Sirimavos United Front government which won the 1970 General Elections obtaining the two-thirds majority. (Her government passed a new constitution in 1972. Bandaranaike who was in coalition with the two main leftist parties, the LSSP and CP, in the process, extended the life of parliament by 2 years, to continue in office till 1977).
JRJ was sworn-in as the first Executive President elected by the people in 1982. He was elected to a six-year term in October 1982. JR made an unconventional though legal, through the legislature, his decision to call for a Referendum in place of a general election extending the term of Parliament by six years.
The life of the Parliament was due to expire in August 1983 - the government faced the prospect of losing its massive five-sixth majority if general elections were held under the new Proportional Representation system introduced.
He proposed a referendum to lengthen the life of 1977 parliament, which the UNP led by him won comfortably over the extremely unpopular SLFP led government, (obtaining 140 of the 168 seats under first-past-the-post) with its constituents unaffected, thereby allowing the UNP to carry on with its two-thirds majority.
Citing the infamous Naxalite factor, JR told the people that the SLFP was under Naxalites control and they were planning to take over the Armed Forces and carry out a movement of terror. For the Referendum, the government had to pass an amendment to the Constitution (the Fourth) which was later allowed by the seven-Judge bench of the SC on a majority decision. The amendment states: Unless sooner dissolved, the first Parliament shall continue until August 4, 1989.
JR also demanded that the UNP MPs sign and handover undated letters of resignation to the President. He claimed that a certain section led by popular film idol Vijaya Kumaratunga (husband of Chandrika) of the SLFP connive to kill him and some leaders of the SLFP immediately after the Presidential election and topple the government in a coup. The President imposed a State of Emergency though there were absolutely no signs of trouble. He maintained a State of Emergency, throughout the process of referendum, thus for the first time an election took place while the nation was under emergency.
The Amendment was passed with 142 votes for and only 4 against. The Referendum was held on December 22, 1982; it was the first and the only national referendum to be held in the island. The election between the Lamp and the Pot was a highly rigged one (Ref. Election Commissioner Chandrananada de Silvas report on referendum 1982; released in late 1986), votes in favour of the Proposal got 3.1 million [54%] as against the 2.60 [45%] million voted against the idea. The referendum was filled with electoral abuses. In fact, De Silva was made the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence for his impartiality by CBK when she came into power.
MPs punished
Seventeen UNP MPs  who tendered undated letters of resignation were asked to resign based on poor performance in their electorates at the Presidential Election and referendum. On February 10, 1983, their letters of resignation came into effect. They were  Tudor Gunasekera -Mahara, Sumanadasa Abeywickrema of Baddegama, Reginald Wijegunaratna -Mathugama Sepala Akurugoda, P. Sumatiratna -Habaraduwa, Dr. Ranjith Atapattu -Beliatta, P. M. B. Cyril -Tissamaharama, D. G. Albert de Silva -Kamuburupitiya, Pathmin Fonseka -Panadura, T. D. Fransisco -Mulkirigala, Premaratna Gunasekera -Maharagama, Mervyn Kularatna -Eheliyagoda, Harris Wanigasekera -Hakmana, Jinadasa Weerasinghe -Tangalle, V. L. Wijemanne Kalutara, and Ryter Tillakaratne -Ratgama. They had to face by-elections, some lost while a few of them won.
Let me relate the writers own first-hand experience, a ghastly one indeed on the day of Referendum at Ratmalana electorate, where Lalith Athulathmudali was the organiser. A couple of days before the voting, while returning from work with a friend who worked for a state institution coming under Athulathmudali, he suggested we go for organisers meeting at a venue in Ratmalana that Lalith wanted him to participate. Seeing an opportunity to meet the young dynamic politician I obliged.
Addressing a crowd of around 60-70 supporters that included a few notorious characters from Angulana slum area [Gona-Kovila], the astute man inquired from his secretary if the allocation of agents for the polling booths had been covered fully. He was informed of some difficulty in finding suitable men for Attidiya area. Lalith pointed at my friend calling him by his first name and requested him, in his own words, I say, why dont you come with your friend to assist the secretary in filling the vacuum, he continued looking at me, Attidiya is a decent place. I, who never got involved in politics was compelled to engage as my friends were urging me to come along.
Ballots and bullets
The election morning was one of the darkest days in my life, I told a lie to home people, cast my vote against the referendum at our booth and rushed with my friend to Attidiya at around 7.30 am sat with two others after producing the documents to the polling officer. My friend was given a copy of the electoral list of the ward and we had to ensure the name of the claimant is recorded therein.
Voting was far below the average according to veteran observers. Around 8.45 am two men clad in green shirts and caps with Laliths badges walked in ignoring the two cops objections, and spoke with the chief state officer inquiring the percentage polled, and walked away to return with a gang of about ten, some openly carrying small arms; a shot was fired in the air.
They ordered the agents of other parties to leave at once. Both of us got up too, mahaththayala inna (gentlemen, you shall stay). They demanded the unmarked fresh ballot papers from the polling officer who was shivering and had no option but to oblige. Some of the books were thrown on our table while they commenced marking a vote for Lamp on the rest requesting us to follow. Two of them separated the ballot papers from the counterfoils and stuffed them into the box using a knife and a foot-ruler returning the last book back to the authorities, and released one more bullet to the open air and rushed back.
Waymba PC election
The SLFP led by CBK in 1999s infamous Wayamba PC election went a step further and returned the drama in style making over 70 percent of polling booths close up by 9 am. Since then gradually things improved for the better.
The voters today are fortunate that 100 percent fairness has been restored in the electoral process, where results are genuine and indicate the wishes of the voter.

Writ petition on Elpitiya PS election fixed for argument
A writ petition filed by the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) regarding the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha election was yesterday fixed for argument by the Supreme Court.
On January 30, the Supreme Court issued an Interim Order preventing the Elections Commission from taking further steps to proceed with holding the election to the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha, until the final determination of a writ petition.
Issuing an Interim Order on the Galle District Returning Officer, the Supreme Court had observed that there is ample reason to grant relief pleaded by the petitioners.
The Democratic United National Front (DUNF) was founded in 1990 by a group of United National Party dissidents. The party was led by the late Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake.
Three members of the DUNF filed this petition in the Supreme Court naming Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents. They sought an order in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the DUNF for the election of members to the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Three petitioners Vithanage Ariyaratne, Thilak Opatha, Ariyawansa Dissanayake (party secretary) had filed this petition naming Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Galle District), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents.

The United National Front (UNF) Parliamentary Group yesterday unanimously decided to vote against the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Power and Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
Speaking to journalists after participating in a special discussion between the Prime Minister and the NFF Parliamentary Group members in Temple Trees yesterday, the Minister said the NCM is not against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but against the entire government.
The President as the head of the government and the Cabinet Ministers represent the government. This has not targeted only the Prime Minister, the Minister said.
The former government had failed to conduct adequate investigations into serious crimes. Now all the investigations are in the final stages and rapidly progressing including the legal action against the responsible persons involved in the bond scam.
Therefore, this is a futile effort of the JO since the legal action have already been taken against wrongdoers, the Minister said.
He said that Prime Minister agreed to restructure and reform the Party. The partys Parliamentary Group on Management and Policymaking and the members of the Working Committee will meet on April 7 and 8 to discuss this process further.
The NCM will face sure defeat when it is taken up for debate on April 4. Then a draft law to establish a

AASL strike called off
Employees at the Bandaranaike International Airport (AASL) who engaged in strike action yesterday morning, called it off last evening as authorities agreed to the payment of allowances.
Airport Sri Lanka Freedom Party Union (ASFPU) members had blocked all three entrances to the Airport using backhoes and other vehicles. The aviation sector however was operational and security and air traffic controllers continued to function during the strike.
The union had met Transport and Civil Aviation Minister, Nimal Siripala de Silva on March 28 but they failed to reach an agreement on the occasion.
Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G.S. Withanage told Daily News they had agreed to sign an agreement to provide an allowance of Rs 10,000 per month for three years.
The Union had alleged that eventhough the Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited had promised them a Rs 10,000 increase in 2015 they have not been paid it for the last three years. The allowances will be paid with no increment to the salary, Withanage said . The Police, Special Task Force (STF) and anti-riot squads had been called for during the chaos at the airport. Union Convener M.W.P Muhandiram was not available for comment despite various attempts made to contact him.

Agro Nutrition honored at Most Innovative Exporter Category National Chamber of Exporters awards

Managing Director, Agro Nutrition (Pvt) Limited Prabath Fonseka said that his products are made out of more natural material and herbal products and due to this there is an increase demand in the world.
"Sri Lanka has rich bio-diversity but sadly authorities are paying less attention to R&D. However in contrast our company has taken an initiative and hired University graduates and as a result we have come out with new products.
Fonseka said that the European Union countries expect extensive clinical reports for all natural products, which are very expensive to carry out in those countries. 'The lack of facilities to do extensive clinical research in our laboratories has resulted in our losing many opportunities to tap unexploited areas in herbal exports, he said.
"We can develop new herbal products but the biggest problem is getting validations for our researched products from local research institutions. Therefore, we have to either go to Singapore or to Europe for such certification, which is very costly, Fonseka added.
His products include, Vitamin Mineral Premixes, Water Soluble Powders, Oral Liquids, Wound Healing Spray Multivitamin Amino Oral Liquids, Antibiotics, Acidifiers, Dewormers and Toxin Binder.
Agro Nutrition today is one of Sri Lankas Leading manufacturers, exporters, importers and distributors of high quality, cost effective animal nutrition products, catering to a large cross section of customers in the poultry and livestock industry.

Artificial rain, superficial gain
The Secretary to Ministry for Power and Energy, Dr. Suren Batagoda is reported to have said, in a bid to find a sustainable solution to the recurring droughts in the next few months would witness the first onset of artificial rain in selected areas of the country as a pilot project. He seems to depend on luck, a defeatist attitude when he says: "But we cannot provide an uninterrupted power supply throughout the year unless we do not dramatically increase the generation of alternative energy, which is not possible in a short period of time. Besides, it needs major investments. That is why we have decided to try our luck on artificial rain.
This very statement proves Artificial Rain is not a proven technology. It will be interesting to know whether this technology was tried in other countries and the results. If not, is Thailand testing it at our expense Readers will remember, I wrote sometimes back about a team sent to Vietnam in the 1980s for a similar training and when tested in Sri Lanka, it was an utter failure. A similar case where some foreign companies were trying to set up an Ocean Thermal Energy project at our cost which was heavily influenced by political backing. Fortunately, wise counsel prevailed, in requesting the foreign company to install one at their cost and CEB would buy power at a negotiated price. They made a hasty retreat, never to be seen again. Let not Sri Lanka be a testing/ experimenting grounds, spending our money to prove others' innovations or inventions.
Sometimes back, this same Secretary had said he was getting private power suppliers to come in at a cost of Rs.28.20 which he considered as a bargain when the price was Rs.30/- to Rs.35/- per unit. If he is so price conscious, he could have persuaded the Minister to go along with the CEB Generation Plan where a Coal Plant was included. If done, the price per unit would have been in the region of Rs.12/- to Rs.18/-. He should not come with the argument of Paris Accord, as in our submission, there is provision to deviate when necessity arises.
To quote from the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution  Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment- Sri Lanka  October 2015: Sri Lanka reserves the right to revise its intended national contributions and targets at any point of time and consider its UNDCs to be a living document that should be integrated with changes/modified national development goals and targets.
All this Trying our luck is due to the mismanagement of this vital sector by not listening to the expert advice of CEB engineers and its expert consultants. Had the Ministry, supported the Least Cost Long-Term Generation plan, where a Coal Power Plant was included, this desperate, pathetic situation would not have arisen. Instead, the Minister for Power and Energy backed the recommendations of PUCSL and the Generation Plan of the CEB is yet under dispute. Do not forget, when the CEB prepares its Generation Plan, it takes into consideration, its own Institution [CEB], national and consumer interests, and international, environmental aspects as well. Whereas PUCSL does not care to consider the interests of the Institution [CEB]. That is where the government is misguided and thereby cause a conflict between CEB and PUCSL. Please stop this Kana Mutti game and see reality and act accordingly.

Ball-tampering scandal had big effect, says Paine after thrashing
JOHANNESBURG tuesday: The fall-out from Australias ball-tampering scandal had a major effect on the performance of the team, new captain Tim Paine said after his team were thrashed by 492 runs in the fourth Test at the Wanderers Stadium on Tuesday.
The defeat gave South Africa a 3-1 series victory, their first at home against Australia since 1969/70.
Paine admitted that South Africa had outplayed Australia after losing the first Test in Durban. We cant hide from the fact that purely on skill they outplayed us, he said.
But he said he was disappointed at the lack of fight shown as Vernon Philander ripped through his team on the final morning. Philander had career-best figures of six for 21, taking all six of his wickets for three runs in 5.2 overs. He dismissed the Marsh brothers, Shaun and Mitchell, with the first and fourth balls of the morning and Australia never recovered.
They crashed from 88 for three to 119 all out in 16.4 overs.
It brought to an end a series of high-quality cricket and even greater off-field drama, culminating in a ball tampering scandal during the third Test in Cape Town which resulted in former captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and Cameron Bancroft being sent home and banned.
Theres been enough spoken about the week we had, said Paine.
Were disappointed with the way we handled it. This group had a chance to show some real fight and determination today, but unfortunately we werent able to.
Mentally we werent quite there.
You only have to be slightly off in any game of cricket, let alone (against) a team as good as South Africa, and you get exposed.
I thought we were going to be better than we were. It obviously had more of an effect on guys than we probably knew ourselves. Paine said Australia would reflect on what had happened. Now we have the opportunity to go home and start again almost. He said the change in team culture that had been spoken about after the scandal had already started. That will continue to happen, he said. Weve obviously got a new coach coming in who will have a huge say on how that is. From my point of view weve got to find a fine line between being really respectful of the opposition and also being at a level that is really competitive.
South African captain Faf du Plessis hailed what he said was South Africas most complete performance of a 10-Test summer during which his second-ranked team had beaten top side India and third-ranked Australia.
This means a lot to us, he said. This whole series has been probably the best we have been right through a series. Weve been winning a lot of series but there have been little holes where we could improve.
This series has been incredible the way we have put it all together.
Du Plessis said different players had contributed at stages throughout the series.
There are a lot of things that came together. The opening (batting) combination got us off to a good start pretty much in every game. There were five hundreds in this series which is incredible and we were bowling teams out every time, taking 80 wickets in the series. Our bowling unit was exceptional. Du Plessis said he had never known his team to be as motivated as much as they were after a bad-tempered first Test in Durban. They went almost from motivated to motivated slash angry and they were determined to turn it around. I could feel all 11 guys were really motivated to make a play in this series.  AFP

Brahms Explodes On Cello
After the intermission, Brahms jump-started into every heart with his open score Allegro con brio in B Major Op. 8, Leaving behind the more popular Beethoven and Schubert to trail behind, followed by Scherzo - Allegro-molto and Adagio that brought down the roof by a buoyant response at the Lionel Wendt Memorial Theatre as the curtain fell on the players.
A CLASSICAL TRIO, presented by Sunetra Foundation to fund-raise a worthy cause touched all our hearts, headed by Sunetra Bandaranayaka who must be commended for her dynamic dedication to reach the helpless. In the process, Sunetra also helps promote and nurture something very close to my heart; the arts: mainly performing and visual arts. Clearly, she is focused on fine arts and we are here for one such event made possible by her.
Into the jam-packed auditorium, lovers of classical music thronged most faces I have seen over and over again which reveal their everlasting bond to classical music. Some come to witness and hear their favourite composers being played but tonight, one thing was sure that the crowds came to watch Rohan de Sarem on the cello when mystique came alive the moment he started caressing the strings.
These three wonderful artists Rohan de Sarem, Rohan de Silva and Mandhira de Sarem whose wizardry on their chosen instruments played differently. Each in his/her own world on strings and keyboard and combined as and when each score made it necessary. Otherwise, they drifted apart with no indication of passion for each other. Drops of brilliance, iconic playing brought together in youth and experience. Of course, Rohan de Sarem led from the front with his immaculate playing the world has come to known. He is by far and wide the living legend on cello, recognized, honoured and beloved whenever or wherever he played. If I mention him to be the most spectacular performing artist that Sri Lanka has produced during our lifetime followed by pianist Malini Jayasinghe-Pieris, many will agree.
If their body language failed to respond to each other, the piano should have been placed a bit further away because of most of Rohan de Silva's powerful playing overlapped the gentle, soft melodious strings. Yet, Mandira was seen punishing the strings with gusto and force while Rohan de Sarem remained the genius he is letting the cello speak for him.
This distinguished cellist wining all international awards one can hope for has come a long way to establish his genius in our hearts and souls. Between the three, the attractive lyricism and the gift of retaining their own distinctive music mannerism made them the most formidable for Lankan audiences to relish upon. Seldom seen such graceful, high-class talent assembled on our stage in recent times.

International Day for Mine Awareness:
Britain funds Sri Lankas mine clearance effort
Its over 20 years since Princess Diana walked through a heavily mined field in Angola and changed the way the international community thought about this appalling and indiscriminate weapon of war. Shortly after that historic visit, the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and
Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their destruction was signed, creating an established framework through which the world could work towards eradicating these barbaric weapons.
Mines and unexploded ordnance leave a terrible legacy of war, long after the guns have fallen silent. Hidden from sight, they continue to kill and maim innocent civilians going about their daily lives. Their very presence hinders development and prevents families and communities from being able to return to their land and rebuild.
Sri Lanka is no stranger to the long-lasting suffering that mines cause. In fact, by the end of the conflict, over 500km2 of land was contaminated by landmines. Today marks the International Day for Mine Awareness, the first one since Sri Lanka acceded to the Ottawa Convention in December 2017. Signing up to the Ottawa Protocol demonstrated the governments commitment to meeting its ambitious target of becoming Mine Impact Free by 2020.
The UK supports Sri Lanka in its efforts to clear every single mine on this beautiful island. Thats why the British High Commission in Colombo has been funding demining work in Sri Lanka since 2010. Between 2010 and 2019, we will have spent over 6.2 million (Rs. 1.2 billion) on demining all across the North and East of Sri Lanka. Working mostly through our partners, The HALO Trust, our goal is to clear more than 600,000m2 of land between 2016 and 2019, making it safe for people to move home and start cultivating their land again.
Together with a range of Sri Lankan and international partners, we are making progress. Last year, we joined celebrations to mark the milestone of Batticaloa becoming the first district in Sri Lanka to be classified as mine residual risk free. Many organisations helped to ensure this significant result. We are proud that another British demining charity, the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), working alongside the Humanitarian Demining Unit of the Sri Lankan Army and others, made a major contribution to achieving this great feat.
In the last year, UK support helped clear 142,549m2 of land of mines, unexploded ordnance and stray and small ammunition; our clearance activity has benefited 5,215 people; a further 11,139 individuals, including women and children, have received UK-supported mine risk education.
Thats what makes demining such an important part of the UKs wider commitment to reconciliation and peace-building in Sri Lanka. Not only does it offer immediate humanitarian benefits, but it also accelerates recovery from conflict.
Families can live and farm. Children can play without fear. In the short term, it also offers employment opportunities to some of the most vulnerable, including female heads of household. The HALO Trust for instance has a workforce that is over 50 percent female, helping young women affected by the conflict to make a real difference in the future of their communities.
Last year our Minister for Asia, Mark Field, MP, visited the North to hear from those working on the frontlines of the demining effort. I too visited last November, seeing for myself the scale of the challenge. With anti-personnel mines still covering the ground in great numbers, the risk is still very real, though significant progress has been made. The Halo Trusts thorough and professional clearance operations mean that land can be handed back to those displaced many years ago. I met one family who had already begun rebuilding their lives in their old home. With new crops planted and a sense of optimism about the future, meeting them was a great reminder of exactly why this sort of work is so important.
Since 2010, much has been accomplished, and together we have dug many thousands of mines and unexploded ordnances from the ground. Thousands of mines that can no longer threaten the lives of ordinary Sri Lankans. Whilst we should take pride in this shared achievement, there is still much more work to be done. On International Mine Awareness Day, lets redouble our efforts to realise the dream of a mine-free Sri Lanka by 2020.

Deport Udayanga to Colombo: Foreign Ministry resquests UAE
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate that the Foreign Affairs Ministry has made a request from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) authorities to deport former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga to Colombo in connection with the controversial MiG aircraft deal.
Senior State Counsel Udara Karunaratne appearing for the Attorney General informed Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne that Weeratunga had been arrested by UAE authorities and is currently detained in Abu Dhabi.
The Magistrate had earlier issued an open warrant written in English through Interpol for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF).The Magistrate issued an order directing the managers of two private banks that bank transaction details pertaining to the mother-in-law of Udayanga Weeratunga be provided to FCID for their on going investigations.
The FCID alleged that Udayanga Weeratunga had allegedly misappropriated Rs.1072 million through the MiG aircraft transaction. The FCID informed court that it has traced properties said to be worth Rs.94 million belonging to former Ambassador.
The FCID conducting investigation into MiG aircraft transaction had named Udayanga Weeratunga and five other Singaporeans as suspects in the case through a B report filed in the Fort Magistrates Court. The FCID had informed Court that Udayanga Weeratunga had directly intervened into the questionable transaction in procuring MiG-27 ground attack crafts.The FCID said the deal amounted to US$ 14 million.
On June 9, 2016 the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued notice on Udayanga Weeratunga to appear in Court July 15 but he did not turn up. Thereafter, on October 20, 2016 court issued a warrant for Weeratungas arrest.
The FCID told court that they were investigating whether the former Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia had invested money in a company called Sri Lankan Limited Liability Company in Moscow, which he had earned through the Mig-27 transaction. Meanwhile, the FCID named five foreign nationals and a foreign company as suspects regarding this case.The FCID launched this investigation following a complaint lodged by defence columnist and political writer Iqbal Athas.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircraft had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lanka and Ukraine.

Desire to inspire
For Head Boy of Lyceum, Hemaka Gunasekera trust is a cornerstone of his leadership. Gunasekera calls those under him to have a sense of responsibility and value integrity. Perfect Prefects features Gunasekera a man of his word.
A Head Prefect should take responsibility when a situation of difficulty arises. It calls for leadership skills. No matter how nervous or distressed you are you need to take responsibility. You have to take charge. When coming to a decision I will always think about it twice. If I am nervous I need a little bit of time to think about it. So I will come to a conclusion with my fellow Head Girl Budara Wickramasinghe, said Gunasekera.
Street-mart
Gunasekera pointed out that the position of a leader is never easy. Whatever those under him do, he or she comes under criticism. Every mistake a person under his/her authority makes, falls on him/her.
It is my responsibility not to make a mistake that might reflect badly on my boss. If I make a mistake I should take the full responsibility. It is a way of getting street- smart. I also believe in talking to my boss in a diplomatic and courteous way. It is a bit of a risk but it is worth it, said Gunasekera
In this century there are so many stereotypes points out Gunasekera. There is a great need for men who are honest. He or she should be straightforward and someone who does not talk behind your back.
Basically you need someone, who is entirely honest with you, pointing out your faults and what you have done correctly. He or she has to be authentic. And he or she needs to be credible. If there is a credibility I can say he is role model for me, added Gunasekera.
Along with his sense of morality comes a conviction that one needs to go through a baptism of fire.
In life, in order to change you need to be broken. In that sense, Lyceum has changed me so much. I started out as a very inexperienced character but I have matured ever since I took this position. I have made a lot of rash decisions and this year of prefect-ship has changed me a lot. There are excellent people in the management and staff that I can look up to and talk to, explained Gunasekera
Make the change
Gunasekeras dream is to be an entrepreneur because he has this desire to inspire people. Because inspiring people is what makes a change and making the change, is what this world needs says Gunasekera. You need to be strong to ignore what everyone is saying about you and be yourself.
A leader needs to be confident and honest. You need to work hard no matter what anyone says about you, if it is a lie, ignore it and move on, said Gunasekera
He believes that there should be more legitimate people in the world. People you can look up to and trust. The main goal any leader should have is for the progression of the country. Not for one individual or for a group of people. It should be for the country. Change starts within yourself.
I feel there should be more understanding of each other. Society often rejects and corners people due to many reasons. It always happens. The change I would like to see is more acceptance of people. At the end of the day, we are humans regardless of how we appear. And we would like to be treated as humans. Racial discrimination, Gender Inequality and the Stereotypes is what really concerns me. If you do not live up to them some people reject you. And when people reject you it hurts. We are social creatures. We need acceptance. But if we want to work together and make the world a better place, people need to see each other as equals, explains Gunasekera.
Also as leaders we should know where to draw the line and how to get the job done. This is something else he believes in. Too often we dont know when enough is enough. Every problem you encounter you have to bring it out because the more you keep a problem within yourself it is going to hurt you.
Formulating plans
Making a crucial decision is tough in life, because the moment you screw up, everyone is going to put the blame on you. People will point fingers at you so you need to think very carefully. Think about it, discuss it and formulate the plan. Budara and I never knew each other until we got this post and now we are great friends now, said Gunasekera.
Head Girl of Lyceum Budara Wickramasinghes attitude is that adversity in life is actually an opportunity for one to acquire skills that will enable one to be a model citizen and also mould ones character so that one may be of service to society and motherland.
As Head Prefects me, and my fellow Head Boy Hemaka Gunasekera have to really take the plunge. As Heads, we have to take responsibility for the situation that requires immediate attention. Both of us collaborate with each other and talk about the situation and come to a conclusion. Because when we are under pressure, decision making is at its best when we take a decision together. Because then we present our different angles and viewpoints to each other and scrutinize and come up with the best decision possible, said Wickramasinghe
This position itself is a role that prepares us for the workplace. The boss takes all the decisions and is responsible for the mistakes every worker makes.
I believe it is my responsibility to do the task properly and hand the assignment over, so he or she will not be blamed, for what I have done. So I believe this position and this prefect-ship itself is a training platform. When you consider problems in a relationship, the best thing to do is to approach that person, and explain matters to him/her courteously so there wont be a conflict in the future. It involves discussing pluses and minuses, said Wickramasinghe.
We live in an age of great and rapid change. Now more than ever before the youth of this world are tested and need to prove themselves. The youth need to keep up with this rapid change.
The 21st century has many demands. It is up to us to take action in response to an opportunity or crisis, and think properly before taking a decision. Because if a decision goes wrong at the end, you will not be able to fulfil your potential to be of service to others. You need to be a good citizen, pointed out Wickramasinghe.
Fostered within
Being a good citizen is a belief that has been embedded in Wickramasinghe. These are values that have been fostered within her.
From the day I joined this school it has provided me with a lot of opportunities. We are exposed to discussions about basic human values. This has taught us to be proper citizens. We are also educated on Effective Speech so we can speak confidently without being nervous. Since becoming Head Girl I have matured in so many ways. Truth, Love, Peace, Right Conduct and Non Violence are themes we are educated in. You should always speak the truth and be honest with people. When it comes to love, be caring for each other, said Wickramasinghe.
Wickramasinghes ambition is to become a Chief Executive Officer of a company. She has the courage to make this dream come true. She has faith in herself and can face any situation no matter how tough it may be.

Emilys melody
In 1862, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a scholar, received four poems enclosed in a letter from a young woman in Amherst, Massachusetts, US. The poems were sent to Higginson for a professional literary opinion since his reputation had established him as a man of letter and an essayist. The judgement came from the receiver as creations of a certain degree of unorthodox writing.
He too felt that the poems he read belong to a new era. But his ultimate conclusion happened to be a rejection. Despite the conclusion, Higginson continued to correspond with the young poetess. She was no other than Emily Dickinson (1830  1886). As later records show, the poetess had been enjoyed in the creative process devoid of any discouragement. This has reached a point where she had written some thousands of poems.
Poetic skills
As a later compiler of the poems of Emily Dickinson, George Gesner points out: after the death of Emily, in 1886, her sister Lavinia had discovered a box containing hundreds of her poems. In her search for a publisher, she had come in contact with a poetry enthusiast named Mabel Loomis Todd, a wife of a professor. In contact with Higginson, Mabel brought out the complete poems of Emily Dickinson in order to encourage Lavinia and to rediscover Emily and her latent poetic skills. As such, most of the poems we read today, which are closed in the compilation of Todd and Higginson titled as Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson came out several times commencing from 1890 until 1982. The work I possess is an edition brought out by Gramerey Books in NY.
This complete work includes four books each containing more than 100 poems. The first book is titled as Life. The second one is Love. The third is Nature. The fourth is Time and Eternity. Whether the partition of her poems is done by her or by the later editors is not quite certain. But all the books taken as a whole depict the world of the poetess in varied forms.
In Book One, Emily attempts to present the simple and sensitive challenges she had faced through her living conditions. On the topic titled as Success she writes:
Success is counted sweetest,By those who never succeedTo comprehend a nectarRequires sorest need!As he, defeated dying,On whose forbidden ear,The distant strains of triumphBreak, agonised and clear.
Mysterious pain
As a poetess, Emily traverses from the simple situations to visionary stages, penetrating into sensitive experiences such as The Mystery of Pain where she states:
Pain has an element of blank,It cannot recollectWhen it began, or if there wereA Day when it was not.It has no future but itself,Its infinite realms containIts past, enlightenedNew periods of pain to perceive.It is believed that most of the poems of Dickinson have been sent to friends as gifts and sometimes as letters of goodwill. From a conventional point of view, most of the poems are rhythmic prose, written as thoughtful streams with flashes of sensitive insights.One good example s the introspective thought stream that goes as follows, untitled.If I can stop one heartFrom breakingI shall not live in vainIf I can ease one lifeThe achingOr cool one painOr help one fainting robinUnto his nest againI shall not live in vain.The book Love contains some of the alternative types of love poems in the form of a metaphysical definition, the poetess writes:Love is anterior to lifePosterior to deathInitial of creation andThe exponent of breath.
In an undertone, at times the poetess sees the concept of love as ironic. One good example is the one untitled and goes as follows:
We outgrow love like other thingsAnd put it in the drawerTill it an antique fashion showsLike costumes grandsires wore.
Why poetry
The poetic persona is created in the form of a detached person who observes experiences as a series of images. In the third book titled as Nature the poetess seems to penetrate into the inner selves of all that is around her. They include the trees, birds, butterflies, seasons, sea mornings and evenings and tender questions related to them. The poem titled 'Why', looks like a preface to her creations that go as follows.
The murmur of a beeA witchcraft yieldeth meIf anyone asks me whyt were easier to die.The red upon the hillTaketh away my willIf anybody sneer,Take care, for god is hereThats all.The breaking of the dayAddeth to my degreeIf any ask me how,Artist who drew me so must tell.
A layer of spirituality is fused into the narrative type of expression reminding of influences from psalms. The poems in book four titled as Time and Eternity encompasses more natural poems of Emily Dickinson. They include more of prophetic views on the passing of time and the thoughts pertaining to a possible lifespan than one expects. In the prologue-like beginning, the poetess says:
This world is not the conclusionA sequel stained beyondInvisible as musicBut positive as so soundIt beckons and it bafflesPhilosophies dont knowAnd through riddlesAt the last.Sagacity must goTo guess it puzzles scholarsTo gain it men have shownContempt of generationsAnd crucifixion known.
The poetess seems to have gained inspiration in her visits to places of sanctity like seeing graves, bombs, imagining profiles of holiness and reading epitaphs. As her well-wishing preface writer Mabel Loomis Todd says: Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns the birds and bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden with a few trusted human friends, were sufficient companionship for her inspiration.

The meals have been restricted to morning hours which are not in keeping with the accepted guidelines of more frequent smaller meals. Kumarasena has developed cows milk allergy which complicated the situation further.
Over time, the Engineer felt information acquired by him will be useful to many readers and considered publishing his findings and thoughts. However, he warns that the writing is flavoured with Engineering and IT, though it does not mean that he does not appreciate the broad knowledge and the guidelines provided by medical profession. The model used by an average practitioner is unlikely to cover certain cases due to some complications, which prevail in the domain of the total medical profession.
Similar to the procedure adopted to use certain software with known bugs with workaround (practice adopted to avoid the known problem by achieving the result in a different manner) rather tahn writing each and every application, a patient has to manage the health consulting available practitioners.
Titled as An Engineers Experience of and Views on Diabetes, the book is based on the information and knowledge derived from several fields. Kumarasena has attempted to explain the relationships among the results of the different observations using simple models.
Some people may feel that they are too basic and not adequate. Kumarasena invites them to enhance and improve the models by introducing additional parameters. If the concepts are further elaborated to cover a wider scope, the end result will become more useful.

EU delegates here to monitor GSP Plus trade programme
A high-level delegation of European Union Parliamentarians arrives in Colombo today to evaluate Sri Lankas membership to the GSP Plus trading programme.
A spokesperson for the EU Embassy in Colombo said the MPs would meet with representatives from government, civil society, trade unions, and international organisations to discuss the initial results of the preferential trade scheme.
The EU restored Sri Lanka to the reduced tariff programme last May, fulfilling a key promise of the Unity Government. But Sri Lankas ongoing membership to the programme is tied to the countrys compliance with certain international human rights and environmental conventions. Sri Lanka was expelled in 2011 because of allegations of human rights abuses and war crimes.
The discussions this week will enhance the (EUs) dialogue with Sri Lanka on the remaining challenges, an EU statement read.
The delegation includes members of the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade, as well as Sajjad Karim, the Standing Rapporteur for South Asia.
The MPs will hold a press briefing on Thursday, before departing the country Friday.

Film Review: Messiah risen from death
Paul, Apostle of Christ is a film speaking about the struggling men of faith, where Grace abounds more than the sin abounds and it is now been shown in some parts of the globe celebrating the Easter festival this year.
The film Paul, Apostle of Christ, directed by Andrew Hyatt, chronicles the apostles last days, which were spent in a Roman prison awaiting execution under Nero.
It is the story of two men, Luke, as a friend and physician, risks his life when he ventures into the City of Rome, to visit Paul, who is held captive, in Neros darkest, bleakest prison cell. But Nero is determined to rid Rome of Christians and does not flinch, from executing them, in the grisliest ways possible. Before Pauls death sentence can be enacted, Luke resolves to write another book, one that details the beginnings of The Way and the birth of what will come to be, known as the Church.
Two men struggle against a determined emperor, and the frailties of the human spirit, in p order to live out the Gospel of Jesus, Christ and spread their message to the world.
The story unveils showing Luke visiting Paul, as is in the biblical account, and writes the history of the early church, recounting the missionarys journeys to spread the Gospel that are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles.
The story is fascinating not only because of Lukes dangerous pilgrimage (the emperor is determined to eliminate Christians) but because of Pauls amazing transformation.
Originally, Paul, as Saul was, Jesus-hating Pharisee, the foremost persecutor of Christ followers in his quest to defend what he believed to be true Judaism. A man of the Law, he was zealous in both condemning Christians (a dero-gatory term that means Little Christ) and in his own self-righteousness under the ritual regulations of the Torah.
Saul breathed threats and murder against anyone who believed Jesus was the Messiah, now risen from death. As a leading Pharisee, he authorized the stoning to death of Stephen, the first servant in the sect of Judaism then known as The Way.
But on his bloodthirsty mission to Damascus to arrest and prosecute disciples, Saul encountered the Risen One.
Suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him, the scripture relates, and Saul fell to the ground.
Then he heard an audible voice calling his name. Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me It was Jesus, who was crucified and confirmed dead by Roman authorities.
Theres much more to the story, but this epiphany so changed Saul that he devoted the rest of his life to convincing others that Jesus is, indeed, the Messiah. He traveled the world over  more than 10,000 miles by foot and boat  to proclaim the Christ he formerly hated. And his name was changed from Saul to Paul.
That Paul, the Servant of the Lord, bound in chains , his struggle was internal. He has survived so much,- floggings, shipwreck, starvation, stoning, hunger and thirst, cold and exposure, yet as he waits, for his appointment with death, he is haunted by the shadows of his past misdeeds. Alone in the dark, he wonders if, he has been forgotten ..and if he has the strength, to finish, well.
Jim Caviezel, who played Jesus in "The Passion of the Christ," is cast as St. Luke. James Faulkner (Downton Abbey, Game of Thrones) is St. Paul.
The name Saul means great one. The name Paul means little one, Caviezel told, a riveted audience of Fellowship of Catholic University Students at the Leadersship Summer 2018.
While making this film, I learned that by changing one tiny letter, we can become great in the eyes of God. But it requires us to be little, if we wish to be great. This is the way of the saints; this is the way of the holy; and this is the way Saul became St. Paul.
Hyatt said, the only source material for the script was the Bible. He did, however, create a fictional character named,Mauritius, a prison warden who is incredulous how this broken old man can pose such a threat.
It will be a very beautiful, emotionally moving film, with a rather wonderful ending, Faulkner (Paul) explained. Redemption is offered and is clear. Caviezel is a devout Catholic who has called abortion the greatest moral defect of the western world. He is also working on a sequel to "The Passion of the Christ" with director Mel Gibson that focuses on the Resurrection.
The main roles of the film are played by Jim Caviezel, Oliver Martinez James Faulkner.

Forced to live inside glass cage  for 13 years!
A woman suffering from four rare and life-threatening medical conditions has been forced to live inside a glass cage for 13 years.
Unable to kiss her husband or hug her children, Juana Munoz from Cadiz in Spain fears she may never be able to hold her first grandchild.
The 53-year-old dreams of the day she can embrace her loved ones again and thanks to a US-made organic dust mask she may be able to very soon.
But for now, she is forced to isolate herself inside a 25-metre glass cage that she's called home for more than a decade.
Medics are stumped over her four rare conditions, which she has been coping with for 29 years, including chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and signs of electrosensitivity, according to Spanish press.
The mother says her conditions started shortly after having her first child, when she came into contact with dust on potatoes covered in an anti-germinating agent., grown by her husband.
Juana was cleaning the potatoes when her right eye began to itch, which she scratched, then her eyes and tongue began to swell and her condition rapidly deteriorated.
She woke up days later in intensive care, lucky to be alive.
"Over the years, I came to the conclusion that the origin of everything lies in the poisoning that I suffered," she told Spanish press, who she communicated with through a microphone inside several plastic bags, passed to her stretcher in the glass cage.
Since she was forced to live inside the confined space, Manuel has been a huge source of support and grows his own vegetables so that his wife can eat fresh organic food.
The couple are waiting for the organic mask to arrive from a hospital in Dallas before their first grandchild is born.
Juana said: "In a few weeks my grandchild will be born and I do not know if I will be able to hold him at some point in my life.
"The worst thing about living like this is not the pain, it is the physical and psychological damage of not being able to go out and live a normal life with loved ones."
She is also promoting a campaign on social media called 'the hug' to support other people who have to isolate themselves from others due to rare crippling conditions.

Is foreign coach the answer for U19 and womens cricket
After much soul searching Sri Lanka Cricket eventually found a successor to Graham Ford when they appointed former Sri Lanka cricketer Chandika Hathurusingha to take charge of the mens national cricket team in December last year, but the same cannot be said of the Sri Lanka under 19 team and the Sri Lanka Womens team. These two sides badly lack a proper head coach for them to make any further progress in the sport and not only be a competitive unit but able to win titles.
Our under 19 cricketers however much we boast of a strong school system have yet to win an under 19 cricket World Cup, the women are nowhere close to winning one let alone qualifying for the last four. Sri Lanka Women who once were dominant over teams like West Indies and Pakistan and now being beaten fair and square under their own conditions and pitches. The recent ODI series saw Pakistan Women whitewash our women cricketers 3-0 and also win the T20I series 2-1. Even the West Indies Women cricketers have improved in leaps and bounds that they are ranked five ahead of Pakistan (7th) and Sri Lanka (8th). Pakistan were a team that Sri Lanka could easily beat a decade or so ago, but whereas the Pakistan Womens team have improved greatly we are still struggling to be competitive. With the exception of a one-off win here and there, our women cricketers have failed to be consistent in their performances.
The womens team has gone through the hands of several coaches who were past Sri Lankan cricketers but the improvement has been rather painstakingly slow so that other countries have already moved ahead while we remain stagnant. Its not that we dont have any cricketers of international repute there are quite a few individuals who could get into any team - players like Chamari Atapattu, Shashikala Siriwardena, Chamari Polgampola, Dilani Manodara, Inoka Ranaweera, and Sripali Weerakkody, but as a team there are many grey areas that needs fine-tuning.
One of the key factors is that unlike mens cricket, the womens cricket team does not have school cricket as its nursery. As a result a Sri Lankan woman cricketer starts her career rather late in her teens or early twenties which is not the right age to teach the basics of the game when there are so many other distractions. Only recently attempts are being made by SLC to rectify that lapse by encouraging girls schools to undertake the sport, the campaign being spearheaded by Apsari Tillakaratne (wife of former Sri Lanka captain Hashan Tillakaratne).
Now that Sri Lanka Cricket has tried their hand at appointing local coaches to handle the womens team and seen the results over the years why not for a change get someone from overseas The mens team reached the finals of six World Cups and won two of them when a foreign coach handled them. So why not our women cricketers also be given the same opportunity and see how far they improve. The only hitch with a foreign coach is the communication problem as the majority of our women cricketers converse mainly in the native language. If that shortcoming can be rectified SLC should not hesitate to give a shot at it and see the outcome of the results.
The same could be said of our under 19 cricketers too. Unlike the women counterparts the under 19 cricketers have a strong school base from which to select their squads.
The talent is so overflowing to the extent that Sri Lanka could field more than one team of equal strength. However there seems to be a shortcoming from the coaching part as the best of talent is not properly harnessed and used to get the maximum results. Sri Lankas poor showing in the recently concluded Under 19 World Cup in New Zealand was due to bad selection by the team management that saw them fail to qualify for a place in the knockout stage (quarterfinals) and end up as Plate winners in ninth place.
The team was oozing with talent and if handled properly could have even made it to the final  a feat Sri Lanka has achieved only once in 2000 when they hosted the tournament. Even in the under 19 Asia Cup, Sri Lanka has come only as far the final once again when they were the hosts in 2016.
SLC are in the process of finding a successor to Roy Dias who has handled the under 19 team since May 2016. What the SLC should look for is a coach who is familiar with the current trend of international cricket and is well versed in all three formats  Tests, ODIs and T20Is. You dont need a coach who frowns when a batsman plays a reverse sweep, a switch hit, a Dilscoop or hits the first ball he receives for a six.
The game has changed so much in the past three decades that the coach has to let the natural talent and flair flourish instead of trying to curb it. It would not be a bad idea even for the under 19 team to be handled by a foreign coach because with them there are no strings attached when it comes to training, selections etc. They have a reputation to safeguard and will not compromise in anyway, which means that the team will benefit the most. Isnt that what we are all looking for

Foreign remittances, pensioners exempted from tax
Foreign remittances of persons working abroad are not taxable. Only those who earn above a certain amount will be taxed, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament yesterday.
Upto Rs 15 million from services rendered to persons outside Sri Lanka is tax exempted. Further, pensioners have been totally exempted from taxes, but if their interest is over Rs. 1.5 million per year (over Rs. 125,000 per month) it will be subject to a withholding tax.
If a pensioner is to gain an income of Rs. 1.5 million per year, he should have an investment of Rs.20 million. Hence, this tax will not affect 95% of the pensioners, Samaraweera said.
He said during the past few days many distorted and incorrect news was disseminated by the media and some MPs with regard to the Inland Revenue Act. The Minister yesterday presented ten gazettes under the Commodity Levy Act for house approval.
The minister noted that last year on October 24, the government had the new Inland Revenue Act passed in parliament and based on a proposal made in the house, the implementation of the new taxation was postponed by a year and came into effect from April 1, 2018.
The current direct and indirect tax disparity is absolutely unfavourable. Today direct taxes are paid by a fraction of the population at 18%.
This can be considered the lowest in the world. In Malaysia, 72% of taxes are charged through direct taxes and in India its 57%, Bangladesh 33%, but we in Sri Lanka is still at 18%. However, 88% of the taxes are charged through indirect taxes.
The problem with indirect taxes is that even the millionaire pays the same taxes as the poor man in terms of purchasing essential commodities. I do agree that the VAT is too high and it needs to be reduced. In order to reduce that we should reduce the tax disparity to at least 40% to 60%. Then accordingly we can gradually reduce VAT and other taxes providing relief to the people, Minister Samaraweera said.
This is why the brought in this new Revenue Act to introduce a simpler taxation structure, he said.Under this new system, he explained that those who earn Rs. 1.2 million or lesser per year (Rs. 100,000 or lesser per month) will not be taxed. Similarly they have made the taxation system simpler preventing politicians from granting tax relief to their relatives and friends as they please to suit their whims and fancy.
We have taken away the power to decide on the tax from the minister and incorporated it into an Act in a methodical manner. However, many have expressed warped and false claims regarding the taxation system.
Rumours are spread that capital gains tax is at 10% on the sale price, but this is not true. This tax is applicable on the gain derived from the sale of an extra land or house and the sale price is seen as a cost, he said.
He also refuted claims that the sale of a vehicle subject to capital gains tax, adding that this is again an absolute lie and capital gains tax is applicable only on the sale of lands, buildings and securities.
The governments tax policies have focussed on some key principals and objectives, increasing the share of government revenue which had declined to 11.6% of GDP by 2014. This would enable us to better meet our debt repayments without compromising government expenditure on health and education.
The changes are aimed to achieve revenue increase by increasing the share of direct taxes from 18 to 40% and create a more progressive tax structure, broaden the tax base to bring in the informal economy into the formal sector.
This will create a level playing field by ensuring that everyone complies and shares the burden of taxes, reduce discretion in tax policy and shift to a simple transparent rules based structure and in future the minister would not be able to change the rules and regulations according to the whims and fancies of those in power, Samaraweera noted, adding that this was required to minimise potential corruption and reduce tax leakages due to ad-hoc tax exemptions.

Lower Malwathu Oya Project:
Headwork construction to be launched mid-2019
The construction of the headwork for the the proposed Lower Malwathu Oya Project, had been planned to be commissioned in mid-2019. This was disclosed at the Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir Project progress review committee meeting that was recently held at the Anuradhapura Kachcheri Auditorium with the participation of Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake.
Senior officers representing the government and irrigation, survey, wildlife, forest conservation, archaeology and assessor departments, were present at the meeting.
It was disclosed that around 40,000 acres of land in both the Mannar and Anuradhapura districts, would be provided with adequate irrigation water throughout the year, once the proposed reservoir has been completed by 2021.Project Director Engineer T. P. Alwis said that currently, surveying of the demarcation of high flood-level areas had been completed and the surveying of the estimated 4,000 hectares of land that would be submerged due to the proposed reservoir, was scheduled to be carried out in May. Subsequently, a socio-economic survey in relation to resettlement would be carried out as well.
"The Malwathu Oya basin of which the capacity is 3,246 square-kilometres, is the second largest river basin in the country. The reservoir was built having constructed a 3.6-km long main dam across the Mahaweli river at the Bogoda village in the Thanthirimale area. Around 35,000 acres of existing paddy lands will receive sufficient water for cultivation activities related to both the Yala and Maha Seasons," Alwis said.
"The two sluices of the proposed reservoir would permit a continuous flow of 35 cubic-feet of water per second and of that, a volume of 18 cubic-feet of water would be supplied to the Malwathu Oya. The maximum height of the main dam is 72.9 feet, whereas the water capacity is 169,000 acre-feet. The estimated cost for the completion of the project is Rs. 12.5 billion," Alwis added.
Project Land Officer M. A. M. Wimal said that already, a landscape spanning 528 acres had been identified for the resettlement of families being evacuated, while lands spanning to a total of 1,200 acres in the Sooriya Thenna and Handapangoda divisions, had been selected as alternative paddy lands.
Hence, the Wildlife and the Forest Conservation Departments had been requested to release the said lands. The land officer said President Maithripala Sirisena had given instructions to finalise the resettlement arrangements, with housing and relevant infrastructural facilities provided before the construction work of the reservoir project commences. Meanwhile, wildlife authorities said at the committee meeting, that since new settlement colonies are currently emerging near the Wilpattu area, it was likely that elephant corridors would be affected as wild elephants frequent the areas between Mahakanadarawa and the Wilpattu National Park.
It was revealed that there were 36 monuments of archaeological and historic value within the project site and that the moveable monuments would be handed over to museums within the Thanthirimale area.
It was also learnt that there is a current lack of funds to complete the prerequisites of the project and hence, additional funds had been requested. So far, only Rs. 50 million had been allocated for the ongoing work. In addition, investigations are currently underway to scrutinise whether any portion of the proposed landscapes selected for resettlement, would fall under the category of High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs).

How Kandyan dancing began
In Kandyan dancing Vannam forms as a specialfeature. In Tamil and Telegu Vannam means adescription. When the dancer performs he recites the Vannama and according to the description when he has recited and begins to dance displaying a Tandava style of dancing. The dancing is done in a rigorous way while describing the movement of the cobra (Naiyandi), elephant (Gajaga), peacock (Monera), eagle (Ukussa) showing the onlookers a description of the animal. In the course of the recitation, adoration to the Buddha and the great qualities he had possessed is highlighted.
Kandyan dancing is popularly known as Udarata Natum derived its name from the traditional dance forms peculiar to the central region of Sri Lanka. The origin of Kandyan dancing can be traced back to the time of the Nayakkar rulers who ascended the throne of the Kandyan Kingdom 300 years ago.
The books written on this form of dancing namely Nrutiya Upata, Bere Daul Upata and Saranga Male do not refer to the existence of books on Kandyan dancing. But with the coming of the Nayakkar rulers, it was made possible for the dancers, musicians and craftsmen to make their presence in the Kandyan kingdom which resulted in the creations and innovations in the field of arts and crafts. Dancing then became a regular feature in the royal court. The dancers and singers sang Prasasti or eulogies extolling the kings virtues. At times kings were compared to Ananga when the verses were sung and dancers then performed to the rhythmic beat of the drums before the king and his courtiers.
Rhythmic watch
The popular drum  Geta bere became the accompaniment to singing and dancing. Verses were sung to keep pace with the rhythmic movements of hands and legs when they moved in keeping with the beat of the drums. The Tandava form of dancing which is essentially masculine became popular making Kandyan dancing more rhythmic and pleasing to watch. It also created the correct tempo for singing and dancing. The dancers were able to move to and fro in keeping with the drumming.
In viharas too during Tevava time drumming became a vital part of pooja when homage was made to the image of the Buddha. Talam pota and Pantheru that accompanied provided perfect timing to singing and dancing. In rituals like Bali and Thovil drumming formed an integral part of reciting verses when appeals were made to deities or devils In the text Nrutiya Upata mode of dancing not mentioned. It is said that Maha Ishvara and other deities had helped to foster the art of dancing.
However, the books give the history of dancing but it cannot be accepted as a form of systematic study on Kandyan dancing. The information given in verse is in the form of questions and answers and the failure to answer was subject to taboos like the disability to move the dancers limbs and also the difficulty in playing musical instruments.
According to the description given in the books Ishvara, Mahesvara with his left-hand holds the conch and play fivefold musical notes and with his right hand he claps several pada and commences his dancing. However, there are contradictory descriptions about the manner in which Ishvara does his performance.
Drumbeat
He dances to the beat of the drums but there is no instruction to the beat of the drum. The beat of the drum begins with Tak Dik Tonnan and goes to the second beat Tatadik Tonnan and to the final Urataka Jagadam Tadarika Kadiri Tol. The beat of the drum is similar to a mantaram. The sound of the drum takes one to a state of a spell. The drummer begins his performance with the recitation of the tala and then plays the drum. This is done the manner of Taraga poya hewisi. Horaneva is an accompaniment with its notes keeping to the drumbeat making the onlookers enthralled with the performance.
Tamattama is another form of a drum with two small drums tied to the waist of the drummer. When it is played with sticks (circular at the ends) on the face of the drums to the accompaniment of the horaneva can make the performance exciting. In Naiyandi and ves the playing of Udekki and Pantheru can be added to provide as an accompaniment. To the drummer has to play his bera pada and make the dancer perform Adam Sandam - Tanam Matra Tit and also Kastiram to keep up with the steps.
The teachers of drumming have to depend on the tradition when teaching their pupils. In the text Bera Daul Upata, the bere was said to have been created by Brahma, Maheshvara Bhadrakali, Maha Kalanaga, Mahapadmanaga and goddesses Tara and Pattini.
Thovil rituals
In Bali and Pideni rituals when offerings are made the drummers change the beat of the drums to suit the different rituals. In the recitation connected with Bali and Thovil rituals, names of Hindu deities are mentioned. The folk dramas like Kinduru Natuma and Sokari Natuma have originated in the Kandyan areas. These two folk plays possess the elements of a dance drama. In the Sokari Natuma, the influence of South Indian folk drama can be seen.
The dialogues in these two folk plays are interspersed with song and dance. They appeal to the popular taste of the ordinary people who enjoy them especially during the time of the Sinhala Avurudda. The dialogues are always improvised and lack refinement. At times jokes and poking fun by the participants are seen bordering into vulgarity. The theme of these folk plays is to appease goddess Pattini and the worship fertility cult.
In Kandyan dancing Vannam forms as a special feature. In Tamil and Telegu Vannam means a description. When the dancer performs he recites the Vannama and according to the description when he has recited and begins to dance displaying a Tandava style of dancing.
The dancing is done in a rigorous way while describing the movement of the cobra (Naiyandi), elephant (Gajaga), peacock (Monera), eagle (Ukussa) showing the onlookers a description of the animal. In the course of the recitation, adoration to the Buddha and the great qualities he had possessed is highlighted.
There is evidence to show the influence of Gita Govinda based on the Krishna legend which was translated from Sanskrit into Tamil and later rendered into Sinhala poetry during the reign of King Narendrasinha when dancing became a popular form of entertainment in the royal court. In the present context, it is necessary that Vannams should be adapted and innovated to suit the modern stage. ln this exercise Mudras (gestures) should be incorporated to enhance the beauty of our dancing. Tandava aspect of Kandyan dancing should not be taught to girls because of its masculine nature. Instead, they should be taught Lassiya form of dancing as in Manipuri which is more graceful and rhythmic in movement of the body and in its presentation.

Judicature act Amendments need two thirds - SC
The Supreme Court (SC) has determined that three Sections of Judicature (Amendment) Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution and need to be passed by a two thirds majority in Parliament.
The Government presented the Bill on March 6 to set up a permanent High Court-at-Bar to expedite cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced to the House yesterday that the SC has determined that Sections 12 A (1), 12 A (2) and 12 A (7) are inconsistent with the Constitution.
Section 12 A (1) of the Bill deals with the setting up of the Permanent High Court-at-Bar, and the nature of cases to be taken up in it.
The SC has ruled that an amendment is required to be made to the Constitution to give effect to that Section.This requires the bill to be passed by a two thirds majority. However, if the jurisdiction is conferred on a the High Court of Provinces under Article 154 P(3) (a) like in Act No 10 of 1996 and Act No 54 of 2006 this amending section will cease to be inconsistent the SC ruling stated.
Section 12 A (2) states, the Permanent High Court at Bar shall consist of three Judges sitting together, nominated by the Judicial Service Commission from among the High Court Judges of which one Judge shall be nominated by the Judicial Service Commission as the Chairman.
The SC has ruled that the Judicial Service Commission nominating judges to the Permanent High Court-at-Bar is inconsistent with the article 154 P (2) of the Constitution.An amendment is required to be made to the Constitution to give effect to the Section 12 A (2) of the Bill which requires a two-thirds majority. However, if 12 A (2) of the Bill is removed and Article 154 P (2) remains as it is, this inconsistency will cease, the determination said.
Section 12 A (7) allows the Attorney General or the Director General for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption to refer the cases to the Permanent High Court at Bar.
The SC has determined that Section 12 A (7) is inconsistent with Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.
However, if the Chief Justice is given the power to decide whether to hold a trial at Bar or not this amending section will cease to be inconsistent, it has ruled.
The Bill is scheduled for debate on Thursday.

JVP requests for report whether Buddhist  philosophy has any connections with soothsaying
The JVP yesterday, requested the Buddhasasana Ministry to submit a report to Parliament, stating whether the Buddhist philosophy had anything to do with soothsaying and other mythical concepts as some engaged in those practices often imply, MP Bimal Rathnayake said.
Today, some people claim that they are involved in soothsaying activities with the blessings of Buddhism. Some people even promise to help infertile women to have children and also help students pass various examinations with the blessings of Buddhism. There are plenty of such stories, Rathnayake said.
The JVP MP said true Buddhist philosophy of Lord Buddha has been distorted to a great extent by those involved in such mythical practices.
I have studied Buddhism in school. As we are aware, The Buddha had never preached such things. Therefore, I request the Buddhasasana Minister to appoint a committee compromising of intellectuals on Buddhist philosophy and prepare a report on the matter and tell us if there was any relations between these activities and Buddhism, he requested. As Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawichrema Perera was not present, the Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said that he would direct Rathnayakes request to the minister.

Lanka targets self-sufficiency  in pharmaceuticals
Efforts to increase domestic and foreign investment in Sri Lankas pharmaceuticals industry is set to boost output and broaden the sectors product range, bringing the country closer to the governments goal of self-sufficiency in medical production.
In early January the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) announced it was joining forces with Malaysian investment firm Pharma Zone to develop a dedicated industrial centre for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals products.
This was reviled in the Sri Lanka economic update produced by Oxford Business Group (OBG)
Pharma Zone, a partnership of the Sultan of Johor and Malaysian property development company Equine Capital, will provide $10m for the construction of infrastructure necessary for pharmaceuticals production.
To attract investment to the 50-ha site, to be located in the Kalutara district, south of the commercial capital, Colombo, the state has offered a 15-year buyback guarantee to purchase pharmaceuticals from manufacturers operating within the zone at 20% above unit cost.
Lohitha Samarawickrema, the president of the National Chamber of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Sri Lanka (NCPM), told local media in January that at least 17 local producers had signed memorandum of understanding with the SPMC to establish manufacturing facilities within the zone, with each committing a minimum of US$ 4 mn to secure blocks of 2-4 haur development.
The initial facilities in the zone are scheduled to come into operation in the first half of 2019, and by 2020 total output is expected to meet around 60% of domestic requirements, according to the NCPM. At present, locally manufactured pharmaceuticals account for just 12% of the market.
The increase in local production is expected to significantly reduce the sectors annual import bill, which currently stands at US$ 400 million to 500 million. The strategy is also being supported by other investments in the sector. In early February the government signed an agreement to construct a new Rs 1.4 bn ($9m) facility for the production of cancer-treating drugs using nanotechnology. The plant, to be located in Payagalas Malegoda district, is a joint venture between the SPMC and two Indian pharma companies, and aims to bring down the cost of cancer drugs, most of which are currently imported at prices of around Rs. 150,000 (US$960) per item.

A long overdue remedy
The Maha Sangha hierarchy, led by the Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates, have called on President Maithripala Sirisena to take measures to expel from the Sasana persons with criminal backgrounds who function under the guise of Buddhist monks, according to a report in an English daily yesterday. The Mahanayakes, in a letter to the President, has brought to his notice that persons with court warrants issued against them seek refuge in the robe and a proper identity card should be issued to all monks as a preliminary measure (to identify the criminal elements).
Perhaps, the chief prelates would have been prompted by the growing trend of persons in robes being arrested over various acts of lawlessness. Buddhist monks, or those disguised as members of the Sangha, were also seen prominently on television footage capturing the recent incidents in Kandy, conducting themselves in a manner unbecoming of the saffron robe, though it must be added that many members of Buddhist clergy rushed to the protection of the victims at risk to themselves. This is why it is important that all members of the Sangha be issued with ID cards. The Police could then expose the pretenders and remedy the damage caused to the religion by the actions of a few.
It is a well known fact that even in the past those bent on mischief masqueraded as Buddhist monks. They even went to great lengths shaving their locks and making the necessary changes to their facial appearances to make them look the genuine article, all the time harbouring evil intent in their hearts. This phenomenon was mostly seen in the two bloody uprisings of the JVP in 1971 and the late eighties and especially at the time the Indo-Lanka Accord was signed where those disguised as monks went on the rampage causing mayhem and destruction.
There is good reason for this. The Law enforcement would naturally be reticent to mete out harsh treatment to members of Sangha, whom they identify by their outward appearance. They are also placed strategically in the vanguard of the protests and agitations by the masterminds of anarchy and more often used as a cushion for the latter to let loose their mayhem behind the lines, while the police negotiate with the so called Buddhist monks. This was seen even during the recent anti-SAITM campaign where monks, or, those masquerading as members of the Sangha, played a prominent part.
Like the prelates contend, there is very good reason to suspect that criminal elements are increasingly seeking cover under the robe to commit acts of felony and thus desecrating the religion. It is obvious that not all the monks we see in the middle of protests are really monks but hired hands or even undesirable elements made to don the saffron robe by the organisers to give legitimacy to such protests.
The identity cards, as a means of identifying the true members of the Sangha, as suggested by the prelates, would help the police sift the chaff from the grain and expose the charlatans bent on mischief. This would also minimize the prevailing trend to enlist Buddhist monks in all forms of protests, who in most instances act violently, which to say the least, is unbecoming conduct for those entrusted with disseminating a religion which has at its core teaching the virtue of compassion and serene living.
True, the members of the Sangha are well within their rights, or, even bound by obligation to stand up against injustice, oppressive, or, anti-social policies of the government in power. Nobody will fault them for leading protest campaigns against the opening of meat stalls or liquor shops close to temples or schools. But a line has to be drawn at a certain point so that they don't overstep their bounds and be drawn into what are seen as political projects, or allow themselves to be exploited by crafty politicians. Regrettable though, this is more the case than the exception today. Leading Buddhist priests are not only seen spewing venom to the extent of inciting communal passions, on political platforms, but are also lending their temple abodes to be used for political work. While the Maha Sangha's determination to identify the rogue elements in the Sasana should be commended this aspect of some of the genuine Buddhist clergy too should engage their attention. There are plenty of monks going around today causing much damage to a pristine and noble religion. Monks misbehaving in the courts and running amok breaking into government ministries and threatening officials, is indeed a novel phenomenon to all Sri Lankans. Most Buddhists also look down on the practice of members of the Sangha holding political office, quite at variance with a life frugality that was enunciated by the Noble One to all members of the Sangha.
Today it needs not be stressed that the respect and regard for the saffron robe among the Buddhist public has taken a heavy beating, due to the unbecoming conduct of a few. While the Mahanayakes objective of identifying the bad eggs is praiseworthy, discipline within the Sangha Order too is an aspect they should address in all earnestness.

Journalist Keith Noyahr abduction, assault case:
Maj. Gen. Karunasekara barred from foreign travels
Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama cancelled the permission granted to the former Army Chief of Staff and Commandant of the Defence Services Command and Staff College Major General, Amal Karunasekara, to travel to India, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) told the Daily News.
The CID had informed court that Karunasekara could be named as a suspect in the abduction and assault of journalist Keith Noyahr and the Court had ordered his foreign travel be suspended.
While court had banned him from overseas travel, he was appointed to the post of the Commandant of the Defence Services Command and Staff College, and he was scheduled to attend a tour of the College in India from April 1 to 7.
Major General Amal Karunasekara, meanwhile, had made an application to court to lift his travel ban, which was granted.
CID sources conducting the investigation told Daily News that a motion was filed by the CID on April 1 seeking a court order to re-impose the travel ban order.
The CID had informed court that they had discussed the matter with the Defence Secretary. He had told the CID that he was unaware that a travel ban had been imposed on the Major General. He had told the CID that he had not nominated Major General Amal Karunasekara for the tour, and that it had been done by the Army.
The case was called again yesterday (2), and the Army notified court that the foreign travel accorded to Major General Amal Karunasekara had been cancelled. Court cancelled the permission previously granted to him and reimposed his travel ban.
The CID said that the court had ordered Major General Amal Karunasekara to give a statement to the CID on April 5.

Around 1,500 midwives (family health workers) serving in the country need motorcycles and arrangements will be made soon to provide them motorcycles, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, approval has already been given to change the official uniform of the midwives, considering the fact that they travel by riding motorcycles. I like the current uniform but it is difficult for them to work wearing it, said Minister Senaratne while addressing the gathering during an awareness raising programme held for the midwives of Kalutara district.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that he ordered health officials to formulate a report on the requirement of the motorcycles for the midwives. Sometimes the decisions made by the Health Ministry get delayed or do not get implemented at all. Therefore, it is the duty of the health trade unions to monitor the progress on the implementation of such decisions, the Minister said.
It is midwives who pushed Sri Lankas health indicators up. I do not know whether health officials understand the standard of Sri Lankas health service. But the world health authorities such as WHO recognize Sri Lankas health service as one of the best in the world and a role model, he added.

A mothers quest to stop corporal punishment
Dr. Tush Wickramanayaka is a family physician, licensed in both Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom, with a long history of helping children in their time of need. Part of her job description, quite literally, is to identify what pains a child and do what she can to fix it. But lately, Wickramanayaka has been using not just medicine but advocacy and activism to try and achieve that goal.
In early March, on International Womens Day, Wickramanayaka launched Stop Child Cruelty, a new organisation aimed at ending corporal punishment of children in schools and beyond. Corporal punishment is defined by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child as any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light.
For Wickramanayaka, the issue is personal. She says that in January of this year, her 11-year-old daughter was abused at her school in Colombo, forced to kneel before a teacher as a form of punishment. Wickramanayaka insists this incident was not the first and that the severity of the incidents varies.
But the problem of corporal punishment of children in schools is not hers or her daughters alone. According to National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Chairperson Marini De Livera, the number of official complaints her agency received regarding cruelty faced by children in schools for 2017 was 1,191.
Even these numbers, however, indicate that corporal punishment in Sri Lanka goes vastly under-reported. In May 2017, the NCPA released a report it commissioned, A Study on Child Disciplinary Methods Practised in Schools in Sri Lanka, which found levels of corporal punishment among schoolchildren - that is, the rate of students who reported experiencing at least one episode of corporal punishment in the past term - to be a staggering 80.4 percent.
Technically illegal
Currently, says Wickramanayaka, there is in place a three-tier protection system against corporal punishment of children in schools in Sri Lanka.
The first tier is Penal Code 308/A, which provides for the offense of various forms of cruelty against children. The second tier is Article 11 of the Constitution, which lists as a fundamental right that No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The third and final tier is the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which Sri Lanka became a party to in 1990 and which declares that corporal punishment and other cruel or degrading forms of punishment are forms of violence and States must take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to eliminate them.
Additionally, the Ministry of Education has issued circulars stating that corporal punishment not be used in schools, though this policy as an absolute was never confirmed by a vote in Parliament.
But Wickramanayaka believes that the mere status of corporal punishment of children as unlawful does little to deter those in schools who might commit it. And the rate of corporal punishment in schools found in the NCPA report indicates she is correct.
Yes, this type of punishment has been outlawed. But many educators commit it or accept that it will be committed because its what they were subjected to themselves as children, she says.
Repeatedly stonewalled
According to Wickramanayaka, the problem is not a lack of fairly adequate laws governing corporal punishment of schoolchildren; the problem is that existing laws are not enforced, either at all or to the degree they should be.
Even though there are laws in this country, we find it very difficult to implement them because of objections from political or financial or other external pressures to shut investigations down, she says.
She adds that she faced many barriers when reporting the January incident involving her daughter.
The first barrier for Wickramanayaka was when she went to the women and childrens division at the police station to report the incident. The officer assigned to speak with her told her in Sinhala that a small punishment is acceptable for children and reclassified her case as a minor incident.
With the police, many of whom grew up with corporal punishment as the norm, they see it as an acceptable mode of discipline rather than an unacceptable form of abuse, she says.
Then she reported the incident to the NCPA, which is duty-bound to accept every complaint. But she insists that just as she filed the report, external pressure to stop the investigation began to pile on. She says her child faces discrimination at the school, which denied the incident took place, and that she herself was blacklisted as a parent.
Wickramanayaka emphasises that she believes the NCPA has good intentions and wants to help, especially Chairperson De Livera. Indeed, as recently as February, the NCPA released a statement to the press stating that it had initiated a programme to eliminate corporal punishment meted out to children in all settings.
But Wickramanayaka insists there are political pressures exerted on the NCPA that prevent it from doing its job to the best of its ability.
Finally, Wickramanayaka tried filing a report on her daughters behalf with the Human Rights Commission, only to have confidential details of her case, after one month of receiving no response, allegedly divulged to the very teacher she claims is responsible for the abuse. Wickramanayaka subsequently met with varying politicians, including the President, but feels that none of them were concerned enough to do anything.
A cultural rather than legislative change is necessary
Multiple studies have demonstrated the problems with corporal punishment. The American Academy of Paediatrics says it is ineffective at best and harmful at worst. Canadian researchers found that it can cause long-term damage in children, concluding that they are more likely to be depressed, aggressive, antisocial, and anxious. In Sri Lanka, research has indicated that it also correlates with lowered self-esteem and academic performance and a greater tendency toward violence in the future.
So why does it continue to be used as a method to discipline and punish
Both Wickramanayaka and the NCPA believe the problem, primarily, is cultural, that there are misconceptions across the spectrum - from the teachers allegedly committing this abuse to the police officers who receive complaints and are charged with investigating the apparent incidents. To fix it and end child cruelty, as Wickramanayakas organisations title dictates as her campaign rallying cry, requires not just changing the laws, but changing peoples mindsets about what is and is not acceptable.
As part of its new aforementioned programme to eliminate corporal punishment of children, initiated in February, the NCPA has multiple aims. First, it hopes to sensitise principals and teachers on the laws surrounding the right of children to protection from corporal punishment. Second, it hopes to use awareness-raising methods such as street-drama, interactive workshops, and discussions to alert the public on the problems with such punishment. Finally, it seeks to encourage the general public to alert the NCPA to incidents through its 24-hour child hotline (#1929).
Wickramanayaka, along with her newly founded organisation, has a wider scope which she hopes her advocacy will impact. In addition to ensuring teachers and school administrators understand the illegality of corporal punishment, she wants to prevent police officers from allowing personal biases about what is and isnt abuse to colour how they investigate a case.
She wants to eliminate political and monetary pressures that prevent investigations from being carried out adequately. Finally, Wickramanayaka, through Stop Child Cruelty, seeks to empower children and their parents to seek justice, especially those who may not have the luxury she did, of spare time and energy, to report her case and appeal to multiple different bodies.
Wed like parents to know, as citizens, what the common law is and to be able to speak up. We will be a voice for them. The more we speak up, the more we begin to say this is wrong, the more they will hear us.

Mushroom coffee is the new caffeine fad
Listen up, coffee aficionados, add a new caffeine fad to that long list of already existent varieties of coffee and let us all call it the mushroom one.
Mushrooms that have been used medicinally for centuries are one quirky ingredient for coffee.
Apparently, the brand leading the charge is Four Sigmatic. Company's founder, Tero Isokauppila explains health benefits of variety of mushrooms. He dwelled on the kinds like reishi, a mushroom he says will keep your skin healthy, chaga, which he says is rich in antioxidants, cordyceps, which he says enhances performance, reported the Washington Post.
Not restricted to coffee alone, mushrooms are found in other beverages like shakes and tea as well.
For instance, wellness cafe in Los Angeles, such as Lifehouse Tonics lets you order a "shroom shake" or a lemon juice tea with mushrooms in it, the report said.
The mushroom coffee is purportedly an anti-inflammatory, and is supposed to regulate blood sugar levels and boost metabolism.
However, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Mascha Davis, said, "There is some research showing some beneficial utilities in some mushrooms, but I think some of these companies that want to sell them overstate the benefits."

NCM will be defeated -Minister Ranawaka
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday that they would vote against the No Confidence Motion (NCM) brought against the Premier.
The Minister said so after a press conference on the Suryabhishekaya mega spring festival and trade fair, organised to celebrate the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
The main allegation brought against the Premier in the NCM was the Central Bank bond issue. However, the culprits were caught and necessary actions were taken against the accused. So there is no reason to support the NCM, said the Minister. Shedding light on the meeting between the President and a group of UNP Parliamentarians on Monday, the Minister said the President had stated that he is capable of running the country with any government with his powers as Executive President.
However, the Minister was critical of the government for covering up the frauds of the previous regime.
The government did not take necessary action against the former President and covered it all up, the Minister alleged. The recent elections showed us that the government did not rise to the peoples expectations and more was needed.
It is clear that we need a radical change to the policies along with a new youth leadership with skills and talents.
The leaders should be reminded constantly that they represent the expectations of the people, said the Minister.

No-Confidence motion on Prime Minister: Vote to be taken up in Parliament at 9 pm today
The Vote of No-Confidence on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, is to be taken up at 9 pm in Parliament today, following a full-day debate.
The No-Confidence Motion was submitted to the Speaker by the Joint Opposition on March 21, carrying the signatures of 55 MPs including four SLFP members from Government ranks.
Parliament will meet at 9.30 am today and the debate on the NCM would commence at 10 am after the oral question round. The debate is expected to continue till 9 pm, while the vote would be taken up by name or by row. A series of eleventh-hour meetings took place at Parliament and outside it yesterday, to decide on the vote of NCM. With less than 24 hours for the decisive vote on the NCM, the UNF was confident of a sure defeat, while the JO pledged to win the motion with the support of the SLFP members in Government ranks. JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has also stated that they would vote in favour of the motion. JVP has six seats in Parliament.
TNA members could not reach a final decision on the NCM yesterday, even after having two group meetings, one in the morning and another in the evening at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday. The TNA would meet again at 10 am today, to come to a final decision. According to Parliamentary sources, some TNA MPs have proposed that the TNA should not take part in the NCM debate. Opposition Leader and TNA Leader R Sampanthan also met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday afternoon.
The TNA has 16 MPs in the current Parliament, while UNF has 106 seats and UPFA has 96 seats. Out of the 96 MPs in the UPFA, 54 MPs are in the Opposition. The 106 seats in the UNF bloc includes 7 Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) members led by Minister Rauf Hakeem, 5 All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) members led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, and another six members representing the parties of Mano Ganesan, V S Radhakrishnan and P Digambaram.
UNF National List MP Ven Athuraliye Rathana Thera and UPFA MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera acts as independent MPs in Parliament. Former Minister Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshe is still a member of the UNF.
The party leaders of the UNF, who met at the Parliament complex yesterday, reinforced their position to vote against the motion. The SLFP members in the Government ranks were inclined towards voting in favour of the motion as at yesterday evening. However, there was a strong possibility of cross voting due to dissenting views within the parties.
Parliament officials said the Public and Speakers galleries would be open only to selected invitees during the debate. This is the 47th NCM and the third against a Prime Minister in Sri Lanka's Parliament history.
Previously, two NCMs had been submitted and taken for vote against former PMs late SWRD Bandaranaike in 1957 and Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1975.
No Confidence Motion: A mad joke says, State Minister Harsha de Silva
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva yesterday, dressed down certain ministers who were allegedly in support of the No Confidence Motion presented to Parliament by the Joint Opposition. Referring to the NCM as a mad joke, Dr. de Silva pointed out that if someone is not confident in ones self, that person should step down from his or her post.
If I was not sure of myself, I would have stepped down from my post! There is no issue there. Why would I ask someone else to bring in a no confidence motion against me This is madness! We recently found out that there are such jokers with us, an amused de Silva said.
Dr. de Silva also said that in recorded history of the world, no sitting government had so far brought in a no confidence motion against itself. There is no problem in the Joint Opposition bringing in a no confidence motion against the government. That is perfectly understandable. The problem is with the persons who hold ministerial portfolios going around saying that we are not confident about our own government, so we are voting against it. My God, I dont think this has happened anywhere in the world! he said.
Dr. de Silva said that he was hundred percent sure that the government would defeat the no confidence motion on Wednesday.
He also said that they would present the restructuring proposals for the UNP by next Sunday.
"Our political party is a democratic one," he said. "It is not like your political party. Yours have a father, sons, uncles and brothers all in it. Ours is not like that. We have a democratic structure in our party. So we can make such proposals freely. Our leader have allowed us that," he added.
National Audit Bill presented to Parliament for First Reading
The National Audit Bill was presented to Parliament yesterday for First Reading.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the Bill on behalf of the Prime Minister.
The Bill was published in the Gazette on March 16. The Bill provides for the powers, duties and functions of the Audit Service Commission. It also provides for the establishment of the office of the National Audit Office and the Sri Lanka State Audit Service. It specifies the role of the Auditor General over public finance.
The Bill was Gazetted incorporating the amendments proposed by the Cabinet Sub-Committee headed by Minister Dr Sarath Amunugama. As per the Gazetted Bill, the powers of surcharge have been vested under the Chief Accounting Officers (Ministry Secretaries and Department Heads).
The CAOs impose the surcharge against any person who is responsible for the deficiency or loss, either jointly or severally, followed by a formal disciplinary action by the Disciplinary Authority or a judicial process.
The Audit Service Commission shall report the amount of any deficiency or loss in any transaction of an auditee entity if it had been made contrary to any written law and has caused any deficiency or loss due to fraud, negligence, misappropriation or corruption of those involved, the Bill stated.
A Surcharge Appeal Committee comprising of five members would be appointed by the Constitutional Council to hear and determine appeals by any person against whom a surcharge had been imposed. The Bill states the Auditor General should not be a member of the Committee.
The JVP and several organizations, including Transparency International Sri Lanka, have already raised concerns over dilution of the Bill, especially with regard to the surcharge provisions.
The National Audit Bill was a key pre-election pledge of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena that was also included in the 100-day work programme of the Government. The final draft of the Bill was revised over 23 times, mainly due to contention over its surcharge provision.
State Minister of Finance Wickramaratne on pension taxes
If a person has worked for less than 20 years, there is no tax up to 2 million for a commuted pension. If it increases from Rs. 2 million to Rs. 3 million, then there would be a 5% income tax that would be charged. Anything beyond that would be subjected to a 10% tax.
If a person has worked for over 20 years, then there would be no tax imposed for up to Rs. 50 million and it would be completely tax free, said State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne.
He said this in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, with regard to the commuted pension under the Inland Revenue Act.
Meanwhile, MP Wimal Weerawansa, raised a question as to whether through this taxation, it would deter people from depositing their money in banks and also whether it would make people resort to other ways to hide their money.
In response, Minister Wickramaratne said people who have excess money may resort to devious ways to escape having to pay any type of taxes, but he said that due to interest rates, they would tend to invest. Only a small percentage is taxed. I dont see this as a big issue.
He noted that the governments budget deficit target was 3.5 percent, but it had shot the mark by .5% due to inclement weather related issues. However, he said that currently, the government had managed to get the economy back on track, while ratings have indicated that in certain areas where we were negative, we have succeeded in making it stable in the ratings.
With regard to the countrys foreign reserves, he said in 2017, it had grown by $ 2 billion. Export has also increased by 10% especially in the fisheries sector, due to the regaining of the GSP concession. He said direct foreign investment which was around $ 800 million, had increased two folds during 2017, making it the year with the highest foreign investment. The minister said the government hopes to increase it further in 2018.
Wickramaratne noted that according to the Central Bank report, inflation had shown signs of reduction. The Central Bank report suggests a trend of reducing commodity prices, he said.
The minister said that the government had systematically spent the countrys taxes on education and health primarily.
For education and skills development in 2014, the government had spent 1.9% of the GDP. He said as a country with a smaller population, priority should be given to education. We intend to increase the allocation for education, higher education and skills development to 3% of the GDP by 2020.
In terms of health, the government intends to increase allocations up to around 2% of the GDP, Minister Wickramaratne added.

Rendezvous in colour
Royden O. Gibbs, a gifted artist, has marvellously captured many historical places of Sri Lanka through his art. As an individual interested in history, architecture and humanity he gives us a glimpse of past glories, some of which unfortunately have disappeared over time. He has an impressive collection of paintings of lighthouses from all across Sri Lanka. He was also the first artist to travel to the northeast during the war, to capture unique perspectives even during such turbulent times. An unassuming individual who makes friends wherever he goes, he is invariably mistaken for a tourist when he travels across the country.
Gibbs has been passing on his passion for art to many students throughout the years. He is helping his current students organize an exhibition of their paintings which will be held at the Alliance Francaise, opening on April 5 at 6 pm. The exhibition will be open to the public from April 6 to 9 from 9 am to 6 pm.
Below are some of the students in their own words;
I am told that I had a love for art in my early school years. In my long corporate career, although I couldnt find time for art, I kept up the interest as I had the opportunity to visit many art galleries around the world. About 5 years ago I was told that art would help alleviate my stressful lifestyle. After some guidance from the great Royden Gibbs, I finally started painting. Did it help with my stress Yes, it did. Now that Im retired I hope to spend a little more time in this pursuit. However, I guess Ill continue to be a dilettante as far as art goes! Lets see where this takes me. - Lal Chandranath
Coming from a family of artists who dabbled in art at different points in their lives, it was very much instilled in me that I could draw. My uncle, the late Asoka A. Gunawardhana, was my first teacher. Since then I have studied under many great teachers, but never had enough time to settle down to finish a collection of paintings worth exhibiting, until I met my excellent teacher Royden Gibbs. Watercolour is a wonderful medium and I am thoroughly enjoying myself. I am happy and proud to be part of this team displaying our wonderful skill for all to see. - Veeranthi Wijemanne
The distinctive ability acquired throughout my career as an architect, to feel and perceive inner splendour and reality, inspired me to create this series of landscapes. Besides, I find that sitting still in a site, admiring minuscule details and painting with watercolour on a blank paper for hours is the perfectly tested method of relaxation for myself, as well as the ultimate cure for my soul. Thus, through my work, I wish not only to initiate a spark in peoples heart to appreciate the genuine inward significance of everything in our lives, but also to gift them a sense of peace and well-being. - Keshani De Silva
Art had been a distant dream for me being a mother of three sons while working full time. Long have I wished to pursue my dream as an artist until I was introduced to Gibbs by my friend Mendis. I was very inspired by him and his work. I joined his class four months ago. I somehow manage to find time for painting and as the old saying goes, better late than sorry. - Renuka Mendis
Painting is not just a blend of mere colours and strokes, it gives us a deeper insight. I started drawing and painting when I was 9 years old, capturing on paper what was before my eyes. I started entering competitions and won national awards. In 2017, I won an international award  the Toyota Dream Car silver medal in Japan. That was a wonderful moment in my life. I found art as precious and valuable as emeralds and dearer than fine opals. It was a pleasure for me to sit the green and watch the sun in his chariot of gold. Hats off and dearest thanks to my master, Royden Gibbs. Im overwhelmed and very delighted to take part in this exhibition. - Hansaja Devnith
I have always been very much interested in art, especially watercolours. Under the guidance of my teacher Roydon O. Gibbs, I am learning the use of different techniques and this has been very useful for me since I am doing art as a subject in school. Art has made me look at things from a different perspective. I have learned to be more observant of little things, be it the colour of the sky or cloud formations or shadows, etc., which I had not bothered to notice in detail before. I hope to continue art despite my studies since it makes me a happier person. - Malinka Samarasinha
I was interested in art from a very young age. My interest in art was rekindled under the guidance of Roydon O. Gibbs. I am mainly interested in learning the different techniques in watercolour, which is a very interesting and challenging medium. I have done a few still life and landscapes in watercolour and hope to expand to other mediums in the future. Getting involved in art has made me observe and appreciate the things around me, especially nature, in a more detailed way. My hope is to continue this effort, which brings happiness and a sense of achievement to me. - DharshaSamarasinha
Over the past 29 years, I made a name for myself in the field of print media and have won several awards as a political cartoonist and as a newspaper and graphics designer. One of my childhood dreams was to become a top-class painter and to achieve this dream I sought guidance from the legendary painter Roydon Gibbs a few years ago. This marks the first time that some of my work will be on display in an exhibition. - Wasantha K Siriwardena
I have always been interested in art/paint/colour. The bit I had really never thought about learning it, until my children left home and I had time on my hands. I was introduced to Royden Gibbs by a former student of his. He has encouraged and guided me to paint, and mostly to have the confidence to express myself. I am very thankful to him for that and for showing me the tricks of the trade. - Manel Ratnayake
My mother inspired me to take up art as an adult when she handed me my old Botany and Zoology practical school books, which she had kept as souvenirs. My very first teacher was Lathifa Ismail and I am very grateful to her. While going through a turbulent period in life, art gave me the peace and quiet I needed. A few years ago, my mother reminded me not to give up painting. After her demise, I decided to heed her advice.
I was introduced to Royden Gibbs, who inspired me to improve myself with his passion for art and his enthusiasm. Art is the best stress reliever and gives me lots of joy and happiness. - Dianthi Uragoda
In my experience, there is no subject more fascinating, more illusive nor captivating as art. I had a desire for art from my school days, having won the college art prize in 1961, at St. Thomas College, Guruthalawa. I continued to further enhance my abilities by joining the then famous Amarasekera Academy of Art. After three decades, I had a fortuitous meeting with Royden Gibbs at an art exhibition. Under his inspiring tutelage, I have happily started painting again. - Gamini Fernando
As an engineer, who has worked in Africa and Asia in the management of cross-border multidisciplinary projects with multicultural, multiethnic workgroups, I found that art is a cohesive medium that permeates across geographies, cultures and ethnicities  a common language that binds humanity.
My desire to learn to draw stems from a passion to capture and share the extraordinary beauty found in the detail of what cursorily seems mundane and ordinary. I feel blessed to have the opportunity to train under Roydon Gibbs, one of the best watercolourists of our time, and is determined to make the best of it.

Scholarships given to children of war heroes
The main responsibility of the children of war heroes who sacrificed their lives for the motherland is to become good citizens after completing their education in an exemplary manner, Rana Viru Seva Authority (RVSA) Chairperson Anoma Fonseka said.
She was speaking at a scholarship distribution ceremony at the Sri Lanka Navy Auditorium organised by the Kuwait - Lanka Friendship Society in collaboration with the Ranaviru Seva Authority recently.
The sacrifice made by fathers and brothers of these children is immeasurable, Fonseka said. We are indebted to them and their wives and children for this sacrifice.
The issues and difficulties faced by those families in their daily lives cannot be devalued," she added. But, I am very glad to say that the family members of military personnel and war heroes have tremendous pride for the services and sacrifices rendered by their loved ones for the country," Fonseka said.
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene was the chief guest at the event.
Scholarships valued at Rs.12,000 each were distributed among 60 children.
The society has already given scholarships to around 477 children of war heroes since 2008.
She reminded the children that they received these scholarships due to the sacrifices of their parents and requested them to study well and be useful citizens. She also expressed her appreciation to the Kuwait - Sri Lanka Friendship Society and Sri Lankan expatriates in Kuwait for their magnanimity in coming forward to assist these children.
"The Security Forces gave a new lease of life to the country by defeating the most dangerous terrorist group in the world," Kuwait - Lanka Friendship Association Chief Organiser Gamini Wijeratne said. Therefore, all segments of society have a responsibility to pay gratitude to them.
Ranaviru Seva Authority Vice Chairperson Upulangani Malagamuwa, Kuwait - Lanka Friendship Society Coordinator Daya Lankapura and families of scholarship recipients were also present at the occasion.

Sculpture in style
The Sri Lankan Hindu temples, temple structures and inner temple designs almost resemble the ancient South Indian Hindu temples. Shiva worship is one of the foremost practices in this island nation. Sri Lankan Hindu tower temple sculptures almost resemble the typical South Indian Dravidian Hindu temple tower sculptures. South Indian Hindu temple architecture has its own excellence and exceptional unique structural style. It could be generally said that almost all the Sri Lankan Hindu temple sculptures follow the rich ancient Dravidian architecture.
It is inevitable that the famed Colombo Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple Kochchikade was built following the same South Indian Dravidian architecture and South Indian Dravidian sculptural style. According to Sri Lankan Hindu temple history, this is the only Hindu temple in Sri Lanka which was built with granite alone. That's why this particular temple is often referred to as 'Kallu temple' or 'KalluKovil'. This implies that the temple was built with granite alone. Even the outside boundary walls of the temple, the skyscraper Kopurams (towers), Sanctum (Sanctorum) and outdoor of the Sanctum were made with strong granite slabs. Besides these, even inside the temple, separate different inner temples were also built for different deities, with granite alone.
Beautifully crafted
The inner top roof of the temple is also made of granite. Even the inner top roof is beautifully crafted, and carved with excellent figures which reveal the excellent and exceptional craftsmanship of the sculptors.
The diagram of twelve Rasi Chakarams is exquisitely depicted near the eastern entrance roof top. Besides, these various aspects are beautifully carved on the magnificent granite pillars. Most of the pillars are decorated with beautifully crafted reptiles, beautiful and different varieties of birds and big and small wild animals in different poses and stands. All these provide us ample evidence of exquisite handiwork of the sculptors. In simple words, we can say, by numerous ways the sculptors of this temple have contributed their whole might and efforts to beautify this temple into a cultural citadel.
Inside the temple, a plenty of granite crafted and carved sculptures are seen. Simply it could be said that this temple is decorated with beautiful sculptures. And these sculptures are seen on the temple walls, on the temple pillars, on the top of the pillars, as well as on the inner rooftops. Even the inner rooftops are also decorated with beautifully carved and crafted figures. On one pillar near the Navagragha temple, one could see 18 Tamil letters beautifully crafted.
We are privileged to see beautifully carved lions on each top of the tall majestically sculptured pillar. Each lion looks very calm and majestic. It is worthy to mention here that none of these single lions looks agitated anywhere else in the temple. Most of these lions are depicted in sitting position. Each lion's mouth is wide open. From the wide-open mouth of the lions, thick carved granite chains seem to be falling out. It implies the exquisite craftsmanship and the excellent sculptors' skill. Further from some of the lions' mouths, instead of carved granite chains, leafy creepers seem to be falling down from their wide-open mouths. All these sculptures reveal the exceptional imaginative creativity of the sculptors.
Saint KannappaNayanar's epic is well depicted on one of the temple pillars. Saint KannappaNayanar's devotion towards Lord Shiva is immeasurable. KannappaNayanar's epic clearly defines his sacred devotion and exceptional love for Lord Shiva. Saint KannappaNayanar, due to his overwhelming devotion towards Lord Shiva, in one incident had plucked and offered his left eye to the Lord.
Gypsy figure
Near the IsthambaMandapam, adjoining the right side steps, at the top of a pillar a gypsy woman's figure is beautifully carved. In other words, a gypsy woman's figure is beautifully depicted on one of the temple pillars.
This particular gypsy woman is holding a basket in her hand. It is remarkable and appropriate evidence which reveals the excellent nuances of Dravidian sculptors' handiwork. On the top of these sub inner temples, the devotees are privileged to have an opportunity to view numerous poses of Shiva Puthams (Goblins). The Shiva Puthams are decorating the pillar tops. Some of the Shiva Puthams seem to be bending their two legs and they are in resting positions. Meanwhile, some of the Shiva Puthams seem to be in sitting position and raising up their body.Above all these, the Eastern Rajakopuram and Southern AmbalRajakopuram of the temple towers are beautifully decorated with numerous sculptures. Further, these sculptures depict different puranic stories related to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi.
In some Hindu temples, excellently carved musical instruments also could be seen. Unlike other South Indian Shivan temples, at Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar Temple, Kochchikade, there is neither a single decorative dance pose of Lord Nataraja, nor a single decorative Thandava Karana pose of the Lord is seen. Similarly, even a single dance pose of a danseuse is also not seen.
Another noteworthy aspect of this temple is unlike other temples, no room is given for paintings or portraits. The temple gives more importance to the sculptures rather than paintings. All the Hindu temples are generally decorated with beautiful paintings related to different stories pertaining to the main presiding deities of the selective temples. Most of the Hindu temples are adorned with beautiful decorative sculptures of various Gods, dance poses of numerous gods and numerous female dancing figures.
Rooftop space
To get ventilation inside the temple, magnificently crafted granite windows were installed by the temple constructors. Initially, the constructors left some spaces on the rooftop in order to get sunlight and ventilation into the temple.

SL a welfare oriented country which needs taxing: State Minister Harsha de Silva
Certain groups are trying to spread false information on some taxes that would be introduced by the Inland Revenue Act, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva yesterday said. He also said that he believed, especially in a welfare oriented country, individuals who are earning above a certain amount needed to pay income taxes.
"I was speaking the other day with a Consultant Physician who was unhappy with having to pay Rs. 12,000 as tax for a salary above two hundred thousand. Is it unfair to pay it I don't believe so. This is a welfare oriented country. The government needs to collect such taxes if it was to continue with the welfare system," Dr. de Silva said.
Deputy Minister de Silva also pointed out that there are number of rumours circulated with regard to taxes on the Employees Provident Fund, Pensions, earnings by employees in the Middle East and Bank Deposits. He also said that the proposed tax on apartments was postponed for an year.
Meanwhile Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva in reply to a question raised by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, said that issues regarding methods determining the Gross Domestic Product in the country, would soon be resolved. According to the Deputy Minister, the Department of Census and Statistics is currently having discussions with the International Monetary Fund to determine the changes necessary to the said system to correctly measure the contributions made by new services in the economy to the GDP.

Sorrow, celebration at Winnie Mandelas home
SOUTH AFRICA: Crowds of mourners flocked on Monday to Winnie Mandelas home in the heart of South Africas Soweto township, a centre of anti-apartheid resistance that remained her base decades after white rule fell.
Neighbours, supporters and passers-by assembled to sing and chant at the gates of her modest two-storey red-brick home in the Orlando neighbourhood shortly after her death was announced.
I was friends with her mother for some time. I saw it on the TV just now and came here to check and was shocked, said Constance Mokolobat, 89, a neighbour of Winnies on Maseli Street.
Winnie Mandela remained embedded in the township community where she met Nelson Mandela at a bus stop in 1957.
She was a good woman. When we had birthdays she would call us and when there were funerals shed always go. When we had problems she would always help. The community was like family, said college worker Elise Tsikhovi, 60, another neighbour.
Local residents heading to the house were soon followed by President Cyril Ramaphosa and officials of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) of which Winnie was a prominent figure as the former head of its Womens League.
I was shocked and thats why we gathered -- to make sure it was true, ANC Womens League official Winnie Ngwenya, 64, told AFP.
In African culture, we sing when were hurt, she added as dozens of well-wishers sang struggle-era songs in a dark night.
She was a woman who was known by everybody in Soweto -- as well as in Africa and outside. Well remember her for her role in the struggle in Soweto.
She used to wake up in her pyjamas right in the middle of the night when you would call her and she would fight the (security forces) who would come into Soweto, added Ngwenya.
Tsikhovi described how Winnie Mandela -- known by many as Mama Winnie -- had stayed active right to the end.
She liked gardening -- she used to come out to her garden. I last saw her last month at voter registration, she said, standing beside Winnie Mandelas neat lawn, manicured trees and an ANC banner fluttering above her home. She wasnt so strong by then, but she was a strong woman. Even if she was sick, she would act like she was well. - AFP

SriLankan restructures with  new Board of Directors
A new Board of Directors under the Chairmanship of Ranjit Fernando has been appointed at SriLankan Airlines in order to accelerate the restructuring process and create the enabling environment to proceed with entering into a Public-Private-Partnership with a strategic investor.
Other Board members appointed include Mano Tittewella (Ministry of Finance), Dr. Roshan Perera (Central Bank), Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathi (Air Force Commander) and Susantha Katugampala (Lawyer/Barrister).
Fernando was chosen to head the Board based on his experience in transforming the then State-owned National Development Bank where he served from its inception in 1979 until his retirement in 2001.
He was appointed as a Director and CEO of the Bank in 1989 and gave leadership to the growth of the bank including its privatization and an extremely successful public issue of shares in 1993 and NDB becoming a Universal Bank, adding commercial banking with the acquisition of ABN Amro, insurance, venture capital, stock brooking and investment banking to its product portfolio. After retirement, Fernando has functioned as Secretary of the Ministry of Industries and Chairman of several public listed companies and the UDA. He is an Attorney-at-Law, possessing a Bachelor of Law (Hons) Degree and is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (UK), Chartered Institute of Bankers (UK) and a Companion of the Chartered Institute of Management (UK).
The restructuring and PPP process will continue to be guided by the Officials Committee chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury with the participation of the Secretary, Ministry of Public Enterprise Development and Chairman of the National Agency for Public Private Partnership (NAPPP), Thilan Wijesinghe. Wijesinghe serves as the Convener of the Officials Committee. The Officials Committee, set up in September 2017, will continue to refer required areas for direction by the Ministerial Committee chaired by the Prime Minister and for implementation by the Board of SriLankan Airlines. Aviation Consultants, Nyras of UK, hired after a competitive process in November 2017 by the Officials Committee, will continue to report to the Officials Committee. This working arrangement is to ensure shareholder (Treasury) interests are adequately addressed in the restructuring process.
The final restructuring plan prepared by Nyras with the assistance of NAPPP has already been presented to the Ministerial Committee and will be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for approval upon being endorsed by the new Board of Directors. Nyras has presented a detailed business plan that demonstrates the SriLankan Airlines Group can become viable in the short to medium term through the restructuring strategy. This has similarities to the strategy adopted by Swiss Air and Aer Lingus, both advised by Nyras that resulted in turning these loss-making airlines turning into extremely profitable companies. The NAPPP, with the assistance of Nyras, will coordinate the PPP process that will be implemented in parallel with the restructuring process and advise the Ministry of Finance and Officials Committee. The NAPPP will also advise the Officials Committee on the debt restructuring process designed to mitigate any impact on the General Treasury and State Banks, who are the largest lenders to SriLankan Airlines.

Stamps story
Subsequent to the issue of the first postage stamp for the usage of the General Public in Britain on May 6, 1840, a gradual renaissance was experienced in the postal service of the country. Following this, other countries too showed sharp interest in the usage of a postage stamp. Thus and further, the postage stamp usage expanded among the British authorities who took efforts to introduce and promulgate the habit in all the countries that were under the British domination.
Accordingly, the first issue of postage stamps came to effect in the Mauritius Island in 1847. In Asia, the country where the first issue of postage stamp took place was India and it was in 1852 in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) our own postage stamp was for the first time issued on April 1, 1857.
It appears that there was a keen interest among postal authorities as well as the general public of various social strata in the matter of postage stamp usage. The G G Fraser Post-Master General period had been actively involved in this regard. It was his aim and ambition to overprint for the first time. The postage stamp of the particular category which was in usage in England and a requisition was placed in favour of Ceylon in the year 1854 to get down 60000 postage stamps in the denomination of 6 pence and 70 stamp seal. For the cancelling they used stamps. This was the reason that made the British authorities to venture on printing a stamp in a novel type exclusively for Ceylon.
Engraved in printing
The figure form which was chosen be depicted in that postage stamps was a portrait of Queen Victoria. This was designed by Edward Henry who had designed for the Worlds First Postage Stamp and this figure was engraved on the printing plate by William Hungreys.
The first stamp of Ceylon was printed by Perkins Bacon & Com Who had printed the worlds first postage stamp. A total of 60000 postage stamp was printed in the form of 250 stamps per sheet. This stamp was printed in light brown and purple on a special type paper light blue in colour. Bearing star-shaped watermark and this stamp dispatched to Ceylon in December 1855.
Following the publication of an article in the newspapers regarding the delay in the issue of this postage stamp, efforts were duly taken by the authorities to issue the said postage stamps and accordingly the issue took place on April 1, 1857. Scissors were then used for separating the stamps from among other stamps in the sheet because no perforations were used in that stamp sheet.
In addition to this postage stamp, six other postage stamps were issued further in 1857 in various denominations on July 2nd three postage stamps at 5 pence. 10 pence and one shilling on August 24, two postage stamps at one penny and two pence all these stamps were printed and despatched to Ceylon by Perkins Bacon & Com.
However, the other stamp in the denomination of halfpence that was issued in the same year was printed at Da La Rue & Co. This postage stamp was printed on a special type paper with glistening surface and without watermark in it. Additionally, two stamp covers at the value of one penny and two pence two were issued in that same year.
Portrait depiction
According to the annals of the lineage of Ceylon postage stamps, we find the depictions in them as follows  from 1857-1900 stamp bearing the portrait of Queen Victoria from 1903-1912.
The portrait of King Edward VII, from 1512-1935 portrait of King George V, from 1937-1948 portrait of King George VI in this year 1935 series of scenic. Views of Sri Lanka (Ceylon) were included postage stamps.
Since 1948 when Sri Lanka (Ceylon) was declared an independent state, a large spectrum of postage stamps expounding the information pertaining to several aspects of Sri Lanka have been issued.
They served as descriptive instruments related to Sri Lankas history art life patterns of our people and aesthetic matters and thereby enlightening the world. It should, therefore, be our committed determination on this momentous to further enhance the quality of philatelic arts through understanding and learning the expectation of people.

## Title: STEELED THREAT TO WORLD TRADE

STEELED THREAT TO WORLD TRADE
Is there a looming trade war between large nations The global scenario on trade that is dominated by the large countries seems increasingly poised to battle it out if a trade war breaks out. Though the international media run many stories on this tense topic that will also engulf poorer countries like Sri Lanka, this writer was in particular impressed by a critical lead article in this regard in an international magazine.
The Economist in the issue of March 10-16, 2018 claims that President Donald Trump though appears to be the first U.S. President to hit the road to protectionism, he was not.
Protectionism at least in the context of imposing tariffs on imports, Trump was super-ceded by other U.S. Presidents in the somewhat distant past. The Economist mentions that President Jimmy Carter was to an extent initially protectionist. During the Carter regime, the product that was subject to high import tariff was steel. This time too it is steel.
The current U.S. administration plans to impose a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports respectively
The two tariffs alone will not lead to debilitating damage to the U.S. economy. But they may trigger a potential disaster for both the U.S. and the world economy.
Let us examine the fearsome situation projected closely.
Incidentally in 2016 steel and aluminium imports to the U.S. accounted for only 2% of all imports to the U.S. Last year imports to U.S. amounted to U.S.$ 3 trillion.
Free trade and President Trump
The Economist observes that ever since Trump assumed office he has been sneering at free trade, besides the existent multi-lateral trading system.
According to the U.S. administration this system is detrimental to its interests. On the other hand, the international media in general feels that the U.S. administration is in a chaotic state. To make matters worse, Trumps Chief Economic Advisor who was widely considered a rare advocate of free trade within the establishment, recently resigned from his post and that was believed to be a major setback for the U.S.
It now looks as if that there is an ill-wind about to blow against the long held belief of a liberal international trade environment and within that trade environment a main proponent had been the United States. It is now the U.S. which is a conscious opponent of a free trade regime.
A multidimensional danger
The imposition of high tariff to curb imports by the worlds largest economy may lead to a retaliatory effect. It is the U.S. that will first face the counter import sanctions imposed by those nations affected. The U.S. to cite an example is thinking in turn of imposing high tariffs on import of cars from Europe. In retaliation it is reported by the foreign media that products like bourbon and motor cycles (Harley Davidson) exported by the U.S. will face sanctions.
And why should the US build a tariff wall in respect of steel imports on the basis of such exports are a security risk. Observers on trade state that the security factor cited is spurious since these products exported to the U.S are mainly by Canada, Mexico and South Korea, firm allies of the U.S.
Emerging picture cloudy and complex
The real truth is reportedly different. It is to gain leverage to the planned re-negotiation of NAFTA. = the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Over a period of time Trump had been highly critical of NAFTA. His criticism had gone viral and this gave indications that President Trump is thinking of a protectionist approach to exports into U.S. and that he is considering a revisionist attitude to NAFTA.
The emerging picture of the much talked of high tariff and retaliatory effect remains complex and unclear. To begin with observers of the current scenario wonder whether the imposition of tariff on grounds of security of a nation could be challenged legally.
The lead article in The Economist has queried whether the WTO will react positively to this situation. But the WTO, it is contended has long been troubled by the failure of the Doha Round in 2015.
The additional burden of counteracting action by the powerful U.S will add to it woes or entrap it further. All this of course is speculation and as yet there in nothing definite.
What should however be most worrisome is the WTOs inability to secure a consensus on much needed reforms to the current trading system. As a result of the action required to initiate a new trade round has led to the transfer of the much needed reforms to dispute resolution machinery of the WTO. Such machinery is reportedly too weak. The prevailing belief is that WTO is not strong enough and also irresolute. As a result trade disputes that could have been dealt with in a new trade round effectively have instead been pushed into its dispute resolution machinery. It is said to be the experience of many nations that the dispute resolution mechanism is too burdensome to the WTO. Given this situation, if the US issue of high import tariff on steel due to security factor is transferred to the US for resolution through adjudication how will the WTO tackle it, in the face of its awesome current burden (According to the latest information in the Chinese news the issue is said to be already placed before the WTO)
On the other hand, as pointed out by The Economist if the WTO courts cannot adjudicate or if it has second thoughts about the security factor that US has advanced on steel imports, President Trump may even decide to quit the WTO.
The Economist observes that a severely overburdened WTO after 15 years of fruitless search which led to the collapse of the Doha Round will have to confront a much graver situation if the US leaves the WTO.
The Economist is of the view that the WTO has been slow and had not been able to keep abreast of economic change that has transformed the international trade scene.
The magazine is further of the view that the WTO is increasingly involved in intangibles like patents and copy rights, whereas it should in reality consider physical assets like steel mills. Also, the earlier rules it drafted in respect of rich market economies cannot be applied to state directed and controlled capitalism. The Economist cites the example of implicit subsidies afforded by China to its producers of industrial metals. This had led to a glut of such metals and it is not a surprise that China is looked at by some nations thereby affected with dislike.
Tragedy to undermine WTO
In the midst of all these recent developments inimical to the interests of the WTO and whatever its failings had been, there are many who state that it will be a tragedy to undermine the WTO.
This could happen if the US adopts a contra mercantilist policy that runs counter to the existent global trading system.
If this happens many other nations would follow suit, thereby destroying, despite flaws largely an orderly and regulated international trade regime. The Economist towards the conclusion of their study on this critical subject state that this may not lead to an imminent collapse of the WTO, it is likely to break the very structure of globalization.
Despite purists who are inclined to cast aspersions on globalization, this writer is of the view that globalization has opened vast new frontiers of trading and Asia as a whole had been a big beneficiary. One just has to look at the economic transformation of China, India and the smaller Asian countries.
Of course critics will cite the case of continuous trade imbalances partly brought by globalization. On the other hand globalization has opened the doors of opportunity to many a poor nation through technology transfers and investments, as also through the application of modern supply chain techniques.
Innovation and new products
The WTO has had a definitive role to play especially in terms of developing countries not only through a regulatory framework but also other modes of trade promotion.
We are inclined to agree with The Economist the vast improvements to living standards in an impoverished world as it were after the Second World War which reduced the barriers of trade were clearly due to the eight trade rounds.
Imports should in most cases be welcome since they benefit the consumer and drive manufacturers towards innovation and new products.
Even without the WTO, cross border trading is bound to continue though subject to less governance and regulation. We are also inclined to agree that international trade in such a case will be without norms and procedures.
An environment sans these basic elements of control will give way to runaway mercantilism. Trade policy will then enter the domain of special interest groups. What is more, military power as pointed out by The Economist will come into play and fair play will disappear.
One area in particular that helps global economic growth transnational investment will suffer the most. One could be almost certain that if such an adverse development follows, given the present climate of uncertainty it is The US that will be hit the most so The Economist contends.
The US has been the most important power in the system of post- war trade whether you like it or not.
If the US does not realize this inevitable fact of life other key nations need to keep their heads calm. On the other hand a tit for tat attitude will plunge other nations too into a state of disaster.
It is vitally important in this context to give all backing possible to trade.
Such a backing globally will help to fix WTO all its members should agree on a plan of concerted action. This includes considering Trumps tariffs which will strengthen the WTO though it will be tough for it to solve the issue.
Rule based global economy will then receive a boost and free traders will then be required to recognize that the WTO could play a role against the protectionist lobby.
This will however not be easy since the man in the Oval office appears to be the biggest enemy currently of free trade.

Botejue legacy reaches 70th milestone
Striving for greater success with diversification
While family businesses are fading away and new ventures overwriting them, the Bernard Botejue Group in Kohuwala has reversed this trend and moved from stitching to strength to strength and laid the foundation to stay afloat for another 70 years.
It was the love for a fabric, needle and a thread that created The Bernard Botejue Group way back in 1948 by Bernard Botejue who first started making banians (vest) for the local market competing against the imported British vest. Having being employed as a Librarian at the Medical College and a supervisor at Ceylon Hosiery Company he did not have access to large capital. Undeterred he then managed to borrow cash from Dr P.R. Anthonis, the famed surgeon and also few other friends to kick start his business seven decades ago.
Armed with not only cash but courage and a strong future plan he then imported sewing machines from Japan and employed three women. The business move on becoming an instant success story and within one year of operations Bernard Banians became a house hold name and due to high demand the employee strength increased to 58.
This success gave him additional confidence and then he moved in to making socks and caps which too caught up in the local market.
With his marriage to Hema in 1956 Botejue received another moral boost with his better half too joining the business and bringing in more innovation and the much needed ladies touch to it.
To give a corporate feel to the company the business was transformed in to the limited liability company in 1967.
The year 1967 was significant for the business when the Colombo Plan offered Hema a scholarship to Germany for advanced training in the field. After their return with more technological innovation behind them the company moved in to making of Polo T-shirts, underwear and ladies frocks which too caught up instantly.
The present Managing Director of Bernard Botejue Industries, Janaka Botejue going down memory lane recalled the dedication of his father as he drove around the country selling banians until they were sold out.
Though closed economy was a bane for some it turned out to be a major success for the company. There were traders coming to place orders even at dusk and keeping money on the table as advances to secure orders and pleading to accept them.
Everything we made was sold instantly but my parents never compromised quality nor increased the prices to make a quick gain,
With the introduction of the open economy in 1977 Bernard Botejue Industries, switched gears at the right time and looked at the export market. It was the Export Development Board that helped us in 1978 to take part in our first international exhibition in New York which opened up new technological ideas and most importantly helped us to find foreign buyers.
We subsequently tied up with an US and Hong Kong company and for the first time foreign exchange started to flow down to Bernard Botejue Industries.
The Apparel quota system which was introduced during this time too was an asset to us and helped to intensify exports.
Janaka Botejue also recalled that President Premadasa too was a tower of strength in the rise of the apparel industry in Sri Lanka through his 200 garment factories program. We also saw an opportunity (not an obligation) and opened a factory and embroidery and printing plant in Kolonna Embilipitiya which is a great asset to us even today.
The Colombo factory was downsized due to labour shortages, while focus was transferred to Hambantota to bridge the gap that emerged. In 2003, both the purchase and production functions were moved to the new factory in Hambantota. In mid-2015, having taken a pragmatic look at the business model and its functions, the Hambantota plant was fully divested, forging avenues for the business to completely concentrate in Kolonna. Expansion is also now planned.
Moving on to new products the company also started to make sportswear and football jerseys.
The two factories in Kolonna and Hambantota are under the umbrella of Bernard Manufacturing and concentrate on export apparel, while Sentrino (Pvt) Limited which opened its doors in 2004 initially as an embroidery plant, has now expanded into printing as well, catering to a range of export manufacturers.
Explaining their future plans with the two Directors, Gayani and Bernand at his side said that they were planning to intensify exporters with their officers in New York and London. We also hope to start designing our branded products in the US.
The company has also diversified to the leisure sector with Everton Holidays which is mainlining colonial bungalows and in to holiday packages. The company also acquired Citrus entertainment to offer a different experience from their group.
The company moved in to a BOI venture after a somewhat bad era during 1990 decade but this soon turned around. The company also made use of its large two acre space in Kohuwela and opened up a special commercial zone, Bernards Business Park which is now being used by 10 companies including Perera and Sons and Cargills Food City and also their sales outlet.
We also hope to increase our Research and Development facilities and look at more innovative products that are in demand.
Asked if they plan to list, the trio answered in the negative and said that they have continued for 70 years as a family business and wish to remain that way.

TNA to make final decision on NCM today
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will make a final decision on the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) at 10 am today.
TNA Leader R.Sampanthan met his Parliamentary group on two occasions yesterday, one prior to meeting President Maithripala Sirisena and one after, but the group could not arrive at a final consensus on both occasions.
It is learnt that opinion has been divided within the alliance with regard to opposing the NCM and though the leadership has asked that they vote against it, several other partners had proposed that they abstain from the vote.
TNA MP D.Siddarthan speaking to the Daily News, however stated that it is likely that most would vote against the NCM.
TNA sources revealed that Sampanthan and Mavai Senathirajah had met the President in the morning and thereafter, the TNA leader together with the Parliamentary Group met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at a separate meeting.
At the meeting with the Prime Minister, they had put forward several demands in exchange for their support today and it is learnt that the Prime Minister was agreeable to them. The TNA had asked that the Prime Minister provide them with a written assurance. The latter had agreed.
Siddarthan in the meantime also noted that they could not support a motion brought forward by the Joint Opposition; a group which has always been against the Tamil cause. Another question we have is, even if the motion is passed, who will be the next Prime Minister We cannot vote to pass this without knowing that.
The Prime Minister has not been against us and unless we know who will be the next Prime Minister, we cannot support this motion, he said further. The TNA has 16 MPs in Parliament.
