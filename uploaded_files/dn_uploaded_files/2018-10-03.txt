The International Trade Information Services of taxation subcommittee of the Chamber Obtained the view of eminent business personalities, associations, corporate heads and audit firms before the final submission on budget proposals 2019 was submitted to the government.
Increasing revenue, taxation and tax administration, policy and macro economic issues were the key areas covered in the proposal.
Curtailing revenue loss from under invoicing and under valuation, broadening the tax net to cover public servants, preparation of accounts to confirm to accounting standards which will improve transparency and also more consistent and acceptable accounts for the revenue assessment process optimising the tax revenue and tax audits to identify non- filers and non-compliers were some of the measures put forward by the chamber to enhance the revenue for the government.
As a measure of attracting new foreign and local investment and to encourage company formation the chamber proposes the government to implement the Group Taxation in Sri Lanka. Further, suggestions were put forward on double taxation treaty arrangements in order to optimise the attractiveness of Sri Lanka for investment, trade and technology transfers.

Revenue proposals 

Curtailing revenue loss from smuggling 

The State and the business community lose billions of rupees annually due to the entry of smuggled, contraband/counterfeit goods and malpractices at point of entry such as by unscrupulous Importers. This questionable trade is fast growing and threatening businesses engaged in ethical competition. Tax evasion is mainly aimed at minimising import duty and VAT payments.
The modus operandi by these unscrupulous traders is:

lUnder  declaration of value and quantity smuggling
The main methods used for these operations are:
*Tax on Internet transactions
*Import under different product names and HS Codes
* Concealed with other Imported cargo in containers
*Unaccompanied sea baggage, mainly of expatriate workers returning from Middle East
* Malpractices at unaccompanied baggage warehouses
* Misuse of duty free allowance by arriving passengers
* Baggage carriers / organised traffickers
*Pilferage/ smuggling from ships berthed in outer harbor
* To prevent losses to Government Revenue it is proposed that measures be taken to increase checking and vigilance and enforce harsher penalties on those found guilty of having committed offences.
Declaration of Tax File numbers in large value transactions
Require parties engaged in business transactions in excess of a specified amount to disclose the respective income tax file numbers on the face of the invoice receipt or contract note to facilitate subsequent tracing and effective tax compliance. Possible limits could be: 
Acquisition of any capital assets with a dutiable value over Rs. 5 million.
Payments in excess of Rs. 1 million for any goods or services.

Tax Liability and statutory dues of foreign contractors

Foreign contractors retained by government non-governmental organisation, multilateral agencies and private sector be required to open a tax file and register for statutory dues including super  annuation liabilities at the time of award of contracts.
The party securing the service of foreign contractors is made liable to ensure due settlement of taxes and other statutory dues before release of payment.

Compulsory registration of business

Require compulsory registration of any business with a turnover above Rs. 50 millions (and below a specified ceiling to be determined by Government) with the Department of Inland Revenue. The registration certificate to be displayed prominently at the place of business quoting the income tax file number. At the time of registration, the businesses will have to elect either to pay a fixed charge of 1% of turnover as income tax or else be subject to the
normal process of assessment. New businesses to register within first year of commencing business. Failure to register should be made punishable offence.

The revenue authority 

Unique pin numbers (Business Registration No. or NIC No) to be assigned by parties to all transactions over a specified amount. This recommendation is possibly a project already undertaken by Sri Lanka.
Outsource tax investigation to Private Sector Taxation Professional, where possible and thereby establish a professional approach to co  ordinate revenue optimisation. In such events it should be ensured that there would be no conflict of interest in engaging them.
Measure to ensure speedier collection of Tax Revenue

Tax Audits 

A special focused group of independent professionals with no conflicts of interest to be recruited and placed either under the Revenue Authority or the Inland Revenue Department to do special field surveys in the informal sector to identify the non  filers and non  compliers as a revenue enhancement measure. This will also help to generate a level playing field and it will be appropriate, as the exoneration has been until March 31, 2018.
The chamber feels that an enormous amount of tax can be easily collected by the evidence of the amount of moneys that have come into the economy.
Withdrawal of incentive schemes in revenue services
Improve the professionalism of tax administrators and reduce harassment of taxpayers by replacing the present incentives scheme applicable to revenue officers of tax, customs and excise departments with a performance based scheme.

Tax saving certificate 

Re-introduce the previously successful scheme of tax savings certificates at market rates of interest as a form of investment for taxpayers and to ensure advance collection.

Speedy tax reforms 

To improve tax payer services establish stretched targets for tax refund settlements and these be made in every instance with interest.

Use of private sector professional service organizations by the revenue authority on contractual basis

The revenue authority to identify areas and scope of work where, private sector professionals can be engaged on contractual basis in supporting the revenue administration to ensure speedier and more effective collection of tax revenue and improved tax compliance.
In outsourcing this work, the revenue authority and the private sector professionals to ensure that there are no conflicts of Interest.

Taxpayer recognition 

Issue taxpayer cards to all individual tax payers and public servants, which will entitle them to preferential treatment in selected instances eg. exemption from motor vehicle license fees, airport taxes and passport fees, as an incentive for complying with tax regulations.
Such card holders may also qualify for preferential treatment such as admission to tax payers immediate family to national hospitals to National Schools and to other institutions owned and operated by the government to provide service to the public.

What is required to put house in order 

Chamber officials urging the newly appointed Finance Minister to clean up the top administration in major revenue collection institution and economic nerve centres immediately as the heads of these institutions will definitely present a rosy picture on the economy misleading the authorities by hiding massive financial misappropriation and corrupt deals.
Problems need to be identified and corrective action taken immediately. Main problems according to our view are without making changes at the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs, Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, National Lotteries Board, Development Lotteries Board, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and Employees Trust Fund Board coming under the Finance Ministry, the countrys financial administration cannot be saved. Sri Lankas Tax Revenue has fallen from its target in the first quarter of last year. Due to the unsatisfactory situation in the revenue administration many capable officers at various levels retired from the service pre-maturely or transferred to the Finance Ministry under the one man show.

Housing loans 

It is not understood as to why the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka at present does not provide for a tax deduction for interest on housing loans to white (other than defined professionals) and blue collar workers.
It is significant that there was no considered policy decision that was adopted to eliminate the tax deductions that prevailed for the housing loans prior to 2011 era.

Rainco, the market leader in umbrella production is passionate about sustaining goodness across all its activities, amongst all stakeholders.

Commenting on Raincos initiative of sponsoring the Guru Prathibha Prabha program, Ahmed Aroos, Chief Operating Officer, Rainco (Pvt) Ltd said, Teachers have always played a vital role in all of our lives, but not many people talk about them or appreciate and praise them for what they have done or are doing. We as an organisation want to drive this and really acknowledge the vital role teachers have played in all our lives and its time to appreciate them. The meaning of Guru Panduru is literally a tribute to teachers. On that basis this program is very much in line with our organisations core value.
As a tribute to teachers, Rainco have also launched a unique limited edition special collection of umbrellas honouring all teachers. Additionally, it is an ideal gift as the product is specially designed in commemoration of World Teachers day.
Rainco is engaged in several corporate social responsibility activities and is a firm believer in giving back to the community. Its foremost purpose in helping teachers is to reinstall the values inculcated by this special segment.
We have many other CSR initiatives and this is one important activity. We collaborate on this program as we celebrate a special set of individuals.

National Public Private Dialogue on Maritime, Logistics and Transform Reform
Removing foreign equity taboos to spur industry
The governments plans to liberalise Sri Lankas shipping agency sector will augment its ambitious target of transforming Sri Lanka into a maritime and trading hub in the Indian ocean and it will also lead to attract more foreign investment, reduce costs and improve efficiencies, Eran Wickramaratne, State Minister of Finance and Mass Media told
the National Public Private Dialogue (PPD) on Maritime, Logistics and Transform Reform event held at the Galle Face Hotel yesterday.
In addition to these benefits, the Minister said removing 40 percent foreign equity ownership restriction on shipping agencies will encourage knowledge sharing activities among the counterparts and also increase the overall market size.
By removing this restriction, shipping industry will witness more global companies invest in Sri Lanka, increasing the overall competition. It is also imperative that we maximize our potential and take the advantage of the countrys geographical location, he said.
Minister said further that the global shipping and logistics companies dont have incentives to directly invest in maritime and logistics sector in Sri Lanka due to their minority equity ownership.
Removing 40% foreign equity ownership restrictions will help them to invest and infuse their expertise into maritime sector in order to create a world class industry, he said.
Noting that key objective of the government is to develop Sri Lankas maritime industry as a key trading hub in the Indian Ocean, the Minister said that the government is hoping to see the initial steps, taken to achieve this target to be completed by 2025 for which country needs to adopt proactive reforms and invest mainly in supply chain management.
We have already embarked on transforming countrys ports infrastructure and the government will be developing the Trincomalee port to complement existing Colombo and Hambantota ports. Another important step in this process is the full liberalization of the shipping industry, he said.
If Sri Lanka is to become a maritime hub by 2025, the country needs to provide basic transshipment services, more value added services even to non transshipment vessels as well, he said.
One of the Sri Lankas greatest advantages is its strategic location along many maritime trading routes in the Indian Ocean, which has enabled it to become a container transshipment hub. However the minister pointed out that Sri Lanka captures a small amount of basic transshipment growth in the Indian ocean and the full potential of Sri Lankas maritime and logistics industry remains unused.
The Minister also emphasised the need to protect current industry market share and urged industry stakeholders to be more proactive and act immediately to grow and protect the market share.
Otherwise we will regret years later, he said.
He also added that current artificial pricing mechanism of shipping agencies also doesnt reflect market dynamics. In addition to that, the industry is also controlled by large domestic players and there is a lack of foreign participation in the agency business.

Time ripe to accelerate structural and regulatory reform in SL
Tung Lai Margue

Sri Lanka needs to step up its efforts to accelerate structural and regulatory reforms to be on part with regional piers and to realise Sri Lankas vision of becoming a maritime and distribution centre in the region.
Tung Lai Margue , Ambassador and Head of Delegation, Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and to the Maldives told the National Public Private Dialogue On Maritime , Logistics and Transport Reform held at Galle Face Hotel yesterday.
In a rapidly changing and developing environment where regional neighbours such as India, Dubai and Singapore have intensified their efforts to grab opportunities to increase market share, the time is ripe to accelerate structural and regulatory reform in Sri Lanka, he said.
He further said that well performing logistics industry unlocks tremendous opportunities for growth of trade it enables connectivity of intraregional markets, helps meet the demand of a growing e-commerce industry and integrates value added services to obtain higher profitability and increases the countrys competitiveness.
As outlined in Vision 2025, Sri Lanka aims to transform itself into South Asias leading maritime, logistics and distribution hub. Furthermore the industry has been identified as a priority cross-cutting sector in the recently launched National Export Strategy which the European Union was pleased to fund through the EU-Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance Project, he said.
However he said that transforming Sri Lanka into a leading maritime, logistics and distribution hub in the Indian Ocean will require the creation of a conducive business environment and improved infrastructure and services to compete with the likes of Dubai to the West and Singapore to the east.
Compared with regional peers Sri Lanka has a lower ranking in the World Banks Logistic Performance Index (LPI) and is in the 94th position (of 160 countries) in 2018. Other hubs like Singapore and Dubai have high and consistent LPI rankings.
India used to depend on Sri Lanka for their transshipment cargo but gradual improvements to their port infrastructure have resulted in some shipping lines diverting their ships to Indian ports, he said
Sri Lanka has also higher shipping costs in comparison to regional hubs such as Malaysia and Thailand.
The Sri Lankan Government has invested heavily in developing infrastructure however some completed transport projects in Sri Lanka have not so far met their targets, although notable efforts are being made to transform these into profitable business.
Sri Lanka is mainly known as a container hub in South Asia. It must however rapidly diversify its business model to attract other types of ships and related services, for instance, multi modal hub providing logistical services for passing cargo such as crew changes, supplying and replenishing of food stock, bonded warehousing, cold storage solutions, packing etc.
I noted that the Government in its 2018 budget policy speech announced that the current legal framework for shipping and logistics would be changed in order to remove government protection in the sector and to fully open up the sector for international players and greater competition.
He expressed hope that these announcements will now be implemented.

Sithangi Pamula launch
Romance in the battlefield
Amidst the heavy flow of readers who carried bundles of books to their taste and field, a grand ceremony was held at the Special Book Launch Unit at the BMICH recently to coincide with the literary nature of September.
Who is the hero Can you skip the boring bits How long will it take to read A guide to a book that is not just great, this could be the best novel ever written.
The book is Sithangi Pamula which could be loosely translated into English as At the Bottom of Emotional Thoughts. The author is Jayani Pinnawala.
Samudra Wettasinghe, in his capacity as the compere of the launch, introduced Pinnawala as the author of three books: Apeksha, Sangiliyam and Samukka. Sithangi Pamula is apparently her fourth achievement. Her newly acquired role as a writer aside, Pinnawala has held top positions in the government sector in addition to being a university lecturer as well as a diplomat.
The book is themed under the civil war with a soldier with jilted love at the centre. He tries to make a soft companion out of a Tamil girl who apparently belongs to the Tiger outfit. The girl leaves for India yet hurries back to her Sinhala lover.
Dr Leel Gunasekara in his brief yet insightful speech maintained how Pinnawala has absorbed the soldiers character in the words and sentences.
The seasoned writer stressed the importance of enmeshing the golden era of the style of literature into the modern day write-ups.
Prof Kusuma Karunaratne recalled her memories of Jayani Pinnawala as a smart sweet girl at the University as an undergraduate. The professor, of course, has every reason to be proud of that young undergraduate now fully blossomed into a complete professional. A writer, Professor Karunaratne added, must entertain a theme on a familiar experience.
The first copy of Sithangi Pamula was handed over Jayani Pinnawala by Sarasavi Bookshop Chief H D Premasiri. The author, in turn, handed the copies to Dr Leel Gunasekera and Prof Kusuma Karunaratne.
People change. The characters in Sithengi Pamula endure extreme experiences and emerge at the end as quite different people. The miracle of the book is that its protagonist who falls in love with the Tamil girl of the opening is recognisably the same woman who withdraws from society in the end.
The novel has a particular technical feature; it passes from mind to mind, showing us the world as a consciousness moves through it. It doesnt mean that the consciousness of the moment has any particular importance; it is just how these events were seen by one particular observer, and another observer will take up the baton in a page or two.
This is not a historical novel, but a novel that discusses events of the recent past within the memory of many of Pinnawalas first readers. Its details are not exquisite recreations of lost practice, but ways in which an individual psychology can engage with the real world. It is about history, and how the Sri Lankan war makes an awful appearance.

Romantic proposal gone wrong
A man's dream proposal turned into more of a nightmare after he and his girlfriend got lost on a mountain.
Joshua Mason and Katie Davis, both from Texas, hiked up Jasper Peak in Colorado on Saturday.
They walked about eight miles - more than 3,000ft up the 13,000ft summit.
Mason had been seeking a scenic and isolated spot for the couple's special moment and Ms Davis happily accepted his surprise proposal, according to CBS. But it was late, getting dark and, with no clear track to follow, the couple lost their way. They had no cold weather gear and only a little water, according to Boulder County Sheriff's Office.
When they were found by a man camping nearby, Mr Mason, 27, and Ms Davis, 28, were showing signs of altitude sickness and dehydration.
The man and his friends gave them water, food and allowed them to warm up in their tent. One of the women in the group, concerned about the couple's health, hiked back down from Diamond Lake to her vehicle and then drove far enough to get mobile phone reception before calling for help in the early hours of Sunday.
Rescuers found the campers at about 4.30 am. The sheriff's office said the couple were immediately moved to a lower altitude, adding: "By that point they had recovered enough that they were both able to walk down to the trail head, assisted by Rocky Mountain Rescue Group personnel.

Roshith, Sonali win golds  at Asia Pacific Masters Games
Roshith Perera and Sonali Wimaladasa, Sri Lankan athletes who participated at the recently concluded Asia Pacific Masters Games (APMG) in Malaysia, returned to the island last week having won a medal in every event and category that they competed in.
Roshith competed in the age 30-34 years 200m, 100m and 50m breaststroke events, where he was placed first in the 200m and earned a gold medal and was placed 2nd in both the 100m and 50m events earning 2 silver medals. Sonali competed in the age 35-40 years 100 and 200 meter track events and won gold in both.
On their return to the island both athletes want to shift focus from their victory at the games and bring home a message they feel will benefit more people. In sports, as in a myriad of other spheres, ones age tends to be considered a cut off line or deciding factor explains Roshith who is a successful businessman, father of two and youth pastor at Wow Life Church and Riverlution (which is his sports initiative to encourage and inspire others to challenge what they thought were their limits). Because this concept has been unconsciously accepted where lots of people give up on their dreams, ambitions and hopes at a set time in their lives. I was one of them he explains.
Roshith was a successful swimmer during his teenage years competing at the schools and club levels, having captained CIS swim team and represented SSC. But in his late teens he opted to retire, considering end his sporting career. He explained how his body responded to his mindset, with unhealthy levels of weight gain and harmful habits. I know a lot of people thought I was crazy when I said I was going back to competitive swimming in my thirties, but since I started this journey, there have been so many other athletes who have stepped out of retirement and ended up winning medals and honour for Sri Lanka says Roshith who has now begun his own journey of coaching budding athletes.
Sonalis story is similar, being a successful track and field athlete as a student of St Bridgets, yet opting to stop at the end of her schooling career. Getting back to the sport I loved in my 30s was like a breath of fresh air. There were hundreds of people who told me why I shouldnt and couldnt, but I think we all owe it to ourselves to try she says. Her gold medal wins would appear that she was right.
Both explain that Sri Lanka has immense potential in terms of sporting capability that has not yet been fully taped into, recognizing two other athletes who competed and won medals in other respective swimming and running events at the APM games 2018. They believe that Sri Lanka has far more potential for gold in international competitions and intend to encourage athletes such as themselves, to hang up the retirement plans and look instead toward contention at regional and international events.

With several new measures by Central Bank
Rupee to stabilise; growth picks up
The Central Bank is hopeful that the depreciation of the rupee will stabilize soon following a number of measures taken by the Central Bank and the government while the economic growth is expected to grow at a positive note.
In a bid to stabilize the Sri Lanka rupee the Central Bank bought four million dollars from forex markets on Monday and now the markets have begun to stabilize, Central Bank officials said yesterday.
In contrast to Sri Lankan rupee the Indian, Philippines and Indonesian currencies are also facing major depreciations against the dollar, Governor, Central Bank, Indrajit Coomaraswamy told a media conference on Monetary Policy Review yesterday. The substantial surge in import expenditure was driven by the growth in imports of fuel, gold and personal motor vehicles.
In addition to the Central Bank intervention to curtail disorderly adjustment in the exchange rate during the first few weeks of September 2018, both the Central Bank and the government introduced a raft of policy measures including margin deposit requirements for letters of credit opened for the importation of personal motor vehicles, cash margins on selected non-essential consumer goods imports and the suspension of concessionary vehicle permits for a limited period.
These measures are expected to ease the excessive demand for foreign currency and hence the pressure in the domestic foreign exchange market as already observed in the stabilising exchange rate.
Emergency controls on some imports are temporary, and could be taken away or added to in the future.
The Governor said that some are trying to say that the rupee depreciation has resulted in the crash of the economy and this is not at all a reality.
Coomaraswamy said that the agriculture sector too has picked up and also other dynamics are falling in to place and the Sri Lankan economy which grew at 3.8% in the first half will pass the 4% mark in the second half and pick up further, he added.
With appropriate policy adjustments, inflation is expected to remain within the 4-6 per cent target range over the medium term.
Governor also said that the Monetary Board at its meeting held on October yesterday, decided to maintain policy interest rates at their current levels. Accordingly, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank will remain at 7.25 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively.
The Board arrived at the above decision after carefully considering current and expected developments in the domestic and global economy, with the aim of stabilising inflation at mid-single digit levels in the medium term to support growth.
Deputy Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said that Indonesia has used up over USD 13 billion in foreign-currency reserves in the first eight months of t 2018 but have seen the currency losing almost 10% highlighting that such measures may not always avert a currency slide.
The U.S Federal Reserve has increased interest rates 8 times since December 2015 bringing to a gradual close a period of easy money flowing into emerging and frontier markets like Sri Lanka. Most of the other Central Banks globally have signalled a similar direction in terms of monetary policy.

Chief Justice Priyasath Dep PC has appointed three High Court judges to the Second Permanent High Court at Bar to hear high profile financial frauds and corruption cases, informed sources told the Daily News yesterday.
The second special Trial at Bar will comprise High Court judges Rathnapriya Gurusinghe (President),Amal Ranaraja and Sashi Mahendran .
Rathnapriya Gurusinghe is presently serving as Commercial High Court judge while Amal Ranaraja and Shashi Mahendran are serving as Negombo High Court Judge and Colombo High Court judge respectively.

SRI LANKA SHOULD HAVE AN EXPORT  DRIVEN ECONOMY
In case of Sri Lanka, total exports per year is about USD 10. 5 billion.
Our total imports per year is about USD 19.5 billion per year.
Trade balance is USD 9 billion.
This is very big problem. We must increase our total exports.
Our main export products are the following.
Tea, apparel, rubber and rubber based products, gems, coconut based products, vegetables and fish. We have to look after our industries. Very often they are unable to compete with cheap foreign products. Some protection is essential.
We have to do a lot to attract foreign investors. Foreign investors are harassed by corrupt officers and red tape. They should be one common office to get their paperwork done quickly. We get foreign exchange from tourist industry and foreign employment. We must try to improve the tourist industry by providing a very good service to tourists. We must treat them very well and protect them from various racketeers. Our sisters working in Middle East countries bring lot of valuable foreign exchange to this country.
We spend the money they earn to buy luxury cars and to go around the world. Unfortunately we always forget the contribution these ladies make to our country. We do very little for the welfare of these female workers. Do they have any social recognition in our society
Countries like Thailand and Vietnam are not much affected by the present global economic crisis as they fully depend on exports.
We have failed to increase our exports. We increase our imports by importing luxury cars and luxury items. We also use foreign exchange for foreign trips.
Unnecessary government expenditure has to be controlled at least for two years. High income earners and politicians should be socially conscious to help this country by not spending large amount of foreign exchange on luxury vehicles and on foreign trips.

Sulawesis  tsunami  puzzles  scientists
FRANCE: The tsunami that ravaged the Indonesian city of Palu was outsized compared to the earthquake that spawned it, but other factors -- including a long, narrow bay -- conspired to create monster waves, scientists say.
At least 1,200 people are already known to have died in the disaster, and officials say that toll is likely to rise -- perhaps into the thousands.
The 7.5-magnitude quake, which struck early evening on Friday -- a time when many in the Muslim-majority country would have been at the mosque -- brought buildings down all over Palu and its surrounding area.
But it was an unlikely confluence of geophysical conditions that gave rise to a localised tsunami that washed away many other structures and certainly added to the human cost.
The waves were at least two-to-three metres high, and possibly twice that, said Jane Cunneen, a research fellow at Curtin Universitys Faculty of Science and Engineering in Bentley, Western Australia, and an architect of the Indian Oceans tsunami warning system, developed under UN guidance.
Judging by the earthquake, however, the tsunami shouldnt have been nearly that big.
In the overwhelming majority of cases, tsunamis are generated by so-called thrust earthquakes, which create a large vertical displacement of the seafloor, said Baptiste Gombert, an expert on tectonics at Oxford Universitys department of earth sciences. The Palu tsunami, by contrast, was generated by a strike-slip fault, where chunks of Earths crust move over or under each other along a horizontal plane.
Strike-slip faults are less likely to generate tsunamis, as they dont uplift the seafloor too much, said Cunneen.
So what caused the deadly waves At least three factors, experts told AFP.
One is the singularly long channel of ocean water dead-ending at the low-lying city of Palu.
The shape of the bay definitely played a major role in amplifying the size of the waves, said Anne Socquet, an earthquake expert at the Institute of Earth Sciences in Grenoble who has studied the regions seismic faults.

Surreal mixture of ballpoint art
After going through a collection of ballpoint art done recently by Chandana Ranaweera, I found that he has improved by leaps and bounds. His recent sketches of Gods, lovers, raban players, drummers, dancers, funny faces of men and women, decorations, waves, houses, trees, shapes and lines, boats and tripods remind me of what Franz Kafka said about Picasso's art.
Picasso only registers the deformities which have not yet penetrated our consciousness. Art is a mirror which goes fast like a watch  sometimes.
Chandana Ranaweera
Having viewed the paintings of a wide range of Sri Lankan and foreign artists, I feel Chandana belongs to a class of his own. This is because he has not attempted to copy the style of any other artist. He has evolved his own style using only ballpoint pens of different colours. More than a decade ago, I reviewed his exhibition of paintings held in Colombo. At that time I referred to him as a ballpoint artist  pure and simple. However, I find that he has widened his horizon subject-wise and created marvellous pieces of art which appeal more to the brain that to the heart.
Having taught art as a school teacher Chandana devotes his life giving vent to his pent-up feelings. I have not seen any of his water-colour, oil or acrylic paintings. He seems to be wedded to ballpoint pens and paper leaving aside the palette and the brush. An artist needs not necessarily use traditional raw materials such as watercolours, acrylic and oil paint. A creative artist can use a pen, pencil or even a piece of charcoal to give expression to his feelings.
Living away from the bustling city of Colombo, Chandana is not in a position to hold regular exhibitions of his paintings. It does not mean that he should give up his vocation. As a genuine artist, he breaks new ground every time he puts pen to paper. Some of his creations show his inner feelings about art in a fast-changing world where almost everybody is running behind fame and power. His Hathares Minisa (Square man) has a touch of Picasso's style. It has been done with a black ballpoint pen reminding the viewer that every man's life is mysterious to a point. He has captured man's suffering too in the painting.
In the painting titled Vrushaba Maranaya (The death of a bull) we see to men armed with weapons attacking a defenceless bull with the intention of killing it and selling its flesh. The dumb animal remains helpless. It serves to drive home the point that men and even animals are victims of the immanent will of God. Buddhists may call it kammic forces that drive them from birth to death and beyond.
His painting titled Pem Yuvala (Lovers) has its own charm and depth of meaning. The lovers sit very close to each other and they are holding hands. With a few dexterous lines Chandana has recreated the grandeur of human love not tainted with lust. In a world full of lustful activities innocent and true love appears to be something of the past.
The Sithar Vadakaya (Sitar Player) sits erect and plays the instrument as if he is in a trance. The sitar is a difficult musical instrument to play and it is used mostly in classical music. The background shows curved lines to depict musical notes that come out of the instrument. It is a beautiful painting to look at.
In another painting titled Vrushaba Minis Adaraya (Love between man and bull) we see a man more or less praying to a bull for succour. The man appears to be an innocent villager who has numerous problems. He has no one to tell his story of woes except the bull who appears to listen to him. In a way, the bull symbolizes the authorities who remain deaf and dumb when poor people come to them for relief.
Hopefully, Chandana will do some more creations with his ballpoint pens to enrich art in his retirement.

Task platform - an opportunity for SMEs, skilled persons
Two software engineers and a hospitality industry professional have come together to set up a fully pledged interactive platform, creating a space for those who want to get professional services done and for those who want to market their skills and abilities.
Rakkitha Kumarage is a hospitality industry professional who also studied abroad. His two partners Isuru Gihan and Udara Dilhan are software graduates of the Moratuwa University. They hail from the same locality and have been friends from their childhood.
When they met as adults, they often had discussions about various economic issues and how they could put their knowledge and skills into use to support less privileged ones. They were researching for a solution to reduce the ever-increasing cost of living in Sri Lanka.
Then we found out there are 7.1 million (46.2%) people of working age population is in the economically inactive due to various reasons such as higher studies, household chores and not having enough opportunities to offer their services. At the same time we found out there are lot of people who wanted to get done various professional and skilled services. This gave us the opportunity to create a platform to bring these two parties together, said Rakkitha Kumarage. Etasker is an interactive platform that combines these two segments together that didnt exist previously in Sri Lanka, he added.
Since then they were working on a project to set up Etasker.lk, the platform of services. Anyone can use this platform to outsource, and to offer services. People have already started using our platform and we have taken measure to protect information and privacy of those who use the site,: says Gihan talking about security measures.
With Etasker, those who work on a full-time basis- but still have extra hours also can make money by offering their services. For instance, those who want to get the services of a carpenter can easily find one through our platform. There are no hidden charges involved. The transaction is strictly between the two parties, Gihan said.
Dilhan said, you can also find online marketplaces dedicated to specific areas such as education, jobs and retail goods. Their focus is on the main largest assets you have; house, car and a full-time job. Exchange of ownership is the concept of many of those- in simply, monetising your home by giving it to someone else.
However, with the introduction of the shared economy, people started to monetise their assets to gain incremental revenue. Uber and Airbnb are the advents in this category followed by other small-scale players globally and locally.
Rakkitha says, Gig economy may be an alien word for many of Sri Lankans, however, there are a large number of Sri Lankans who belongs to Gen Z is working on global gig platforms such as Fiverr and Upwork. Gig economy relates to temporary work (also called odd jobs) refers to an employment situation where the working arrangement is limited to a certain period of time-based on the needs of the employing organization.Etasker is a platform uses the gig concept, however, adopted to Sri Lanka market.
Etasker is re-imagining how labour exchange in the real world. We are not in the plan of taking existing labour and categorising them into segments. We want people to re-imagine how labour could utilise. Imagine you need to fix a TV antenna. However, you do not need to find a certified TV technician. It could be fixed by the person next door who is having general knowledge of antennas.
This is where Etasker helps you. We have hundreds of taskers registered with us who are willing to monetise their skills to help you out with everyday jobs. The taskers are vetted by using a mobile gateway. We are planning to substantially increase the verification requirements by using police checks, certifications, etc. when moving forward, Rakkitha said.

Train commuters complain over fares
Although the Railway Department stated that the train fares have gone up only by 15 percent, commuters have complained that some train ticket fares have gone up by as much as 40 percent.
The new train fares, revised under the Budget Proposal for 2018, were effective from October 1 onwards.
According to the new fare revision, train fares were increased by 15 percent. Commuters complained that in addition to the daily fares, the season ticket prices have also gone up drastically. Accordingly, the season ticket price which was Rs.420 earlier has been increased to Rs.720. The Rs. 600 and Rs.3360 season ticket prices have gone up to Rs. 960 and Rs.4,320 respectively.
According to the price formula, the Rs.100 ticket should have been priced at Rs.115, but it has been priced at Rs.135. Many commuters who expected only a Rs.15 increase in train fares have been inconvenienced as a result of the higher than expected fares.
However,in rounding up the fares, differing distances between various stations has caused this situation,a Railway Department spokesman said.

Trump hails US-Canada -Mexico trade pact
President Donald Trump on Monday (Oct 1) hailed a US trade pact with Canada and Mexico, which replaces the old NAFTA deal, as a historic agreement set to turn North America back into a manufacturing powerhouse and fuel US economic expansion.
Governing almost US$1.2 trillion in trade, the pact known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, is the most important trade deal weve ever made by far, Trump told a White House press conference.
The agreement first announced late Sunday, just before a midnight deadline, ended more than a year of tense negotiations sparked by Trumps decision to scrap the quarter-century old North American Free Trade Agreement.
Trumps aggressive tearing up of long-standing US trade deals - with everyone from its two huge neighbors to China and the European Union - has rattled world leaders and sparked fears of economic turmoil.
But in a buoyant performance at his Rose Garden news conference, Trump said the approach of using harsh tariffs to force countries into renegotiating unfair deals had been vindicated.
The United States in its trade deals has lost on average almost US$800 billion a year. Thats dealing with China, dealing with European Union, with everybody, Japan, Mexico, Canada, everybody, he said.
USMCA is said by analysts to be similar to NAFTA in many respects but there is improved access for US agricultural goods, including the dairy products which Canada in particular had tried to limit.
New rules are designed to improve US auto workers competitiveness, with 40 per cent of each car required to have been made by people earning at least US$16 an hour. The US had also sought increased American content for duty-free autos.
Trump said the new framework will encourage US companies to hire at home, rather than look abroad.
It will transform North America back into a manufacturing powerhouse, he said. USMCA will allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off-shored to the world because of unfair trade issues.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has embraced the new deal, his incoming foreign minister said.
It will allow us to maintain the competitiveness of the Mexican manufacturing industry, which will keep its access to the worlds largest market, Marcelo Ebrard told a press conference.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces anger from dairy farmers but told journalists on Monday that the deal overall would be profoundly beneficial for our economy and the most important progressive reform for North American workers in a generation.
Stock markets rose on news of the agreement, with the Dow Jones in New York up 1.0 per cent in late morning, just shy of a record high.
For Trump, the USMCA is only the start of what he says is a global push-back against countries taking advantage of the US economy.
Talking up the new accord, Trump declared it a privilege for foreign powers to do business with the United States.
And Im not talking about Mexico, Canada. Im talking about everybody. Everybody, he said.
Its a privilege for China to do business with us. Its a privilege for the European Union.
Pointing to his combative attitude towards China - which is now locked in an escalating trade war with the United States - Trump said his strategy was bearing fruit. China wants to talk very badly, he said.
Likewise, he claimed that India - which he described as the tariff king - wants to start trade talks with the United States immediately.
In all three countries, the new USMCA trade pact must be ratified by lawmakers.
Trump immediately set about selling the idea to voters ahead of November congressional elections that could see the legislature taken by Democrats, putting approval for USMCA at risk.
In Trumps view, the new deal and promise of more around the world show that he has kept his campaign promise of putting America first.
As I say, the United States is respected again, he told the press conference.
But a Democrat-controlled Congress might be willing to throw one of the great deals for people and the workers. They may be willing to do that for political purposes, he said.
The AFL-CIO, a Washington-based federation representing millions of unionised employees, said it was too early to make a final judgment on the new deals impact on working people.

Turkey to provide more assistance to Sr Lanka
Turkish Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tunca Ozcuhadar said yesterday, that Turkey is ready to continue supporting Sri Lankas development projects and also provide technical and humanitarian assistance.
He stated that Turkey provides assistance to a number of countries around the world through the (Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency) TIKA, Turkish Red Crescent Society and several Turkish NGOs.
The Ambassador was speaking at a ceremony to donate a 3D printer to the Peradeniya University Agriculture Faculty at the Turkish Embassy premises.
Ambassador Ozcuhadar said that the donation was aimed at improving knowledge among the youth and allowing them to find better jobs.
Our humanitarian assistance policy is development-oriented. While providing humanitarian aid such as delivering food and medicine to a country in need, Turkey will also simultaneously facilitate capacity building programmes, construct essential infrastructure and providing education, sanitation and health services, he added.
Turkey has already undertaken a housing project in Mannar and has already built 100 houses as a first stage while 450 houses already built for Tsunami victims in the Southern Province. We have engaged in providing financial assistance for the repairing of water dams in several areas while donating computers and construing medical centers in several schools islandwide, the Turkish Ambassador said.
He further said that Turkey is a strong advocate of international solidarity and partnership and that Turkey provided US$ 8 billion worth humanitarian and technical assistance world-wide in 2017. We believe that a country can truly archive a sustainable growth only through development-oriented assistance.
By donating a 3D printer to the Peradeniya University, Turkey could help Sri Lankan youth acquire vital skills and enrich the workforce in Sri Lanka.

UNHRC Social Forum begins
This years United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Social Forum began on Monday in Geneva, with Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez as the Chairperson-Rapporteur, alongside Human Rights High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet and Council President Vogislav Suc. This three-day Forum will address the possibilities of promoting human rights as well as the strengthening of universal respect.
Ambassador Azeez said, This Forum has served as an inclusive platform for multi-stakeholders and has enabled deep reflection, among participants, on important themes that could promote diverse aspects of intersectionality between human rights and society.
He said that at a time when every norm and value on which the UN, international order, and multilateralism stood was being put to the test in todays globalised yet volatile world, the Social Forum enabled the exchange of diverse perspectives aimed to strengthen and elaborate such norms and values.
High Commissioner Bachelet highlighted the importance of sports as a tool for social empowerment.
Ambassador Suc also addressed the opening session.
This years Social Forum consists of nine sessions followed by dialogues covering wider range of themes such as Sports, Human Solidarity and Universal Values for All Humanity; Sports and the Equal Rights of Men and Women; Inclusivity, Equality and Non-Discrimination in Sport; Sports, Sustainable Cities and the Right to an Adequate Standard of Living; Sports for Sustainable Development and Sustained Peace; and Youth, Children and Future Generations.
A documentary created by the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation on how sports and sports-persons impact society in our journey to peace and reconciliation was screened.
The Forum will end with a musical presentation by the UN Music Team titled a World Premiere Racing for Peace, which symbolises Sri Lankans desire and commitment for lasting peace and advancement of human rights.

UNP awaits  Attorney Generals  decision on Ravi
The UNP awaits a decision from the Attorney General to arrive at a conclusion about former Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando yesterday said.
A decision should be given soon by the Attorney General with reference to former Minister Karunanayake. He may be held responsible or be cleared, whatever the decision does not matter, what matters is that we receive some form of a decision soon. It is not fair to keep him in suspense. He is a person who has contributed immensely to form this government. It is wrong to act in a manner that would affect his political career, Minister Fernando said.
He made these observations in reply to a question whether the government is considering giving a ministerial portfolio to MP Ravi Karunanayake, at a press brief held at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters, yesterday afternoon.
When allegations were levelled against the Former Minister, we as a party and me individually stood against him, and criticised him. Now, when he is unfairly treated, we have to stand up for him as well. Fernando further said.

Unqualified SAITM students creating obstacles - Alwis
SAITM students have been absorbed by the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) but 34 students who did not possess the required basic qualifications to study medicine could not gain entrance.
But, the first, second and third batches of SAITM students have not entered the KDU due to certain reasons, Media Spokesman of the Parents Union of the State Medical Students Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the three student batches have refrained from joining the KDU because they are unable to sit and pass the examination required for this purpose after clinical training. The second reason is that they do not possess the minimum qualifications to enter the KDU.
According to Alwis, SAITM students who do not have even three simple passes (3 S) at the G.C.E.Advanced Level Examination in the Science Stream are now trying to prevent those qualified SAITM students in their group from entering the KDU and obtaining a medical degree. Therefore, the parents of these qualified students should come forward against this injustice.
Recently,the media reported that 83 SAITM students had the Sri Lanka Medical Council to register them as doctors, but only a few SAITM students had come on that day.
The SAITM is an illegal fraudulent institution and this fact had been proved on several occasions during the past. Now, it is up to the authorities to end the issue in keeping with the KDU Act, Alwis added.

Voices of Peace demands to be heard
The room was packed beyond capacity during the Voices of Peace book launch at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute recently, with politicians, clergymen, activists, and citizens.
Voices of Peace aims to strengthen and support peace and reconciliation processes in Sri Lanka. The book, written by Sarah Kabir with photographs by Munira Mutaher, and Tamil translation by Sophia Mahendran, is a collection of oral histories from 10 former LTTE cadres and 10 Sri Lankan military personnel who fought on opposing sides in Sri Lankas three-decade long conflict.
Using personal stories from both sides, Voices of Peace asks its readers to reexamine reconciliation through the lens of combatants, who may see the differences between themselves less starkly than Sri Lankas politicians or society does.
Kabir, 29, says that it took her between eight to 12 months to collect the 60 interviews that ultimately informed this book. She says she shared really deep conversations, about the worst sort of things, which Kabir says is not even the most difficult part of the process. Instead, she says, the worst part of the process is that at one point you get numb to the stories.
Speakers praised and analysed Kabirs work at the event. It fills a vacuum, said Dr. Jehan Perera, Executive Director at the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, who moderated the discussion. He praised the fact that she gives the stories of those who fought on opposing sides, and that she tried to do justice to those stories. On occasion, she went back five times to get a more complete version of the story.
More critical praise came from guest speaker Aranya Rajasingam, a Womens Rights and Peace Activist, who said this book is an attempt to understand what we dont know. Isnt it strange that we live in a country where people sought refuge in the military outfits, only to be sent to their death She offered that perhaps the way that Kabir chose to format the stories made it harder for readers to empathise with them.
Kabir also shared quotes from the book, including one by 50-year-old Sanjeewa: Our stories help to keep a record for future generations. If we dont, all these things get burnt with us when we die.
Tamil and Sinhalese translations of Voices of Peace are currently in progress, as well as an online publication of the book. It will be available at all major bookstores.
Attendees of the book launch included State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva, and Minister of Justice and Prison Reforms Thalatha Athukorala. Former Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa attended, along with UPFA leaders Namal Rajapaksa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara. Ven. Dambara Amila Thera of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Ven. Banagala Upathissa Nayake Thera attended the launch. The Ambassadors of Germany and Switzerland also attended.

China highly professional  in development assistance
China has been prompt and highly professional in the selection of projects and disbursement of funds, which otherwise was lengthy and time consuming in other multi-lateral and bi-lateral relationships, said Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
He was addressing an economic forum on the Belt and Road Initiative held in Chengdu, China, recently.
As Sri Lanka was able to mobilise Chinese support in time, Sri Lanka was able to overcome the recent escalation of prices, he said.
He added that most developing countries have increased their debt burden in relation to international multi-lateral and bi-lateral lenders. China has played a positive role in suggesting a conversion of debt to equity in many of the projects that were launched with Chinese assistance, the minister said.
The future will therefore, be more complex in the realization of investment for infrastructure development. While the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and AIIB have enhanced their lending capacity, many borrowers are inhibited by the debt ceilings imposed either by the IMF or by their own budgetary constraints. Recent developments in the areas of trade and commerce, with the imposition of new tariffs and trade embargos, will finally affect the development efforts of the poorer nations.
I suggest that we appoint a high level group of eminent persons to examine ways and means of overcoming their debt difficulties, said Minister Amunugama.
The minister said Sri Lanka is strategically located in South Asia and is known as the Pearl of the Orient. Chinese President Xi Jinping at the inaugural meeting of the Belt and Road initiative said Sri Lanka is not only the Pearl of the Orient but also the Pearl of the Belt and Road initiative, the minister added.
Sri Lanka and China have had close and friendly relations since the establishment of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). We were the first country in South Asia to recognize the PRC established under Chairman Mao Zedong. Soon after that, we entered into the Rice-Rubber pact with China even though many other countries imposed embargos and isolated China. Our two countries have never lost sight of such solidarity and Sri Lanka is grateful to China for its help in varying fields, especially in infrastructure development, the minister said.
He said China is Sri Lankas major bilateral donor partner. China has provided funds and expertise for many crucial infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka.
China financed and constructed a new harbour in Hambantota, a new international airport in Mattala, Port City of Colombo where approximately 300 hectares of land is reclaimed from the sea, a 600 megawatt coal power plant in Norochcholai and several super highways which connect all parts of the country. Some super highways, especially the new highway to Kandy, is now under construction and the extension of the road and railway from Colombo to Hambantota is significant, he said.
All the more reason then, for all developing countries to act together, improve their infrastructure and productivity, and find new and efficient means of utilizing their natural and human resources.
The Belt and Road initiative (B & R) helps us with its emphasis on international solidarity, inter-connectivity and the best uses of our natural resources. At a time of growing instability and isolationism, the initiative tells us that all can win and no one should be left behind.
We in Sri Lanka have benefitted from that initiative and would like to join all our fellow nations in helping the B & R initiative to grow for the benefit of all mankind, the minister said.

Flooding had become common in urban areas, and it was the responsibility of local government bodies to prevent it, Water Resource Management and Disaster Management Minister Palitha Range Bandara said.
He was addressing a meeting held on Monday, at the Anamaduwa United National Party office.
According to research carried out by the Disaster Management Ministry, it was revealed that unauthorised constructions set up near rivers and tanks were one of the main causes for floods, he said and added that over 90 percent of compensation for disaster victims was due to complications caused by them.
The state minister highlighted the importance of demolishing illegal constructions without considering the political backgrounds of the people who own them. He added that the local government bodies had the authority to remove them.
State Minister Bandara said that solid waste in drains had increased due to such constructions.
It is a result of inefficient administration of local government bodies, he added.

NEED FOR AN EQUITABLE AND  PEOPLE FRIENDLY TAX REGIME
Far reaching fundamental changes have been done to the tax structure of the country in the recent past. It is true that laws have to evolve and change to suit the changing socio economic environment.
The new tax law among other things aim at widening the the tax net in the country.
While acknowledging the numerous good features in the new system one has to recognise the need for fine tuning and making the system more equitable.
WITHHOLDING TAX
Withholding tax (WHT) is a method to collect taxes with ease and speed. It is an effective and less expensive way of revenue collection for tax administration. WHT is the mechanism used by most countries to retain the tax on cross boarder payments subject to any Double Tax Avoidance Agreements.
Currently, in the domestic front, WHT tax is applicable on employment income, interest, rents, fees, partnership income etc. WHT on rent is liable on any amount even, Rs. 2,000 per month. Even if the income of land lord is less than the statutory tax free allowance of Rs. 500,000 still WHT has to be deducted. There are no provisions to get directions from the Department to stop such deductions. One segment of the society is charged with income tax though their income is less than statutory tax free limit making an inequitable element in the current system. Therefore, there is a need to stipulate a minimum limit such as Rs. 50,000 per month for rent for WHT purpose.
WHT on fees also needs to be revisited. Currently a fee of Rs. 50,000 or more paid to an individual or proprietorship business will be subject to a WHT of 5%. This person may not be an income tax liable person getting an income exceeding Rs. 500,000 per year.
The Rs.50,000 - payment may even be a one off payment. If a single person provide his services through a proprietorship he is subject to WHT while two or more people provide services through a partnership or a company such fees are not subject to WHT. This can be amended to say if fees in aggregate of Rs. 500,000 or more per annum paid to a person it should be liable for WHT in the following period and broadened to cover all businesses or proprietorships be exempted along with other businesses.
Similarly partnership income is also liable to WHT irrespective of the amount. Earlier there was a limit of Rs. 1,000,000 for a partnership to be liable for income tax. Presently no such tax free limits exist and even an income of say Rs. 5,000 will be liable to WHT at 8%.
If a partnership business earns an income of Rs. 1,100,000 in 2017/18, the partnership tax liability is Rs. 8,000. If this partnership has the same income for 2018/19, it will be liable to a tax of Rs. 88,000 in the form of WHT in other words income tax. If the partners do not have any other income and the profit is shared equally there will be an over payment of Rs. 80,000. Start up entrepreneurs will be in difficulties if no minimum limit is not set for WHT on partnership income.
Thus some of the provisions of the law may hinder informal sector of the economy and stifle the economic growth in the medium to long-term.
ECONOMIC SERVICE CHARGE
Economic Service Charge (ESC) was introduced in 2004 to recover some tax in lieu of income tax from those entities who were exempt from income tax and those who were declaring loses in the accounts. In fact this was done to recover loss of revenue due to tax exemptions, tax evasions and avoidance during that period.
Though ESC is related to turnover the intention was to collect a tax where income tax is not paid. Later ESC was made liable for even profit making entities. However, ESC was allowed to be deductible from income tax liability.
ESC could be carried forward and set off for 4 years against income tax. Also there was a maximum limit of Rs. 250,000,000 for ESC liability. The intention of the law was to facilitate deductions of ESC to a large extent from income tax. According to current ESC regime there is no maximum limit on ESC liability. ESC carried forward is allowed only for 3 years. Further, the rate has been raised to 0.5% on the turnover of almost all business entities with the turnover of more than Rs. 12,500,000 per quarter.
The component of ESC which cannot be deductible from income tax becomes a cost for business and in turn this may be passed on to customers ESC which started with the features of income tax (Direct tax) is increasingly becoming an indirect tax such as VAT and NBT. Tax like this on exports may affect the competitiveness of our exports in the highly competitive international market. There is an urgent need to revisit the current ESC regime.
INCOME TAX
Under earlier system exports income were subject to concessionary tax rates. Under the present system a person who exports more than 80% of the turnover only is entitled for a concessionary rate. Any business entity starts exporting initially on a small way. Such exports become liable to Income Tax at the rate of 24%.
TAX PAYER RIGHTS
Tax payers are the ones who contribute to the coffers of the government enabling the smooth running of the state. In the process Tax payers do not get any direct benefit in return. In this context it is very important to give due consideration for the rights of the tax payers.
If tax payers do not send a valid appeal against an assessment due to some reasons, earlier law provided for an objection against taxes in default. This facility has been taken away under the current law. Interest on tax in disputes can be as high as 20% per annum. The penalty imposed on non-compliance are prohibitively high in many instances.
People who are within the tax system and pay taxes must not be treated very harshly. The Commissioner General must be given powers to determine interest and penalties fairly under just and equitable circumstances.
TAX PRACTITIONERS
Tax practitioners, mostly Chartered Accountants and Lawyers are providing a yeoman service in this country. Most of the tax payers are ignorant about our complex tax system. Tax practitioners are the ones bridging the gap between tax payers and Inland Revenue, enabling smooth revenue collection in the country. Chartered Accountants and Lawyers are bound by their professional code of ethics in discharging their professional duties.
In this context the new requirement for practitioners to sign the tax return of tax payers has put them in a dilemma. They provide their services based on information provided by the taxpayer. If we take an individual tax return, an individual is required to provide even the information about his or her jewellery. How can a practitioner verify such information, in this context it will not be fair to expect the practitioners to certify the return.
All in all the new Inland Revenue Act No.24 of 2017 is a step in the right direction. However, as this is a complete repeal of the old income tax law in the country, teething issues must be expected and addressed to in suitable manner by way of introducing appropriate amendments as we evolve under new Inland Revenue Act.

New laws crucial to  capitalise on investments
The introduction of digital laws is crucial to capitalise on investments made by the government to digitise state institutions, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said.
He was addressing the media during a meeting held at Sirikotha, yesterday.
Minister Fernando added that digital infrastructure platforms had already been established at most state institutions; however, institutions had shown reluctance to adopt those methods. It was imperative that the all state institutions adhered to the system, he added.
Some institutions said they would like to establish their own digital systems, while some did not want to adhere to it. Due to these weaknesses in adaptation, the process has been delayed, the minister said.
The government has made significant investments for this process. If we are to reap the benefits of it, it is important that we introduce digital laws. The Digital Infrastructure Ministry should be given the power to implement it. When state institutions, by law, are required to adhere to the digitisation process, its implementation would be fruitful, Minister Fernando added.
Taking India as an example, Minister Fernando highlighted that the portfolio of Law and Order, Judiciary and Digital infrastructure was held by a single minister.
When the Indian Digital infrastructure Minister visited Sri Lanka, I had a discussion with him regarding the issues we have. It was clear that coordination was easier when the same minister held the judiciary and the digital infrastructure portfolios, the minister said.
The concept of digitisation was still new to Sri Lanka, particularly to the state sector, he said and added that it was necessary to encourage the use of modern methods.

Accordingly, family members of six victims of hit-and-run accidents were provided financial support worth Rs. 1.2 million while six injured people from such accidents were granted Rs. 6 million financial support by Minister de Silva.
The minister said CCTV cameras should be installed at accident prone areas to identify hit-and-run drivers and implement the law against them.
When I brought new laws to increase fines against errant drivers, some parties opposed it. Therefore, it is necessary to change peoples attitudes to prevent road accidents, the minister said.

Robust development now than MRs time
Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim said the government has done more development work than during the 14-year period of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
During his entire term, only 169 meters of highway were constructed whereas during our three years in power, the government constructed 219 kilometers of highway, the minister said.
The minister said it is by comparing and contrasting that people can truly see the correct picture. The construction work of 3.5 kilometer-long Gadaldeniya - Paranapattiya Road in the Udunuwara electorate commenced last week, he said.
It is a widely known fact that residents were chased away from homes when roads were constructed during the Mahinda Rajapaksa government. This happened even at Hematagama, along Kegalle - Avissawella Road. Even compensation was not paid to the victims who lost their homes and neither were they given houses, he said. On the contrary, the present government has paid Rs. 65,000 million and Rs. 43,000 million for 14,700 plots of land. Not a single individual was displaced from their homes or chased out. That is the difference between the present government and a dictatorial regime, he said.
Under the road development programme, the government has planned to develop 3,130 kilometers of rural roads apart from highway development.
The rupee depreciated because of the colossal foreign debt of Rs. 7,400 billion which was passed on to this government. The present government is not the author of this burdensome legacy. Rather, it is only an unfortunate inheritor, the minister added.

ADB, HNB ink US$ 20 mn deal for Microfinance
HNB PLC, announced the signing of a new partnership agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in order to expand lending and provide guarantees of up to US$ 20 million to support development of Sri Lankas burgeoning microfinance sector.
Arranged under the ADBs Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program, the agreement was signed by ADB Private Sector Financial Institutions Division Senior Investment Specialist Sabine Spohn and HNB Deputy General Manager - SME & Midmarket Jude Fernando at a formal ceremony in Colombo.
HNB is an organization that has long maintained a trusted and prosperous legacy in the microfinance sector. In our experience, access to finance can often be the crucial factor that determines whether a small scale entrepreneur is able to achieve his dream of a thriving business.
Todays agreement between HNB and the ADB is therefore a major step forward in our collective mission to support this vital sector.
When we combine funding with comprehensive advisory services  all of which are heavily slanted to ensure the maximum benefit to the end- customer, we enable fresh economic opportunity in segments that are small, but hold tremendous growth potential.
Partnerships such as these are therefore vital in creating a sustainable trajectory for our nations economy, Fernando stated.
Currently, many microfinance institutions struggle to access funds for growth from the commercial market to meet the demands of clients. Only approximately 17% of women have access to formal financial services in Sri Lanka. Through the Microfinance Program, ADB and HNB aims to fill market gaps by sharing risks to promote local currency lending to these institutions. This helps mitigate microfinance institutions exposure to foreign exchange risks.
We are excited to partner with HNB, an established player in microfinance in Sri Lanka, said Spohn. Our partnership will help further expand the Microfinance Program, which has already facilitated more than $846 million in local currency loans across the region since 2012.

Always  already  alienated
The slow night mail coach to Maddakalappu from Colombo passed through Mannampitiya and was moving towards Welikanda.
I noticed a Sinhala girl smiling with me. I just smiled too without making it obvious. But she was not a middle-aged female for me to respond.
She was, in fact, a grown-up lass with a nice figure.
Until Sellathurai boarded the train at Gal Oya, I was deeply interested in reading the novel by Alberto Moravia. I spent the time chatting with Sellathurai and did not see the time passing Maybe that I didnt see her first.
She was wearing a sarong-like dress leaving ample space bare to see her navel and a jacket. She was really a bombshell.
She must have been listening to the chat Sellathurai and I had had. Thats why we both didnt notice her.
Rest of the passengers were half-asleep and were putting their heads on the shoulders of their neighbours It was not fair to expect them awake at 4.30 in the morning.
Her cheeks became reddish dimples. Her eyelids were moving up and down. Her eyes pierced through mine. At the end of her lips, a faint smile blossomed and bloomed widely over her face. Her chest went up and down-boombudy boom as Sophia Loren sang- I was shy to look at her.
Cha! Shame1.Why should I get enchanted over an ordinary Sinhala girl my thoughts lingered. But again, I comforted that God has created our eyes to appreciate pleasant things. Shedding my arrogance of middle-class superiority, I voluntarily smiled with her. She opened her purple-red lips and showed her pearl-like teeth.
Sellathurai smelt what was going on.
What does that baby want from you, he asked.
 Nothing special. She just smiles. I said.
 Yaa, Ya. She will smile, she sarcastically said in frustration as if he was a saint. What he said made me interested in this girl.
What
Hkum! Look, after these people flooded Amparai, the flirting in Maddakkalappu too has come to stay. The so-called Thamil culture has vanished from the East. Those Tamil girls are imitating the Sinhala girls. They are all falling in love with unknown people
What are you saying Sellathurai You are saying something like a dialogue in a film
He laughed. She laughed. Me too laughed without not allowing my shoulders relaxed as if I am a joker.
What is this Does that Sinhala girl in the train know Thamil for her to laugh I told him in English that she seems to know Thamil, as she too laughed
She giggled in the manner of the sound of a waterfall.
I have been listening to your conversation, he babbled in English.
I am a Tamil too,  when she started talking in Thami, I was flabbergasted.
So, why are you dressed like this, Sellathurai asked her boldly.
Oh, this Thats a big story, she said.
Why dont you tell us briefly, Sellathurai intervened. I looked outside without any purpose. It was dawning rapidly. At a distance, I could see the Vaalaichenai Paper factory profusely illuminated. The train was pacing through the Oddamaavadi bridge. In one hours time, I could step down on the soil of the Singing Fish. The landscape was green with beautiful vistas. It reminded me of the ancient Tamils five kinds of lands.
Sellathurai distracted my attention saying Listen, Chum, sister wants to tell us her story
I didnt reply him turning my face from the window and looked only at the face of Sellathurai. I felt shy to look at her. She was narrating: My name is Vijaya Malar. Studying in Colombo. There was a fancy-dress competition in our school. I took part as a pretty Sinhala girl
I received a telegram that my mother was sick and to come to Maddakkalppu immediately. I didnt have time I change into a new dress. No time to pack my luggage. Only a few minutes were left to catch the train. So, I rushed to the station with this dress.
I learn that this family was going Maddakkalappu. So, I joined with them. The family she showed was a Sinhala family. I noticed that most of the passengers on the train was Sinhalese.
Where do you live in Batti Lake Road  Sellathurai and that girl were chatting with each other enormously.
I was patiently listening to their conversation. I was dumbstruck. Maybe I was enchanted with the look of the girl.
Sellathurai who spoke disparagingly of her at first was now eagerly conversing with her. That was not surprising. The girl who smiled with me at first ignored me now thinking perhaps that I was useless., Bothe were all agog laughing and chatting. Both of them ignored me totally.
After all birds of a feather will flock together.
The train stopped at the Maddakkalppu railway station. They were still chatting. I got down and walked out of the station.

Bodies found in ruins of quake-hit church
INDONESIA: The bodies of dozens of students have been pulled from their landslide-swamped church in Sulawesi, officials said Tuesday, as an international effort to help nearly 200,000 increasingly desperate Indonesian quake-tsunami victims ground into gear.
The discovery adds to the already-high death toll from Fridays disaster, when a powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami that smashed into the seaside city of Palu.
At least 844 people are already known to have died, but officials say that number is certain to rise -- perhaps into the thousands -- as isolated communities are reached and the scale of the disaster becomes clearer.
Survivors are battling thirst and hunger, with food and clean water in short supply, and local hospitals are overwhelmed by the number of injured.
Some survivors clambered through detritus hunting for anything salvageable, some crowded around daisy-chained power strips at the few buildings that still have power, others queued for water, cash or petrol being brought in via armed police convoy.
The government, the President have come here, but what we really need is food and water, Burhanuddin Aid Masse, 48, told AFP.
Rescue efforts have been hampered by a lack of heavy machinery, severed transport links, the scale of the damage, and the Indonesian governments reluctance to accept foreign help.
As if to remind the world of the tectonic fragility of Indonesia, a series of quakes rocked the country Tuesday morning, albeit hundreds of kilometres from Palu.

CCPIT, IBC TEAM UP FOR PROMOTING  SINO  LANKA TRADE, TOURISM
The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) of Beijing and the International Business Council (IBC) of Sri Lanka have teamed up in an ambitious move to promote imports/ exports and tourism between the two countries through a strategy of online marketing which would be absolutely free.
This would be a huge boon for Sri Lankan exporters and importers as well as tourism companies to access Chinese companies, which will be the home to a billion plus market, President of the International Business Council, Kosala Wickramanayake said in a media release.
He said that there would be limitless opportunities to Sri Lankan exporters of black tea, apparel, gems and jewellery, spice and spice related products among a host of others. There will be also limitless opportunities for importing Chinese products which should be cost competitive as well, he said.
He also stressed that there would be further opportunities for promoting Chinese tourists into Sri Lanka given that there were 130 million Chinese tourists who were outbound in 2017, reporting a 7% increase Year on Year and that they had spent US$ 115 billion, which was a 5% increase over the previous year.
The release further said, The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Beijing Sub-Council has created eShow Global, a free online trade show/expo and marketing platform for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to exhibit their products and services. It also has a section for cities to promote local business and tourism to the world. The online platform is free of charge for enterprises and cities to post their products and services in the form of pictures and videos; it also allows users to post links to their own website.
It has globally distributed cloud hosting servers that solve the problem of access limitation. The free and automatic switching among 50 languages in the system can eliminate language barriers and covers over 80% of the countries in the world. With its long-term cooperation and collaboration with over 400 global news media, eShow Global will help SMEs achieve global visibility, recognition and influence.
As an important supplement to physical exhibitions, CCPIT Beijing hopes that the online platform will help address the challenges of cross-border trade faced by SMEs caused by cultural differences among various countries, regions and peoples.
eShow Global is not only an online trade show/expo without borders, but also offers enterprises a new channel for marketing. Online self-marketing through the platform marketing tools, such as social media sharing and following, targeted product marketing, keyword searching etc. enable SMEs to reduce high marketing costs.
There are plans to host a series of special online shows/expo such as Global Industry Expo, Theme Expo, Regional Expo and City Expo.
Currently the platform is open for businesses and city governments to register and upload both graphics and video content to the online platform. It was officially and fully released on September 5, 2018.

CEAT marks 25 years with Good Drivers Save Lives campaign
After two and a half decades in Sri Lanka, a leading tyre brand CEAT has a message for the countrys motorists and has taken to the streets to deliver it.
Good Drivers Save Lives is the theme of an emotive new campaign that seeks to persuade drivers and riders to drive carefully on the islands roads, which claim around 3,000 lives every year.
Launched to mark the CEAT brands 25th anniversary in Sri Lanka, the campaign involves the free distribution of 20,000 vehicle stickers with those four words, with the hope that it will drive home the message that sensible driving is not just about avoiding traffic fines and penalties, but about saving lives.
Safety is a paramount element in every product we manufacture, said Ravi Dadlani, Managing Director of CEAT Kelani Holdings, the company that manufactures nearly half of Sri Lankas pneumatic tyre requirements.
That is why road safety has been the focus of one of our principal community engagements for many years, and why we chose this theme for this milestone anniversary. Something needs to be done urgently to reduce the shocking loss of life on our roads.
To spread the word, CEAT has partnered with Sitha FM and offered a generous incentive including a chance to win eight air tickets to Singapore, to those who help propagate the message by displaying the sticker on their vehicles.
The seven-week campaign kicked off with sticker distribution activities in Colombo 6 and Havelock Town, using eight sandwich board men to grab the attention of motorists. Those who undertook to display the stickers on their vehicles received gifts of umbrellas, CEAT Racing caps and key chains. Each Good Drivers Save Lives sticker has a unique serial number, which when sent to a designated number via SMS or WhatsApp, makes the vehicle owner eligible to participate in a draw for the air tickets.
Sticker distribution is scheduled to take place throughout September and October in several locations, including Peliyagoda, Gampaha town, Kandy town and Kurunegala town, the Company said.
Additionally, the campaign is to be supported by two mobile clinics at which motorists can have their vehicles checked up free of charge by the renowned motor mechanic Lal Alawatte; the first in Kandy on October 12 at the premises of M. J. R. Peiris and Sons and the second in Colombo on October 20 at U&H Wheels, Colombo 2. Motorists who participate will receive discount vouchers that can be redeemed on their next purchase of CEAT tyres.
Notably, promoting road safety has been a key community initiative of CEAT Kelani Holdings for the past ten years, with an emphasis on schools children, their parents and the drivers of school vans.

Alleged misappropriation of Rs. 21 million
Changed company name  in fear of Gammanpila - Witness
Wife of Australian businessman Brian Shaddick said the name of her family company named Shaddick Group was changed to Digital Nominees in fear that Udaya Gammanpila would start a new business using their company name.
Witness Janet Elisabeth Shaddick, 69, was present before Colombo High Court A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa yesterday. She is the third witness in the alleged financial misappropriation case filed against two accused including Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila.
Replying to a question by defence counsel Shavindra Fernando PC, the witness said her family decided to change the company name since Udaya Gammanpila and his family stayed in Australia on or around 2011 and 2012.
However, defence counsel informed court that Udaya Gammanpila and his family came to settle in Australia in December 2015 and suggested that the witness was giving false evidence.
However, the witness denied the fact that she is giving false evidence.
Witness Janet Elisabeth Shaddick, 69, was present before Colombo High Court A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa in connection with an indictment filed against MP Udaya Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 21 million following their alleged fraudulent share transaction that took place in 2000. Further trial was fixed for October 5.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila had cheated Rs.20 million and misappropriated another Rs.21 million along with Sydney Jayasinghe, the second accused when selling shares of Digital Nominees to a businessman called Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick.
The AG had listed 20 persons as the witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General.
Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe with Shavindra Fernando and senior counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for the accused.

Exercise Cormorant Strike IX - 2018
Counter-insurgency in Kuchchaveli
It was about 3.45 in the evening. The terrorists base located in the Kuchchaveli fishing village along the Eastern coastline was very calm. About 30 - 40 cadres were on duty and moving here and there. But they were very vigilant. Their base was surrounded with land on three sides and the clear blue sea, on the other. They were sure that there was no threat from the land. Also there was no sign of any threat from the military near the coastline. But the terrorists were always ready to face any attack, from land or sea.
Time passed by. However, in an instant, everything changed. The terrorists had to face an unexpected bombardment by Air Force Kafir jets right in the middle of their base. Suddenly, the entire scenario turned into a battle zone. Now the terrorists were being shot one by one. The next moment put them into another difficulty: Special Operations Force (SOF) troops emerging from the sea launched an attack on the camp, further weakening the terrorists.
Troopers continued the attack on the enemy despite the return fire. They gradually entered the base and established a bridgehead. A few minutes later, the mechanised infantry on tanks linked up with the SOF troops who cleared the insurgents base camp. Now, the base was totally destroyed and surrendered to the SOFs. It was the completion of the mission conducted by the Special Operations Forces of the Army, Navy, and the Air Force.
Before May 2009, this entire scenario was a reality. But since the end of the conflict in the North and East in May 2009, the Tri-Forces have not faced such an experience so far. However, the Special Operations Forces (SOFs) of the Tri-Forces staged this demonstration at the final phase of Exercise Cormorant Strike IX  2018 last week in Kuchchaveli. Generally known as the Critical Engagement phase, this phase demonstrated a joint operation by the Tri-Forces against the enemy.
Although the 30-year-long war in the country was concluded by defeating the LTTE, the defenders of the country must maintain their power and ability to face any threat even in the future. In this context, continuous training and rehearsing is essential and so, a joint tri-service mega Field Training Exercise (FTX) namely, Exercise Cormorant Strike was introduced in 2010 by the Sri Lanka Army.
Exercise Cormorant Strike, also known as the Diyakawa Military Exercise, has since 2010 become the flagship annual event of the Sri Lanka Army. The exercise was initiated on a concept of the then Defence Secretary with the aim of developing a competent Special Operation Forces soldier and a conceptual framework for the employment of these forces.
The exercise was first conducted in 2010 in the general area of Mannar with the participation of 2,500 soldiers for nine days. During this exercise, 40 naval vessels and aircraft including the SLNS Shakthi, Kafirs, and MI24, Y12 and MI 17 helicopters were deployed. Army Commandos and Special Forces were directly involved in the ground battle and the amphibious landing was jointly coordinated by senior security officials of the Tri-Forces.
Sharing of military competency, exercising the elites in joint nature interoperability, experiencing of complex environments and exercising the chain of command under simulated scenarios are among the major objectives behind the realisation of this annual event. Further, Exercise Cormorant Strike seeks to develop common understanding among the Armed Forces, efficient integration among the different arms of the Tri-Forces and theoretical understanding of military subjects. The Diyakawa Military Exercise also seeks to build a platform for special operations, exercising the fundamentals of warfare and integrating advanced technology into special operations.
The FTX encompasses military operations such as patrolling, infiltration, counter-infiltration, reconnaissance and surveillance, combat tracking, demolitions, raids, ambushes, rescue missions, cat sniping and urban fighting, VIP protection, HALO-casting, combat diving, and cyber security.
Held every year since 2010, this year Exercise Cormorant Strike reached the ninth edition with renewed strength and complexity.
Exercise Cormorant Strike IX - 2018 was launched from the mock operational headquarters located at the Infantry Training Centre in Minneriya on September 6. It was held for 20 days covering the Eastern, Central, Western, and North Central Provinces and culminated on September 26, when the Critical Engagement phase was staged at Kuchchaveli in Trincomalee in the Eastern Province. This years exercise portrayed a counter-insurgency scenario, which appears to be the most likely national and international security threat in the 21st century.
Exercise Cormorant Strike IX - 2018 was developed under the guidance of Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake and a special committee. Kilinochchi Commander Major General Niyshshanka Ranawana was this years Exercise Director, while Brigadier Krishantha Gnanaratne and Colonel Upul Ihalage served as Deputy Directors.
This year, over 3, 000 soldiers of the Tri-Forces as well as foreign military personnel participated. About 2,500 infantrymen including Commandos, Special Forces and Mechanised Infantrymen, 400 Sailors, and 200 Airmen joined the FTX along with 64 foreign military personnel either as participants or observers, representing 19 countries, including Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, Sudan, Turkey, UK, USA and Zambia.
Cormorant Strike IX - 2018 incorporated the most modern military techniques, adding new features in specific operation segments. Based on a hypothetical scenario, the Exercise incorporated Web GIS software for operations, improvised digital bird tables and smart boards, separate joint Naval operations, joint night operations, operations conducted by both Special Forces and Commandos in the same area, and a parachute jump with full combat gear, to highlight a few.
Adding a novel item this year, participants also joined a VIP rescue demonstration at Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre premises in Colombo. This was witnessed by State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene.
The final operation of the FTX was the Critical Engagement phase, which conducted at Kuchchaveli, Trincomalee, before a mammoth gathering. Critical Engagement displayed how a simulated multi-pronged joint amphibious attack on enemy hideouts could be carried out with precision at short notice, in a setting considered hostile, most challenging and exciting. For this mock operation, the Commandos and Special Forces were simultaneously joined by MI24 and MIG fighter jets and Naval fighter craft.
A panel of exercise directors, commanded by Exercise Director Major General Niyshshanka Ranawana, with the coordination of the Army Directorate of Training, headed by Army Training Director General Major General Aruna Wanniarachchi, planned and executed the whole of Exercise Cormorant Strike IX - 2018 in a professional manner.
State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene, Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake, the Navy Commander, the Chief of Staff of the Sri Lanka Air Force, invitees and foreign military officials witnessed the final operation at Kuchchaveli.
What foreign militaryofficers said...
After the conclusion of Critical Engagement, the foreign participants expressed
their views of the FTX:
I participated in this exercise last year too. I gained a lot of knowledge. We joined the apprehend and ambush missions.
We had a lot of new experiences. We too have such an exercise in Indonesia called Tribuana. We hope Sri Lanka would join Tribuana in Indonesia next year.
- Major Borneo,Indonesian Military Academy
I think it is a brand new exercise for foreign participants. Our team participated in many missions during this exercise. They gained practical experience.
The quick deployment of troops on attack and application of tactics is very great. We thank the Sri Lanka Army for its hospitality.
- Lieutenant Wu,Chinese Army
This is the second time I am participating in this exercise. This year the exercise is better coordinated. The scope of the exercise has been expanded and broadened this year. Overall, the exercise setting is good. Foreign troops have definitely benefitted from this. We also have such exercises in our country. From these exercises we come to know something new and different.
- Colonel Sajjad,Pakistan Army
I participated as an observer. The setting of the Exercise, the coordination, movements of troops, and execution of tasks was great. The Sri Lanka Army is progressing well. We also have such Special Forces joint training.

Couple reunited in quake zone
INDONESIA: It was two agonising days of searches through makeshift morgues and hospitals before Azwan found his wife Dewi alive and well after she was swept away in the tsunami that crashed into the Indonesian city of Palu.
Recounting the story beside her at a small roadside stall in the quake-hit city, the 38-year-old civil servant struggled to keep his emotions in check, tears welling up behind his glasses.
I was so happy, so emotional -- thank god I could see her again, Azwan, who like many Indonesians only has one name, told AFP.
His is a rare story of hope, in a place where the sense of despair, grief and loss hangs thick.
Dewi was registering guests for a festival at a beachside hotel when the tremor sent a jolt through the ground.
Soon a wall of water was rushing at her.
A wave came and hit me hard. When I regained consciousness, suddenly I was on the street in front of the hotel. I remember hearing people shouting Tsunami! Tsunami!, she told AFP.
Her clothes ripped and torn, she wandered through the debris-littered streets until she found an evacuation post where she stayed overnight.- AFP

Johnstons Sathosa funds case
Court asked to summon Assistant Commissioner
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rakshana Abeysuriya yesterday pleaded before Kurunegala High Court Judge Menaka Wijesundara to include the Kurunegala Assistant Election Commissioner as a witness in the former Minister Johnston Fernandos case on the misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million of Sathosa funds, when the case was taken up yesterday (02).
The Defence Counsels objected the plea by the prosecution stating that there was no need of involving politics into this case. The High Court Judge observed that the matter on issuing notice on the Kurunegala Assistant Election Commissioner would be discussed on a future date.
Notice had been issued on the Vice Chairman of the Kurunegala Mosque to give evidence yesterday.
Mohamed Haseem Mohamed Milan, who appeared to give evidence had no document to prove his position, so that evidence was not taken from him. Thushara Sampath Ruwan of Thorayaya, Kurunegala giving evidence said that he delivered commodities of the Sathosa under the second defendant of the case Shakeer Mohamed. He said he transported goods from the Yanthampalawa Sathosa branch to the private boutiques in Kurunegala Mahaveethiya and Gattuwana. He said he did not know the third defendant.
Twelve witnesses gave evidence before the Court. The Magistrate observing that evidence have to be taken from several other witnesses ordered to further remand the defendants. The hearing was postponed for today.
Former Lak Sathosa Chairman K. M. Fernando and former Ministers Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohamod Sakeer were also served with indictments for aiding and abetting to commit the offence.
The three suspects are charged under the Public Property Act. According to the Court, Fernando as the Minister in charge of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) had allegedly ordered that goods worth over Rs. 5.2 million be released from three CWE warehouses in Yanthampalawa, Wehera and Mallawapitiya in the Kurunegala District during the North Western Provincial Council Election in September 2013.

Korean gang rape case
Court orders CID to investigate Lankan suspects
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Interpol Unit to carry out investigations into three suspects who were allegedly involved in the gang rape of an 18-year-old Korean girl in 1998, in South Korea.
The CID yesterday filed a B report before the court.
CID officials informed the Magistrate that the South Korean Police had investigated the incident where an 18-year-old Korean girl was killed in an accident on an expressway in Daegu City in South Korea in 1998.
CID also said that Korean Police had found the deceased girls underwear in a separate location and performed DNA tests on the sperm samples found in her underwear. Korean authorities could not identify the real perpetrators of the crime, but they stored the DNA samples, the CID said.
Meanwhile, 12 years after the crime, a Sri Lankan who was employed in Korea pleaded guilty to requesting an under-aged girl for sexual favours in exchange for money. Korean Police found that the accused Sri Lankans DNA matched the DNA of the sperm samples found in the underwear of the deceased. Korean officials had filed a case against this Sri Lankan before the Korean court, CID said.
The Korean court rejected the case due to the long period that had lapsed since the crime was committed.
The two other suspects involved in this incident arrived in Sri Lanka later.
The Korean government requested Sri Lanka on August 28, 2017, to conduct investigations into the case. Earlier this year, a Korean delegation also visited Sri Lanka, after which the Attorney General had issued instructions to the CID to conduct investigations into this case.

Creativity with courage
Chathuranga Biyagama is a highly skilled and experienced Sri Lankan artist who has had international exposure. Biyagama is now into art full time, and is confident and has so much to share with anyone interested in art.
Daily News spoke to Biyagama who recently attended the 18th Asian Art Biennale in Bangladesh, which according to him was a tremendous experience for any young artist. He has taken part in the Asian Art Biennale, Dhaka, Bangladesh 2014 and 2016 as well. In 2003 he could not participate, yet sent his paintings to the Biennale.
Different cultures
The 2018 Asian Art Biennale was massive. In Sri Lanka, you cannot see such a big collection of artworks. Once you participate in that, you can see where you stand. You can see different cultures coming together. I was very excited. It was a huge event because participating countries are now growing, said Biyagama.
Biyagama noted that the enthusiasm and the interest in this Biennale are increasing. There was a representation from countries including Italy, Spain, Germany, Australia, China and Japan. This event is very important and relevant to our times. When you particulate in such events it opens your eyes to what is going on in the rest of the world and you develop insights. He commented that the idea is to soon make it an international Art Biennale with the Government of Bangladesh inviting European countries. So the next target is to invite 100 countries that go beyond Asia.
Biyagama was a student of many fields and a graduate in Business Management and Strategic Marketing and holds a Bachelor of Law LLB degree and worked in the finance industry and banking for 10 years. Last year he decides to take the risk and resigned from his full-time job to pursue art. He had an interest in art from childhood and took part in competitions and won awards. This was partly because as he matured, he came to realize with all his travelling, that there is a huge potential in Arts outside Sri Lanka. So he decided to learn more about art and developed his talents in art.
International events
Biyagama is busy as a bee now and is making full use of his talents and his experience by holding exhibitions. So far he has represented Sri Lanka for 10 international events and has held two Solo Exhibitions in Sri Lanka, three exhibitions in England and last year he participated in the Amsterdam International Art Exhibition in the Netherlands.
Now I am 35 years old and I started art at age of five. My talent in Arts first started to manifest itself from my childhood. So it is a passion that I have had since childhood. And now my passion has led me to become a full-time artist who takes his profession very seriously. This is the way I express my inner self. Now I take part in foreign exhibitions happening in many parts of the world. I am now seeking opportunities outside Sri Lanka and I compete with foreign artists as well, explained Biyagama.
Biyagama is convinced that if the quality of your work is good, and if you have the talent and you are willing to put in the hard work, there are opportunities.
International forums
Now he is working for a small movement called Artist Development Movement. The theme is taking Asian art talent to international forums. Now he is dealing with some upcoming Sri Lankan artists and upcoming University passes out students from Bangladesh and India, in the hope of introducing them to the high-end artist forums in USA, Europe and Japan. He is trying to give them the opportunities that will help them succeed.
Biyagama forms so many contacts in his travels. He meets these University students at foreign events and through this networking, they get to know each other. So be provides opportunities and guidance.
My ambition in life is to take art beyond Sri Lanka. I am now doing five exhibitions a year -London, Amsterdam, Tokyo and Dubai. I have developed my career without outside funding and did not seek government aid. But we need to also understand that governments have other major problems to sort out in a country. So I would like to think that I have done my part to take Sri Lankan art to International standard. I am well known internationally. I want to introduce more Sri Lankan and Asian people to these international art forums and show that there are potential and talent in our countries. There are a lot of capable people in our region, pointed out Biyagama.
Now his bread and butter is his art. When he was in the finance industry he was able to earn the money for his artwork.
But now I am selling my paintings and I have international buyers and there are galleries and collectors who buy my work. So now I find my funds through art. I do not worry about my resources and I am fully focused on my work, and if our work is good there will be a market and there will always be a demand. I normally go for simple themes which are not political. Art should be very simple and beautiful. People who see my work need to understand the theory behind that. It is normally about human life. Sometimes the woman is a subject of my themes, explained Biyagama.

## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

CURRENCY  TENSIONS AND  CONTAGION  Part I
There is a high publicity that the rupee has been gravely falling in the foreign exchange market. The currency has depreciated during the year so far by about 12% to around Rs. 170 per US dollar as compared to Rs. 152 at the beginning of the year. Further currency depreciation is expected while some raise concern that the country is on the verge of the economic collapse. The wider publicity is given for the primary, external reason, as usual with a tone of blame, for this sudden fall of the currency as the strengthening of the US dollar globally due to the increase in the US interest rates by the US central bank (the US Fed) and strong economic recovery in the US. The authorities emphasize that this currency problem is confronted by many countries in the world at levels worse than Sri Lanka and show a lukewarm attitude to get the currency under control by using immense policy powers available at their hands.
Some analysts seem to confuse the current currency problem (exchange rate over-shooting) with the currency depreciation seen throughout the past as a normal macroeconomic outcome due to the protracted deficit in the countrys balance of payment and, therefore, propose to resolve this deficit problem in order to control the current problem of heavier currency depreciation. However, the balance of payment deficit is a structural economic problem that has been debated during the past 50 years without an outcome and no solution is seen even in next decade.
Therefore, the country has to find immediate policy options to bring the present level of currency depreciation to its normal trend if we wish to escape an economic catastrophe in the event the current currency tensions develop to a currency crisis, as experienced in many countries in the past, given regional and global links and possible contagion of the current currency tensions.
Direct macroeconomic consequences of currency depreciation even in normal times are well-known. Those are the increase in local currency amounts required for repayment of foreign debt, increase in inflation due to the increase in local currency prices of imports and resulting erosion of living standards of the general public and the loss of competitiveness of exports due to higher local inflation. As usual, governments also are adversely affected by concerns raised by the public and political corners on such consequences. In opposite, exporters are expected to benefit from the increase in export proceeds in local currency if they are able to maintain their trade competitiveness not affected by the higher inflation. In general times, the currency depreciation or under-valued exchange rate is a textbook economic policy to improve the trade balance by encouraging exports and import substitution industries and discouraging imports, provided that exports and imports are highly responsive to exchange rates. However, excessive currency depreciation, if not controlled at the beginning, could disrupt the economies.
Therefore, given the wide literature in economic catastrophes due to currency and financial crises in the world, it is prudent to think of the worst and prepare at least from now onwards. This article is drafted in that spirit in the national interest. The relevant policy-makers can ignore my stance and proposals put forward here without any cost if they believe otherwise as they are the legally authorized on policy-making. In that event, contents in this article will help the general public to understand some of the dark inside of currency problems in countries.
The primary reason for the present currency tensions
The faster outflow of foreign investment to the US in the recent past is the prime reason. This outflow has been caused by two factors that emerged during the past two and half years in the global front.
First, the tightening of the US monetary policy by the US Fed has become faster since December 2016 due to strong recovery of the US economy from the global financial crisis 2007/09 during the past decade as reflected by the fall of unemployment from 10% to 3.9%, increase in economic growth from negative 2.8% to 4.2% (annual projection: 3.1%) and increase in general prices from a price reduction 0.5% to around low inflation of 2% between 2009 and present. The monetary policy tightening is being made primarily in areas. They are the hikes in policy interest rates and absorption of dollar liquidity by the US Fed. Interest rate hike so far is 2% from 0.25% in December 2015 to 2.25% as at September 26. The increase has been 1.75% between December 2016 and now and steady/gradual being seven times increase with 0.25% at each time. According to the forecast of interest rates by the US Fed, further hikes are expected, one more this year and four more next year, until the US policy rate is 3.00-3.5% in 2019/2020 as per projections.
The absorption of liquidity is to remove colossal amount of new dollars printed by the US Fed at interest rates close to zero to facilitate the US economic recovery from the financial crisis. Nearly 3.5 trillion of new dollars were printed during 2007-2016 by purchasing government and private securities (asset purchase) from the market. A part of new dollars was invested by private investors, i.e., investment banks and hedge funds, in developing countries including Sri Lanka to earn higher returns due to higher interest rates mostly more than 10% (as compared to close to zero in the US) prevailing in these countries.
These investments are generally short-term in government securities, equities, bank deposits and short-term loans that can be taken out in few days if necessary. The asset purchase was stopped in 2014 and printed money is being taken out gradually from the economy as and when those assets at the hand of the US Fed mature. The current projection is to remove about a trillion of US dollars whose eventual monetary policy impact would be reduction of the global dollar liquidity by nearly 6 trillion through the normal multiplier effect. When interest rates rise and dollar liquidity falls significantly in the US as compared to other countries, it is natural that money and investments flow back to the US for safer US investments with better returns.
Second, the President Donald Trump has offered a highly protectionist economic policy package, America First, through increase of import tariffs (increase from 10% to 25%), general tax cut (amounting 1.5 trillion with corporate tax reduced from 35% to 11%), new fiscal spending on infrastructure (nearly one trillion) and considerable deregulation. He openly and aggressively invited American firms and investors to come back to the US of the new business friendly economy. This also has prompted huge investment inflows to the US.
As a result of higher demand for and tighter supply of dollars in the US, the value of the dollar being the most popular global reserve currency (nearly 63% of world central bank reserves) naturally increases as against other currencies in the world. This is the story in brief behind the fall of the currencies of many countries. The currencies of countries which are highly exposed to short-term foreign investments confronted adverse falls when such investments started flowing out. India, Indonesia, Philippine and Sri Lanka are in the top of the Asian list. Argentina and Turkey are in the top of the worst list in the world. It is highly possible that the list will expand soon, added with prevailing trade tensions among the US, China, Canada and Europe.
Both monetary policy tightening and the US new economic policy package have been well communicated to the world. The US Fed continuously communicated its monetary policy tightening in its forward guidance policy since 2014 and global financial and economic analysts have been providing projections throughout the clock for the US interest rates and possible policy transmission and spillover effects along with past experiences. Therefore, the US monetary policy change was not a secret to policy-makers of developing countries as the global financial and economic media in the internet has been full of the literature. However, as usual, they started opening eyes only after the spillover effects started biting the economies since early this year, especially at the beginning of the currency turmoil in Turkey and Argentina in May-June. Still, some give brave talks as if the present currency problem has no macroeconomic fundamentalsim order for them to be complacent until a currency crisis hit, as usual.
Economic experts led by former US Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke state that, at the cliff of monetary tightening and termination of the additional fiscal stimulus by end of 2020, the US economy will start confronting a severe recession requiring a turn-back of another round of relaxed monetary policy in 2020 as the US economic recovery is still not sustainably strong for such a speedy phase of monetary policy tightening. Therefore, countries like Sri Lanka can expect another silver line from the US and world economy if we survive in next two years.
Currency tensions to currency crises
Exchange rate is a highly speculative price among all those who have economic activities that are linked to foreign exchange. Central banks, currency dealers, international investors, exporters and importers are on the top of the list. Except central banks, all attempt to make profit in their transactions of buying or selling or both of foreign currency. In normal times, various speculations mostly cancel out in aggregate and, therefore, the volatility of the exchange rate stays in unconcerned territory of minds of participants in markets. However, in the event the exchange rate gets in to regional tensions of speculations, it becomes destabilizing, i.e., everybody starts speculating (herd behaviour) in same direction faster and faster, causing the exchange rate to over-shoot.
In the current communication and geo-political systems, it becomes extremely difficult to make it turn-back if the currency tensions become currency crises. A regional currency crisis affects countries disproportionally depending on the economic and financial strengths and the policy proactivity of the respective countries. Any currency crisis within a country not connected to any global or regional tensions is manageable by the country authorities with the support of other countries in the region. Therefore, if a currency gets attacked by regional tensions, the country should think of the worst of a currency crisis and taking prompt action to prevent any contagion of speculation as nobody can forecast a currency or financial crisis and such crises have potential to destroy countries and regional economies as experienced from the Asian financial crisis 1997/98. Further, no support can be expected from friendly countries as they are also in the currency threats. A currency crisis causes widespread shortages of funds in the economy, loan default and bankruptcies. Therefore, we need to fully understand how various important sectors of the economy are linked to or exposed to tensions of currency speculations and crises.
Destabilizing speculation over the depreciation of the currency will cause significant shortage of foreign currency in the country through various sources. First, foreign funds/investments will flow out to safer and competitive countries.
As most foreign investments are in short-term local currency investments, the currency depreciation will result in reduction in their foreign currency capital (foreign currency brought to the country) that can be recovered by selling out local currency investments. They are usually currency arbitrageurs that flow across countries to earn quick gains from interest differentials and movements of currency rates and they have no mercy on our countries other than returns and safety of their funds. Some of these investors have high geo-political links which can destabilise the countries through their investments. Therefore, foreign investors rush to take back their investments as soon as possible as they also start confronting losses and defaults. For example, many high-street European banks started feeling tensions in August on their large exposures to Turkey and Argentina. This is the origin of a currency crisis. Second, citizens such as exporters and foreign remittance receivers will delay their foreign currency receipts with the intension to get more local currency out of foreign currency proceeds when the currency is more depreciated. This will curtail the existing foreign currency inflow to the country on real trade.
Third, importers and others who are to pay to foreigners in the near future, they will try to pay in advance in order to avoid the increase in amount of local currency required for foreign payments in future. Fourth, importers accelerate imports to pile stocks to make abnormal profit in the future. Everybody will try to stock foreign currency outside the banking system. The accumulated result of such currency speculation is the grave shortage of foreign currency liquidity in the banking system. As the foreign currency outflow has to be financed by the reduction in the foreign reserve of the Central Bank who sells foreign currency to the market by buying local currency, the market will confront a grave shortage of local currency liquidity and increase in interest rates unless the Central Bank pumps back new money to the economy through its domestic open market operations (sterilization).

Dance Philosophy of Lord Nataraja
Bharatha Natyam is the only classical dance form in the world is blessed with a well-defined symbol. The symbol of Bharatha Natyam is dancing deity Lord Natarajas dance pose. This particular Nataraja pose is often referred to as Ananda Thandavam which depicts the entire Panchakirthiya Thollil of Lord Siva. According to Hinduism the fivefold works (Panchakirthiya Thollil) of the Lord are necessary for the survival of the world.
Ananda Thandava is the symbol of Bharatha Natyam which is not included in the 108 Thandava Karnas of Lord Siva. The popular belief is that Lord Siva danced these 108 Thandava Karnas at 64 temples. But all 108 dance Karanas have been brought together in the Chidambaram temple kopura sculptures. A remarkable feature is all these Karnas are danced by only women dancers. Whilst in the famous Bragatheeswarar temple in Thanjavur, the same Thandava Karnas are depicted by the Lord himself. Unfortunately, only 83 Thandava Karnas (poses) still exist at the Bragatheeswarar temple. It is believed that the emperor Raja Raja Cholan, who built the Thanjai Bragatheeswarar temple, installed the sculptures of 83 Karnas of Lord Shiva. With the end of his rule, these works ceased. Among these 108 Karnas, some Karnas are difficult ones and others are easy.
Five functions
Ananda Thandava pose of Lord Shiva is widely known as Lord Nataraja. Lord Shiva is generally believed to have performed five functions, namely, creation and protection in two Thandavas, {(bestow happiness) and (protection from sorrow)}, destruction, dispelling egoism, sins; illusion and bestowing blessings are the main five functions of the Lord.
All these five were expounded in the six Thandavas. But all these six Thandavas are finally expounded in one single Thandava namely Ananda Thandava. Together with the six Thandavas, the Ananda Thandava becomes the seventh Thandava. All these seven Thandavas are collectively called Sabtha Thandavams. Thats why; the Ananda Thandava is used in Bharatha Natyam, because it embraces all the five essential functions of the creator of the universe.
The cosmic dancer Lord Siva is often referred to as Lord Nataraja, Koothapiran, Ampalakoothan, Adavallan, Adputhakoothan, Thillai Koothan and Thandava Moorthy. Lord Nataraja is the general and the common name used for the dancing deity.
Important elements
According to popular belief, the dance of Lord Nataraja consists of five essential elements of the world which are collectively called Panchaputhams. The five important elements of the world are fire, water, wind, earth, akasham (sky). The dance pose of Lord Nataraja consists of all these important elements. Out of the four hands, the right hand of Lord Nataraja holds the wind instrument, udiki (Udukku) and the right leg is resting on the demon (Muyalavan). Agini (fire) is in his left hand. Ganga (river) is in his tresses and the moon is worn in the tresses.
All these five essential elements are coordinated to five famous temples. Kanchipuram Temple is related to earth. Thiruvaanika is related to water. Thiruvanamali is related to the fire. Kalahsti temple is related to wind and Chidambaram temple is related to Akaya (Sky or ether). The drum which is in the right hand of Lord Nataraja denotes the creation. The fire in the left hand depicts the destruction. The second right hand denotes the protection for all living beings by Abaya Hasta. Similarly, the second left hand is in Dola hasta position to attract all towards him. Raised left leg demands all the beings to surrender to him for salvation. The pressed right leg denotes the destruction of the evils such as Kama, ego, pride, anger and jealousy.
In almost every Bharatha Natyam recital, this particular dance pose of Lord Natarajas Ananda Thandavaadorns the stage. And it is the universally acknowledged symbol of Bharatha Natyam.

Did Royal cheat to end Hayman trophy drought
Royal College won the first leg of the coveted RL Hayman trophy narrowly beating S. Thomas College for the first time in seven years.
But their celebrations were shortlived in an unprecedented turn of events where it has transpired that Royal waterpolo team resorted to using an extra player in the pool during a crucial period of the game to gain an undue advantage over their rivals.
What was stunning was that none of the officials present, the crowd or the opposing camp failed to notice this change.
This phase happened to go on for more than three minutes during which time Royal scored a crucial third goal and denied the Thomians several attacking opportunities to open their score.
Video analysis show evidence how Royal coaching team surreptitiously place an extra player away from the prying eyes of opposing camp and referees of the game in what appears to be a well orchestrated tactical move.
It is unclear what action should be or will be taken against Royal for this type of reprehensible conduct that has put the result in doubt and also the future of series.

Distortions to open economy hampered intl trade
Sri Lanka will need to establish an overall policy package to restore countrys initial and original open economy regime to better garner benefits in multiple areas particularity to make progress in terms of international trade, said Sirimal Abeyratne, Prof. in Economics, University of Colombo.
He said over the years, a number of distortions have been introduced into the open economy, as a result of that; Sri Lanka has not been able to make progress in terms of international trade. Noting that Sri Lanka is left with limited options to face any burning issues on the economic front, Prof. Abeyratne cited enforcing and restoring rule of law and improving the public sector efficiency as two main fundamental cornerstones in which the open economy functions.
It is essential to enforce the rule of law in the country to have enough rules and regulations to make sure everyone is equal before the law.
He also stressed the need to enhance the effectiveness of the public sector role in the economy.
Today exchange rate has become weaker and is vulnerable to external shocks. I believe our biggest problem is to correct our economic fundamentals and trade activities to avert any foreseeable negative impacts, he said. The Professor said further that the government needs to do away with protective and prohibitive tariff regime to attract foreign investments and to improve international trade.
Also, were not quoting industries that have flourished without the government interventions and at the same time, we dont quote unsuccessful stories that have happened with the government intervention. In numbers, they are bigger than the success stories, he said.
Prof. Abeyratne also added that country will end up in a worst situation if unnecessary taxes were removed and the trade fully liberalized.
There are many other areas that the government can correct along with that, he said.
Speaking at the event, Rohan Samarajiva, Chairman of Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka said that telecom enables greater productivity in all other sectors including logistics.
He said the logistics sector enables greater productivity in rest of the economy and the liberalization of logistics sector is likely to yield benefits in the form of value for money, greater responsiveness to customers and new products.

Drop in number of housemaids  seeking foreign employment
During the last four years, the number of women seeking employment in foreign countries as housemaids has decreased by around 100,000, the Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando yesterday said.
According to statistics, in 2014, the number of housemaids going abroad reached 300,000 where as in 2017, this number had decreased to 200,000, the Minister said.
A drop of 100,000 is a significant result. I personally believe that this number should see a further drop. We dont want to send unskilled labourers abroad. We want to send skilled and semi-skilled workers instead. We do not want to continue with the habit of sending our sisters and mothers abroad as housemaids, Minister Fernando pointed out.
Fernando also said that he as the Minister of Foreign Employment, has forwarded a special proposal to the Finance Minister for the next Budget proposal which will be immensely beneficial for persons in foreign employment. He expressed his confidence that this proposal will most definitely be included in the upcoming Budget proposal.
This proposal will take the nature of an incentive for those who send their remittances to the country through the banks. We see a tendency in most of these employees sending their money through ad-hoc methods. Many people go abroad because they want to build a house. With this proposal, such people will be relieved. More money will be sent via the banks. I am sure, this proposal will be a revolutionary concept,Minister Fernando pointed out.
He vehemently denied the allegation that a tax would be imposed upon foreign remittances. He was speaking at a press brief at Sirikotha, UNP Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
Meanwhile, speaking of the changes and trends in employment for the last few years, Minister Fernando pointed out that employment has increased from 7.7 million in 2014 to 8.2 million in 2017. He also pointed out that private sector employment has increased from 40.9% in 2014 to a 43.3% in 2017.
The Minister also observed that employment in the government sector has decreased from 15.5% in 2015 to a 14.4% in 2017.
He pointed out that this is a positive change. We are not a government that fills the government sector with employees for political advantage. We cannot afford to fill the public sector with more heads. That is the bitter truth. If we take the CTB for example, we have about eight employees per bus.

Economy being exploited for  petty political goals - Thalatha
Those who speak about depreciation of the Rupee at least did not reduce the fuel price on the orders of the Supreme Court, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Atukorala said.
She said they attempt to create a wrong image on the the economy to get petty political advantage.
The Minister was responding the queries by journalists following a ceremony at Belihuloya on Monday.
She said the politicians in the previous government could have dropped the cost of living of the people by reducing the fuel price as instructed by the Supreme Court.
But they did otherwise, Minister Atukorala said. The corruption, waste and thefts committed during the previous regime aggravated the economy and we have taken measures to stop them. Those days some members used 30 to 40 vehicles, she said.
The currency depreciation is common in the regional countries and the Rupee is far better than those currencies, she said. She said the currency in Russia too is depreciating and in India, Afganistan, Bangladesh and in others, the same thing happen. She said this is a result of the competition between leading nations which Sri Lanka has no control over.
Minister Atukorala said the government empowers the people who were neglected during the previous regime.
She said the government has taken measures to appreciate the Rupee. The vehicle permits granted to Parliamentarians and the Ministries were cancelled. She said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had taken many measures to appreciate the Rupee.

The essential quality  of human rights
During the course of last week, the issue of human rights became one of the most debated discourses within the country. This heated exchange of ideas about human rights arose as a result of two controversial statements made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith at Delgoda Kaluboda Sri Saranankara Dhamma School and at the Ekala St Mathew Roman Catholic Church.
At the Delgoda Kaluboda Dhamma School, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said that within Sri Lanka, an environment is building up where religious intolerance has come to the forefront. Buddhism has always been the backbone of this country and people have believed in the Buddhist faith from a long time in the past. By protecting the Buddhist philosophy, rights of all the people belonging to different ethnicities will be protected. Things which negatively affect religions are seeping into the social context. So we must work towards removing such negative elements and protect our religious environment. The declaration of human rights was created in the 20th Century. But we had a much more developed socio-cultural ethos in this country way prior to that. So, we do not need to think about human rights in an extraordinary way.
During the Mass held at the Ekala St. Mathew Church, the Right Reverend Cardinal stated the following. Today, human rights have become a religion in the West. Human rights came about in the recent past. Earlier, there was nothing called human rights. But despite that, people lived inhumane ways respecting each other. Now, people are preaching about human rights as if it is a modern fashionable invention.
In Europe, it is like wearing a coat. When they want and when it is beneficial for them they subscribe to the faith. When they feel that they have to give something, they remove it. This same situation is spreading in this country.
Some people talk about an atheistic society and state that if we have food, clothes and other perks it is enough and we do not need anything else. We could see the same situation in the early Sinhalese society. They used to say eat, drink and make merry. Even if one dies tomorrow after making merry today it will be a solace. If we properly follow a religion there is no need for human rights. Human rights are embedded in the religions we follow. What else So, my dear brothers and sisters, we should not get caught in this fallacy and myth. We have to think intelligently (This report was taken from the report published in the Lankadeepa newspaper published on 25/09/2018, p. 10).
These two statements made by the Cardinal obviously sent shock waves among human rights activists in the country. Mangla Samaraweera, the Minister for Media and Finance responded to this quite strongly and said that these ideas expressed by the Cardinal cannot be accepted. The minister further stated that human rights became essential in order to protect the lives of those who did not subscribe to Catholicism as they were subject to various forms of torture and were even killed as a result of the crusades.
Catholic Social Doctrine
The minister by stating this tried to explain that Catholicism was one major reason as to why human rights came to the forefront in political, legal and social domains. Bertie Ranaweerage, keeping a note on Facebook stated that most of the religions were spread and promoted in the world through the use of swords, arms and bribes and therefore, those who engage in religious activities are against the notion of human rights.
One of the most logical statements made with regard to the statements made by the Cardinal was made by Wishwamithra Bandusiri in an article titled Enough is enough, Archbishop, did you come to this world to give evidence to the truth or to go shopping for somebody In this article Bandusiri states that the Catholic social doctrine is the main element taught by Catholicism. But that is hidden and kept away from lay Catholics like us living in this country. As long as it is hidden, it will be easy for authoritative governments to maintain their power. That is why the Church always tries to hide this very important doctrine. The base of the Catholic Social Doctrine is the teachings of the Bible.
The notion that the human being is created by God, the strong bond between humans and god as a result of this creation, the strong notion that God always takes the side of marginalized groups for their liberation and finally the notion that god eventually took the form of a human being and came to this world and re-established human dignity are the premises on which the Catholic Social Doctrine is built up. Human dignity, bringing the society and the family together for the common good, human rights and duties, sacrifice everything for the poor, workers rights and dignity in workplaces, solidarity and preserving the environment are part and partial of that doctrine. Therefore, human rights and human dignity are directly related to the teachings of Catholicism. It becomes clear that human rights are embedded in the Bible but the Church has made them be absent so that it will allow authoritarian rulers to continue their rule without a hindrance.
These arguments made against the Cardinals statements will be understood by different people in different ways and they can be criticized in various ways. Some people see Minister Mangala Samaraweeras statement as one which was made against the Catholic Church and the Cardinal. Some, as usual, gave it political undertones and stated that this shows the current governments resentment towards the Catholic Church. By stating such the obvious attempt by the anti-government factions are to sway the Catholic voter base away from the government. But eventually, these rhetorical arguments relegated the reality behind human rights to the background which is obviously wrong.
Despite various politically and religiously loaded statements made by various people, there is no way that human rights can be relegated to a secondary position as human rights showcase the importance of humanity. This essential quality was gained by the people after waging a long battle against three main inhuman forces.
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Authoritarian governments, the functioning of the Catholic Church in the middle ages and its authoritative religious rule and the exploitation unleashed by capitalism with the advent of modernism over the poor were those three inhuman things. Human rights, therefore, were not gifted to the people by the ruling elites or the high priests of the Catholic Church or by the capitalists after seeing the status of the poor. They were won by people after fiercely fought battles which shed blood.
As stated above, the basis of human rights is humanity. As Morris Cantrin shows, human rights are a universal ethical right. This should apply equally to all women and men at all times and unless the principle of fairness seriously impinges, it should not be taken away from people and it belongs to humans as a result of being human. So human rights are built on universal ethical principles and are essential for the humane physical existence of humankind. It applies to everybody regardless of sex and is built on humans. It is universal and it applies to everybody uniformly and it cannot be infringed and if infringed it will be a serious violation.
The United Nations assembly on December 10, 1948 brought about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights based on this. The United Nations firmly believed that this will bring about a system of rights which will be universal in application to bring about freedom, equality and peace. These rights cannot be impinged upon in any way and protect the dignity of human life and provide it with much-required security and solace.
Therefore, it becomes clear that human rights are essential in order to develop humanity and lead peaceful and complete lives. These rights apply to those who subscribe to religion and atheists alike. In a conflict-ridden world over various political, social, economic and religious reasons, the only tool which can suppress these and bring human beings to coexist peacefully are human rights. Those who stand up against human rights then are standing up against this ideology. So, ultimately, if somebody is against these universal ideas, that person should be regarded as an enemy of the human society.

Five corruption cases  against Johnston re-fixed
Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday re-fixed the inquiry of the five corruption cases against the former Minister Johnston Fernando and two others.
This is for allegedly incurring a loss of Rs.40 million to the government by employing 153 employees of the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) for election work from 2010 to 2014.
The Magistrate ordered prison authorities to produce Johnston Fernando before Court if he serves a term in prison at that time.
Accordingly, cases against former Cooperative and Internal Trade Minister Johnston Fernando, former CWE (Lak Sathosa) Chairman Eraj Fernando and former Ministers Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohammad Sakeer were fixed for trial on December 14.
Attorneys appearing on behalf of the suspects stated that first and second suspects did not appear before the Court yesterday because they appeared before the Kurunegala High Court yesterday.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed these corruption cases against three accused under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on three charges. The Bribery Commission alleged that the first accused Johnston Fernando had unlawfully employed 153 employees for election work from 2010 to 2014, when he was the Co-operatives and Internal Trade Minister.

Former National Boxer Ajantha Gamini will be missed
IP Ajantha Gamini Perera has had a long illustrious career in boxing from young days. During his school days at St, Johns Collage Nugegoda, he participated at most Inter  School tournaments including the Stubbs shield Championship winning them convincingly. His first coach was UAT Sumanapala, a former Feather weight National Champion of the Army.
Soon after leaving school he was drawn in to the police boxing squad by the Police sports officer Dharmasiri Weerakoon SP under whom Ajantha Gamini trained. Dharmasiri Weerakoon boxed at 1960 Rome Olympics.
Earlier Ajantha was taken in as a reserve Sub Inspector and later was made permanent. Ajantha was kept in the Police Field Force HQ Thimbirigasyaya for training. Possessing a strong heavy body he kept on winning regularly at the major tournaments, the Layton cup, Clifford Cup and National Championship. Earlier he boxed in the Light Middle weight under 71 Kg and latter Middle Weight under 75 Kg. He was fortunate to represent the National Boxing team at SAF Games held in Kathmandu 1999 and Adijaniya International Boxing Championship held in India coached by Capt. (Rtd) RK Indrasena then National Coach. He also represented Junior National team at Asian Junior Championship held in Bangkok in 1985.
Later he took over training the police boxing team initially making them absolutely fit. He ran and did exercises with them setting an example to all. Apart from men, he trained the Police women boxers too and some of them were able to represent the country.
He qualified as a National Referee and Judge in April 2006. He further qualified as a one Star International Referee and Judge in February 2011. In the Boxing field or outside he had no enemies. He was friendly with everyone and everybody loved him. His habit was to help anyone who needed assistance.
It is most unfortunate that he met with an untimely death, succumbing after an unexpected motor car accident in the early hours of 1st October 2018. A drunken lady driver in a jeep crashed head on to his car at Pepiliyana causing fatal injuries. During this accident his family members had been in his car. As a hero, he was able to rush his family to Kalubowila hospital and got immediate attention. However, he succumbed to severe injuries two hours later.
Three School boys have lost their beloved father. Faithfull wife has lost her husband. Sri Lanka Police has lost an able Inspector and their competent Boxing Coach. Boxing world has lost an experienced Referee and Judge. Everyone have lost a very dear friend. We pray that his loving wife and two sons recover soon. He was only 51 years old

Gifted  intelligence
She is an inspiring leader. She has a wide array of talents, has much insight, and is a charismatic and confident individual. Perfect Prefects features Head Girl of Pushpadana Girls College Kandy, Ama Dharmakeerthi who has achieved success through her determination.
Wisdom Shines through Character is the motto at Pushpadana Girls College Kandy. And Dharmakeerthi points out that her school has enabled her to stand strong anywhere in the world.
Gifting intelligent, creative and honourable young women with exemplary characters is the mission of our school. Theres a strong academic atmosphere in the school. The young ladies are guided by a devoted teaching staff who help them to develop their personalities. My school has played a major role in shaping up my character. It is my school that identified my hidden skills and talents. I have tried more than half the extracurricular activities and sports to identify what goes with me the best. I loved all of them so I became an all-rounder. Many teachers and elder sisters motivated me to develop my personality, courage and confidence. My teachers even stayed after school, to help me catch up with the missed lessons and their support has been wonderful, said Dharmakeerthi.
Role model
Courage is a characteristic that is essential if one is to move forward in the world. She very correctly points out that young people need a courageous role model with a well -balanced personality. Because along with courage comes an attitude that can influence young people, thus becoming a guiding light for young people to move forward in the path of success.
Self- belief is key to her success. She has properly assessed her strengths and weaknesses. For her, becoming Head Prefect was a childhood dream.
From Grade 3, I practised my first head prefect speech under the shower. I had a strong determination that I will achieve my goals and I worked hard for that. I have to thank my parents, the school I got primary education, my current school Pushpadana, our madam principal, teachers, friends, competitors and motivators who have been the pillars of my success. I would like to attribute my success to my prefects committee as well because they are the best team any leader can ever have, stated Dharmakeerthi.
From the leaders she admires, the current president of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar -Kitarvi, Dr Martin Luther King Jr. and Sirimavo Bandaranaike are some of them.
Great leader
I appreciate the intelligence and passion of Kolinda Grabar -Kitarvi, the President of Croatia. Her humble and simple character reflects the great leader that lives within her. Her desire to enrich her mind with knowledge is a lesson for all women in the world.
I also admire Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. who had a dream to bring light to the lives of Afro-Americans and he was the live wire behind the banishment of colour based discrimination. The late Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who became the worlds first female head of government is a leader I adore because she opened doors for women to engage in the field of politics with confidence, explained Dharmakeerthi.
In Dharmakeerthis own words  Making a difference in society is a tremendous task but a small spark in the positive direction can light up the whole world.
Im someone who believes that we should change for the better first, to make the world a better place to live. We hear many injustices happening in the world in many ways. Some superpowers are using their upper hand to oppress the developing and undeveloped countries that are trying to gain economic stability. I would like to help stop the manufacturing and selling of lethal weapons and destroy them forever. I would like to influence and encourage my fellow sisters and brothers to strengthen their walk on a steady path toward a better future. I wish to live in a world bereft of discriminations where all of us can live with peace, love, happiness and harmony, points out Dharmakeerthi.
Her vision is to start a business firm that provides many job opportunities for people. She also has a dream to become a motivational speaker.
Injustice for child
This is so I can influence and develop positive attitudes in the minds of youth. I want to become someone who can set an example to young leaders with a need to change the world. In my point of view, there are many injustices happening in the world. Child labour, child exploitation, condemnation of women in the employment sector, cruelty towards animals, the wide social disparity, environmental pollution, war and violence can be mentioned as few of them. I want to stand up against discrimination, having the hope of a better world. I would like to be a voice for female empowerment because I am a girl and I have the power, explained Dharmakeerthi.
For her, life is a learning experience and an opportunity to develop ones leadership skills. She points out that developing insights into people is necessary.
Our world is developing day by day with modern technology. There is much competition since theres easy access to gain information. The modern generation is caught up in a constant struggle with scientific technology and everything has become complex. Leadership is not just having titles or ranks but influencing the followers to do better in their lives. For a school leaver, there are ample opportunities if you have a goal in mind along with self -confidence. I believe you should achieve your dreams by working hard because your dreams should guide your way. Dont ever give up what interests you, because you never lose until you stop trying. Keep moving forward. Things may not be easy sometimes, but even if you are going through hell, keep going. Either you win or learn but never lose. One day, you will discover the correct way to fight against the hardships and accomplish your goal, explained Dharmakeerthi.
When facing pressure, and when thinking of ways to solve the challenges in an efficient way, she always discusses the matter with her parents, Madam Principal or teachers and receives the best advice.
Immediate action
Pressure comes in different ways. Sometimes when things have gone wrong, you need to have that pressure to take immediate action. Sometimes it is just you who needlessly pressurizes yourself over irrelevant things. The first thing I do when Im under pressure is sorting the type of pressure into these two categories. Then the problem will appear simple and less stressful. I read the motivational sayings regarding the problem and refer to articles posted on websites. I also listen to some motivational songs and they provide relaxation to my mind. As Im a good artist, drawing keeps me calm. I try to take a break if that is still not solved. Then I meditate for a while. Trying to find a solution all by myself seems stressful, but for me, facing challenges is really interesting because there wont be a rainbow without rain, added Dharmakeerthi.
Quoting the saying The more that you read, the more things youll know, the more that you learn, the more places youll go, she says that reading is the best medicine that heals the mind.
It is a well- known fact that all the competent leaders throughout history and even in the present are avid readers. I read all sorts of books which I find appealing. They motivate me to look at life from a better point of view. I listen to a few songs daily because music is the magic that gives life to us. My favourite songs are Hall of fame and I was here. I love all the songs that motivate me and keep me calm. Music changes my mood and makes me happy, said Dharmakeerthi.
In her words, an obstacle is actually an opportunity and any obstacle is difficult if we take it as a problem.
Common problems
I look at all obstacles as challenges that are going to shape up my life and develop my personality. The common problems I had to face were balancing studies with the Prefect-ship, being focused, being liked and respected, staying motivated, handling stubborn people and dealing with peers and society, said Dharmakeerthi.
Her final message to the youth is a powerful one.
I would like to tell all young leaders who are struggling hard to balance their life with extra curricula and academics, that you are all amazing and wonderful. I want you all to be strong and confident because you have the power and potential to change the world into a better place. Use your strengths and talents to create the life of your dreams. Be a kind-hearted and a caring person. Dont ever stay stagnated in one place. Keep going. I know it is very hard sometimes but dont give up. Youth is the best period of your life. Spare that extra hour of sleep for studies. Work hard and rise with pride. You can do it! summed up Dharmakeerthi.

CB DEFENDS RUPEE
GOVERNOR SAYS AMPLE MEASURES TAKEN TO STABILIZE ECONOMY
The Central Bank debunked speculation that the countrys economy was collapsing and requested the public not to panic.
The Central Bank is confident that it can professionally handle the countrys current exchange rate issue and debt situation, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy told at a press conference at the Central Bank (CB) auditorium yesterday.
We have now come to a better position through aggressive intervention in the market and through various measures to curtail luxury imports.The pressure on the exchange rate will abate, Dr Coomaraswamy said.There is enough technical excellence in this organisation to come out of the situation we are now in and we will, he said.
According to the Central Bank, the exchange rate had depreciated at a faster rate of 9.7 percent so far in 2018. The Government and the Monetary Board of the CB adjusted the gold and vehicle duties and most recently introduced a raft of measures to cut the non-essential imports, the Governor said briefing on the interventions made to defend the Rupee.
These are intended to be temporary measures. As soon as there is stability in the market, these can be taken off, he commented.
Let me recall that in 2015 about USD 3.2 billion was spent to defend the Rupee, but the Rupee depreciated by 9.5 percent. In 2011-2012 USD 4.1 billion was spent, but the Rupee depreciated by 15 percent.At that time, there was also a credit ceiling imposed without discriminating luxury goods, essential goods, intermediate goods and capital goods, the CB Governor said.
In 2018, so far we have had 9.7 percent depreciation of Rupee, but on net basis we have only sold USD 184 million to the market.We have protected the reserves. The measures orchestrated this time have been very carefully selected, and we have not touched capital goods, essential imports and intermediate goods. This is a far more nuance and sophisticated intervention compaird to that crude credit ceiling which was imposed in 2012, Dr. Coomaraswamy remarked.
In 2015 and in 2012, there were fiscal slippages which contributed to the currency depreciation, but this time there had been no slippage. This situation arose basically due to external developments, he added.
I hope that the situation would stabilise now.There is tremendous amount of misunderstanding and ignorance about the exchange rates in this country. I have worked in about 20 countries.The attitude to the exchange rate in this country is unique. People think if the currency is depreciated the economy is about to collapse. Our reserves, growth and inflation are ok. From where does this economy collapse then he asked.
Our reserves have come down a little because of debt repayments and some interventions in the currency market, but we are anticipating USD 1 billion within a week from the China Development Bank and we are hoping to raise USD 500 million more from the Panda Bond and Samurai Bond. We are planning to have another International Sovereign Bond issuance before the end of this year. There is plenty of money that is going to come in terms of reserves, the Governor said explaining that the CB hopes to increase foreign reserves from the current USD 7.3 billion to USD 8.3 billion towards the end of the year.
The CB Governor stressed that having competitive exchange rate is crucial to increase exports, adding that increasing exports is necessary to come out of the debt, which is a major millstone around the economy. Without getting exports up, we are going to be in this mess in terms of debt forever and ever he noted.
Now it has actually come to a competitive rate, but I understand that it can have impact on the cost of living. We have to take that into account. Fortunately, this currency depreciation has come at a time when inflation pressures are muted in the economy. Food price inflation is very low. Though currency depreciation may lead to bus and train fare hikes and prices of imported goods going up, its impact is relatively low. The domestic production is competitive and this limits the import prices of imported goods going up, the CB Chief analyzed.
The CB Governor stressed the need to stop subsidising foreign producers at the expense of our local producers. Our imports have doubled compared to our exports because of the overvalued exchange rate, which we had for years and years. Having a competitive exchange rate is critical to support our domestic producers. There is nothing wrong in importing goods, but we must be able to earn to pay for the imports, he added.
He announced that the Central Bank decided to maintain policy interest rates at current levels at 7.25percent and 8.50 percent because of the relatively slow economic growth, tight liquidity conditions in the market, high nominal and real interest rates and keeping the inflation rate within the target.
Tight monetary policy conditions are observed globally with the continuous strengthening of the US dollar. These have accelerated capital outflows from emerging economies resulting in depreciation of local currencies, the Central bank announced.
There had been arguments in favour of increasing interest rates as other countries such as India, Indonesia and Philippines have done that, but we must keep in mind that those countries have very high economic growth and lower nominal and real interest rates where as Sri Lankas current economic growth rate was only 3.7 percent in the first half of the year, the Governor commented.
Given that Sri Lanka is a twin deficit country, in terms of budget deficit and current account deficit, the chances that Sri Lanka attracting new money at this juncture is very minimal indeed. By increasing interest rates, we will not be able to attract new money or keep the money already invested, the Governor justified the decision to keep the policy interest rates on hold.
He also said that the countrys economic growth would not exceed 4 percent this year.
Responding to a question by a journalist on the purpose of suspending duty free vehicle permits for MPs for one year in a context where all MPs have already purchased their duty free vehicles, the Governor said the policy had to be imposed in common to public officials, professionals and politicians. What would have been your reactions, if we excluded politicians from the category I dont have the data as to how many MPs have utilised the permit, but we did not want to specifically leave them out, he replied.
Senior Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said USD 467 million of foreign exchange had gone out from Government Securities this year. He said last year there was an addition of USD 440 million of foreign investment to the Government Securities.

Govt. Analyst to submit report in three weeks
The Government Analysts Department said that it will release the report regarding the controversial voice clip believed to be of former TID Chief DIG Nalaka Silva and Anti-Corruption Movement Operations Director Namal Kumara, in three weeks.
The CID has obtained statements from DIG Ranmal Kodithuwakku, DIG Nilantha Jayawardena of the State Intelligence Service, and ASP Prasanna Alwis of the Divisional Crime Investigation Unit, Colombo, who are said to have been mentioned in the voice clip.
The voice clip allegedly contains details of a conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
DIG Nalaka Silvas office was sealed by police officers of the CID on Sunday. According to senior officers at the Police headquarters, the CID seized two laptops from the former TID Chief's office.
The TID Chief was sent on compulsory leave pending the inquiry into the alleged assassination conspiracy.
The CID had already started an investigation into the mobile phone which it received from Namal Kumara, allegedly containing the controversial conversation.
However, court ordered the Government Analyst to investigate the voice clip recorded in the mobile phone.
According to the CID, DIG Nalaka Silva will be summoned to the CID to give a statement on the alleged assassination plot.

Govt. has given free education for future prosperity of our children - President
The government has been strengthening free education over the past three-and-a-half years, since the future of the country depends on the prosperity of children, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was speaking at the opening of an indoor stadium complex at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Colombo, yesterday.
Addressing the gathering, the President said that not only the future of the country, but also the future of people and of the world are linked with the future of children.
As a state policy, the present government has increasingly strengthened free education during the past three-and-a-half years, while providing equal opportunities for children to receive free education, the President said.
No one can put a limit on education. Education which doesnt have boundaries is the guiding light of the entire world, President Sirisena said.
He said that investments in the fields of education and health will yield long-lasting results.
Free education and free health facilities available in the country have created and produced iconic persons. All over the world, education has resulted in producing productive people. Sri Lanka is not an exception as the countrys free education and free health service have been creating experts, he said.
Free health facilities have resulted in creating a healthy nation and free education has created an educated society. The country is on par with developed countries where the health sector is concerned, the President said.
The President further added that we are ahead in several fields in the world arena. Education and health sectors are among them. Sri Lanka has achieved tremendous progress in controlling the problem of illicit drugs and drug trafficking. As a result of the initiatives to eradicate the drug problem, Sri Lanka is among the two countries appreciated by the United Nations, President Sirisena said.
Unlike some other countries, it is illegal to smoke in public places in Sri Lanka. Besides, smoking in the public transport service is prohibited. In some developed countries, there is no spiritual development of the people, he said. I believe that the Buddhist culture and Buddhist vision has resulted in the spiritual development of the Sri Lankan people.
Excessive use of technological gadgets has become a threat to mental health, President Sirisena said. With advancements in technology, people have become robots. Human qualities have come down, he said.

Has the Sports Minister been upstaged and hoodwinked
A few days ago, there were unconfirmed reports that the Minister of Sports had instructed Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to replace the national selection committee. It was also reported that the Minister had wanted Angelo Mathews place restored following his removal from the captaincy that he deemed unfair and rightfully so. Amidst all this drama being played out behind the screen, there was a press conference held at SLC attended by the captain elect, head coach, and the entire selection committee.
The general temperament witnessed from the head table no doubt reminded the media personnel of a bygone era where questions disliked by the people calling for the press briefing was arrogantly browbeaten into silence and submission. These gentlemen needs to be reminded that times have changed, and media policy indoctrinated by the present leadership headed by His Excellency the President, the Prime Minister and the government is quite different, and today there is freedom for transparency and an environment to pose questions that are of national interest and general public wellbeing. So, any official holding a position of national office is obligated to respond to any question/s posed by the media in the public interest. For any unknown reason an official is unable to respond to any question/s such officials should not be calling for, nor attending press conferences.
At first glance all appear quite normal in spite of the jittery setting. However, what started to raise a few eye brows once the press conference commenced were; a) The Competent Authority wasnt in attendance to chair the press conference as is usually the case nor was the CEO or the COO. b) The entire selection committee was in attendance perhaps for the first time in the history of SLC. c) There was complete break from protocol where the chairman, selectors read out the squads for the upcoming ODI and Test series against England. The normal practice is for the team to be announced by way of a press statement upon being approved by the Minister of Sports, and released simultaneously to all media and relevant institutions. Anyhow, announcing teams at press conferences was a recent phenomenon introduced by the Sumathipala administration to bask in cheap media exposure. The chairman, selectors should know better that the selection of national teams needs to be done behind closed doors and not in a public forum like reality shows that have become very popular in this country. It was in extremely bad taste to publicize the finer details related to their decisions where individual players are concerned as it destroys trust that is a key criteria in building teamwork among players and administrators.
The chairman should take a leaf out of previous selections committees who never even appeared at press conferences despite the achievements they accomplished. A good example is how the average cricket fan in other countries does not even know who sits on their respective selection committees as they carry out their sacred duties with utmost discretion protecting the integrity and transparency of this extremely sensitive process. Perhaps, the current chairman does not know the protocols that needs to be upheld and adhered to as he has never served on a selection committee prior to been installed as chairman by the Sumathipala administration.
What prompted this break from protocol Were the two squads announced by the chairman, selectors have sanction from the Minister as dictated by law Was the ODI and Test squads picked simultaneously to hoodwink the Minister by including Angelo Mathews in Tests whilst leaving him out from the ODIs The 3-match Test series starts only in November. What may be the haste to announce it now What raises further suspicion over the real motive is the squad for the one off T20 game that is right after the 5 ODIs not announced Under normal circumstances, the squad for the ODI series would have been picked first. It is understandable if the squad for the one off T20 was announced concurrently. But, announcing the Test squad prior to the T20 squad does raise some serious doubts.
The question that begs to be answered is if there is a sinister cats paw lurking in the background
Was this press conference held at the behest of such elements Are there attempts to upstage the Minster and make him uncomfortable with executive immunity to checkmate his moves to take corrective action in order to safeguard interests of a few individuals striving to creep back into SLC by hook or by crook
Such moves being afoot was further demonstrated by what was disclosed at another press conference that was conducted concurrently. This was by none other than the former Minister of Sports who made several allegations against a former captain, chairman and a cabinet minister. What was unwittingly confessed during the press briefing was his knowledge of Sumathipala having connections to the gaming industry. That being the case what the former needs to explain to the general public is his rationale for permitting such an individual to contest SLC elections in violation of the countrys Sports Law and rules of the ICC. What the former Minister needs to be reminded is that two wrongs does not make one right. It was further disclosed by the chairman selectors that he was carrying out match referring duties with the express approval of the former Minister of Sports and that double hatting did not interfere with his selection duties. How a member of a national selection committee can carry out selection duties and identifying young talent whilst being overseas for long lengths of time is mindboggling. It was such distressing decision making by people in authority that has created the untenable crisis SLC is grappling with at present.
Another major piece of misinformation that was stated by the head coach when being grilled by media personnel is his statement that the Bangladesh team had a 20 point advantage over Sri Lanka in the ODI rankings. The head coach needs to be educated that Bangladesh only has a 13 point advantage over us and that too after the recent losses at the Asia Cup 2018 where a team loses more points when defeated by a lower ranked team. It is extremely surprising to learn that the head coach is unaware of the standing of his team in the ICC rankings. Under such circumstances, nobody needs to be surprised at what is on show.
As a responsible national newspaper the Daily News is laying out these startling revelations for the benefit of the Minister of Sports who we are confident is resolved to take decisive action and set a new course for this rudderless ship, and steer it back towards winning ways.

Heavenly intervention
Devol is a deity subjected to worship and belief in Sri Lanka. The deity, like his contemporaries, is believed to possess a heavenly intervention in curing the incurable. He is one of the twelve deities worshiped. The deity is believed to be intervening in the affairs of the worldlings. The practice of the worship of Devol deviyo or the cult of Devol is widespread in the Southwestern lowlands and coastal areas. The devotees who make offerings at the shrines and perform rituals usually seek vengeance, benevolence and prosperity from the deity to solve their day to day problems. Firm in that belief, such a procession was witnessed recently in Kolonnawa.

Imperious Osaka saunters into China Open third round
Beijing, Tuesday: Naomi Osaka is keen to move on from the bittersweet memories of last months US Open triumph and she did just that with a ruthless display at the China Open on Tuesday.
The young Japanese star thrashed unseeded American Danielle Collins 6-1, 6-0 in just 53 minutes on Beijings outside hard courts to saunter into round three.
The 20-year-old Osaka, whose maiden Grand Slam was overshadowed by Serena Williamss row with the chair umpire in New York, faces 10th seed Julia Goerges next in the Chinese capital.
Osakas reputation is growing fast and organisers on Tuesday said that she has booked her place in the season-ending WTA Finals Singapore for the first time.
But the world number six has appeared to struggle with the fall-out from the tempestuous final at the US Open, where Williams branded chair umpire Carlos Ramos a thief and later accused him of sexism.
For me, I dont know, I dont know, the memory of the US Open is a little bit bittersweet, Osaka said on Monday.
Right after, the day after, I really didnt want to think about it because it wasnt necessarily the happiest memory for me.

India eye Windies boost ahead of Australia tour
RAJKOT, Tuesday: Keeping in mind the tough Australian tour next month, India's cricketers are looking for some confidence-boosting home victories against the West Indies from Thursday. The number one Test side and the winner of last week's Asia Cup start as favourites against the eighth-ranked West Indies in the series of two Tests, five one-day internationals and three twenty20 games.
"West Indies doesn't have a team to compete against India. They don't stand a chance at all," veteran India spinner Harbhajan Singh told news agency AFP ahead of the first Test in Rajkot starting on Thursday. But India may not find it so easy, with series defeats this year in England and South Africa revealing some serious chinks in India's armour, at least away from home.
India, under talismanic captain Virat Kohli, have new faces in uncapped batsman Mayank Agarwal and fast bowler Mohammed Siraj.
Siraj will bolster the pace attack led by Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav who could trouble the relatively young West Indian batting line-up.
Meanwhile, spinners Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav are a formidable force on home turf.
The Jason Holder-led West Indies are arriving off the back of a successful home season where they drew a Test series against Sri Lanka and then drubbed Bangladesh 2-0.
ROACH RETURNS
The erstwhile cricket powerhouse have been bolstered by the return of experienced quick bowler Kemar Roach who will join fellow pacemen Holder and Shannon Gabriel.
"We have played some really good cricket in recent times. Quite a few of our guys stood out individually and we have to keep that collective strength," Holder was quoted as saying by The Hindu newspaper.
"India is the number one Test team. They have played some good cricket despite their last series (against England). It will be a good test for us," Holder, captain in 26 of his 34 Tests so far, said.
Holder also said that leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo could prove to be key on turning Indian tracks.
"He has been around for a while and doing well. The conditions could favour him a bit more here. We expect him to come into play in this series and be a match-winner," he said of Bishoo. It will be West Indies' first India tour since the Caribbean side abandoned their 2014 trip due to a players' pay dispute with the national cricket board.
INDIA SQUAD: Virat Kohli (captain), Lokesh Rahul, Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant (wicketkeeper), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur.
WEST INDIES SQUAD: Jason Holder (captain), Sunil Ambris, Devendra Bishoo, Kraigg Brathwaite, Roston Chase, Shane Dowrich (wicketkeeper), Shannon Gabriel, Jahmar Hamilton, Shimron Hetmyer, Shai Hope, Sherman Lewis, Keemo Paul, Kieran Powell, Kemar Roach, Jomel Warrican, Alzarri Joseph.

JO's manna  from heaven
There is much brouhaha these days over a statement made by the Head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith and the response to it by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Delivering a homily at the morning service at St. Mathew's Church in Ekala, Ja-Ela, His Eminence observed that human rights had today become the religion of the West and that Sri Lankans could well do without the Western concept of human rights, which is anyway an integral part of teachings of all the main religions practised in this country.
Minister Samaraweera taking exception to the Cardinal's remark went on to state that Human Rights were necessitated today due to the incidents of the past, such as the Inquisition, where marauding hoards burnt non-believers at the stake. He also made the claim that His Eminence was ignoring these facts in trying to be a populist.
It is unfortunate though that he chose to draw a parallel from the Inquisition which occurred during medieval times that is hardly relevant to this day and age, when there are many other examples he could have cited from more enlightened times to buttress his argument in favour of upholding human rights.
Minister Samaraweera is no stranger to controversy and is known to call a spade a spade. On many an occasion in recent times he had rubbed on the wrong side of the Buddhist clergy too, particularly over his suggestion to keep liquor shops open on Poya days and permit females to be employed at bars and restaurants.
His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith is also not entirely free of controversy, coming into conflict with his own Church, when he upheld the suggestion to introduce the death penalty though he subsequently clarified his position on the matter.
The Joint Opposition has however lost no time in cashing in on the spat, with His Eminence having as his unlikely allies Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila - two dyed in the wool Sinhala Buddhist nationalists - to defend his stance. The duo, more than the Catholic MPs in the JO fold, has got behind the Cardinal to raise their voice against the insults and indignities heaped on the Roman Catholic community and the alleged disrespect shown to the Head of the country's Roman Catholic Church by a Sinhala Buddhist Minister.
The duo has added their voice to the call by certain JO MPs in the coastal Catholic Belt in calling for a Black Sunday (Kalu Irida), unless the minister tenders an unqualified apology to His Eminence, with Weerawansa going one better and leading a demonstration of members of his Jathika Nidahas Peramuna against the harm done to a prominent dignitary of the Roman Catholic Church.
We are now only left with the likes of Bodu Bala Sena of Ven. Gnanasara Thera fame, the Ravana Balaya and outfits like the Sinha Le to come out expressing solidarity with His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, which, from the looks of things, is a growing possibility.
And who are the individuals from among the JO's Catholic brigade who had taken the forefront in the agitation to protect the Catholic religion from being desecrated and be the local version of the Knights Templar There is the enfant terrible Arundhika Fernando, who, the other day, chaired a press conference to highlight the insult hurled at the Cardinal and the need for Catholic Action to teach the Government a lesson'. The other individual taking the lead to cleanse the local Catholic Church from the stigma is a certain Nimal Lanza.
Sri Lankans who have a television set at home would not fail to recall how, when this individual was suspected of having a large haul of narcotics inside his residence, the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa homed in on the scene in a helicopter donned in track-suit and accompanied by a group of supporters of the former, marched forth to rescue his besieged loyalist from the clutches of the STF. That was the end of the STF probe.
It is certain that His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith would be the last person to avail himself of any assistance emanating from such quarters, nor would he give his imprimatur for any protest or agitation during Sunday Services in the churches throughout the country. We say this because thus far, the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka had not engaged in any form of rebellious conduct, nor has it been associated with violent demonstrations and agitations against the State. Even when there were certain protests during the takeover of Church-run schools in the 1960s, it never took on a violent form and no priest or Rev. Brother was arrested.
The game plan is clear. The JO is desperate to cultivate the Roman Catholic vote which had eluded Mahinda Rajapaksa at the last Presidential Election and is eying this bloc at least at the next hustings in 2020. The present dispute had come like manna from heaven to the Rajapaksas and the JO is bound to keep the topic on the boil for as long as possible.

JVP protest campaign
Ishara Mudugamuwa
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has organised a series of protests against the governments unfair tax and Cost of Living increases and the burden it has caused the people.
JVP Leader and Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said that his party will begin a series of protests on October 23 from Colombo.
Speaking at a press conference at the JVP Headquarters in Battaramulla, Dissanayake said that the country is currently experiencing an economic recession due to the present governments economic policy.
The government which came into power on January 8, 2015 pledged to create a people friendly economy. It also pledged to enhance the income level of the people and generate 10 million jobs, he said.
But, during the past three years, the government has led the country towards an economic downturn. As a result of this, the people are currently experiencing a huge economic crisis. The government has no proper plan to rescue the country from the debt trap, the JVP Leader said.
Since 1978, the UNP government followed the policy of selling public properties. Therefore, the present government is also following the same policy, he added. The JVP leader questioned whether the government has an ethical right to reduce imports.
He charged that the leaders of this country spending large amounts of money for their personal comfort. At the same time they are asking the public to tighten their belts to face the economic downturn.
We will not let the government play with the peoples intelligence anymore, he added.

ACC under 19 Asia Cup 2018
Lanka defeat Pakistan and qualify for semi-finals

Lanka has highest  per capita in region:  Minister Ranawaka
Sri Lanka is no more a poor country as envisaged by certain pessimists clinging on to outdated statistics. Today, it is a middle income country with a per capita income of US $ 13,000. This is the highest per capita income in the region, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing the gathering at the 40th anniversary celebration of the Urban Development Authority at the Sethsiripaya Administrative Complex in Battaramulla, recently.
Minister Ranawaka said people's needs and their purchasing power had undergone a dramatic change today. Only about six percent of the population could be counted as those in abject poverty. The unemployment rate had decreased to 4 percent of the population. When considering the country's economic direction, this could be considered as a great victory, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said nearly half of the country's population enjoyed urban facilities today. But the statistics department said only one fifth of the population live in urban areas. But the urban population could not be counted on the basis of urban council and municipal council areas only.
"In today's competitive world, wealth is created through the urban sector. There should be efficient trading if a country was to become rich. Sri Lanka should come under rapid urbanisation if it was to become wealthy.
Sri Lanka should become a good trading partner and this is the challenge before us today, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said the Urban Development Authority had achieved many victories today. The first victory was that it had become a professional institution.
Earlier, there was a time when a General Manager was sentenced to one and a half years in jail for writing a letter on the instructions of the minister. When some public servants queried as to why such a punishment was given, the answer was They should be given some shock treatment.
Since then, the UDA functioned under fear and threat. But some people had forgotten the unfortunate fate suffered by professionals in the immediate past, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said there were any amount of projects to be undertaken if unbridled funds were made available. But today, the UDA's vision was that expenditure should be made by earning an income. Expenditure should not be made on projects that do not earn income.
"We should learn from past mistakes. The biggest past mistake was expenditure on fanfare projects that did not bring any financial dividends. This was the reason which had saddled the country with an enormous debt burden," he said.
The Urban Development Authority which was Rs. 39 billion (Rs. 3900 million) in debt in the past, has invested more than Rs. 25,000 million on projects this year.
No other state sector institution other than banks had made such an enormous investment. The UDA should be proud of these achievements. But on the other hand, it had to face many challenges in the future. One of them was that it had to continue certain development projects irrelevant to it.
He said the UDA had undertaken a massive project costing Rs. 200 billion to provide housing to shanty dwellers and uplift their living standards. It had also stepped into resolve the middle class housing problem. The UDA had also intervened to build the Battaramulla administrative city by 2023.
It had also been entrusted to build the proposed light railway network, which is a US $ 7.5 billion project.
The UDA received funding from the government for its projects. But today it was in a position to undertake projects on its own, he said.
Certain people remained idle by blaming the past. But they should try to learn from past mistakes without harping on the past, the minister said.

Under-ground metro stations are associated with rats, garbage, noise and filth, not architecture. However, there are a few metro stations in the world that go against the grain, standing out as excellent examples of the beautiful architecture and interiors that can be created in underground spaces.
The interiors achieved in some of these metro stations become all the more impressive when you consider the challenges unique to creating comfortable underground spaces. The architects must keep track of the structural integrity of the walls, air circulation, excessive moisture, and a million other concerns. Their maintenance is another difficulty entirely  one that transit organizations often have difficulty with.

Dr. Nussbaum inquired about the sectors in which Sri Lanka has interest in attracting German partnerships, to which Minister Samarawickrama explained about the National Export Strategy Sectors like high end food and beverage processing and electronics, as well as other sectors like rubber-based products, automotive components, and renewable energy.

Rising death toll from road accidents
New laws needed, says Minister
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday, that new laws have to be drafted to replace old and outdated laws to prevent the large number of road accidents contributing to death that keeps rising day by day.
He was speaking at a ceremony yesterday to pay compensation to hit-and-run victims where the identity of the vehicles was not known.
Family members of six victims of hit-and-run accidents were provided financial relief worth Rs. 1.2 million, while six injured people from unidentified road accidents were granted Rs. 6 million as relief, by Minister de Silva.
The Minister said that CCTV cameras should be installed at accident-prone areas to identify hit-and-run drivers and implement the law against them. When I brought in new laws to increase fines against errant drivers, some people were opposed to it. It is necessary to change attitudes of the people to prevent road accidents, the Minister said.

NO female JAMES BOND anytime  soon, claims 007 historian
UK: Idris Elba recently shot down rumors that he would be the next actor suited up to play James Bond, becoming the first African-American in the role. Now, a British historian is telling audiences that a female version of the English spy could be decades away.
Jeremy Black, a 007 expert who recently published The World of James Bond, told Fox News that it could take as long as 20 or 30 years for a female star to shake things up on the big screen.
I cant see why it shouldnt happen, he explained on whether the next Bond should be a woman. But Ill tell you one reason I dont think its going to happen. If youre looking at James Bond as a commercial product, the leading film market in the world is the United States. And an increasing portion of the James Bond market is in the Far East, South Asia and in parts of the world where their values are different, shall we say.
These are more male-centered societies. And in those societies, I think it would be a hard sell to have your leading secret agent as a female. Now that may well change in 20, 30 years time. But I think one has to be aware there are commercial reasons.
TheWrap.com previously reported the last 007 film, 2015s Spectre, was the second-highest grossing entry in the franchise with $750 million global rung up by December. It also outperformed 2012s Skyfall, in several foreign markets, specifically in China, where it had taken in $83 million since opening on Nov. 13, compared to the $59 million overall taken in by the previous film. Both films starred British actor Daniel Craig, who currently has four Bond films under his belt. The 50-year-old is set to return in the still-untitled movie, known now as Bond 25. While the idea of the first female Bond in a film would easily stir headlines, Black pointed out it would be a major gamble for a franchise that has Star Wars as its biggest competitor financially.
The present Bond films are much more action-oriented, he explained. More fights, fast chases and less talk than in the films of the 1960s or 70s. That is because more of the audience is people who dont speak English as their first language. The fights and chases make much more sense to them than if youre going to have a lot of conversation. And it is a commercial product.
Elba voiced his support for a female Bond to Variety in January.
Are we interested in having a Bond character other than being a male said the 46-year-old British actor. It could be a woman  could be a black woman, could be a white woman. Do something different with it.
Why not But Rachel Weisz, an Academy Award-winning actress who is married to Craig, told The Telegraph in February she was not into the idea of a female Bond because the mastermind behind the stories, English author and naval intelligence officer Ian Fleming, devoted an awful lot of time to writing this particular character, who is particularly male and relates in a particular way to women.
Why not create your own story rather than jumping onto the shoulders and being compared to all those other male predecessors added Weisz, 48. Women are really fascinating and interesting, and should get their own stories. Still, Black is hopeful that the future will bring a female 007.
My guess is that at some stage, they will go for a female James Bond, he said.
But Black pointed out the most famous spy in cinematic history has already been changing with the times.
If you look at the recent films, James Bond as a character has been having fewer female relationships, he explained. Hes become a serial monogamist. Whereas Roger Moores James Bond usually had multiple partners, one after the other, in the same film. Now, theres generally one female partner and theres very little emphasis on that side.
James Bond doesnt really smoke anymore. He drinks a little bit just to deliver his signature line. And while he has little to no sex, he kills far more people than ever before. It is a strange aspect of the political correctness of the character. There are currently 26 films dedicated to Bond in Hollywood. Black said it has maintained a specific formula in its story, which has been the secret behind its lasting success, despite its changing roster of actors embodying the leading role.
In a way, having a secret agent who was British, not American, was less controversial in many foreign markets, he explained. But essentially fast chases, cars, attractive women, sinister villains, a plot where James Bond has to be captured, a villain that rather just shooting him, explains what he is going to do, this quest to save the world  that seems to be a market that operates very well for different groups.
When it comes to actors who have played Bond, Black has his favorites.
I can believe Sean Connery killing someone with his bare hands, he said. I find that very difficult to believe of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. The one who is most liked of the original stories is Timothy Dalton. The James Bond of the stories He kills people, but hes quite troubled. Timothy Dalton best presents that. [But] Diamonds Are Forever was Sean Connery at his most polished It just worked. - MIRROR

No need of military to contain Aava group - Minister
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said he was confident the situation in Jaffna can be brought under control shortly and saw no reason to obtain military assistance.
Expressing his views on the recent statements made by the Army Commander regarding the Aava gangs in the North, the minister said there is no need for military assistance to control the Aava gang.
Recently, I went to the North to find out details about this situation first hand and in fact these boys are between 16,18 and 20 years. They are trying to imitate South Indian films. However, the situation in the North is not as bad as the South portrays it to be. This situation only exists in the Chunnakam, Manipay, Kopay and Jaffna police divisions out of 53 police divisions in the North. Of these areas too the most significant gang activities are restricted to the Inuvill and Kokkuvil areas.
These groups that began around 2011 have so far not committed any murders but have engaged in attacks using swords and knives.
However, we will not take these incidents lightly and we will take every measure possible to bring this situation under control.
The government is making a great effort to establish law and order in the country. As a government we have taken many steps to establish freedom and democracy in the country. Great efforts have also been taken to establish law and order in the country. These underworld activities are not those that commenced during our government. These underworld gang activities have a long history. However, most of these gang violence is among these underworld gang members. But, having said that we cannot keep our eyes closed. Most of these gunmen are those who had fled the army, but the police is taking every possible measure to bring these offenders to book.
He noted that there are some who allege that the crime rate in the country has risen. However, as the subject minister I must emphasize that based on facts and figures available, it clearly shows a decline in the number of murders, rape, theft etc. However, I have instructed the police to continue with their efforts and increase their operations. The Special task Force too plays a big role in this effort. We also need to strengthen the intelligence service further.
If we are to safeguard the government and the police from these accusations, then we must act accordingly,Minister Maddumabandara said.
Minister Maddumabandara assured that the situation in the North is still within our control and the government will not allow it to escalate out of control at any cost. As the minister in charge of the police he gave this assurance adding that for various reasons these children have gone in the wrong path due to various social factors and if the military is used to control them, it will send a wrong message to the world. On the other hand, we dont need to establish military rule in the country. Hence, I see the statement by the Army Commander as a very inappropriate statement.
I will hold discussions with the President and Prime Minister regarding obtaining the assistance of the military in controlling the underworld and the drug menace in the country, he said.

Ode to a mighty warrior
One is a university professor cum linguist, the other a lawyer cum artiste. So what will happen when they get together Weeramunis cast gives a majestic ode to the age-old legend of Ravana.
Namel Weeramunis 2018 theatre production, an excavation of Ravana, focuses not on the god-like human figure, but the humanity of a human god. Professor JB Disanayaka found a suitable producer in his batchmate, Namel Weeramuni. The seasoned playwright gave the nod to his erstwhile batchmates proposal provided some modifications applied. There was aesthetic value embedded in it all right, but Weeramuni did not find enough depth or meaning to complement the aesthetic elegance.
I took some time and suggested to him to add an interlude with a powerful depth and meaning. I also suggested a story outline. But he was not quite satisfied with my idea. Yet he authorized me to alter and modify the plot.
Disanayaka had a reason to oppose Weeramunis play. He has placed the play in the god. Rama is considered a god in India where an effigy of Ravana is burnt every year. As for Weeramuni, he claims to have done justice to the play with the modification. He took advantage of the permission given by Professor Disanayaka and applied breakthrough-kind of modifications.
Weeramuni took time to combine his own part and the part Professor Disanayaka had written in his childhood. Rama questions Seethas purity. That speculation is fair, as Seetha was under another mans custody and chances are high for a molestation. Rama also entertained fears if Seetha was unfaithful. In response, Seetha claims that she stayed untouched. Ravana kept Seetha in captivity only to avenge Rama who cut his sisters ear.
Weeramuni moves on to another stratosphere with that well-known story. Ravana offers a plea to Seetha to become his queen consort. He is capable of anything as the lord of Sri Lanka. But then Seetha puts forward something that Ravana cannot fulfil. That particular demand is something even an animal could not fulfil. What is that demand You will get to see in the play.
I think Seetha must have got a bit of a soft corner for Ravana while she was under his captivity. Because he did not harm that would have sufficed for her to grow fond of Ravana, Weeramuni said.
Weeramuni believes in Ravana, as he has read quite a lot about the mighty king. He believes in evidence that the king was smart and clever. He does not set aside the belief that the king had ten ways of thinking. As a medicine man, astrologer and so many other roles coupled together, Ravana could have existed, Weeramuni notes with confidence though he is not sure about the exact period.
Probably 5000 years ago, but the surprising fact is that Ravana had already engineered a plane long before the Wright brothers. That advanced civilization came in tatters owing to the invasion from many quarters.
The invaders devastated our civilisation. Our decline is because of them. They call us demons. Ravana was not a demon. He could have been a tough man though. That could be why he was called a demon. It is simply like Sinhabahu. He was not a beast. He was not a lion. He was exactly a man who was a leader of a sect or a cult. I am not a fanatic of Ravana like most other people. But I do believe that such a man existed on this very land, Weeramuni remarked.
The Ravana tale is relevant to the contemporary society because of might and strength the ancient king has showcased. He is reputed to be one of the greatest kings that the Sri Lankans had in the history.
These great men became gods afterwards because of the noble deeds they had executed. They are worshippable. That is what I believe. They were also intelligent and important people. I remember SWRD Bandaranaike was an object of worship close on the heels of his death. There were people lighting lamps in memory of him in Maradana, Weeramuni said.

Outgoing Maldives President  received $1.5 mn before election
COLOMBO: The outgoing strongman President of the Maldives, Abdulla Yameen, faced allegations Tuesday that he received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before his surprise election defeat last month.
The allegations that two cash deposits were made into a private account in Yameens name came to light after local media reported that the Maldivian Monetary Authority (MMA) had lodged a police complaint.
Yameens spokesman Ibrahim Muaz Ali denied any wrongdoing, saying that Yameen maintained a separate account to receive election campaign funding. He did not confirm or deny the amount of any deposits received.
Muaz said the Governor of the MMA had assured the president that there was no wrongdoing and that the banks Financial Intelligence Unit had withdrawn their complaint to the police.

Paul Celans  unfinished poem
Apart from writing his own poems in English to various poetry journals in the UK and the US, the creator scholar Michael Hamburger happened to be the translator of many a creative work in German and French. He is solely responsible for the availability of many a work by two major creators namely Bertolt Brecht and Paul Celan. The latter, though now known quite well by the English readers of the world, he is being rediscovered as a poet who created five major poetic works. Paul Celan (1920  1970), according to his translator Hamburger Happened to belong to a long line of major poets who still remain to be rediscovered in order to place their works in the correct perspective of literary aesthetics.
Hamburger has not only rediscovered the creativity of Clean, but also his personal activities during the short period of life of 49 years he lived. According to Hamburger, Celan had been living in his home in Paris until his suicide by drowning in April 1970 at the age of 49.
Translation and compilation
Simply titled as Paul Celan: Poems (Persea Books NY, 1980) the poems compiled in the volume is selected, translated and introduced by Michael Hamburger. This could be regarded as a yeoman task on the part of the translator cum compiler as it looks a service rendered over a long period. The poems are selected and translated from seven long and short German sources written during the short span of life of the poet Paul Celan. As recorded by the translator Hamburger, Paul Celans poems confront us with difficulty and paradox.
From whichever direction, we approach the creativity, the reader and the literary critic may find the creative thought stream of Celan hidden at times in reality and at times in a realm of fantasy and metaphysics. Though meaningful and understandable from the surface layer of lines, the inner senses are obscure and symbolic.
One such example goes as follows:
The poem is titled as Landscape.
Tall poplars  human beings of this earth!
Black ponds of happiness  you mirror them to death!
I saw you, sister, stand, in that effulgence.
Paul Celan has spent his formative years in a Jewish community that had ceased to be within frontiers of the Austrian empire.
Most of his productive years have been spent in France. His poetic affinities according to Hamburger, were French, Romanian, Russian and English as well as German. There is a poem by Celan that shows this admiration for Brecht translated by Hamburger as follows.
A leaf, treeless for Bertolt Brecht
What times are these
When a conversation is almost a crime
Because it includes
So much made explicit
Some poems sensitively capture the spirit that though he had survived during the Nazi Holocaust he had been fortunate enough to escape the torture.
Imagery to read
As Hamburger states, the literary scholars are still in the process of tracing some of Celans imagery to the books he read, and influenced by, the and the type of life he has spent, the places he had visited and the poetic allusions he makes in his creative process. As Hamburger delves at length, Celan was also active as a translator. His many translations from French included poetry by Rimband, Valery, Appolinaire etc. From the English, he translated sonnets by Shakespeare and Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore. From the Russian selections of poems by Blok, Yesenin and Mandelstam. A reader may not find a book-length biography, Paul Celan.
One of the most anthologised poems of Paul Celan goes as follows.
Go Blind, now today
Eternity also is full of the eye in them,
Drowns what helped images down the way they came,
In them
Fades what took you out of language
Lifted you out with a gesture
Which you allowed to happen like the dance of the words
Made of autumn and silk and nothingness
The inner layer may be a certain type of confession on the acceptance of life as it is. The term blind suggests quite a number of negations from reality.
The reader of Celans poems in translation may feel that he is reading at times a strange kind of love lyrics. But on rereading the inner sense conveyed takes the reader further away from love and romance, a metaphysical layer. One example goes as follows.
That which
Threw us together
Sparkles apart
A world boulder, sun remote, hums
Brevity, as observed, is the major pattern in Celans poetic works.
They cannot be classified into the conventional categories like sonnets, hymns, devotional poems and metaphysical poetry. But the works of Celan as observable embraces the patterns of non-metrical or blank verse or free verse genre of poetic creations.
One example is as follows:
How you die out in me:
Down to the last
Worn-out
Knot of breath
Youre there, with a
Splinter
Of life (P247)
Religious susceptibilities
The reference made as you lay either as a cosmic force or a person to whom the poet addresses his message intended. The poems of Celan perhaps lay fused in religious susceptibilities. But according to the translated Hamburger, the poet Celan had no wish to be a religious poet nor was he a confessional poet. But it is claimed that the element of confession is the expression of the inner feelings of experiences perceived. The words and rhymes convey the experience.
The dependent factor remains to be the thought stream in which a poet expresses. In this direction, Celan could be branded as a poet whose expression is an exception to the rule and/or the conventional patterns of expression. According to Hamburger, Celan had insisted that he wanted to write Hermetic poems. But the term itself lies in a paradox. As such, to which category of poets Celan falls need not worry a reader. He could be spelt out as a poet belonging to all types and all times.
These lines ought to testify Celans ideology.
Once,
I heard him
He was washing the world
Unseen night long,
Real
One and infinite
Annihilated
Zed (itchen in German)
The light was salvation.

Pensions on October 5
The Department of Pensions will pay retired government servants their pensions for October on the 5th of this month as the National Day of Pensioners falls on October 8.
