A wicked sense of humour
One would expect some liveliness from a film that is suppose to be aimed at children but Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children, adapted from the acclaimed debut novel by Ransom Riggs, is anything but sensational.
Though grim is generally a word that is usually connected with Tim Burtons work, the director takes the term to a whole new dimension with Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children. The movie which focuses on children with super natural powers is not a superhero thriller but something straight out of nightmares. The story plays out like a variation on any and all teenage superhero storyline.
Wondrous inhabitants
Asa Butterfield as Jacob
After witnessing the strange circumstances of his grandfathers death, Jacob encounters clues that inspire memories of the stories his grandfather, Abraham, told him as a child about a mysterious orphanage on a Welsh island and its peculiar, wondrous inhabitants. And at the urging of a therapist charged with helping him to distinguish the differences between fantasy and reality, Jacob eventually stumbles upon a kind of wonderland after he and his father, Franklin, travel to the island to determine the veracity of his grandfathers remarkable tales.
Throughout the film, Burton fixates elegantly on the eponymous childrens unique gifts. Once Jacob arrives at Miss Alma LeFay Perigrines orphanage he is faced with characters which he had only heard from his grandfathers stories and ones that many thought were conjured out of the old mans imagination.
There are a few instances when the story is of interest. One particular instance is when we realise that Miss Peregrine has created a loop that allows her and the children to live a particular day over and over again. This wards off the horrors of the future. Jacob is soon absorbed into the ordinary and extraordinary lifestyles of the children at the orphanage.
Cartoonish horror
The creatures whom the main characters are hiding from are particularly scary and really do work with Burtons visual style of making things creepy and beautiful at the same time. The production design surrounding the film is done well and Burtons flair for fiendish and cartoonish horror is second to none. One gruesome scene involves the monstrous creatures dining on a plate of childrens eyeballs.
The powers of the children too are captivating. You get Enoch who has the power to give life to the inanimate with little animal hearts. Hugh has bees living within his stomach. Olive can levitate and must wear a pair of lead shoes so she doesnt fly away and disappear into the clouds. With such resources within his grasp it is a pity that Burton has not made full use of their talents. Instead he lets Jacob, who has the special power to see monsters, lead the action.
Asa Butterfield who has won accolades for his role in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas does his role well and in fact he is the main person who makes the production watchable.
Eva Green who is able to command time and turn into a bird is Miss Perigrine. She makes a worthy headmistress. There are a few times that you are reminded of Albus Dumbledore due to some of her heroic characteristics but Green manages to carry off the role well though she is not given enough screen space.
Miss Peregrines Home For Peculiar Children probably sets the tone for a franchise and Burtons visual flairs and keen eye for design are used well. However this is not a movie for children bedcause it will scare them out of the halls ands give them many sleepless nights.
It is more suitable for young adults and all those who enjoy a horror flick because it embodies a wicked sense of humour.

Pitt on his and Jolies family situation
A week after Brad Pitt confirmed that he and Angelina Jolie are divorcing, the actor finds himself in a strange Hollywood scenario. As the narrator of Terrence Malicks ambitious, 30-years-in-the-making Voyage of Time: Lifes Journey, Pitt would normally be called upon to promote the IMAX film, which arrives in theaters October 7. But because of his headline-making divorce, the actor has elected to sit out this round of publicity, a choice he described in his first public statement since confirming his split last week.
Terrences Voyage of Time is an incredibly beautiful and unique experiential IMAX film for children and families chronicling the birth of time, Pitt told Access Hollywood exclusively. Im very grateful to be part of such a fascinating and educational project, but Im currently focused on my family situation and dont want to distract attention away from this extraordinary film, which I encourage everyone to see.
The film will be released in two alternative cutsa feature-length version narrated by Cate Blanchett and the 40-minute IMAX alternative narrated by Pitt.
Last week, Pitt confirmed that he and Jolie would be separating in a statement given to People.
I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the well-being of our kids, Pitt said, referring to his six children with Jolie. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.
Earlier in the week, Jolies attorney confirmed the split, saying, Angelina Jolie-Pitt has filed for dissolution of the marriage. This decision was made for the health of the family. She will not be commenting at this time, and asks that the family be given their privacy during this difficult time.
Later in the day, the actresss manager followed up with a second statement, adding, Angelina will always do whats in the best interest of taking care of her family. She appreciates everyones understanding of their need for privacy at this time.
Jolie filed for divorce after an alleged argument that took place while the family was flying on a private jet from France to the United States. Because the reported incident took place in flightwhere the F.B.I. has special aircraft jurisdictionthe F.B.I. has since confirmed that it is gathering information about the alleged event before deciding whether to pursue an investigation.

The apparent weight gain could be the result of a prosthetic suit, but the dramatic physical change would certainly be in line with the 41-year-old actress commitment to the craft of acting. Raising three children in the film, Charlize plays the main character Marlo who was gifted a night nanny by her brother, and to her surprise, formed a unique bond with the unique young nanny.
The film is directed by Jason Reitman who, along with Diablo, collaborated with Theron on 2011 film Young Adult. For her Academy Award winning role in Monster, Charlize gained a whopping 30 pounds in the film which saw her celebrated with 17 acting honours.
To gain the weight the actress claims to have eaten lots of doughnuts.
However, it wasnt just about gaining the weight as Charlize claimed at the time that the body transformation aided her in getting into serial killer Wuornos mind.
The convicted killer was executed in 2002 for the murders of six men, a seventh murder she was not tried for. Mail Online

Soul Sounds Academy Choir in Concert
Aptly titled Hello, in a bid to acknowledge and assist children of prisoners to continue their education, the award winning Soul Sounds Academy Choir will come together in exciting harmonies to sing music inspired from the 80s to the present day. To be held on Friday October 14th at the Lionel Wendt, the repertoire featuring complex vocal arrangements encapsulates the spirit and diversity characteristic of pop and rock ranging from the music of Lionel Ritchie to Adele, with a choral twist.
Friends of Prisoners Children, a Trust which was mooted in 2005 by Sister Immaculate de Alwis, focuses on children whose mother, father or both are serving prison sentences and undergo numerous challenges to remain in school, continuing their education. Having begun the programme with just 47 children, eleven years later, there are nearly 300 children being supported annually.
Often, children whose parents are in prison get penalised or ostracised by society for no fault of their own. This leads them into retreating from society and not attending school. By giving them all their school supplies and Rs 1,000 monthly via these scholarships we have provided an incentive for them to remain in school, Sr. Immaculate said in a release. With a number of success stories to be very proud of, Sr. Immaculate also mentions that the intangible benefit is that the children themselves greatly value the fact that society supports them and take on a mantle of courage to face any challenges they may face, feeling less stigmatized as children of prisoners. Scholarships amount to just Rs. 12,000 per year to help a child remain in school.
The award winning Soul Sounds Academy Choir (SSAC), which has won two Gold Diplomas in the Pop and Scenic Folklore categories at the Asian Choir Games, is the senior choir of the Soul Sounds Academy established over ten years ago by Soundarie David Rodrigo.
Comprising singers from their teens to their twenties, the choir has participated at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in Wales, the Christmas concert series Joy to the World with local artistes and numerous international and local events.
The focus of the choir is to push beyond their limits in achieving a sound that is harmonious while being challenging, and this is the first time that the choir would be performing to aid scholarships for prisoners children and the we are privileged and happy to support such a worthy cause, Founder and Musical Director Soundarie added.
Tickets for the concert are available at the Soul Sounds Academy, 57/2, Kassapa Road, off Jawatte Road, Colombo 5.

Former junior welterweight champion Aaron Pryor dies
Boxing Hall of Famer Aaron Pryor, remembered for scintillating duels with Nicaraguan Alexis Arguello, died Sunday at the age of 60 after a long battle with heart disease.
We are heartbroken and sad to announce that our beloved Aaron passed away at home surrounded by his family at 5:57 a.m. Frankie Pryor, his widow, said in a statement from the family home near Cincinnati, Ohio.
He was known around the world as The Hawk but to our family he was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend.
Pryor built a 39-1 record with 35 knockouts during a career that was interrupted by drug addiction.
His biggest moments in the ring were his two junior welterweight victories over Arguello. Pryor's first bout against Arguello is still considered one of the greatest fights in boxing history. He scored a 14th-round knockout to win the match at Miami's Orange Bowl on November 12, 1982, retaining his World Boxing Association crown.
The two fighters squared off in a rematch on September 9, 1983 in Las Vegas. Pryor knocked out Arguello in the 10th round and then announced his retirement.
He returned nine months later, however, successfully defending his title for the final time by defeating Gary Hinton with a 15-round split decision.
It would be 29 months before he fought again as addiction led to the loss of his title due to inactivity.
Upon his return to the ring he was knocked out in the seventh round by journeyman Bobby Joe Young in August of 1987. He retired for good in 1990. Among the boxing legends tweeting condolences was fellow Hall of Famer Sugar Ray Leonard:
My friend and hero of millions of Fight fans has left us! Aaron Pryor RIP Champion and you will be missed. Love you

BCCI to push to bring back Big Three
Anurag Thakur is set for a showdown with current ICC chairman Shashank Manohar during the ICC Board meet in Cape Town, where the richest cricket board will specifically push for a three-point agenda that includes bringing back the Big Three module.
A source in the know of things said that the BCCI top brass will push for inclusion of its representative in the all-powerful Finance and Commercial Affairs (F&CA) committee of the ICC.
The Board will also protest global bodys decision to expand its voting base and get the Big Three module back in fray during the three-day meet.
The first point is non-negotiable, the source emphasised.
There will also be unofficial discussions on affidavit that BCCI President Thakur will have to file in the Supreme Court on his discussion with ICC, seeking governing bodys intervention in adoption of the reforms suggested by the SC- appointed Lodha committee.
The first point in the agenda is to have BCCI representative (either Thakur or secretary Ajay Shirke) in the F&CA committee of the ICC. One needs to be in that committee to officially raise all the key financial issues including budget of the Champions Trophy, the BCCI source told PTI.
The second issue will be letting ICC know that India are not game when it comes to increasing the voter base by including some of the weaker cricketing nations with full voting rights.
India have never shied away from helping the emerging nations with their expertise and infrastructure. But there is a time when a member nation can have full voting powers.
The ICC simply cannot expand its voter base just like that, the source added.
The last but not the least will be the revenue issue where India along with Australia and England were supposed to get a bigger share of the ICC revenue. We certainly do not endorse this idea of entering the common revenue pool. Also the idea of Big Three must be revived and BCCI is having active discussions in this regard with ECB and CA.
With BCCIs relations with ICC hitting an all-time low and the board at the cusp of transformation, it is there to be seen whether there is some sort of redemption when Thakur and Manohar come face to face.
A source in the board informed that Richardson met Thakur in Kanpur after his media interview and both had a long discussion on the issue.
Both had long discussions on a number of issues. As far as the affidavit is concerned, the BCCI president is likely to politely remind Manohar when he (Manohar) was in charge, he filed an affidavit that having a representative of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) will amount to interference. Anurag had just followed up on that issue which was first raised by Shashank, the source added. PTI

SLC offers contracts to 70 cricketers
Sri Lanka Cricket has decided to offer annual contracts to around 70 cricketers in the category of youth, emerging and senior players in a bid to encourage them to press for places in the national team and put pressure on the current players.
There are so many categories of players who are playing cricket so we must look after them. We want the players who have not played for Sri Lanka not to be idling in club cricket but to start putting pressure on the national players and make every effort to play for the country as well as their clubs, said SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala addressing a media conference at SLC headquarters yesterday.
We have decided to look after these cricketers and put them on a national contract. We met about 70 players last Saturday and gave them a proposed agreement and we are informing our member clubs that if there are anybody whom they feel are worthy of contract to inform us.
We will sign the contracts on October 30. The contract lasts from November 1 to April 30. After that date they are free to play in any part of the world. We want to see that our domestic is stronger and protected and give the players something they can be happy about. Apart from the national players we are also looking after the other players as well, Sumathipala said. The players will be paid between Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 100,000 per month.

Sporting grace of injured warriors
The heroics of true heroes will be showcased when the final phase of the 19th Army Para Games worked off from October 12 to 14 at the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium. This was disclosed to the media during a press briefing at the Kingsbury Hotel last evening.
The 2016th edition commenced in April where nearly 1000 Army Para athletes vying for supremacy in 12 Para sports disciplines namely, Archery, Badminton, Shooting, Table Tennis, Wheelchair Tennis, Sitting Volleyball, Rowing, Power Lifting, Cycling, Wheelchair Marathon, Swimming. The climax of the meet, Athletics Championship will be followed by the award presentation and closing ceremony.
Para sports in Army have an illustrious history since the inaugural Army Para Games in 1991. Para sports were introduced to the Army with the aim to reinforce the rehabilitation process of the men injured in battle who were at Ranawiru Sevana. Later all the infantry units were invited and the event became the apex Army Para sports event. This event did not conduct in some years when the Army was fully engaged with battle against the separatists.
Addressing the media, Army Para Games Committee chairman Maj. Gen. Channa Gunathilaka explained how the cause of Army Para Games changed over the years and became the cradle of Sri Lankas international level Para athletes who brought fame and glory to motherland.
Today we have in our fold 2014 Asia Para Games T42 100m and 200m champion Anil Prasanna Jayalath who also created a record in 200m. Pradeep Sanjaya won the T46 400m bronze in 2012 London Paralympics. In 2014 Army athletes secured 100m and 200m bronze medals in Asian Para Games. Armys dominance in Para sports was evident in recent times. Sri Lanka was represented by nine athletes at the Rio Paralympics 2016 and eight of them were from Army. Dinesh Priyantha Herath won the solitary medal for Sri Lanka as he clinched the bronze in mens javelin throw F46 event. So Army has shown continues progress and has become the forerunner of national Para sports, he mentioned.
Our progress is steady and these Para athletes have hinted that they can conquer international scene. All Para athletes who took part in Rio have bettered their performance with an impressive margin. Army has invested a lot in Para sports and we will provide them quality equipment and comprehensive training which are the key factors we have recognized in order to produce top international level athletes. What these athletes lacking are recognition and exposure, so I request all media to provide with due coverage to encourage these great people who have done a great job for the country, Gunathilaka further added.
Gunathilaka thanked Dialog Asiata for strengthening Army Para Games for the second consecutive year as their main sponsor. Dialog helped us on and off many times throughout the history and we hope they will support us in years to come, Army Para Games Committee head stated.
Harsha Samaranayake, GM/Brand & Media, Dialog Asiata said that they are proud to support this important event and extended their support in future for the event. We are really grateful for these injured heroes who did a great scarifies in bringing peace to this country. It is no secret that Dialog fosters many sports in Sri Lanka including the national cricket team. So we are wholeheartedly willing to support this annual event, he mentioned.

We are not funding any money until they rectify their administration. But for the sake of cricket they will be allowed to play in SLC conducted tournaments. Until they get their accounts up and running and they submit the audit reports the SLC has decided not to grant them any money, he said.
