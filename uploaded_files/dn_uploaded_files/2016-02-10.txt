Bill passed amidst pandemonium
The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill which provides for increasing women's representation in local government institutions up to 25 percent was passed in Parliament yesterday amidst strong objections leveled by MPs of the Joint Opposition who shouted various slogans in the well of the House.
The Bill was passed with amendments within a short period and the sittings adjourned at 3.00 p.m. four and half hours before
the scheduled time despite Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promising to grant another day for the Opposition side for the debate on this amendment Bill.
However, as the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella moved the Bill for the Second Reading about 40 members of the Joint Opposition led by MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena rose to their feet and converged on the well of the House and marched towards the Speaker's podium.
The Sergeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekara and his deputies Narendra Fernando and Kushan Jayaratne rushed towards the Mace to protect it.
The debate commenced at 2.00 p.m. after the presentation of papers, oral questions and statements under standing orders 23(2).
However, the Second Reading debate was commenced by the Prime Minister and the same was joined by Ministers Chandrani Bandara, Anoma Gamage, Faizer Musthapa and Opposition Member Mavai Senathiraja. Although the UPFA members on the government side had been allocated 40 minutes to take part in the debate, the UPFA members on the Opposition side had been allocated 41 minutes to give them a fair hearing.
However, none of the names of the members of the Joint Opposition had been nominated to take part in the debate.
Sittings were adjourned at 3.00 p.m. and postponed until 1.00 p.m. today.
When the Bill was taken up for debate, MPs led by MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena stomped to the Well of the House and shouted in protest against the Joint Opposition not being accepted as an Independent group.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commencing the debate said that the Bill was seeking to increase women's representation in the local government bodies and asked as to why the Opposition was trying to disrupt it.
He demanded from the members who shouted slogans to state if they stood against increasing female representation in the local government institutions.
Gunawardena who stormed into the isle was seen followed by the Joint Opposition members that included Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Wimal Weerwansa, C.B.

"We have given additional time to the members of the Joint Opposition to participate in the debate. We could continue the debate and get the Bill passed enabling the increase of the number of women members in the local government authorities," the Premier said. "Tell us if these female Opposition members including Pavithra Wanniarachchi stood against increasing female representation in politics".
As the Premier commenced his speech and the Joint Opposition members were marching towards the Speaker's podium, government members rushed out and formed a protective ring round the Prime Minister .
Among them were Ravi Karunanayake, Lakshman Kiriella, Harin Fernando, Mujibur Rahuman, Kavinda Jayawardena, Nalin Bandara, Chandrani Bandara, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Gayantha Karunathilake.
The Joint Opposition members were heard shouting slogans and hooting in the House attempting to disrupt the debate. Joint Opposition members were heard shouting "Diyaw Diyaw Apata Diyaw, Ape Aitheen Apata Diyaw", "Swadeena Wenna Onay ", "Gedara Yanne Ne Ne", "Kathanayakata Enna Kiyapiya Mewata Uttara Denna Kiyapiya" and etc.
The government MPs who were surrounding the Premier were heard responding to the Joint Opposition members with slogans such as "Diyaw Diyaw Passport ekak Diyaw, Diyaw Diyaw Dineshge purse eka Diyaw", "Buddhadasata Enna Kiyapiya, Mewata Uttara Denna Kiyapiya". Dinesh Gunawardena was heard saying to the Speaker; "go to the Chamber without being a joke". He also was heard telling the Secretary General they would go before Court if the Bill was passed.
Following the Premier's speech the other members joined the debate and Leader of the House and University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella moved the House for the Committee Stage and presented amendments to the Bill amidst the chaos.
The government members were heard shouting 'aye' for each amendment. Later on the Third Reading was passed and sittings were adjourned at 3.05 p.m. Sergeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama took the Mace away and walked through the protesting MPs. MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara after adjournment was heard saying that they would resume their protest today.

British media 'most right-wing' in Europe, survey finds
UK: The British press is regarded as the most "right-wing" and "biased" in Europe, according to new research by YouGov.
The company polled people from seven major European nations to find out how they perceived the press in their own countries. They found that 26 per cent of Britons viewed their newspapers, TV and radio as "too right-wing", more than in any of the other nations surveyed.
By contrast, only 17 per cent of British respondents felt their media was "too left-wing". The other countries in the survey were France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. Respondents to the survey were asked whether they felt their country's media coverage of five key issues was too left-wing, too right-wing, or balanced. The five policy areas analysed were immigration, housing, health, economics and crime.
Between a quarter and a third of Britons felt that British coverage of each of these topics struck a reasonable political balance. However, in each area people were more likely to describe coverage as "too right-wing" than "too left-wing". Only Finnish people saw their own press as similarly skewed to the right, with 23 per cent of Finns perceiving a right-wing bias in their media. All five of the other countries in the survey were more likely to assess their own media as tending towards excessively left-wing coverage. Only 19 per cent of French people, for example, perceived their press as biased towards the right.
Across Europe, an average of 32 per cent of people felt media coverage of the five key issues highlighted by YouGov struck "about the right balance." 32 per cent of Britons feel their media achieves the right balance when covering crime, but the British press fell behind the average European standard in the four other categories.
A mere 18 per cent of Britons felt that the media was reasonable in its presentation of the refugee crisis, with 29 per cent feeling the media was too right-wing when dealing with questions of immigration.

Deputy Speaker hits out at protesters in Parliament
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday condemned the use of Parliament for protests by the Joint Opposition as Parliament is an august assembly.
He said the disruption of Parliament sessions by the Joint Opposition yesterday was an act of terrorism.
The Deputy Speaker made these remarks commenting on a protest staged by the joint Opposition in Parliament yesterday urging the Speaker to enable them to sit as an Independent Group, during a press conference held at his office in the Parliamentary Complex.
The Deputy Speaker said terrorists used to disrupt Parliament by shooting and bombing. Today, the Joint Opposition
disrupted the session. The objectives of both of them were the same, he said.
He said they can not endorse the protest which violated the democratic traditions of Parliament and disrupted its day-to-day proceedings.
He said accepting the Joint Opposition as an independent group was an internal problem of the Opposition. They should sort it out within the Opposition. Asking the Speaker to sort it out is getting him to commit the mistake of dividing the UPFA. That is why the Speaker made it clear that he could not be a party to the division of the UPFA, he said.
Parliament is neither the Lipton Circle nor the Fort Railway Station. It is not a place where one would resort to street fighting tactics, the Deputy Speaker said, adding that it was against principles of democratic struggles.
He said many MPs have one foot in the government and the other in the Opposition. This double standard policy does not suit Parliamentary democracy, he said.
Some members want to be identified as independent MPs in Parliament while remaining in the SLFP. They also hold positions such as SLFP organisers and positions in the district development committees. They should decide where they stand first, Deputy Speaker Sumathipala said.
An MP could stand up in Parliament and announce that he would act independently. That is a right of the MP. But a group coming together and calling themselves independent without making a declaration officially is not acceptable, the Deputy Speaker said.
He said the issue at hand is an internal problem of the UPFA and asked the MPs of the Joint Opposition to sort it out within the UPFA. They should first take a political decision on whether they should resign from the party first, he said.
Increased political representation key to womens success - PM
The issues faced by women cannot be solved by way of commissions, but by increasing their representation in politics, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He said although the government works hard to increase women representation in politics, some opposition UPFA members, including female members attempt to disrupt the endeavor.
Their attempts show who are against increasing women representation in politics. Women in the country should know as to who stands for their rights, the Prime Minister said.
He made these observations yesterday commencing the second reading of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill in Parliament.
He said Sri Lankan women obtained the opportunity to vote with the Sri Lankans being given the Universal Franchise in 1931. Sri Lanka elected the first woman minister in 1956, he said.
We had the privilege to elect the first woman Prime Minister in the world in 1966. She was Sirimao Bandaranaike. I am appreciating her. But some UPFA members are criticizing our attempt. We could elect the first woman Executive President in the World in 1994," he said.
The Prime Minister said the government sought the support of the opposition to increase women's representation. He questioned if Pavitra Wanniarachchi opposed the move. He said there had been a woman Chief Justice, Supreme Court Justices, an Attorney General, Solicitor Generals, Vice Chancellors, Ministry Secretaries. Their representation in politics should be increased, he said.
A Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman raped 100 women during the previous regime. A foreign woman was raped and killed in Thangalle. The suspects have been brought before courts, the Prime Minister said.
He said attempt is to increase the women representation at local government institutions to 25 percent.
Women and Children's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said 53 percent of the population in Sri Lanka are women. They are contributing to the economy of the country. They should be given a prominent position in politics, she said.
TNA MP Mavei Senathirajah said the TNA supports this motion and would agree to increase the women's represenatation even to 30 percent in politics.
Petroleum Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage also joined the debate.
Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill, Constitutional
The Supreme Court has decided that the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday.
The Speaker making a Speakers announcement said the Supreme Court has decided that the inconsistency in the second section of the English and Sinhala copies of the Bill could be amended during the Committee Stage Debate. The Speaker said the Supreme Court order of the case that challenged the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill under provisions of 121 section of the Constitution has been received by him. He said the Supreme Court had decided the section 4 of the Amendment Bill was inconsistent with the section 12-1 of the Constitution.
It could be made non inconsistent by making amendments proposed by the Court.
Fonseka promises to tame unruly elements
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who was sworn in as a new MP from the UNF (United National Front) for Good Governance told the Media yesterday at the Parliamentary Complex that he will do his utmost to prevent the rise of a faction which does not respect law, order and democracy in the country.
He said a certain fraction intending to sabotage the Yahapalana government has emerged. We saw this faction behaved in an unruly manner in Parliament. I will take steps to prevent the rise of this faction, he said. I sworn in as a new MP from the UNF (United National Front) for Good Governance with the blessings of UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said.
He paid gratitude to former Minister M.K.D.S Gunawardene who was his predecessor in his seat. President Maithripala Sirisena also invoked blessings on my appointment as an MP. I will make my maximum contribution to make the Yahapalana government a success.
A former ruler arrested me and jailed me exactly six years ago, he said.
Govt ready to conduct national level inquiry into kidney racket - Kiriella
The government is ready to conduct a national level inquiry with the assistance of the relevant authorities with regard to the kidney racket revealed by the Indian Police recently in Sri Lanka, Chief Government Whip and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.
Responding to a special statement made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, he said the government would pay special attention to the issue.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the government should take action on the kidney racket reported in the Indian media and table the report presented to the Health Ministry in this regard.
He sad it has been revealed that six local doctors had involved in the kidney racket in four private hospitals in Sri Lanka.
Making the special statement under Standing Order 23/2, he said a three-member committee and a five-member Committee had been appointed by the ministry to investigate the kidney scam.
He said a kidney racket was uncovered in 2012/2013. The then Health Minister appointed a committee to compile a report on the matter, but what happened to the report is a mystery.
He requested the government to submit the report of the 2012/2013 investigations as well as the recent report submitted to the Health Minister, to Parliament.
Deputy Health Minister Faisal Cassim said although a report by the five member committee was submitted to the minister on February 5, the report could not be tabled in the House as investigations were still ongoing.
He said the present system of organ donations and transplants would be regulated. We should use diplomatic link between India and Sri Lanka to resolve the issue, he said.
Decision on Attorney General today
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday informed Parliament that a decision on the appointment of the Attorney General (AG) would be made today by the Constitutional Council (CC) when the President forwarded his nomination.
The Speaker replying to a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said there is no political interference into the appointment of the AG.
The Constitutional Council met on Monday to discuss the appointment of the Attorney General as the President had forwarded three names. However, we decided to seek a clarification from the President because as of the Constitution, the President should only forward one name. The Constitutional Council will meet on Wednesday again to discuss the matter, he said.
The Speaker said the Constitutional Council follows the set of criteria adopted in 2002. He said a report on the proceedings of the Constitutional Council was handed over to the President. It would be presented to Parliament shortly, he said.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena sought to know whether the most senior member of the Attorney Generals Department would be appointed to the vacant post.
Even the Bar Association has made a request in this regard. We want to know whether the most senior member, who is acting in the position and whose name the Constitutional Council had approved twice as the acting AG, will be appointed or whether there will be any other decision made to the contrary, he asked.
Dont make the appointment of the Attorney General a political matter. Appoint the most senior and qualified person. A member of the Constitutional Council has asked whether this person can be trusted. The purpose of the independent commissions is to ensure the independence of these sectors, he said.
MP Gunawardena also requested the Speaker to give a ruling on the matter of divulging the information discussed at the Constitutional Council to the media by a member of the council.
The Constitutional Council should have kept whatever decision taken by it as confidential. How can a member of the Constitutional Council address the media without the permission of the Speaker who is also the chiarman of the council It is not a positive procedure to adopt. As of the 19th Amendment, the Constitutional Council should present a report to the President every three months. Such a report has not been presented. The criteria the Constitutional Council adopts in its work should be gazatted and presented to Parliament. Over five months have passed since the appointment of the council, but this gazatte is yet to come. Without such a gazatte, how can the Constitutional Council proceed he queried.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe replying to the concerns of MP Gunawardena said he was happy that the members in the Ppposition have come forwarded to safeguard independent commissions.
When the Constitutional Council was appointed, we decided to go by the set of criteria adopted in 2002 as transitional provisions, until we discuss and bring amendments to it.
None of us in the government look at this problem in a political angle. For me, I dont have personal friends or enemies in the Attorney Generals Department. It is the duty of the Constitutional Council to decide on the appointment of the Attorney General considering relevant facts. We have not decided whether to appoint somebody from wihin the department or consider somebody from outside as in the case of Mohan Peiris, he said.
However, he said time is ripe to think again on re-establishing long held traditions in appointing the Attorney General and Chief Justice. Otherwise, we will have to go by the individual all the time, he said.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the Constitutional Council should first adopt a set of criteria in keeping with the tradition, adding that the councils activities would not be valid if proceeded without such criteria.
MP Gunawardena said the set of criteria adopted in 2002 would not be valid as of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. However, the Prime Minister replied stating that those criteria were adopted temporarily to speed up the functioning of the independent commissions, adding those criteria will be amended in the future, he said.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said, there is no need to hide the three names nominated by the President. Our politics is not to satisfy those in Walauwas, but answerable to the public.
We will not hide anything happened at the Constitutional Council. The people have a right to know them and the activities of the council must be transparent. We will continue to inform the public over the councils work.

Glass ceiling yet to be broken in Japanese politics
JAPAN: Japan will this year mark 70 years since the nation saw women win Lower House seats for the first time in April 1946.
Since then, however, the country has failed to make much progress in increasing female ranks in the Diet and lags far behind other industrialized nations when it comes to closing the political gender gap.
Despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's pet policy to create a society "where all women can shine," male chauvinism dominates Japan's political arena.
Here are questions and answers on the gender balance in Nagata-cho, Japan's political district, and hurdles female candidates face when running for a national election.
As of February 2, women held 45 seats in the powerful Lower House, accounting for a mere 9.5 percent in the 475-seat chamber. The figure is only six seats, or 1.1 points up, from the 39 seats won by women in the 1946 Lower House election.
By party, the Japanese Communist Party has the highest ratio of female decision-makers, at 28.6 percent of all JCP Lower House members, followed by the Democratic Party of Japan at 12.7 percent and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito at 8.6 percent.
In the 242-seat Upper House, the percentage is slightly better with women holding 38 seats, or 15.7 percent of the total. Japan has one of the worst levels of political gender equality among developed countries.
According to a 2015 survey by the Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) on the percentage of female lower house members, Japan was ranked 119th among 190 countries - lower than China, at 58th, and North Korea, at 88th.
As of December, IPU data show about 22.7 percent of lawmakers around the world were women, about 10 percentage points higher than Japan. Mari Miura, a political science professor at Sophia University and a gender equality expert, said many countries that have a much higher percentage of female lawmakers than Japan have implemented gender quota systems to raise the ratio of women. She said it was about time that Japan followed suit.
"Female lawmakers won't increase by waiting for things to turn around naturally," she said.
Explaining that the latest worldwide push is to bring up the percentage of female lawmakers to 50 percent, Miura said Japan will lag even further behind other countries if it does not take concrete measures to seriously reverse the situation.
Observers say one of the major reasons behind the wide gap between female and male decision-makers is the traditional conservative "men at work, women at home" mindset many people still carry today.
While married men usually get full-fledged support from their wives during election campaigns, many female candidates find themselves without such help from their spouses, they said.
Also, due to a lack of understanding, female candidates often face criticism from voters for running for an election when their priority should be homemaking or raising children.
"People have this mindset that politics is the prime example of public work, and that is (the) men's job," Miura of Sophia University said.
Women also tend to lack the financial resources necessary for running for a national election when compared to men, she said.
Koji Nakakita, professor of political science at Hitotsubashi University, also pointed out the lack of enthusiasm among Japan's major political parties, especially the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, to increase female ranks in the Diet.

LG elections: Demarcation of electoral boundaries causes delay
The government has no intention of postponing the Local Government election but the process of demarcating of electoral boundaries takes a certain time, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha said.
The minister was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Mustapha added that however, the Local Government election is expected to be held in June after resolving issues regarding the demarcation of electoral boundaries in the local government wards.
The minister said around 2,000 proposals and appeals with regard to the demarcation have to be considered prior to holding the Local Government polls. "Those suggestions sent by the main political parties with regard to the boundary definitions have to be considered. Each and every appeal is considered during the process of demarcating electoral boundaries," he added.
Mustapha said officials who work on demarcation were advised by the President to take every appeal into consideration aiming to make appropriate boundary definitions.
The minister noted that the intention of the President and the Prime Minister is to take the provisions in the 20th Amendment to the constitution to the rural level.
Accordingly, this is a move to create an MP, who is responsible to an electorate or Local Government division, Mustapha said.
He noted that the Local Government polls will only be held under the new electoral system since the Local Government Act has already been revised.

Obama wants better Wi-Fi in White House
US: President Barack Obama says one improvement he'd like to make at the White House for his successor is to upgrade the Wi-Fi system.
Speaking during an interview with CBS News on Super Bowl Sunday, both Obama and his wife, Michelle, said getting better quality connectivity for the Internet is a serious issue at the Executive Mansion.
Asked by CBS's Gayle King what advice they would have for the next couple, Obama replied, "Well, no ... The whole tech thing, we've been trying to get that straight for the next group of folks, because it is an old building."
"And so there are a lot of dead spots where Wi-FI doesn't work," he said. The first lady chimed in, saying the Wi-Fi system "can be a little sketchy."
"That can be an issue," said Obama. His wife, referring to daughters Malia and Sasha, said "the girls are real irritated sometimes."
The White House, meantime, took a day off from the "Let's Move" campaign to enjoy Super Bowl 50.
The campaign, led by First Lady Michelle Obama, is focused on curbing obesity. But she admitted that the first family takes "Let's Move" off the table for the big game.

## Title: Outsiders sweep to victory in New Hampshire

Outsiders sweep to victory in New Hampshire
Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders swept to thumping outsider victories in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, seizing on the fury of grass-roots voters to rock the elites who control American politics.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose aspirational conservative message contrasts with Trump's populist rhetoric, surged to a surprise second place in the GOP race.

But the nation's second presidential contest failed to clarify the battle between establishment candidates. There are doubts about Kasich's viability in more conservative states and ability to raise money. Marco Rubio faces renewed questions about his readiness after a shaky debate performance robbed him of momentum. And Jeb Bush, the one-time front-runner, did just enough to survive.

That means the opposition to Trump and Iowa caucuses winner Ted Cruz remains divided.

Trump, a brash businessman and reality TV star who has never run for office, and Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist, were both seen as long-shot outsiders when they launched their campaigns. Their victories reflect deep bipartisan anger at professional politicians and suggest that both the Democratic and Republican races will now be long, acrimonious struggles that could stretch well into the spring.

Painful blow for Clinton
New Hampshire also delivered a painful personal blow to Hillary Clinton, who squeezed out the narrowest of victories in Iowa last week. The scale of her defeat  by more than 20 points  is likely to fuel signs of growing internal rancor in her campaign and complaints by Democrats that her message as a progressive who gets results is no match for Sanders' heady demands for a political revolution, which has inspired younger Democratic voters.

The loss was especially rough because New Hampshire has long been kind to the Clintons. It's the state that made Bill Clinton the "comeback kid" in 1992. And Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama there in 2008, salvaging her campaign after a third-place showing in Iowa.

Trump, relishing a victory that restored luster to his claim to be one of life's perpetual winners, which lost some sheen after his second in Iowa, took to the stage at his victory party with a beaming smile and a thumbs-up after defying doubters who had questioned whether he can turn stellar poll numbers into actual votes.

"Wow, wow, wow," Trump said. "We are going to make America great again!"

He spoke in unusually personal terms about his family during his acceptance speech.

The real estate mogul's win is likely to send shudders through the Republican establishment, which fears his explosive rhetoric targeting women, Mexicans and Muslims could hamper the GOP's chances of appealing to a general-election audience.

A hoarse but jubilant Sanders proclaimed his victory to be the result of a "huuuuge" turnout. His emphatic performance will now propel him into a nationwide battle against Clinton as he attempts to shatter the firewall among ethnically diverse voters that she has built in South Carolina and other Southern states.

"Tonight, we have sent a message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington, from Maine to California," he said, before predicting that the race against Clinton was going to quickly get even more contentious.

"They are throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink and I have the feeling that the kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well," he said.

Clinton appeared in her concession speech to be trying to co-opt Sanders' message about an economy stacked against the middle class.

"Now we take this campaign to the entire country. We are going to fight for every vote in every state," she said, foreshadowing a long fight for the nomination that she was once expected to win easily.

"People have every right to be angry. But they are also hungry. They are hungry for solutions," she said, adding that she wanted to rein in Wall Street. "But I know how to do it," Clinton said, implying that Sanders' calls for a revolution were unrealistic.

At 11:15 pm ET, with 75% of Republican votes counted, Trump had 34%. Kasich had 16% and Cruz, Bush and Rubio were tied at 11%. Chris Christie may have hurt Rubio but he didn't do much to help himself and was trailing at 8%. The somber New Jersey governor said he would return home to consider his position, but there was every indication his White House race is now at an end.

On the Democratic side, Sanders led Clinton 60% to 39%. His gaping margin of victory dwarfed the few tenths of one percent by which the former secretary of state prevailed in the Iowa caucuses last week.

Tightly bunched race
The tightly bunched race behind Trump on the Republican side set up an intriguing clash between Rubio, Kasich and Bush in the next battleground of South Carolina, which favors a much more hard-knuckle brand of politics than New Hampshire.

Kasich declared that something "big happened" in New Hampshire that could give him the chance to expand his campaign across the country. The Ohio governor will especially eye Northern and Midwestern states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Illinois, where he message could resonate  if he can stay in the race that long.

There is magic in the air with this campaign," Kasich said.

It was also a good night for Cruz, who was on course to finish third in a state that is much less less receptive to his social conservatism than Iowa.

A chastened Rubio admitted that his debate performance on Saturday in which he was roasted by Christie for repeatedly reciting sound bites was to blame for his disappointing showing.

"I did not do well on Saturday night," he said. "That will never happen again." (CNN)

Speaker tells UPFA dissidents to discuss demand within party
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday in Parliament asked the UPFA dissidents in the Opposition to first discuss their demand to be recognized as an independent group within their party and inform him of the decision reached, observing that it is a domestic issue. He said that he could not lay his hands to the sin of breaking up the UPFA. He was responding to Point of Orders raised by MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Dinesh Gunawardena.
MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Dinesh Gunawardena asked the Speaker to give his final decision whether they would be recognised as a separate independent group in the opposition and if so, whether they would be granted their due privileges. They said the matter has been dragging on for over six months now without a solution.
They also pointed out to a letter signed by 52 joint opposition MPs that has been presented to the Speaker requesting to recognize them as an independent group. "Considering the numbers, our group has the highest number of MPs in the Opposition.
Moreover, unlike other parties in the opposition, we do not join in secret talks with the Government. We also made a request to the Opposition Leader," MP Gunawardena said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commenting on these concerns said there could only be one Opposition Leader and one Opposition in Parliament.
He observed there could not be a Constitutional Opposition and a so called joint opposition at the same time.
"The Speaker has already recognized the Opposition Leader and all in the Opposition should work accordingly.
"When we adopt the Parliamentary Oversight Committee system, we hope to get the active contribution of all. We will share the positions too. Let us solve this problem in consistent with the Constitution and Parliamentary traditions," he noted.
At this point, MP Bandula Gunawardena said that they do not demand to be recognized as a separate party, but as an independent group. Citing various examples from history, he said there had been a tradition of recognizing independent groups in Parliament.
The Prime Minister replying to this comment, observed that in 1989, a group of MPs including Gamini Dissanayake, was given separate time to talk because they were expelled from the party. "Now, let us know whether you are still a part of the SLFP or not. If you are not in the SLFP anymore, then the Speaker has a matter to solve" he said.

Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath Bill in contravention with Constitution
The Supreme Court held that the Theravada Bhikku KathikawathBill was in contravention with the Constitution and required two third majority in Parliament and a referendum to be enacted.

Earlier, a Special Determination petition challenging the Bill titled "Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Act No. 2015" was taken up before the Supreme Court for argument.

This petition had been filed by Shasanika Secretary of the "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Ven. Biyagama Suseela Thera of the Sri Bodhi Vihara Pirivena in Udahamulla, Nugegoda.

In his petition, the petitioner sought a declaration that the Bill shall become law only trough a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum. Presenting submissions before the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Eva Wanasundara and Justice Sisira de Abrew, President's Counsel Manohara de Silva appearing for the petitioner informed Court that intervention by the State to impose punishment on bhikkus through the proposed Bill was not ethical.

He contended that through the provisions of the proposed Bill, the confidentiality of Kathikawath inquiry could be destroyed.

President's Counsel Silva further said criminal proceedings against Bhikkus would result in giving wide publicity to tarnish the Buddha Sasana.

Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Sobhitha Rajakaruna appearing for the Attorney General submitted to Court that section 2 (2), (3) and (4) of the bill could be removed.

Further argument was fixed for today (27).

The petitioner stated that a Bill titled "Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Act No. 2015" was published by way of gazette on December 14, 2015 on the orders of the Minister of Buddha Sasana.

He stated that on January 12, 2016 the said Bill was placed on the Order Paper of Parliament.

The petitioner stated that clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are in violation of Articles 3, 4 (c) and (d), 9, 10, 11, 12 (1), 12 (2), 14(1)(b), 14(1)(c), 14(1)(e), 27 and 28 of the Constitution.

The petitioner said the Bill applies only to Bhikkus of the Theravada tradition and thereby draws a distinction between Bhikkus of the Mahayana tradition and the Theravada tradition, he further maintained that the Bill seeks to restrict the rights and freedoms of Bhikkus of the Theravada tradition in the exercise of their freedom of religion and their freedom of association whilst no such restriction is placed on any Bhikku of the Mahayana tradition or the clergy of the Christian or Catholic communities in Sri Lanka.

The petitioner is of the view that the Bill was seeking to restrict the rights of Bhikkus who do not belong to the Shyamopali, Ramannaya and Amarapura Maha Nikayas or Chapters established under any of the said Nikayas.

Accordingly, the rights of a Bhikku belonging to a Chapter or a Nikaya which is not recognized by or not part of any of the said Maha Nikayas are affected by the provisions of the said Bill.

The petitioner maintained that the distinction is drawn in violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners enshrined in Articles 12 (1) and 12 (2),

(1). Stipulating matters mandatory need to be included in a Kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Thought and Religion.

(2). Appointment of a panel to examine and decide the legality of a Kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.

(3). Powers vested in the said panel is an exercise of Judicial Power.

(4). Compelling a Nikaya or Chapter to conduct an inquiry for every violation of the provisions of a registered kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.

(5). Converting every violation of a decision of the Karaka Sanga Sabava of a chapter or religion to a criminal offence, is a violation of Equality before Law and Freedom of Religion.

(6). Empowering the Minister to frame registration with regard to matters hitherto exercised by the Sangha, is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.

UN probe accuses Damascus of 'extermination' of detainees
SWITZERLAND: UN investigators on Monday accused Damascus of "extermination" in its jails and detention centres, saying prisoners were executed, tortured to death or held in such horrific conditions that they perished.
Over the past four and a half years, thousands of detainees have been killed while being held by different sides in Syria's brutal conflict, the UN commission of inquiry on Syria said in its latest report.
The report painted a stark picture of prisons and detention centres run by the Syrian authorities.
"It is apparent that the government authorities administering prisons and detention centres were aware that deaths on a massive scale were occurring," the report said.
It accused Damascus of committing "extermination as a crime against humanity."
The Syrian government was also guilty of committing a range of other war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, torture and enforced disappearance, the investigators said.
The report, which stretches back to the beginning of the conflict in March 2011 and through last November, is based on 621 interviews, including with more than 200 former detainees who witnessed one or more deaths in custody.
"Nearly every surviving detainee has emerged from custody having suffered unimaginable abuses," commission head Paulo Pinheiro said in a statement.
The survivors had detailed how their cellmates were beaten to death during interrogation or in their cell, left to die of severe injuries sustained from torture or from unattended medical conditions, the report said.
Others died from the "inhuman living conditions", including severely overcrowded and unhygenic cells and lacking food and clean water, with many prisoners for instance forced to use their toilet as a source of drinking water.
Most of the detainees who are known to have died are men, women and children as young as seven, the report said.
Abuse, squalid conditions and deaths were consistent across places of detention and over time, and must have been condoned up the chain of command, it said.
"There are reasonable grounds to believe that high-ranking officers -- including the heads of branches and directorates -- commanding these detention facilities, those in charge of the military police, as well as their civilian superiors, knew of the vast number of deaths occurring in detention facilities," it said.
"Yet (they) did not take action to prevent abuse, investigate allegations or prosecute those responsible."
Damascus is meanwhile not the only one abusing and killing detainees.
The report detailed horrific abuses carried out in detention centres run by the Islamic State group, including massacres and executions of children.

Women's Affairs Minister condemns opposition conduct
Women's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara condemned the disruption caused by the opposition members when the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill providing increased women's representation in Local Government authorities was taken up for debate in Parliament yesterday.
Bandara said that the disruptions by the opposition members were aimed at all women in the country
"It is unethical for disrupting the debate on the Bill which ensures more representation for women in Local Government bodies. This group in Opposition who are talking of a royal family, does not have any regard towards the women and this is reflected by their behaviour in Parliament today," she said.
Speaking at a press conference at Government Information Department, yesterday, Bandara added that a former female minister has also joined this bandwagon.
"Her opposition towards this Bill is regrettable," she said.
Minister Bandara said that the Bill was passed despite various obstacles put in place by the opposition.
Bandara said that women receive a larger representation in Parliament.
"Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardene who strove to increase womens' participation in politics also opposed this Bill and his conduct is highly regrettable," she said.
