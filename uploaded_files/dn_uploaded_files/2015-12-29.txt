Welcome Home Sing-a-Long
Ratnapura is and will continue to be in the spotlight for the fashionable gems it has unearthed over the years and enjoying the distinction of being referred to as the City of Gems. Ratnapura has also unearthed musical gems in the form of Clarence Wijeyawardena, Annesley Malawana and the Moonstones reaching for excellence with their unique brand of music!
When Clarence was a young man wanting very much to be a radio and stage artiste aimlessly searching for help, he met Sri Sangabo Corea who was representing one of the leading multi-national companies. Clarence's heart-rending plea for Corea's help triggered the desire in Corea's mind to help the sad and dispirited young man to achieve his goal.
After a few rehearsals at Corea's home, Clarence was asked to find a partner who would be his lead singer and Annesley Malawana was brought in.
With the very first audition Annesley was confirmed. When Clarence and Annesley had perfected their act, they added the other members of the Group which Corea named The Moonstones. When the Moonstones were ready to go on the air, Sri Sangabo Corea contacted two of his kinsmen Vernon Corea and Vijaya Corea of Radio Ceylon to feature them in a half-hour programme which gave the Moonstones the desired exposure. Bookings, thereafter came one after the other.
Annesley, as the lead singer sang his way into the hearts of his listeners mesmerizing audiences of all ages. Clarence and Annesley became household names known through the length and breadth of Sri Lanka. With the demise of Clarence in 1996, Annesley in his inimitable style kept the name of Clarence Wijeyawardena very much alive by singing his way into the hearts of his audiences as a dutiful friend.
For the very first time in Ratnapura music lovers will be entertained by the ever so popular Annesley Malawana with his incredible style bringing back memories that will never fade away. Samanthi Serasinghe and Padmini Gunewardene have jointly organized a Sing-a-Long featuring Annesley Malawana on January 8, 2016 at Samudhi Hall Ratnapura starting at 7pm.
From curtain raiser to curtain call, it will be Annesley Malawana at his very best and to bring back nostalgic memories. Sri Sangabo Corea will also grace the occasion as the Guest-of-Honour.
