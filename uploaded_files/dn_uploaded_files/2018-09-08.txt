Janabalaya brought to protect the corrupt
The hubbub is over. They came. They protested. They went. Janabalaya Kolambata - Peoples Power to Colombo- had its political exercise, and the politics moves on, with the UNP celebrating the 72nd anniversary of its founding. The Janabalaya message is one of uncertain political trends among the organisers, with a focus on the sharp revival of family bandyism in political leadership, and no message of any future policy changes for the people.
Much of the concerns the government had about this much-publicised political move by the Joint Opposition (JO) seem unfounded. In fact, the government has cause to be pleased at the new strength of the democratic process in the country. The refusal by three magistrates courts for Police efforts to restrain the protesters, showed much of the independence of the judiciary today. The ability of the protesters to gather at key city locations, showed a better organisation of civic activity by the authorities, and the freedom of democracy; in sharp contrast to the protest at Rathupaswala under the Rajapaksa regime, when several were killed.
If the government can wear a decorative feather for the maintenance of peace in the city, it is not too late to think of having a better urban organisation to prevent obstruction to civic movement, while allowing the democratic right to protest. The management of civil and political protest in London UK, during the recent visit of President Donald Trump, is a good example. The protesters were very large in numbers, but the city moved on.
Janabalaya Kolambata had its own weaknesses. The crowd was certainly not as huge as promised. Confined to a limited part of the city, there was no organised rally for any expressions of political strategy or thinking. The fears of possible violence and major breakdowns in service led to most children not going to school, and most offices closing early to enable easy travel to employees. The organisers settled down to a so-called satyagraha near Lake House, which junction was the focus of action, leading up from the crowded Fort Railway Station area. As the sun went down, and political leaders moved to their five-star comforts, there was certainly a carnival mood. The organisers can take credit for the forehead bands that said where protesters came from, but such credit was lost with the drunken merrymaking, with a satyagrahaya becoming a sura-grahaya.
Message from Colombo
Janabalaya Kolambata came after the five-day Kandy to Colombo Walk, also organised by Namal Rajapaksa in 2016, without its planned impact. That walk was to show the Rajapaksa strength within the SLFP, but there were too many political and tactical mess-ups on the way that the message was lost. There was a sharper message to Colombo, and the country from this weeks event. It was the demonstration of the Rajapaksa family in the politics of the Joint Opposition. The media did focus on the Rajapaksa siblings  Mahinda and Gotabhaya, and the son and nephew Namal. Minister Mangala Samaraweera had said this event was to have a peoples chain to protect Namal, who faces several corruption charges in the courts. Such political analysis is good and interesting. Wednesdays show was a wider display of Rajapaksa family politics or Pavul Havula in politics. The promise of more Raja Pavula politics once political goals are achieved. The absence of a rallying point with a meeting to address the participants and the country, was a show of the absence of strategies for the future, other than the Rajapaksa family. The popularity of Mahinda Rajapaksa was certainly unquestioned. Most participants were clear on that. However, Gotabhaya and Namal remained on the political sidelines.
The message from Colombo was one of increasing concern about the rise in litigation against members of the former regime, especially the Rajapaksas and their agents, as long delayed inquiries are moving to the courts. The task for the government is to expedite setting up the other two Trial-at Bar High Courts, already approved by Parliament, and bring more of these probes to the judiciary. This is in keeping with the pledge given to the people by the Common Candidate, Maithripala Sirisena and the UNP-SLFP coalition in January and August 2015. Failure to tackle the issue of corruption effectively enables the JO to talk of revenge through the courts, while seeking to conceal the huge crookedness that prevailed. The Janabalaya came to protect the corrupt.
Rajapaksa Democracy
Mahinda Rajapaksas most quoted line at Janabalaya Kolambata was that President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are able to criticize him in Jaffna, because of what he achieved in the North, and the government is violating the independence achieved by defeating the LTTE, and the peoples democratic rights are violated by postponing elections.
The comment on polls postponement is certainly a line of resonance, which the government should take note of. However, talk of the freedom to criticize him in Jaffna, has more than a touch of the racism that is part of JO and SLPP policy. Defeating the LTTE is certainly worth all honour. However, the failure to seek reconciliation and build genuine peace, moving toward majoritarian policies on race and religion, is something that weighs down his political neck, and is the promise of this organised Janabalaya, too.
While even the limited success of its demonstration and so-called satyagraha could be encouraging to the JO and to Namal Rajapaksa, one must note that much bigger rallies and demonstrations, especially by the left parties in the past, did not bring about the political changes they promised to the organisers. The active participants in such political shows are able to influence public opinion, but only to a limited extend. The changes in a democracy come from voters, and not entirely from the walkers and satyagrahis.
It is important for both the JO and the Government, especially with its divided coalition, to think of the impact this has on the Nihanda Bahutharaya  the Silent Majority. This is the effective force, especially in the context of divisive politics, in electoral democracies. Wednesdays Janabalaya had a limited impact on Colombo, carried wider through the media. It certainly does not show the overall acceptance of a repeat of the Rajapaksa authoritarianism and near dictatorship, by the silent majority of the country. It is near farcical to hear Mahinda Rajapaksa talk of the country heading towards an autocratic form of governance rather than democratic rule. Holding a mirror to himself, brother Gotabhaya and son Namal, will show what autocracy and authoritarianism was in this country, with regular and even purchased elections. Give more strength to the fight against corruption. More probes, more charges, and more to the courts, is the call of the Silent Majority, when the JO/Rajapaksa alliance has no new message to the people.
UNP at 72
As the United National Party celebrates its 72nd anniversary, there are more divisive trends in the politics of the ruling coalition. Sections of the SLFP seek closer links with the SLPP and Mahinda Rajapaksa. These trends are making the UNP to strengthen its unity within the government, with Gam Peraliya moves in the rural sector and increased moves to influence the urban sector with more business policies and investment.
The UNP remains a right wing, pro-capitalist, and neo-liberal party, which is the line of its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. It has challenges when moving towards the coming presidential and general elections. How can it keep its voters who supported Maithripala Sirisena as the Common Candidate for the Presidency in January 2015, and increase its voter base moving away from the disadvantages of the coalition of unity
The party has a major disadvantage with its association with the Central Bank Scam, especially that of Arjuna Mahendran being its choice for the office of Governor. The delays in Arjuna Mahendran coming before the courts, despite an Interpol warrant, is certainly a disadvantage to the UNP.
What it needs to demonstrate when moving to the final stage of current coalition politics, is how it can present itself as a political party with a national following, which can weaken the rising impact of the SLPP, and can it draw support from what is left of the SLFP The next presidential election, any time after January 15, 2019, is the issue of importance to the UNP. How far can it emerge, as a single, independent political party with a strong candidate for the presidency, and an effective winning of seats in the next parliament to have its own Prime Minister are the political challenges today
Ranil Wickremesinghe remains the unchallenged leader of the party, with a political record in a leadership position. Have changes carried out in recent party reforms been effective to meet the challenges of a revived Rajapaksa family move to power How much can it retain the support of minority voters And, how much of the new youth vote can it draw in the coming years Moving away from a common candidate for presidency after nearly 15 years is the stumper for the UNP leadership today.

Alastair Cook: the knocks that paved his path to greatness
England opener Alastair Cook announced his plans to retire from international cricket after this week's final Test against India. The 33-year-old left-handed opener has been one of the great titans of English cricket. In 160 Tests, Cook has collected 12,254 runs and made 32 centuries  all records for England.
Throughout his illustrious career, Cook played many a great knock. Before he bids adieu to the game a final time, it would be a good time to look back at some of the performances that defined his greatness.
60 AND 104* ON DEBUT v INDIA AT NAGPUR, 2006:
In his very first test appearance, 21-year-old Cook left a mark by scoring a 60 in the first innings followed by a composed unbeaten 104 in the second innings against India at Nagpur in 2006. While the match was drawn, Cook's poise and grit was noticeable and the way he handled two champion spinners  Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh  in their own backyard gave a first glimpse of what was to come.
FIRST ASHES HUNDRED - 116 v AUSTRALIA AT PERTH, 2006:
Although this came in a losing cause, Cook's mature performance forced cricketing pundits to sit up and take notice of this young talent. In only his 12th test, Cook smashed his first Ashes hundred on a bouncy Perth track. Chasing a mammoth target of 556, most of the England batsmen crumbled, but Cook showed immense composure in facing Glen McGrath, Brett Lee and Shane Warne and played a purposeful knock to collect 116 terrific runs. While England lost the match by 206 runs, young Cook's performance was the hallmark for them.
SERIES-CLINCHING 122 AT MUMBAI AND 190 v INDIA AT KOLKATA, 2012:
England's 2012 series win in India is a landmark moment in their history. Especially because how, after being 0-1 down after the first Test, they came back to win 2-1. One of the main architects of this turnaround was opener Alastair Cook whose first-innings scores of 122 at Mumbai and 190 at Kolkata allowed England to post dominant totals and put the pressure on India. Again on display were Cook's robust defense and the way he tackled India's ace spinners.
AUTHORITATIVE MATCH-WINNING 118 v SOUTH AFRICA AT DURBAN, 2009:
On one of the fastest pitches in the world, Cook produced a masterful performance in just his third year in international cricket. In the England's 2nd Test against South Africa at Durban, Cook smacked an authoritative 118 against the likes of Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini, Morne Morkel and Jaques Kallis. While the pitch was fast and bouncy, the ball came on to the bat nicely and allowed Cook to assert himself. He set the tone for his team and England eventually won the match by an innings and 98 runs.
MATCH-SAVING 118 v SRI LANKA AT GALLE, 2007:
After being dismissed for a paltry 81 in the first innings of the 3rd test against Sri Lanka at Galle in 2007, England was asked to follow-on as they were well short of the home team's score of 499-8. Another defeat looked imminent, especially with Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas in Lanka's bowling armoury. But Cook held firm and showed immense character to thwart Sri Lanka's relentless pressure on a slow pitch. Cook stayed for six-and-a-half hours at the wicket to score a gritty 118 and ultimately saved the match for England.

Appreciation: Sampath AGALAWATTE  Scholar, Sportsman and Gentleman
Sampath Agalawatte popularly known as Agale, passed away a week short of his 53rd birthday.
He was the youngest of three boys following Dammika and Manjulla sons of the late Mr. Hema Agalawatte, a district court judge and late Mrs. Karuna, a proud home maker. A much loved son, he was very dutiful particularly so during his mothers latter years.
Sampath was a devoted husband to Dilhani and a loving father to Samali, Samal and Sahan. We pray they find strength and comfort at this time of sorrow.
Agale was the quintessential all-rounder at Royal College. An intelligent student who secured the much coveted Donhurst memorial prize for best student, an excellent sportsman in athletics, badminton, cricket and rugby. Although, rugby was his preferred sport captaining the RC 1st XV in 1984.
Under his captaincy, the Royal XV were undefeated sweeping all before them by winning back the blue ribbon of schools rugby the Bradby shield after a span of three years, the Gunaratne trophy against the Thomians, the Philip Buultjens 7-a-side trophy and the league champions trophy.
He led the team on a tour of Thailand at the end of that season. He continued to lead from the front ensuring the team kept the Royal fame inviolate by not just winning all their games on tour but showed tremendous humility and maturity as wonderful ambassadors of Royal College, school rugby and indeed Sri Lanka.
Upon leaving school, Agale joined HSBC bank. Quickly establishing himself as an integral part of his new team. His amiable ways endeared him to a broader socio-economic circle and he thrived in the learning environment of the international financial institution, whilst carving out a corporate profile leveraging his sporting prowess in mercantile sporting events.
He subsequently joined MAS further consolidating his rapid learning of the business world and enhancing his business acumen as he moved up the senior management ranks.
The pinnacle of his career journey however was his time as Chief Executive Officer of TVS Lanka.
A role he enjoyed very much as it enabled him to bring to the fore, his natural leadership attributes. He demanded the best from his team just as much as he demanded of himself. A true servant leader, he would always find time to coach, nurture and mentor emerging talent.
Agales caring nature knew no bounds. He was never too busy or never too tired to extend support and assistance to just about anyone. Always at the ready to do whatever necessary to help a friend or an acquaintance. Too numerous are the occasions to remember, where he has opened his home to family of friends visiting from overseas.
On one occasion he vehemently insisted that my parents visiting from Australia stayed with him despite them having many options for accommodation with family. His extraordinary care and attention in ensuring all of their needs were attended to including a driver and car was most convenient and greatly appreciated by my aging parents.
He later explained that he was the recipient of their hospitality on one of his visits to Melbourne at an earlier time.
Many would recall events, incidents and recollections of similar kind deeds. Yet the accumulation of it all was indeed the essence of the gentleman. Making time to be with elderly parents of his friends who he knew were overseas or just too busy to be there themselves. He stepped up to bring comfort and companionship. Genuinely interested in their well-being. Such was his nature. A gentle soul.
A fun loving, happy go lucky disposition. A loyal trustworthy friend. A son to so many.
I will immerse my sadness in the memories of his calm and reassuring voice of reason. His cheeky sense of humour. His keen sense of fair play on and off the field. His unassuming approach to lifes ups and downs. His exceptional compassion and empathy for the less fortunate.
An endearing legacy of a life taken in its prime. The good, they do die young, dont they
The game they play in heaven, just got yet another outstanding player with a heart of gold the size of a rugby ball!
Rest in peace Agale` my friend.

Bungling SLR deprives Women Tuskers  of possible Asian Games medal
The Sri Lanka Womens sevens Rugby team lost a possible Bronze medal by not participating at the 18th Asian Games rugby sevens held from August 30-September 1 in Jakarta, Indonesia.
According to reliable sources, the rugby administrators were unable to convince the Sports Ministry and the NOC when initial discussions took place for selections of teams and individual events.
Sources further revealed that no representative of the Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) attended the deciding meeting that may have otherwise had the opportunity for the womens rugby team to see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it seemed that in a bid to absolve itself from the blunder and the chaotic situation, the SLR kept on stating that they are hoping to send the team but it never materialized.
What was really baffling was the comment made to the media by one of the top ranked SLR officials, where he said: When it comes to such high profile tournaments, the Ministry of Sports is funding only the teams which have clear opportunity to secure a medal. Such a statement, it appears gives the impression that SLR was under-prepared.
The Womens Tuskers did reasonably well in the Asian 7s circuit in 2017 just a few months prior to the Asian Games under the watchful eyes of Sudath Sampath (Head Coach), Inthie Marikkar (Director, High Performance), and Dilan Zoysa (Trainer). Going by some of their performances of this tournament especially of Sri Lankas losing margins to Hong Kong (5-10) and Kazakstan (0-12); and the fact that Sri Lanka beat Thailand (24-12 to win the Plate championship) who incidentally lost the bronze medal to Kazakhstan at Asian Games speaks volumes of Sri Lankas bright chances. While Japan won the Gold, the Silver went to China. So the top four teams at the Asian Games finally stand as Japan, China, Kazakstan and Thailand. Where would Sri Lanka been placed had they participated
It is indeed a very sad state of affairs why the SLR officials just could not do their home work to come out with a sound assessment. Surely, the authorities who are top administrators in their own rights (may not necessarily be well conversant in sports) would have possibly understood the prospect of a medal on a general analytical perspective. How on earth did the Sri Lanka hockey administrators able to convince the authorities to field a mens team and got humiliated by India 20 goals to nil at the Asian Games. In that context, the SLR surely had all the rights to impress the authorities. Where did the think-tanks of SLR go wrong The rugby fraternitys only hope would be to see that SLR conducts its affairs more sensibly in the future.
Furthermore whats really shocking was that 180 athletes and nearly 70 odd officials amounting to a total of approximately 250 people had participated at this years Asian Games representing Sri Lanka while depriving the prospect medalists, the women Tuskers. In the overall assessment, it was the 4 x 400 mens relay team and Mens 7s rugby team did perform well to secure fourth place. We wish to reserve the comments on the performance of the mens rugby team.

A threat on depriving the lands tenured and held by farmer families has emerged due to a sugar production project to be implemented in a land about 62,500 acres which lays over 10 DS divisions based in Moneragala, Ampara and Badulla districts.
A company engaged in the project has encroached the land with machinery, according to a press release by the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ).
At that time, about 400 locals had obstructed them. Hence, the machinery had been temporary removed from the land.
The lands are freeholds and hereditary lands. It was legally confirmed that the company cannot acquire these lands. Malpractices such as improper land acquisition and sending discharge orders to leave their holdings without compensation had occurred under this project, the CEJ allege.
The CEJ calls on responsible persons not to implement the project by removing the locals from the lands they are settled in.

Citra partners DMMC to support Dengue prevention and control
Citra, Sri Lankas first Social Innovation Lab, has partnered with the Mount Lavinia Municipal Council to develop a citizen-centered open source platform for dengue prevention and control.
Citra, a joint initiative between the Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) uses foresight and innovation tools to prototype and test development solutions to ensure they are agile and holistic.
Its work is aligned to the national development priorities and works towards bringing in greater citizen engagement to the formulation of development solutions.
One such initiative is developing an open source platform aimed at preventing and controlling the spread of dengue, with technical expertise from the Department of Town and Country Planning, University of Moratuwa.
The platform, once developed, will improve local governments efficiency in identifying, managing and monitoring dengue. It will also have a citizen engagement feature and will allow communities to identify and notify relevant local government authorities of the prevalence and locations of potential mosquito breeding grounds for necessary action. The users can send the exact location along with a picture of the potential breeding ground, following which the application will automatically add the location to a website for local health officials to review.
The system provides a user-friendly, interactive web interface to process and analyse the data near real-time. This will help decisionmakers to predict and or visualise potential risk-prone areas.
Dehiwala - Mount Lavinia Municipal Commissioner Dhammika Muthugala said with the high prevalence of dengue in communities and especially with over 40% of the cases being reported from the Western Province, we need to find innovative initiatives if we are to effectively control and prevent dengue in the future. We believe engaging citizens to assist us in this regard is the most efficient way to curb the spread of dengue.
A pilot of this application will be tested initially within the Ratmalana division under Dr. Indika Ellawala, the area Chief Medical Officer.
This project is part of City-i-LEAPS, an initiative implemented in partnership with the Seoul Metropolitan Government and UNDPs Bangkok Regional Hub, which aims at collaborating with municipalities in countries around the region to develop and assist the implementation of innovative development solutions.

Cook hits fifty in final Test as  England start solidly against India
LONDON AFP Sept7:
Alastair Cook marked his final Test appearance with the first fifty by an opening batsman on either side this series as England frustrated India at the Oval on Friday.
England were 123 for one at tea, after winning the toss, on the first day of the fifth Test.
Cook was 66 not out and fellow left-hander Moeen Ali 23 not out.
Both batsmen were dropped on their respective lunch scores of 37 not out and two not out. 
The pair had so far added an unbroken 63 in an attritional 25 overs.
Meanwhile India paceman Mohammed Shami (none for 27 in 16 overs) was unlucky to repeatedly beat the duo with a succession of leg-cutters, none of which took the outside edge.
Cook, Englands all-time record Test run-scorer, was making his final appearance at this level before international retirement.
The 33-year-old opener, who will continue to play for Essex, came into this match having scored 12,254 Test runs at an average of 44.88 including 32 hundreds.
But he has struggled for runs lately, with his previous best score this series the 29 he made during Indias 203-run win in the third Test at Trent Bridge.
Cook, extending his England appearance record to 161 Tests, was thrust straight into the action when Joe Root, his successor as England captain, opted to bat first after winning the toss.
England had already won this five-match series after a 60-run victory at Southampton, completed on Sunday, gave them an unassailable 3-1 lead.
Cook, who walked out to a guard of honour from the India team, was soon into his stride with two trademark boundaries off successive balls from fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah -- a square-cut followed by a pull.
But this innings also saw him displaying his familiar powers of concentration.
Keaton Jennings, under pressure for his England place, had made just six when he was hit on the helmet after taking his eye off a short all from Ishant Sharma.
He nevertheless helped fellow left-hander Cook compile Englands best opening stand of the series.
But when Jennings had made 23, with England 60 for one, he carelessly turned left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja, recalled in place of the unfit Ravichandran Ashwin, straight to KL Rahul at leg-slip.

A Special Determination Petition challenging the Bill entitled Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution was yesterday filed before the Supreme Court by Colombo District Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila.
He is seeking a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.

Hollywood's Moustached heart-throb   Burt Reynolds dead
US: Burt Reynolds, the moustached heart-throb of 1970s cinema who won acclaim in Deliverance and a host of awards later in his career for Boogie Nights, died on Thursday, his family announced.
The famously suave 82-year-old, a huge box office draw at his peak who had a reputation as a hard-drinking playboy, reportedly suffered a heart attack and died at a hospital in Florida.
It is with a broken heart that I said goodbye to my uncle today, the actor's niece Nancy Lee Hess, said in a statement sent to AFP.
My uncle was not just a movie icon; he was a generous, passionate and sensitive man, who was dedicated to his family, friends, fans and acting students. Reynolds, whose career spanned six decades, earned a Golden Globe, Oscar nomination and several critics' awards for his portrayal of porn director Jack Horner in the 1997 film Boogie Nights.
Last year, he also drew critical acclaim for his performance in the indie movie The Last Movie Star. The actor was considered box office gold in the 1970s and early 80s with such hits as Smokey and the Bandit, Starting Over, and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, films that were popular at the box office and often less popular with critics.
It was his breakout role in the 1972 thriller Deliverance, in which he plays macho survivalist Lewis Medlock, that cemented his status as one of Hollywood's leading men in the 1970s and 80s.
The film -- infamous for its hillbilly male rape scene -- earned three Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Editing. But Reynolds failed to get an Oscar nod and he would later say that his nude spread that year in Cosmopolitan probably cost him a chance at the golden statuette. During his career, he would also become known as much for the hit movies he racked up as the big roles he turned down.
Reynolds notably walked away from playing the space scoundrel Han Solo in the first Star Wars, turned down the role of James Bond and declined the leading role played by Richard Gere in Pretty Woman. He also rejected an offer to play retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove in the 1983 hit movie Terms of Endearment. The role was taken up by Jack Nicholson, who took home an Oscar.
On the personal front, the actor was married and divorced twice, the first time to British actress Judy Carne and the second to American actress Loni Anderson, with whom he adopted a son, Quinton. His divorce with Anderson would go down as one of the nastiest in Hollywood history.
He also had a high-profile romance with actress Sally Field, described by Reynolds as the love affair of my life.
Tributes poured in for the late star on news of his death, including from fellow actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities.
Burt Reynolds was one of my heroes. He was a trailblazer, Schwarzenegger said in a tweet. He showed the way to transition from being an athlete to being the highest paid actor, and he always inspired me. He also had a great sense of humor - check out his Tonight Show clips. My thoughts are with his family. Tennis great Boris Becker described Reynolds in a tweet as one of the last icons in Hollywood, while Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood lamented the passing of a legend. RIP Burt Reynolds. Seems his whole career was tongue in cheek. Always warm and funny, tweeted comedian Ricky Gervais.

How advertising money greed is killing Test cricket telecast in India
Imagine the twinkle in the eye of a brand manager if someone promises 100 opportunities to advertise in a single day. They will buy into the idea just as passionately as vegans have taken to avocado toast. That is why brands love cricket, especially in India.
In case of an ODI, there are at least a 100 over breaks. Plus there are more with the fall of wickets and drinks breaks. With T20 that number came down and that is precisely why strategic time-out had to be invented. To manipulate more on-air ad time. In the case of Test matches, the audiences have been dwindling in stadiums across the world; and the ones who are plugging in to watch on television are served a distinctly watered down version. The broadcast excellence expected from such a high-profile series as the ongoing England and India is entirely missing. Reason being greed.
Test cricket and its ebbs and flows are thrown out of the window for the viewer when between the over discussions, both on-field and by the commentators, are mercilessly chopped to make way for the latest ads of brands flush with venture capitalist money make unwelcome and repetitive appearances. The complaints and grumbling disapprovals from the viewers are because of the overplaying of advertisements, their increasingly long duration, and also the raised audio level during ads. The commercials are repeated several times in between the overs which break the continuity of the commentary and the innings. Whats more, it is often done at crucial stages just as the action is reaching an impending crescendo.
It is not that the production value is not fantastic. It is that ads are killing the joy of watching a Test. The arc and narrative of the innings are not appreciated. The live feed is still on, and the production team is doing a good job, but it is the channel which isnt. When a wicket falls, even the replay is sacrificed to show more ads.
However good the commentary may be, the viewers are missing out and the panel is really good with Harsha Bhogle, Michael Atherton, Graeme Swann, Sunil Gavaskar and Alan Wilkins. Just yesterday, Virat Kohlis long walk into the Ageas Bowl in Southampton, greeted by generous applause was not shown. It could have built a sense of anticipation for the touring captain walking in with his team in peril. The stage set for another dogfight between him and Jimmy Anderson. The commentators did their part but the broadcasters hunger for advertising money undid their work. The screen played an ad, and a spectacle was lost. It is akin to having a speed bump every 100 meters on a highway and a tollbooth every kilometer.
It is time that the advertising brands and their media planning see through this faade that the broadcasters - Sony Six in this case, are pulling. People tend to associate negatively with a brand if it is coming in the way of them enjoying their game.
The broadcasters across the board will always argue that if the ads are cut short, the limited availability of advertising time will only jack up the advertising rates many folds and this will be detrimental to brands. Well then, so be it! Additionally, it would have the impact of a sharp increase in subscription charges.
But, the subscribers in India are already paying the highest a-la-carte rates for sports channels (as much INR 75/month) as compared to other channels. The feed is not proportional to the fee. Another argument is that theres a very high fee given to acquire the rights and they have to recover the costs. Again, its the broadcasters who are overbidding and bringing upon them this eventuality. First, they skew the market, then they exploit the viewer.
Since the cable television ecosystem in India is now entirely digital, the broadcasters also argue that a consumer has an absolute choice in choosing any channel and paying accordingly, there is no need to regulate advertising time. It is up to the subscriber to opt for a channel with commercials at a lower cost or pay a premium to watch a channel without ads. Again, this is a case of taking the cricket fan in India for granted. The subscribers were led to believe that no ad HD channels will be beaming a better experience but at a premium price point. When enough people subscribed, they instead sell the ad slots for a premium, leaving the viewers back to the same mediocre viewing.
Recently, global streaming platform Netflix heard a collective netizen groan at the first inkling of their plans on introducing their own shows ads between episodes. Thats how much the millennial are averse to product plugging. If theres a streaming platform, theyll move. But here too, for the England-India series, the streaming alternative of Sony Liv app is just marginally better.
If they found advertisers to run ads on the app, it will be exactly a cash grab like the television broadcast. It is only because brands dont get enough eyeballs while streaming online that it is not overrun with ads. Before you forget, thats a subscriber-based model too.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has regulations in place; and the broadcasters are in a clear breach of the Supreme Court of India covering a Test series with total disregard for honest broadcasting conduct. The constant barrage of advertisements during live sporting action impairs the viewing experience of a cricket fan. Which is why in my opinion, the advertising money greed is killing Test cricket telecast in India.  sk

Indian press lauds gay sex ruling
INDIA: Indian media yesterday -- including some conservative outlets -- hailed a Supreme Court ruling to decriminalise gay sex whilst highlighting a deafening silence from Narendra Modi's BJP government.
Banner front page headlines such as Love at First Right, Rainbow Nation and Independence Day greeted the verdict of the top court to strike down the heart of Section 377, a law introduced by British rulers in 1861.
Many said the five justices may have opened the doors to demands for greater civil rights for long-marginalised gays and lesbians, including same-sex marriage.
The conservative Hindu newspaper called the verdict a reaffirmation of the right to love and a welcome depature from centuries of 'hetero-normative' thinking.
The judges had furthered the frontiers of personal freedom and liberated the idea of personal rights from the pressure of public opinion, it added in an editorial.
The Hindusan Times warned that the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender community will still face condemnation from their families and colleagues.
Harassment and violence will continue to occur, it warned.
But if the long legal battle and the courage of queer people and communities are anything to go by, this fight for equal rights will not end. It will grow even stronger now that even the apex court has said there is no going back. Amid pictures of celebrating activists, Google India put out a rainbow flag on its homepage and Facebook changed its display picture to a multi-hued icon.
The United Nations and rights activists around the world gave Twitter support to the Supreme Court ruling.
But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-wing government has yet to make a comment on the ruling.
Modi's administration had initially opposed dismantling Section 377, though in July government lawyers said they would give in to the wisdom of the top court. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said the government should have taken a categorical stand one way or the other instead of being ambivalent, the Hindu newspaper reported the judge as saying. The Indian Express daily said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's silence on the issue was deafening and deceptive. India's main opposition Congress and other small regional parties have welcomed the verdict. - AFP

Invoke the 25th  to remove  Trump - Senator
US: US Senator Elizabeth Warren said Thursday it is time to invoke a Constitutional amendment to remove President Donald Trump if top officials believe he can no longer fulfill his duties.
The Democrat's comments follow a stunning newspaper op-ed by an anonymous senior administration official expressing grave concerns about Trump's morals and behavior.
The New York Times article described an insider resistance movement that prevents him making reckless decisions.
If senior administration officials think the president of the United States is not able to do his job, then they should invoke the 25th Amendment, Warren told CNN.
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment of the Constitution allows the vice president and cabinet officials to write to Congress if they believe the President cannot do his job. The far more consequential Section 4 has never been used, however, and experts say the process is particularly fraught.
Warren, a potential 2020 Presidential candidate, expressed alarm that senior officials were offering anonymous but searing critiques of a troubling presidency but not taking constitutional action.
What kind of a crisis do we have if senior officials believe that the president can't do his job and then refuse to follow the rules that have been laid down in the Constitution Warren said.They can't have it both ways.

Constitutional Council tells IGP, NPC:
IRON OUT DISPUTES IN TWO WEEKS
The Constitutional Council (CC) instructed IGP Pujith Jayasundera and National Police Commission Chairman P.H. Manatunga to settle differences between the two parties within two weeks. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, who is also the Constitutional Council Chairman, summoned the two parties to Parliament yesterday for a special meeting to iron out the disagreements between them.
According to the Parliamentary sources, the IGP has been informed during the meeting to report to the CC within two weeks the progress of implementing the NPC recommendations.
Speaker Jayasuriya explained that the purpose of the independent commissions created by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was to bring about a culture where the public institutions could render a service to people without being politicized, the Speakers Media Division said in a press statement following the CC meeting.
NPC Chairman P. H. Manatunga complained that the Commission is powerless to take any further action when the IGP is refusing to implement the Commissions recommendations.
The NPC members pointed out that the purpose of NPC is not achieved owing to the IGPs standpoint.
The ten member CC is the apex body that makes decisions pertaining to the appointments to the Independent Commissions and looks into the affairs of those commissions.
The IGP is also appointed upon the recommendations of the CC.
Among the NPC recommendations that the IGP was dragging its feet to implement were issues pertaining to the promotion of SSP Palitha Siriwardena to DIG rank, promotions of 129 officers who claimed to be politically victimised, removal the Narammala OIC from his post, investigations into educational qualifications of DIG Nalaka de Silva and the suspension of the OIC of the Statistics Division.
However, the IGP in return had presented the reasons for him not to implement those recommendations. He had described the grounds as to why he did not promote certain officers.
The CC also discussed the new appointments to the CC and other independent commissions which are to end their terms shortly, the press statement said.

Kim Jong-un invited for  Russian summit
CHINA: Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend a regional summit in Russia next week, officials said Friday, joining the prime ministers of Japan and South Korea at a gathering to which North Korean leader Kim Jong -un was invited.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited Kim to participate in the September 11-13 Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok.
Kim has not confirmed his attendance, but his participation would mark another major step in his efforts to bring Pyongyang out of international isolation over its nuclear weapons programme.
At a press briefing to announce Xi's visit, Chinese officials would not comment on whether Xi planned to meet with other leaders during the summit.
Should we have any proposals from other countries, China will positively consider them, assistant foreign minister Zhang Hanhui told reporters.
Kim and Xi met three times in China this year as the two countries seek to repair relations frayed by North Korea's nuclear activities and Beijing's backing of United Nations sanctions against its Cold War-era ally. Xi is sending the head of China's rubber-stamp legislature, Li Zhanshu, to Pyongyang this weekend to attend celebrations marking North Korea's 70th anniversary, ending speculation that the Chinese president would use the occasion to make his first official trip to the neighbouring country. In the latest chapter in the roller-coaster diplomacy over North Korea, US President Donald Trump signalled on Thursday that negotiations on denuclearisation remain alive after weeks of an apparent deadlock. Xi will be in Vladivostok on Tuesday and Wednesday. It will be the first time that a Chinese leader participates in the annual economic forum hosted by Russia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean premier Lee Nak-yeon are expected to attend the summit.
Relations between China and Japan soured in 2012 over a territorial dispute, but have begun to warm. In recent months, the two sides have been negotiating an exchange of top level visits.

Lanka keep hopes alive with draw against Maldives
The deciding match between Sri Lanka and Maldives in the South Asian Football Championship played at Banghabandhu Stadium Stadium yesterday ended in a goalless draw.
Sri Lanka kicked off the first half, yet it was Maldives who got the first real opportunity when a cross turned into a chance but the ball was palmed away by goalkeeper Sujan Perera. Maldives seemed the more dominant side in the opening 10 minutes.
Throughout the game goal keeper Sujan Perera produced a good performances and saved more than four goals in the first 25 minutes of play.
On resumption of the second half Sri Lankans conceded foul after foul and Bandara Warakagoda was finally shown the yellow card. Sri Lanka also gave away a free kick in a dangerous area 52 minutes into the game.
Some worthy brilliant performance was produced by Kavindu Ishan to Asela Madushan in the 82nd minute, but a brilliant save denied Madushan and the rebound effort by Ishan was saved as well.
Ibrahim Mahudhee Hussain of Maldives broke into the box in the 86th minute and found the back of the net with a tap but to his dismay the flag was raised for offside. Thus a scoring opportunity was lost.
Mohamed Fazal then took a shot at goal from the middle of the box but the keeper made a relatively comfortable save. In the 72nd minute a shot by Kavindu Ishan curled and went over the bar.
Sri Lanka dominated the second half with brilliant passing and defence.
With the game ending in a draw Sri Lankas semifinal hopes are still alive for now. The semi-final spot will not depend on Sundays match between India against Maldives.

Condemning the assault on four workers of the Maharagama Urban Council by its Chairman, UNP Member Dhanushka Ramanayake said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his authority should take responsibility for this situation.
He said the former President fraudulently helped the group that contested the local government elections under the bicycle symbol to win the election and capture the power of the council. So he should take the responsibility for these incidents.
He further said that the entire administration of the council has collapsed due to the poor management.
He stressed the importance of making Maharagama, a proper Urban Council in order to create a business friendly environment since Maharagama is a large suburb of Colombo city which famous as a destination for clothing and textile.
The poor administration of the council has affected activities of the city since the council failed to fulfill the main services of the urban council such as garbage collection and disposal, providing health services and other public services, he charged.

Malcolm Nash: The Glamorgan bowler on the end of Sir Garfield Sobers six sixes
Every sport has its defining moments. One of cricket's most famous days came on 31 August, 1968.
Sir Garfield Sobers famously became the first batsman to hit six sixes in an over in a first-class cricket match in Swansea.
The legendary West Indies all-rounder was playing for Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan at St Helen's and his bowling victim was Welsh bowler Malcolm Nash.
Half a century on, Nash is back at the St Helen's venue on the Swansea coastline, which he now lives only a few miles from, to recall what happened that famous day.
"It won't be different to the other 49 years," Nash told BBC Sport Wales.
"I have not changed my story in the last 50 years about what I was trying to do.
"When you are playing against the best player of all time, all you want to do is try and get him out and that is what I tried to do.
"Other bowlers have been struck for six sixes, but have not had the same attention.
"It was five minutes of my life that has been talked about now for 50 years."
Things had started all so well on that first day of the county championship match for Nash after reverting to spin from his traditional seam bowling.
"It was the time of day where we were trying to get some wickets and they were trying to get some quick runs for a declaration," said Nash.
"I had bowled seam earlier in the day and captain Tony Lewis had asked me before tea to relieve Peter Walker and bowl some orthodox left-arm spin.
"I got four wickets doing that and at one time my figures were looking good.
"When Garry came to the wicket after tea he bludgeoned that to death."
SOBERS ARRIVES
That arrival of Sobers to the crease changed everything.
"It was the first time I had played against him in a first-class game and he was so dynamic," said Nash.
"When you look at specialist all-rounders through history, nobody can lace his boots.
"I never thought about him getting six sixes at all during the over. I just thought about getting him out and taking five wickets myself.
"He hit them all pretty cleanly except one.
"The second ball was pretty dramatic. It nearly destroyed the [nearby] pub after hitting the guttering.
"It went like a tracer bullet and was still going up when it hit the building."
The first four balls came and disappeared over the boundary ropes before Nash thought he had his man.
"I gave the fifth ball a little bit more air and Garry got underneath it," he said.
"Roger Davis was underneath it at long-off and caught it and fell on his backside and landed on the line.
"There was a little controversy about which side of the line he landed. Umpire Eddie Phillipson, much to the delight of the crowd and my colleague Tony Cordle, signalled six. That was that.
"The previous year the rule was if you caught the ball inside the boundary and went over it was out.
"They changed the ruling in 1968 to say it was six before going back to the original ruling the year after. Funny really."
SUPER SIX
History then beckoned despite Nash trying to stop it.
"There has been lots of talk whether Tony Lewis spoke to me, but if you look at the footage the only person who is close to me is John Parkin, the non-striker, umpire Phillipson and Sobers himself," he recalled.
"I bowled the same run-up and action, but I bowled a seamer which proved an absolute disaster.
"It was a half tracker and he despatched it to a bus stop down the road." The crowd were elated, but what about the bowler who had just been struck for 36 in one over and saw his final ball disappear out of the ground "I was a little numb immediately after the last ball," said Nash.
"The fact it was a world record and history was made did not register.
"They declared and we walked off together and we were both smiling.
"I said he should buy me a couple of beers that evening because he could not have done it without me.
"We went over to do a BBC interview at the end of the days play and I told Garry "this world record could not have been done without me."
Nash was only 23 at the time, but refused to let the over affect his impressive career which included 993 first-class wickets.
He had helped Glamorgan defeat Australia earlier in 1968 and went on to help the Welsh team win the county championship in 1969.
Nash went on to feature in Glamorgan's first one-day final in 1977 and captain the county before his final first-class game in 1983.
"It did not define the rest of my career; if anything it gave me greater resolve," said Nash.
"I could have easily have said I was done with cricket and never picked up a ball ever again.
"That was not in my nature. My record speaks for itself and I got top players out on a regular basis.
"I knew I could bowl. I just did not bowl slow, orthodox left-arm again for a long time!"
WRONG BALL
Nash moved to north America after finishing his career, but returned to public spotlight in 2006 when a ball claimed to be the one used at St Helen's was sold for 26,400 at auction.
A subsequent re-sale in 2012 was dropped because of questions over its authenticity, amid suggestions Sobers had inadvertently given a supporter the wrong ball, decades previously.
Nash has always been adamant the ball sold at auction was the wrong one.
"Firstly, contrary to what has been said we had not run out of balls, we used the same ball for all six deliveries," said Nash.
"That last ball came back the following day from a lad who had picked it up on his way home to Neath.
"The ball I bowled that day and always bowled for Glamorgan was a 'Stuart Surridge'.
"I was in living in north America when one of my colleagues, Peter Walker, rang me and said they were auctioning the ball I bowled.
"When he mentioned it was a 'Dukes' ball I told him we always used a 'Surridge' ball. "He said he would get onto Christies and they gave him short shrift believing they had done their due diligence.
"They sold the wrong ball and they won't speak to me about it despite me trying on numerous occasions. They say the matter is closed."
STILL GOOD FRIENDS
This matter has not affected his relationship with the man that he created history with 50 years ago.
"Our relationship has been good over the years and we have never lost touch," said Nash. "I met with him this summer. Like me, he is getting a bit more frail, but is in good humour. "We did not talk much about the over, everywhere we go it is all anybody wants to talk about.
"We did other things in our lives and experienced events which were important. "We get a little bit bored of it from time to time.
"I have done a book this year which tells the rest of my cricket life. I bowled about 11,000 overs so around 10,999 overs are in the book.
"That one over, as I say. It was just five minutes of my life."  BBC

President warns:
No mercy for ragging suspects
Stern punishment will be given to ragging culprits in State universities with the strict implementation of the Prohibition of Ragging Act, President Maithripala Sirisena declared yesterday.
Ragging cannot be allowed to happen in universities any more, destroying the future of university students, President Sirisena said, participating in the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Polonnaruwa National Vocational Training Centre of the National Vocational Training Authority.
The Government will launch a special programme to safeguard the quality of university education. Statistics show that thousands of students do not enter university due to ragging fears. Nearly 25 students have died in the last 25 years due to ragging and thousands of students have suffered physically and mentally, the President remarked.
He emphasised that the lives of the majority of students could not be allowed to be destroyed due to cruel activities of a small number.
Certain political groups have held university students hostage and attempts to spread barbarism among youth who are to inherit the future of the country should be defeated, he added.
Speaking on the importance of safeguarding the quality of school education, President Sirisena said that in some instances education professionals are still not ready for the reforms that should be implemented in the education as a country which is moving forward with the rest of the world. The President said that the enrollment of a larger number of students in some schools considered popular schools is one of the reasons for the decline in the quality of school education.
The President emphasized the importance of being up to date with the new world and modern technology, changing the traditional views regarding vocational education and pointed out the importance of creating a trained workforce targeting the foreign job market while producing a workforce required for the national production process and industries.
This Rs.6,500 million training centre comprising all modern facilities will be constructed on a land of 17 Acres in Doradeka, Polonnaruwa, on the Hingurakgoda, Medirigiriya Road. The Government of Netherlands is funding the project.
The training centre, which has modern technical facilities will provide full time courses of NVQ 4 and 5 levels for 1325 technical assistants and diploma holders annually.
Additionally it, will also offer semi-diploma courses for professionals. Five training schools will be opened in the fields of construction, motor mechanism, electronics mechanism, hospitality, and tourism, agriculture, to conduct 34 full time vocational courses.
The construction will be completed within three years and courses will start in January 2022. The President, who inaugurated the construction work of the training centre made an observational visit of the premises. He also launched the website which contains information on the development of vocational skills. Minister Sarath Amunugama, Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranavitana, Chairman of Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka Ravi Jayawardena, former Chief Minister of North Central Province Peshala Jayarathna, Ambassador of Netherlands to Sri Lanka Joanne Doornewaard and other dignitaries participated.

Colombo Outer Circular Highway final phase
Over 72 pc of work complete
About 72 percent of the work on the final phase of the Colombo Outer Circular Highway (OCH) is complete and will be finished in 2019, Road Development Authority (RDA) Project Director of the OCH Phase Three N. K. L. Nettikumara said.
He said the third and final phase of the OCH (OCH-3) from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya, extending 9.63 kilometers is a four-lane expressway with two interchanges (Kaduwela and Kadawatha), including toll plazas and facilities.
Three viaducts over 6.3 kilometers in length are being constructed over the Muturajawela wetland area, Ragama and Kadawatha, close to the starting point of the proposed Colombo - Kandy Central Expressway. Once the third section from Kaduwela to Kerawalapitiya is complete, the OCH will link Southern Expressway and Colombo Katunayake Expressway.
"It will then act as a link between the North and South, bypassing the inner city area, thereby easing the traffic congestion in the city, he said.
The second phase of the Outer Circular Highway from Kaduwela to Kadawatha was opened to the public in September 2015, while the first phase from Kottawa to Kaduwela was opened in March 2014.
The third stage of the project is implemented by the Road Development Authority under the supervision of the Highways and Road Development Ministry with the financial support from the Chinese government.

Ian Paisleys visit linked to Sajins business deal- JVP
UK Parliamentarian Ian Paisleys two luxury holidays to Sri Lanka in 2013, for which the Sri Lankan Government spent Rs 13 million, are connected to a business deal of former MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake revealed in Parliament yesterday.
The MP, moving an Adjournment Motion, brought out that the real intention behind sponsoring UK Parliamentarian Ian Paisleys visits was to negotiate a lucrative oil purchase deal with a Nigerian company for former MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena.
The former MP was widely known to be the Monitoring MP of the External Affairs Ministry, under the previous administration.
MP Rathnayake, quoting a series of email communications between Paisley and former MP Gunawardena as well as a Foreign Ministry official known as Majintha, pointed out that the former MP had used Paisley as a negotiator for his business deal. He further pointed out that the UK Parliamentarian had visited Nigeria for the above purpose with the funds sponsored by the Foreign Ministry.
His visits clearly had nothing to do with image building of Sri Lanka, while he had made no such contribution, he added. MP Rathnayake further pointed out that UK Parliamentarian Paisley in his two visits to Sri Lanka from March 30 - April 5, 2013 and from July 1-11, 2013, had not met any of the responsible office holders.
He had not met the President, the Prime Minister, Opposition Leader, the Speaker, Foreign Minister or the British High Commissioner in Sri Lanka. He had simply gone to see the elephants in Pinnawala in a helicopter. In his first tour, in which he accompanied his wife and four children, he had spent three nights in Passikudah and one night each at Hilton and Galle Fortress.
The Government had spent a total of Rs 7 million for that tour. On the second tour, in which he accompanied his wife and two children, he had spent two nights in Kandalama, one night at Earls Regency and five nights at Ahungalle Heritance. The Government had spent a total of Rs 6 million for that tour, MP Rathnayake elaborated.
He said the itinerary and invitation for the second tour had been sent by Paisley himself to the Foreign Ministry. These tours had been approved by the then External Affairs Minister Prof. G L Peiris. If the Government could not provide any proof for the appointment of former MP Sajin Vass as a monitoring MP, then Prof. Peiris has to take the responsibility for these spending, he noted.
He added that an executive class Benz car and a Sri Lanka Air Force Helitour helicopter had been provided to Paisley for his transport within the country.
Foreign Affairs Minister Thilak Marapone, replying to the motion, expressed his shock over the MPs latest revelations, adding that the matter is a serious fraud that must be well investigated by the CID or the FCID. Now it is clear that Ian Paisleys issue runs deeper than spending a colossal sum of public money for his luxury holidays in Sri Lanka. It connects to a more serious fraud. I was not aware of the Nigerian business deal exposed by the MP. I will ask my Ministry Secretary to study this matter in depth, he told the House.
MP Rathnayake in his motion, urged the Government to come up with specific guidelines or issue a circular detailing the procedure that should be followed when the Foreign Ministry organizes ceremonies in foreign countries and when foreign delegates are invited to the country. Specifically note the punishments when these guidelines are breached, he added.
He also urged the Government to furnish a report to Parliament within three months on the expenses borne by the Foreign Ministry for former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksas Paris visit, Birthday party of former Minister Rohitha Bogollagamas daughter and Sajin Vass Gunawardenas involvement in Ian Paisleys visit after proper investigations by the CID or any other responsible authority.
JVP wants special inquiry on money spent for days sittings
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake called on the Auditor General to hold a special audit inquiry and reveal as to how much of public money is being spent for a days sitting of Parliament.
The MP, participating in the Parliamentary debate yesterday to raise the salary and allowances of Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, expressed his disappointment that Parliament sittings came to an abrupt end on Thursday, within 14 minutes after commencement.
The media had been reporting various figures on the cost of a days Parliamentary sitting. A large number of Police personnel and officials are on duty on the days that Parliament conducts sittings. I urge the Auditor General to hold a special audit inquiry and tell the country as to how much we spend for a Parliament sitting day, he noted.
The MP also stressed that the Audit Commission must be empowered to hold comprehensive audit inquiries prior to the commencement of large scale projects. Conducting post mortem examinations on corruption and fraud once those had happened, is of little help in a country such as Sri Lanka, as there are hardly any instances where we have recovered that loss. I propose that the Audit Commission must be given powers to audit Cabinet approved projects if the project value exceeds Rs 50 million. The Auditor General could study the Project Concept and plan and determine its value for money, he suggested.
He also pointed out that wide discrepancies are there when evaluating Budget proposals with what had actually happened on the ground. The Public Finance Committee would expose more details in time to come. The Government promised to set up the Budget Office, but it had still not become a reality, he added.
The MP also urged the Auditor General to hold special audit inquiries on expenses made to national ceremonies held on a grand scale. I propose that he select 10 - 15 such massive national ceremonies in the last 10 years and reveal the public as to how much of public money had been spent on them. Such expenditure are a colossal waste, he said, observing that four national ceremonies had been held so far to open various stages of the Moragahakanda Project.
He also pointed out that Rs 4 billion has been allocated as promotional expenses for the Gamperaliya project.
Speaker heads committee to improve communal, religious harmony
A Parliament Select Committee headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, was appointed yesterday to recommend measures to improve communal and religious harmony in Sri Lanka.
The Committee includes, Deputy Speaker J.M. Ananda Kumarasiri, John Amaratunge, Gamini Jayawickreme Perera, Rauf Hakeem, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Rishad Bathiudeen, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha, Gayantha Karunatilake, Thalatha Athukorale, D.M. Swaminathan, Abdul Haleem, Mano Ganesan, A.H.M. Fowzie, A.S. Radhakrishnan, Ruwan Wijewardena, Sayed Ali Zahir Moulana, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, Douglas Devananda, Susil Premajayantha, Dinesh Gunawardena, C.B. Rathnayake, Wijitha Herath and M.A. Sumanthiran.
The Committee is expected to submit its report containing recommendations within six months. The Committee is to be set up to prevent repetition of misunderstanding among communities as experienced in Kandy in March, Ampara in February this year and Beruwala in June 2014.
The Committee has been asked to provide recommendations to prevent the propagation of defamatory opinion and opinion that undermine national harmony. It will discuss and decide on the suitability of including hate speech as a crime in the Penal Code. It will look into the possibilities of categorizing the school system on a non-racial or non-religious basis and introducing a special subject into the school curriculum in order to create national reconciliation.
The Committee will seek the contributions of academics, intellectuals and persons who have won the recognition and respect of the public for this national and religious reconciliation programme. It will propose a mechanism to seek the contribution of the Security Forces, the Police and religious leaders for the programme. It will formulate norms that should be followed when expressing views via social websites and various media networks, including the print and electronic media.
It will look into banning the publishing of news which disturbs national amity and how to formulate laws in that regard. The Committee will also be tasked with making recommendations to resolve issues related to the national language policy.
It will also examine and recommend changes to the Police Ordinance and policing in general to ensure better public confidence in the Sri Lanka Police Department.
Govt. allocated Rs. 500 mn for Gamperaliya Development
The Government has made a supplementary allocation of Rs 500 million on August 8, to provide for the implementation of the Gamperaliya Rapid Rural Development Programme 2018-2019.
The supplementary allocation had been made from the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry.
The Government presented a Note on the Supplementary Allocations totalling Rs 12.4 billion, made to cover various additional expenses from July 1 to August 15, in Parliament yesterday.
It also included an additional allocation of Rs 1 million provided to meet the expenditure pertaining to the Gamperaliya inauguration ceremony in the Kurunegala District. That allocation had been made from the Finance and Mass Media Ministry.
When question by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake on this expenditure, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella clarified that Minister Mangala Samaraweera had stated that 75 percent of the money spent on Gamperaliya was from the private sector. The Government had also reallocated Rs 11.4 billion from the Agriculture Ministry to meet the expenditure of fertilizer subsidy.
The Government had also made an additional allocation of Rs 257 million for the Moragahakanda and Kaluganga Reservoir Project (Government of Sri Lanka - China, Kuwait, and Saudi-Foreign Funds). The Note on Supplementary Allocations was presented by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
Construction of Norochcholai Power Plant wind shield by July 19: Ajith Perera
The construction of the Wind Shield to the Norochcholai Lakvijaya Power Plant would be completed by July 2019, State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera said yesterday. He also said that a project to create concrete blocks from coal dust disseminated from the power plant would be on foot by the end of September 2018. The State Minister also said that a compensation of Rs. 12.7 MN had been distributed among the farmers who were affected by the coal dust and ash accumulated by the power plant. He also expressed his confidence that the power plant would soon receive a renewal of its Environmental Protection License, as all conditions have been duly completed.
State Minister Perera made these observations in answer to a question raised by MP Hector Appuhamy, with regard to the wind shield for the Norochcholai Power Plant and the accumulation of ash in the plant premises.
The construction of the wind shield began in February 2018 as a joint venture between Laughs Holding Limited and Sanken Groups. Rs. 480 MN and US$ 1.4 MN had been allocated for the project separately.
The wall is 1,600m long and 15m high. The base of the wall is 5m wide, State Minister Perera pointed out.
Speaking further, Perera pointed out that the government had already called for tenders and signed contracts with five parties for the removal of the coal dust accumulated by the power plant. One such company will be purchasing 360 TN of coal dust from September. Another company had signed agreements with us to purchase 650 TN of coal dust from December 2018. This company has purchased lands and received environmental clearance already. Both these companies and other parties would be using coal dust to create concrete blocks.
The State Minister also pointed out that possibilities are being explored to utilize coal dust in road construction activities as well.
MP Appuhamy informed the State Minister that there had been several mishaps when granting compensation to the farmers in the affected area. He also asked if a factory creating concrete blocks would be established within the power plant and also questioned as to how the factory would access water for its work.
In answer, Perera observed that such a factory would be established within the plant premises. Initially, this factory was to be set up in Mundalama.
Experts needed for AGs Department
The Auditor Generals Department ought to recruit disciplinary experts to avoid any error in conclusions and to strengthen the Audit Service in the country, State Minister Ajith P. Perera said yesterday.
Minister Perera made this observation, opening the debate on the determination moved by the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, to increase the salary and allowances paid to the Auditor General.
The State Minister pointed out that 98% of the officers attached to the Auditor Generals Department are qualified Accountants. However, there are various aspects to auditing. For example, if you take value for money auditing, it evaluates performances on selected criteria.
Parliament approves AGs salary increase
Parliament unanimously approved a Determination under the Constitution presented by the Government to increase the salary and allowances paid to Auditor General H. M. Gamini Wijesinghe yesterday.
The determination was moved by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
The new determination adopted yesterday, placed AG Wijesinghe on the 08th Salary Step of the SL- 4 Salary Scale of the Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006, with effect from November 27, 2015.
From January 1, 2016, the salary would be converted in line with the Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016.
According to the determination, AG Wijesinghe would also be entitled to a special monthly allowance of Rs. 50,000.
This allowance paid as personal to him, is in addition to salaries and other allowances entitled to the post of Auditor General.
It is paid by paying special attention to educational qualifications, service experience as well as the salary of previous service of Gamini Wijesinghe.
The increase of salary and allowances of AG Wijesinghe, had been delayed for three years. Cabinet had approved the revisions on March 14 last year. This proposal raises the AGs salary and allowances to a level higher than what was proposed in the withdrawn motion.
Cabinet Paper presented to hand over Motor Vehicle Examiners report to SLTB, AAC
A Cabinet Paper had been presented to hand over the issuance of Motor Vehicle Examiners report to a joint venture by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and the Automobile Association of Ceylon (AAC), Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Asoka Abeysinghe, said.
He was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti, who queried as to whether there is a move to privatize motor vehicle examinations carried out by the Motor Traffic Department.
The Deputy Minister said a pilot project in this regard would be initiated between the SLTB and the AAC, adding that AAC would be given a 25 percent share of the joint venture. He said the Government came up with this proposal to minimize irregularities in issuing motor vehicle examiners reports.
He said initially AAC would only be given a 5 percent stake.
I had discussens with the company and they pointed out the difficulties in handling this work with the marginal turn over received from it, the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister further said that more motor vehicle examiners would be recruited shortly.
MP Handunnetti however questioned the rationale of privatizing the work of Motor Traffic Department without addressing the shortcomings and loopholes in the process that have led to corruption and irregularities.

A postscript to Jokers paradise
Recent so called uprising organised by Mahinda clan finally ended as a jokers paradise or Moda carnival. They claimed the uprising will be against the division of the country with the connivance of imperialism.
The new constitution is with expanded devolution, giving police and land powers to Provincial Councils. This is the heinous crime of Yahapalanaya. Weerawansa wanted to imitate late Wijeweera by claiming to save the Lanka motherland from treacherous leaders of Yahapalanaya. It is history, that Rohana with all his revolutionary credentials created only a farce with so many deaths. Now for the second time we were given a jokers paradise! Learn from this experience and go for the new constitution; that is the message given by the people.
When elections are near governments try to portray tiny advances in economy as colossal victories. That is useful for popular campaign. Hence it is part of democracy to indulge in populist campaigns. But there is a companion-error on democratic supporters too. They, of course good heartedly focus too much on defeats and what is not done, losing sight of the small but fruitful victories.
Fascistic authoritarianism
In a secure democracy, that would be an affordable error. But in a country faced with the grim prospect of a fascistic authoritarianism, it is a high-risk game for which the best outcome is consistent expose of the villainy of the opposition. On the other hand, if welfare and market control is immense it will give false signals to neighbourhood. Latter outcome would mean large negative spillovers to other countries in the area. If we follow Donald Trump of America it would pressure other countries to protect markets and also further empower protectionists globally. Asia cannot afford to see beggar-thy-neighbour policies and the contagion of protectionism take hold. A worst-case outcome is an all-out global trade war that would undoubtedly lead to global recession. That did not seem a plausible scenario two years ago, but it is now an unaffordable luxury, an unpardonable indulges.
Many writers say that there are presidential hopefuls pushed by various political centres, but they do not put forward manifestos. There is no Presidential Election 2020 programme yet. JVP's proposal for removing executive presidency is also taken up in the island- wide campaigns conducted by a group of parliamentarians led by Dr. Jayampathi. Of course theres been a lot of hot air, such as Viyath Maga; but little substance when it comes to programmes.
There are shouts that we need to move beyond rhetoric and the easy default option of cannibalizing old texts and slogans. Some politicians promise to elaborate on issues that they think important. Some other spells out and preach what they think that candidates, parties and especially voters should consider seriously. Problem arises when sectarian take up the issue of state and patriotism together and create antagonism. They have various lists of issues on Lanka included in the state.
It was explained earlier that at the end of neo liberalism what emerged is fascistic politics where primary emphasis is patriotism. Bold example is America where President Trumps America First agenda is a dramatic departure from US leadership of a multilateral order that has been the guiding norm for over 70 years. State means now our state; the state of the majority that dominate and over determinate direction of growth.
Constitutional reform
Then there is certainly talk, on the nature of state, that is inevitable when domination of minorities a primary goal. It typically happens when constitutional reform is the subject at hand. The nature of the state naturally leads to two things. First, whether it should remain unitary or whether it should be reconstituted as a federal formation.
Secondly, theres debate about the position of religion. Today domination majority is the American rule and that leads to fascistic politics. Those who support the unitary formation promote a fear that an alternative (federal) would be precursor to division. In Lanka the fear lies in the misreading of Maha Wanse and gross historical postulations by crazy political pundits with absolute ignorance of history and geography. They completely reject a map of historical homelands based on the recent history covering last 500 years. They condemn the sincere attempt made by one of Tamils founder ideologues, S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. Also they claim (a little now, more later), naturally gave and gives rise to suspicion!
The federalists draw from history the instances of multiple regimes functioning independently of one another in the island. When history is long, it makes for selective picking. The federalists and the Unitarians are both aces at this. It is not a subject that should be dismissed out of hand but we have to work with modern concepts equality, autonomy and the right of self determination. The same goes for the issue of religion. Recently, M.A. Sumanthiran contended that there was a separate Tamil kingdom on this island in order to buttress a devolution argument.
He never mentioned boundaries and desisted from obtaining from the long history (as opposed to history-segments of convenience). If we go back to obtain formulation, then we cant pick and choose. However, if we decide to go back, then we can go to the Kandyan Convention and the status of Buddhism that was agreed upon. Then we shall see the current formulation pertaining to religion as a historical injustice. Scream unrepentant Unitarians!
However the separation of religion from the state is an issue that needs to be discussed openly and at length, bringing in all relevant histories, numbers and current realities. Is the state a matter that is composed solely by the above two issues Well, theres a third matter where the state is mentioned. The term that is common is welfareist state. Welfare is a word that is associated typically with the underprivileged, the peripheral and poor. The role of the state, accordingly, is in part to provide a safety net to catch those who could otherwise fall by the wayside.

UNP MP Mujibar Rahuman denied the allegation against him suggesting that he distributed milk packets injected with poison among Joint Opposition supporters at the recent protest held in Colombo.
In reply to the accusation made by JO MP Wimal Weerawansa, MP Rahuman observed that he would never engage in such cheap activities.
Rahuman also said that JO is responsible for not taking care of its supporters.
The Joint Opposition brought their supporters to Colombo but did not even give them food. JO abandoned them. All you gave was expired milk packets. And now you are trying to put the blame on us, Rahuman said.
Speaking of the JOs recent rally, MP Rahuman said that it was a complete failure. The JO said that their protest will be similar to the Arab Spring but it turned into an Alcohol Spring, Rahuman said.
The JO sounded as if they will surround Colombo like a suicide squad but left Colombo around ten in the evening. Even JO MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara admitted so.
You must understand that you cannot topple a government without the help of Colombo citys people.
They did not rise in support of your protest.
If they reacted, your buses wouldnt have made it beyond Peliyagoda, he said.

Rising suicide rate: too many questions, not enough answers
The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that each year approximately one million people die from suicide. It represents a global mortality rate of 16 people per 100,000 or one death every 40 seconds.
But the more worrisome factor is that the rate of suicide is increasing every year. For example, in the last four and half decades, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide. It has now become one of the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-44. As a corollary factor, WHO found out that suicide attempts were up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicides.
The suicide mortality rate in Sri Lanka was 16.6 per 100,000 population in 2016. The regional rate for the same period was 13.2. Sri Lanka Police Annual Report released recently revealed that a total of 3,263 suicide cases had been reported to Police in 2017. Compared with 2016 figures, this was an increase by 238 cases. We mustnt forget that for each person who died, there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide and/or considering suicide. These attempts range in intent and medical severity from the mildly self-injurious to the determinedly lethal.
At a personal level, all suicide attempts, regardless of the extent of medical severity, are indications of severe emotional distress, depression and/or mental illness.
Police statistics also reveal that age groups from 26 to 30 years and over 70 years topped the list. In gender-wise, 46.6 percent of those who committed suicide were males while 12.8 percent were females.
Crisis
Sri Lanka has experienced major changes in its suicide rates since Independence. According to the statistics of Registrar General's office, at the time of independence (1948), suicide rate in Sri Lanka was 9 per 100,000 people. In the 1970s, it rose up to 19 per 100,000, and in the mid-1980s, it reached 33 per 100,000. Subsequent reductions in our suicide rates have been attributed mainly to the introduction of restrictions on the availability of highly toxic pesticides and a number of other measures.
However, the current figure is still alarming when compared other countries in the region. We are losing far too many with every suicide profoundly hurting those left behind. It is clear then, that we still have a crisis of suicidal behaviour among its youths and old-aged people. We need some good research to find out why certain age groups have been susceptible to this disastrous activity.
State intervention
When we study about the Asian countries where rates of death by suicide have been lowered, we realise that assertive and sustained government actions have played a critical role. It means that the government, too, has an important role to play along with other public representative bodies to reach the desired goal.
Same studies suggest that a range of social, personality, childhood and related factors indirectly contribute to the risks of suicidal behaviour. The largest contributory factor comes from mental health problems. Its revealed, 90% of suicides are associated with mental disorders.
The depressions act as the main group of mental disorders. A depression (whether mild or severe) can happen due to a great number of reasons like childhood sexual and physical abuse, poor parenting etc. Other groups at risk are persons with severe somatic illness, the socially disadvantaged and those with a recent loss of a loved one or negative life events in the past.
Substance users are positioned as a special group at high-risk.
Although suicidal tendency may hit persons regardless of the socio-economic status, statistics reveal that people with low socio-economic status including the unemployed commit more suicides.
Multi-sector approach
By acknowledging that the multiple causes of suicide are not amendable by the healthcare sector alone, many countries have developed comprehensive approaches across multi-sectors at all levels (individual, family, community, region and nation).
Solidly-structured national suicide prevention programme at national level is one of them. In many countries such programmes are associated with documented reductions of suicide rates. Such a programme will require a tripartite approach that integrates individuals, community organisations, and all related government sectors.
Its mission should be to identify and minimise the circumstances that encourage suicidal behaviours. It is unlikely that significant reductions in suicide rates will be achieved without corresponding reductions in the circumstances that galvanise the suicidal behaviours. The programme will require adequate, sustained government and community support and resources so that they could use scientifically developed and well-evaluated programmes.
Whatever term we identify it, such a programme needs to include (a) improved recognition and treatment of depression, (b) restriction of suicide means, (c) restrict glamourizing of media-coverage of suicides, (d) improved access to mental healthcare, and (e) healthcare staff capacity building.
Approaches
The following broad suggestions may be worth considering.
1) The elevated rate of suicidal behaviour among the youth should be researched first to find out what factors have attributed to it.
2) The level of Suicide alertness and intervention skills among the entire adult population needs to be raised so that people in distress (e.g. a family member or friend) can be identified and encouraged to seek help.
3) More training needs to be provided to the interested community members on elementary counselling methods.
4) Government and local bodies must attempt harder to identify and address those underlying social determinants of elevated rates of suicidal behaviour. They may include, early school dropouts, overcrowded housing, sexual abused children, unemployed youth and youth involved in violence etc.
5) Early childhood development programmes (e.g. home visitation programmes for young mothers, programmes that help children learn how to better regulate their emotions, etc.) will have a positive impact. A culturally appropriate approach to improving the lives of young parents could help prevent many kinds of problems from occurring later in life.
The role of the community
Any programme to be successful requires careful thought relating to achieving a balance between the role of the community in suicide prevention, and the development of effective professional services.
Communities play a critical role in reducing suicide level. They can provide social support to vulnerable individuals and engage in follow-up care, fight stigma and support those bereaved by suicide. They can help give individuals a sense of belonging and a feeling of connectedness by being part of a community. Lastly, communities can also implement specific suicide reduction strategies assigned to them.
Government has a responsibility in facilitating community engagement in suicide prevention. Whereas government needs to take the lead and develop and implement comprehensive multi-sectoral suicide prevention strategies, communities can incorporate and enhance these efforts with their local community needs, priorities and circumstances. Its a fine workable combination.
Tool-kit
WHO has worked collaboratively with the Mental Health Commission of Canada to adapt a tool-kit type of a participatory approach for global use. The toolkit is a step-by-step guide for communities to engage in suicide prevention activities and have ownership of the process and keep efforts sustained. It is not a manual for initiating specific interventions but describes an active and participatory bottom-up process by which communities identify, prioritize and implement activities that are important and appropriate to their local context.
The Government can seriously consider using a similar toolkit as a starting point.

Doubts cleared for player-participation with parents responsible for their security:
Sri Lanka Squash will send team to Chennai
Sri Lanka Squash (SLS) has denied the contents of the article that appeared in the Daily News of August 25 under the headline No show by Squash Federation  a blow to the sport.
SLS in a letter states that they in fact will be sending a team to participate at the 25th Asian Individual Squash Championship18 (AISC) in Chennai to be held from September 18.
SLS states that at no time did they reach a decision not to send the team but there was some delays caused to getting clearance from the Indian Squash Federation and the Ministry of Sport regarding the security of the players.
The letter from SLS further states:
Sri Lanka Squash was well organized and ready to send a players squad of 32 to participate in 25th Asian Individual Squash Championship18 (AISC) in Chennai which is to be conducted by the Asian Squash Federation (ASF) since SLS has participated in all Junior Championships from the inception. Though the championship is to be held in the month of September18, SLS had discussed about the participation in this during the month of April18 monthly executive committee meeting with team manager (Maj. D. Perera) and Assistant Team manager Capt. G. Mendis (Rtd). SLS was to proceed with all administrative and logistics arrangements in this championship once the official championship hand book is issued by the ASF.
The Championship hand book was issued during the month of June 18. Even before the championship hand book issued, SLS was ready to conduct squad selection trials in the second week of August18 with the selected names list under the present ranking list.
By considering the security concerns of the Sri Lankan Players during the 2017 Asian Senior Individual championship which was held in Chennai, Indian national squash coach cum Event organizing member Mr. C. Poncha had informed to Hony. Secretary SLS not to fly SL players directly to Chennai and had informed to reach Chennai via Bangalore by taking road transport from Bangalore.
This fact was discussed in depth among the EXCO members and had decided to seek Ministry of Sports approval highlighting the above and past incidents which SL squash players had to undergo at the same venue. Finally Ministry of Sports has given not to proceed signal in this championship.
Though SLS was ready to send the squad for the 25th AISC18, this matter was once again discussed during the 07th July18 EXCO meeting and had decided to write a letter to the Ministry of Sports to assist and advice over the participation of this championship after consulting Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence sources over the present security situation in Chennai.
SLS letter was sent to the Ministry of Sports on 09th July18 and reply received vide Sport Development Department letter no. AK/NSF/32/2018 dated 18th July 2018, stating that, the Sports Ministry is not willing to take responsibility regarding player participation in the above mentioned championship by considering the probable security situations.
With this response SLS did not proceed with the trials and other arrangements as per the championship hand book.
Further, SLS has initiated following actions after 18th Aug18 with further intention of getting a favorable answer from ASF and the President India Squash racket Association requesting to provide satisfactory security arrangements to SL squad.
Till 15th Aug18 there was no positive response to SLS requests from the relevant authorities. Therefore on 17th Aug18 SLS has communicated to active parents group stating that SLS is not participating in this championship and decided to summon all trial selected players (49) and to brief them on SLS taken efforts in this regard on 25th Aug18.
On 20th Aug18 Hon. Minister Sports has contacted President SLS and had informed that No security arrangements can be made and this needs to be informed to the participants and Hon. Minister is willing to grant the approval for the team participation since parents are going to take overall responsibility on the security concern.
On this message SLS has written to the ASF and got the extension to submit the all required registration forms in this championship on 31st Aug18 though it was originally on 24th Aug18.
As planned a meeting was summoned on 25th Aug18 with the participation of all players and briefed the measures taken by SLS in this regard. During the meeting parents agreed to take total responsibility of their childs security in this tour and requested to consider the participation in this tour. Since the Hon.

## Title: Sri Lankans dominate Asia Cup records

Sri Lankans dominate Asia Cup records
Over the years, the Asia Cup has gained a lot of attention and excitement. One prime reason for that is the clash between India and Pakistan. Any cricket played between these two teams evokes the feeling of patriotism and excitement among the residents of both the countries.
Historically, the first Asia Cup was played in the year 1984 in Sharjah, Dubai where India were crowned the champions. Since then, India has been the most successful team with 6 titles ( 5 in ODI's and 1 in T20 Internationals).
The last Asia cup played in Bangladesh in 2016 was a T20 format; a deviation from the usual 50 overs format. However, this time, the Asia Cup will be played in 50 overs format in Dubai, a neutral venue for the teams.
So, having witnessed the Asia Cup for the last 34 years, let's find out who have been the top performers in this tournament.
BATTING RECORDS#1: Most runs
Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya has the most runs in the tournament's history. He has scored 1220 runs in 24 innings at an average of 53.04 and a strike rate of 102.52 with 6 centuries and 3 fifties.
Sachin Tendulkar is the lone Indian in this list with 971 runs in 21 innings at an average of 51.1 and a strike rate of 85.47 with 2 centuries and 7 fifties.
The other players in the list include Kumar Sangakkara, Arjuna Ranatunga, and Mahela Jayawardene.
Had Virat Kohli not been rested, he would have had a golden chance to enter this list.
#2: Highest individual scores
The thing which comes to our mind after seeing this list is the magnificent 183 by Virat Kohli against Pakistan in Asia Cup 2012. India chased down the target of 330 in 47.5 overs with the help of the extraordinary knock of Kohli, which had 22 fours and a six.
Younis Khan made 144 against Honk Kong in the year 2004. That was the highest individual score in the Asia Cup at that time.
The other special knocks include 143 by Shoaib Malik, 136 again by Virat Kohli and 135 by Sourav Ganguly against Bangladesh in the year 2000.
#3: Best batting strike rates
Well, no surprises here. Taking about strike rates, Shahid Afridi's name will the first on the list in limited overs cricket.
Overall, Shahid Afridi has the best strike rate in the Asia Cup at 140.74.
Suresh Raina with 113.95 is the second in the list. Virender Sehwag, Shakib Hasan, and Sanath Jayasuriya are at third, fourth and fifth respectively.
Will Shakib be able to maintain his position We will find it out after the end of the tournament.
#4: Highest batting averages
Talking about batting averages is synonymous with talking about MS Dhoni. Doesn't matter which record you see, MS Dhoni would always be among the toppers in terms of batting averages.
Overall, he has scored 571 runs in 12 innings at a phenomenal batting average of 95.16 in Asia Cup.
Navjot Sidhu, a surprise entrant is a distant second at 66.25. Marvan Atapattu with 64.2, Shoaib Malik with 63.88 and Virat Kohli at 61.3 are at third, fourth and fifth position respectively.
Let us now look at the bowling records in Asia Cup.
BOWLING RECORDS #1: Most wickets
Another list which is dominated by the Sri Lankans with four players featuring in the list of top 5 prolific wicket-takers in Asia Cup.
Muttiah Muralitharan has taken the most number of wickets with 30 wickets to his name. Ajantha Mendis is at second position with 36 wickets.
It is interesting to see that Ajantha Mendis has taken only 8 innings for his 26 wickets. A wicket per inning ratio of 3.25. Quite outstanding!
Saeed Ajmal with 25 wickets, Lasith Malinga with 24 wickets and Chaminda Vass with 23 wickets are at third, fourth and fifth position respectively.
Lasith Malinga has a good chance to topple Muralitharan from his position as he has been recalled for the tournament.
#2: Best bowling performances
Ajantha Mendis' spell of 6 for 13 against India is the best spell in the history of the tournament. Chasing 274, India were cruising along with the help of Sehwag's blistering 50.
However, things went haywire for India when Mendis was introduced in the attack. He derailed the Indian batting order by taking 6 important wickets for just 13 runs.
In the same tournament, Ajantha Mendis produced yet another sensational spell of bowling against UAE. His spell of 5 for 22 is the fourth best spell in Asia Cup.
India's Arshad Ayub, whom people may not remember, produced a superb spell of 5 for 22 against Pakistan in the year 1988, giving India a famous victory.
Aaqib Javed and Muttiah Muralitharan are the other two entries in this list.
#3: Lowest bowling averages
Talking about bowling averages, Ajantha Mendis's name is no surprise. He has taken 26 wickets in 8 innings at a phenomenal bowling average of 10.42.
Kapil Dev too was really good in Asia Cup. He has taken 15 wickets in 7 innings at a superb average of 13 and an economy rate of just 3.56; second best in Asia cup.
Abdul Qadir at 14.76, Venkatesh Prasad at 17.76 and Wasim Akram at 18.56 hold third, fourth and fifth place respectively.
#4: Lowest economy rates
Talking about economy rates of the bowlers is a crime these days. You would not find such good economy rates in today's era; especially after the rise of T20 cricket, and change in rules favoring the batsmen.
Anyway, Wasim Akram has the lowest economy rate. Overall, he has taken 16 wickets in 12 innings at an average of 18.56; fifth on the list of best bowling averages.
He is closely followed by Kapil Dev at 3.56, Abdul Qadir at 3.62 and Muttiah Muralitharan at 3.75. These are sensational bowling averages; unheard in today's era.
Let us now look at fielding records in Asia Cup.
FIELDING RECORDS #1: Most no. of dismissals by wicket-keepers
Kumar Sangakkara holds the record for most dismissals behind the wickets. Overall, he has effected 36 dismissals with 27 catches and 9 stumpings.
MS Dhoni is second with 24 dismissals. He has taken 19 catches and has 5 stumpings to his name. What is interesting is that Dhoni's dismissal/per inning is the best at 1.69, among wicket-keepers who have effected at least 10 dismissals.
It would be interesting to see if Dhoni goes past Sangakkara in Asia Cup 2018.
Moin Khan at 17, Brendon Kuruppu at 14 and Romesh Kaluwitharna at 11 are at third, fourth and fifth position respectively.
#2: Most catches by a fielder
Mahela Jayawardene holds the record for most catches. He has 15 catches to his name. Younis Khan is marginally behind him with 14 catches.
Aravinda de Silva at 12, Muralitharan at 10 and Suresh Raina at 8 are at third, fourth and fifth position respectively.
Mahela Jayawardene and Younis Khan have both taken 3 catches in an innings; the most by a player in Asia Cup.
We hope you guys had fun seeing the top performers in Asia Cup.

Trump calls on NYT to reveal 'coward' behind article
US: US President Donald Trump on Thursday called on the New York Times (NYT) to reveal the name of the coward who wrote an explosive, anonymous article that has plunged his presidency into its worst crisis yet.
The White House has been convulsed by a fevered hunt for the senior official who declared, in an unsigned article for The New York Times published Wednesday, that unsung heroes were quietly working within the administration to frustrate the President's worst inclinations. Nobody knows who the hell he is, or she, Trump told supporters at a rally in Billings, Montana, adding: Unidentified deep state operatives who defy voters to push their secret agendas are truly a threat to democracy itself. Invoking national security concerns, Trump said the paper should publish the official's name, before encouraging reporters to investigate the matter. That would be a good scoop! he said. On the internet and in Washington, a guessing game has raged over who the author might be, prompting nearly every Cabinet-ranked member of the government to deny it was them. Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats were among those who issued denials. Trump responded with a furious volley of tweets that asked if the author had committed treason while First Lady Melania Trump condemned the decision to publish. To the writer of the op-ed -- you are not protecting this country, you are sabotaging it with your cowardly actions, she said.
The Woodward book, Fear: Trump in the White House, reported that senior aides lifted documents from the Oval Office desk to keep the president from acting on his impulses, reinforcing the assertions in the Times article. James Dao, who runs the Times op-ed page, told CNN he received the article several days ago through an intermediary, but had spoken directly with its author.Trump meanwhile has called for the article's author to be unmasked.
Are the investigative 'journalists' of the New York Times going to investigate themselves - who is the anonymous letter writer, he tweeted ahead of a rally in Montana.
The Times acknowledged the rare step of publishing an anonymous editorial but said the official's job would be jeopardized if they were identified. The piece described a two-track Presidency in which Trump says one thing and his staff consciously does another, citing the president's alleged preference for autocrats and dictators. The root of the problem is the president's amorality, the official said, denouncing Trump's impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective leadership style.

The UNP at 72
The United National Party (UNP), which held its 72nd anniversary convention on Thursday, was founded two years before the country gained independence. The party played a crucial role in the struggle for independence from the British. Although initially mocked as an elitist Uncle Nephew Party by opponents, it has since transformed itself into a common mans movement with a solid vote base.
Three years ago, the party embarked on a new journey that has never really been previously experienced in Sri Lanka  a union with its main political rival the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to form a government of National Unity based in the principles of Good Governance.
In Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, we have an astute politician who has realised that divisive party politics can only take the country backward. Party politics should not be seen as a force that can impede the countrys progress. Many thought of the idea of a Government of National Unity as an impossible dream. Despite certain ideological differences between the two parties and attempts by the Opposition to scuttle the union, it has worked well to bring positive results, from the restoration of basic freedoms to the active pursuit of reconciliation. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have been broadly committed to these efforts.
The UNP has always been a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural party that has never discriminated against the minorities. In fact, some of its most well-known stalwarts have been Tamil and Muslim. The LTTE assassinated a large number of leading UNP figures because of their avowed commitment to peace. The party has since been in the forefront of efforts to formulate a new Constitution that will resolve the National Question and bring all communities and religious groups together, for a truly Sri Lankan identity.
The party must now essentially look forward to the future in a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka. It is with this aim in mind that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe declared at Thursdays Convention that he was actively grooming the next generation leaders of the party with a view to the future. Our politicians are notorious for looking only at the next election, but Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has always looked at the next generation like a true Statesman should.
In fact, some of the pivotal programmes of the Government, including Enterprise Sri Lanka and Vision 2025, are already looking beyond 2025-2030. In order to mould a more youthful party, the UNP must strengthen the grassroots base and also empower women politically. The UNP was one of the first parties to propose a higher allocation of nominations for women candidates. It has been able to attract many professional women for the hustings. The credit must go to the UNP leadership for nominating Mrs. Rosy Senanayake as the first ever woman mayor of Colombo, which is a sign of its commitment for the political and social empowerment of women.
The party faces the challenge of getting more youth on board, though this is by no means unique to the UNP. We must remember that both UNP and SLFP Governments have faced youth insurrections in the last 50 years. Addressing their concerns and frustrations is therefore vital, as is repelling their general mistrust of local politics. The healthy participation of youth at elections will be a boon for the country. We hope that parties and voters will give preference to youth, both men and women, at all upcoming polls because they can play a more dynamic role in the political sphere.
A technological focus will be the key to attracting youth. The UNP has always pioneered new technologies as a political party and as a governing force. For example, it was the first to issue e-membership cards to youth members. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has also introduced revolutionary ideas such as providing tablets for schoolchildren. With its centenary just 28 years away, innovation and technology should be a key focus for the UNP.
The UNP has faced many challenges from the very beginning, including stinging defeats, high profile defections and internal revolts, but the party has remained as a cohesive whole even as other parties splintered. In recent times, the formation of the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) by party heavyweights Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake was one of the biggest threats faced by the UNP, but today there is no trace of the DUNF. There is a lesson here for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna too, which has now realised that personality cults cannot sustain a party, with the debacle of Kolambata Janabalaya.
The UNP, and indeed the SLFP, are not parties based on a single persons personality and ideology which is a factor that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa seemed to have forgotten when he floated the idea of Kolambata Janabalaya as a vehicle to boost his sons political image. For the UNP leadership, it is the party that matters, not individuals. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe amply demonstrated this when he encapsulated his plans for grooming the next level leaders who can take the party victoriously to 2046 and beyond.

USAID, banks partner to  support enterprises
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the USAID Development Credit Authority (DCA), Hatton National Bank and Sampath Bank have announced a new partnership for a programme of up to US$ 9 million for local financing available to private, micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) throughout Sri Lanka.
This seven-year programme will help to address the current lack of financing to these key borrower groups. This partnership will complement and be further supported by USAID's YouLead programme that strengthens employability and self-employment opportunities for youth in Sri Lanka, the US Embassy stated in a press release.
The signing of this agreement, which took place on September 5in Colombo, reaffirms United States' commitment to Sri Lanka's economic development and is part of broader and ongoing USAID support for Sri Lanka.
We at USAID are proud to encourage private sector lending in key sectors that are vital to the economic development of Sri Lanka, said Reed Aeschliman, Mission Director for USAID Sri Lanka.
Increasing access to credit enables youth entrepreneurs to improve their own lives, and helps small and medium enterprises to spur further economic growth in their respective regions.
The programme represents a crucial step toward enabling Sri Lanka's private sector and youth entrepreneurs to access capital, expand businesses, and ultimately, to create more jobs. The agreement will unlock critical resources that will help spur innovation, foster investment and provide critical resources to under-served segments of Sri Lanka's economy including existing MSMEs and start-ups, the release stated.
Given HNBs extended legacy of facilitating growth and development in the MSME sector, we are conscious of the immense potential and vital need for access to finance. Todays partnership between HNB, USAID and Sampath Bank represents a vital step forward in our collective mission in enhancing economic opportunities for young Sri Lankans, said Jude Fernando, HNB Deputy General Manager  SME and Mid-Market.
HNB and Sampath Banks' strategies align well with the purpose of this partnership. Both banks have extensive outreach and experience and are well positioned and committed to increasing MSMEs and start-up lending.
We at Sampath Bank believe in entrepreneurship development at all levels and development finance has been a major area of lending for us. As such, we welcome this scheme which will provide better access to much-required capital for the new entrepreneurs and it aligns well with our own entrepreneurship development initiative, said Tharaka Ranwala, Senior Deputy Managing Director of Sampath Bank.
USAID's DCA works with investors, local financial institutions, and development organisations to design and deliver investment alternatives to mobilize local financing for U.S. Government priorities.
To date, the DCA has helped mobilize up to US $5.4 billion in private capital in 76 countries across 558 projects. USAID is the development agency of the U.S. Government. USAID has provided development and humanitarian assistance to developing countries worldwide for over 50 years.
In Sri Lanka, the U.S. Government has invested more than Rs. 320 billion (two billion US dollars) to benefit its people since 1956.

Wiggie appears before CA in contempt of court case
Northern Province Chief Minister and former Supreme Court Judge C.V. Wigneswaran and three others appeared before the Court of Appeal yesterday over a complaint that they have intentionally acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order.
When the application came up before Justice Janak de Silva, the three respondents Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and two other Provincial Council Ministers Ananthi Sasitharan and K.Sivanesan were advised to appear in Court on September 18 as well.
This matter will be taken up before Court of Appeal two-judge-Bench on the next date.
The Court of Appeal made this order following a complaint made by B. Denishwaran alleging that Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and Ananthi Sasitharan and K.
