Good quality, value addition must to salvage tea industry
As the quality of Ceylon tea is still high there is a very good response for it in the foreign market and authorities should take more measures towards producing good quality and value added tea to capture more global players, opined National Policies and Economic Affairs, State Minister Dr Harsha de Silva at the 124rd AGM of the Colombo Tea Traders Association (CTTA) held in Colombo.
Minister De Silva highlighted that Ceylon tea is still best in the world and lauded the Colombo Tea Traders Association for their invaluable contribution rendered towards the countrys oldest plantation industry that helped to swell the countrys economy to a greater extent. Dr. De Silva pointed out that not producing enough tea, not marketing tea in a methodical way and still focusing on wrong products were the main obstacles the tea industry faced today.
The Minister also recalled that Sri Lanka previously supplied majority of its tea to the UK and Pakistan markets but in 2006 exported only 3.04 per cent to UK and 2.13 per cent to Pakistan while in the same year Kenya exported 47.12 per cent and 60.05 per cent of tea to UK and Pakistan markets respectively.
He said the Ceylon tea industry needs revitalization to take it forward, otherwise the industry will lose grounds to competitor countries. Dr De Silva also warned against the practice of adulterating Ceylon tea with cheaper imports and still presenting it as Ceylon Tea.We need effective regulatory environment and law enforcement to stop such activities, he cautioned. Ceylon Tea Traders Association, Chairman Anselm Perera recalled the incident where Lankas largest buyer of Ceylon Tea, Russia suddenly suspended the import of Ceylon Tea in December 2017, due to the discovery of a beetle in a container of Ceylon Tea.
The Chairman expressed his gratitude to former Tea Board Chairman Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda and Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Dr. Saman Weerasinghe for their support to get us out of that unpleasant situation.
Focusing his attention towards the ban of using Glyphosate which was imposed in 2015, Perera said plantation Managers applied this product for efficient weed control.Glyphosate which was widely used as a weed eradicator by all tea producing countries across the world continues to be used not only for tea but for most commercial crops. Unfortunately Sri Lanka chose to be the only exception.
He said authorities should know that this product has been most cost effective and received wide acceptance globally in the plantations industry.

Lankan economy needs to create more and better jobs to sustain growth
The Sri Lankan economy needs to create more and better jobs to sustain growth and optimally use its working-age population including women, youth and young graduates. This means that both sides of the jobs marketthe supply of jobs and the supply of labourneed to be addressed, while also reducing skills mismatches, a group of economists and experts suggested in Colombo yesterday.
The panel also raised concerns on decreasing female participation in the labour market and suggested the institution should provide affordable childcare and tackle sexual harassment at work place in order to encourage more women to join the workforce.
Sri Lankas female labour force participation (LFP) rates declined from 41 percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2016. This trend stands in contrast to the countrys achievements in human development outcomes that favor women, such as high levels of female education and low total fertility rates, as well as its status as a middle-income country.
The panel discussion coincided with the launch of a new World Bank report in Colombo. The panelists took part included Professor Dayantha Wijesekera, Chairman Designate, Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission, Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, Chair of the Global Economy Programme, Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, Dr. Nisha Arunatilake, Director of Research, Institute of Policy Studies, Ayomi Fernando, Industrial Relations Advisor/Training Coordinator at Employers Federation of Ceylon, and Ralph van Doorn, Senior Country Economist for Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
The report Sri Lankas new Development Update noted, the governments key policy document, Vision 2025, aspires to transform Sri Lanka into the hub of the Indian Ocean, with a knowledge-based, highly competitive, social market economy focused on inclusion. Among the intermediate targets set for the next three years is the goal to create 1 million new jobs. This is an ambitious target, in light of the growth rates required to facilitate this level of job creation.
During the discussion panellists agreed that structural reforms to increase competitiveness are essential to create better jobs.
Dr. Wignaraja highlighted three priorities to create more jobs - raise female participation, improve English language skills and implement public sector reforms while Dr. Arunatilake suggested hiring foreign talent, preventing brain-drain and to look at ways to encourage more women to enter the labour market. Dr. Arunatilake added Sri Lanka needs more and better English teachers to improve the employment prospects of young people; one option could be a cooperation agreement with the Philippines, which has a surplus of such teachers. Professor Wijesekera was of the view that Sri Lankans should get out of the mentality of O/L, A/L and University syndrome and enter the job market at various levels with skill improvement programs and facilities should be developed to encourage young people to build their careers and professions through tertiary education.
The report also highlighted the job market issues in the Northern and Eastern Provinces specifically where employment rates are lower. There do not appear to be quick fixes; but to the extent that skills and access to finance are key constraints to both households and firms, the same agenda as in the rest of the island applies: investment in human and physical capital will increase productivity and better connect workers to more productive jobs, it said.

Laws will be enacted to protect Buddhism from discredit
Laws will be enacted soon to prevent the discredit and dishonour made to Buddhism by distorting the Tripitaka, Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera said.
An Advisory Committee with the participation of the Justice Minister is now meeting and discussing measures to be taken in this direction on the advice of the Mahanayake Theras, he said.
The Minister was speaking to the Media after he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates at their Aramayas in Kandy and received their blessings on June 30.
The Minister said the majority of the Maha Sangha including the Mahanayake Theras have paid strict attention towards Bhikkhu Vinaya (Code of Conduct) and introducing stiff legislation to control activities of immoral sections causing harm to the Sambuddha Sasana. He briefed them on the programme proposed for the progress and welfare of the Buddha Sasana.
All the steps in this direction would be taken with the advice and blessings of the Maha Sangha.
The Minister said that some groups had distorted the Tripitake for their own benefit, and the Advisory Committee would take these matters into cognizance before making decisions.
Minister Perera said he would discuss the possibility of extending the student insurance scheme to pirivena students too with the Education Minister. He was planning to introduce an insurance scheme for pirivena teachers and a health insurance scheme for elderly bhikkhus, so that they could claim insurance cover during illnesses.
Buddha Sasana Ministry Secretary Chandraprema Gamage and Kandy Regional Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs Parakrama Jayawardene were present.

MR cannot be SLFP Co-chairman
Some people argue that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be made SLFP Co-chairman, but it cannot be done in terms of the party constitution, SPFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said.
He disclosed this when he visited the Katukelle Jumma Mosque in Kandy on June 30. According to the SLFP Constitution, a party member who gets elected as the country's President, automatically becomes party chairman, while former President becomes its honourary patrons, he said.
Prof. Piyadasa said former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga had become party patrons as decided by the Party Constitution.
Prof. Piyadasa said the most suitable candidate acceptable to the SLFP and the UPFA would be fielded at the next Presidential Election. "That candidate selected under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena would never be a common candidate. Although fielding the best possible candidate at the next Presidential Election was difficult, complex and problematic, it would be a creative challenge," he said.
Prof. Piyadasa said the SLFP had always stood for minority rights and the opinion some tried to create that it was opposed to minority rights could be construed as a myth. He said the Pohottuwa group was not a political party because many of its membership had not given up SLFP membership.
"Neither have they intimated their desire to resign from SLFP membership to the SLFP Central Committee in writing. These people are still attending party's committee and Central Committee meetings," he said.
Referring to the recent New York Times Report, he said Sri Lankan media persons could conduct an investigative report on the incident as the government would never try to influence them. Such an investigation by local media persons could establish whether it was correct. Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and Provincial Minister Ediriweera Weerawardene were present.

Significant improvement in countrys macroeconomic fundamentals
There has seen a significant improvement in the macroeconomic fundamentals and a positive shift in the economic narrative for the country, said Rajendra Theagarajah, Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, addressing the 179th AGM of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce held in Colombo recently.
Our hope is that programmes such as Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya (Village Transformation) will bring up the next generation of entrepreneurs and drive economic development to the village, he said.
Theagarajah said although last year was a challenging year for the private sector, their members managed in balancing both external and domestic risks. While achieving macro stability to a great extent with higher level of reserves,FDI and exports reaching all-time highs in 2017, he said business confidence has been tepid in the backdrop of political uncertainty.
We have also seen a semblance of policy congruence in recent policy documents brought out by the government which has been lacking in recent years. As we have highlighted in numerous forums and submissions, the credibility of government policy will solely rest on the effectiveness of its implementation, he said.
Theagarajah said the economy presently faced numerous challenges with the countrys GDP growth falling below 4% for five consecutive quarters. However there has been a progress in terms of trade and investment facilitation.
The Chairman said his Chamber favors an outward orientation of the economy which involves deeper engagement with countries such as through bi-lateral agreements such as FTAs. The recently signed FTA with Singapore along with the legislation on Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties and Safeguard Measures are examples of this.
On FTAs, the Chamber facilitated many meetings for the negotiating team to consult with private sector stakeholder groups and is currently studying the text of the Singapore Agreement to provide a responsible view and opinion which is missing in the current discourse in the public domain.
The discussion while focusing on national interests should also be based on sound facts in the context of the overall development strategy for the country taking into account the trade and investment nexus. Irresponsible statements that are not based on the truth should be avoided, he cautioned.

57th ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEOPLES BANK: THE FIRST AMONG THE EQUALS
Peoples Bank celebrates its 57th anniversary on 01st July 2018. The establishment of the bank under the Act no. 29 of 1961 as a State owned bank with special mandate to reach out the rural community was a landmark initiative in the banking history of our country.
Banking history of our country dates back to the year 1828, when the first commercial bank was established. But the needs of the rural communities were not catered by them, because they were established by colonial rulers to provide facilities to plantation and commercial sectors.
Prior to the advent of the Peoples Bank, commercial bank branches were located exclusively in urban centers. Only people fluent in English were able to do business with them, depriving the access to banking to others due to language barriers. Although Sinhala and Tamil languages are the national languages, business of those banks was conducted in English, until Peoples Bank broke through this barrier by adopting them when conducting business in their branches. So rural areas were dominated by informal source of lending at exorbitant interest rates. Even employment opportunities were also limited to English speaking people.
Role in popularizing banking service
Since the inception of the Peoples Bank in 1961, it played a pioneering role in popularize the banking service by opening branches in rural and estate areas, which were previously unexposed to traditional bankers. Out of the 09 branches opened in the year 1961, eight branches were located in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruva, Hingurakgoda, Hambantota, Matale and Puttalama. Its first branch was opened at Duke Street, Colombo, where I was also privileged to become the Chief Manager in the year 1996.
Staff members attached to those branches located in dry isolated areas had to work under very difficult condition, as there were no basic facilities such as water, electricity, telephone, transport, lodging, and health facilities etc. Most of the branches were like ovens during the day time, because roofs are covered with galvanized sheets. So they worked under such austere condition to build a strong sustainable foundation for the bank.
Peoples Bank introduced multitude of products and services recognizing the needs of the people with the view of performing their social responsibility towards the nation. Also used unconventional methods such as pawning to reach peoples in every social stratum. The product cycle spread out from the cradle to twilight years of the people such as Isuru Udana for new born infants, Sisu Udana for students, YES for young generation, Vanitha Vasana, and Parinatha for senior citizens.
A there were no suitable people to introduce rural people to the bank, they were allowed to prove their identity by submitting their rice ration books and pay a small sum of Rs.5/= as initial deposit to open accounts. Specimen forms were displayed in the notice boards to instruct them how to fill the necessary forms to open accounts.
Investment Savings Accounts, a credit linked savings account was introduced to attract regular savers and also to inculcate savings discipline among them. They were also qualified to obtain loans for their financial needs such as housing, consumption by submitting two sureties with same qualifications.
Multi-purpose co-operative societies (MPCS) operated in affiliation with Peoples Bank since the beginning of the Bank. Their credit requirements were provided charging nominal interest rates after obtaining simple securities. The bank was the pioneer lender in agriculture loans to farmers through them.
Co-operative Rural banks
Co-operative Rural Banks (CRB) was set up as the banking arm of the MPCS to institutionalize the rural credit through them. First CRB was opened at Menikhinna in 1964.CRBs were supervised by Peoples Bank, furnishing them with financial and management assistance, as MPCS covered a large area. CRBs were able to reach large segment of rural population than a bank branch.
Pawning Advances
Lending against pawned gold articles also started by the bank to relieve the people from the clutches of the money lenders who charged exorbitant interest rates. This scheme was severely criticized by other banks. But today they also have started pawning business as their Major Cash Cow. CRBs were also authorized to grant pawning advances as agents of Peoples Bank Pawning and Savings Centers opened by the bank provide more convenient access to people.
Loan Schemes
Various loan schemes had been introduced to provide facilities to various segments of the community .Gurusetha, Suva sevana, government employees loan scheme, Electricity loans, S.M.I.loans, housing and commercial loans are some of them designed to grant access for their various needs.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Peoples Bank implemented its services considering its responsibility towards the society to uplift rural communities leading to national development. Scholarships were granted through Sisu Udana Kusalatha Pranama scheme to students who excelled in their 5th standard scholarship and GCE (OL) exams. The bank donated a hostel tin Kinsey Road to medical student of the Colombo University.
When the business of Central Bank were adversely affected by the bomb explosion in 1996, Peoples Bank offered its service by handling refinance portfolios by receiving and disbursing refinance funds and receiving repayment of loans. In case of EPF, the bank undertook to collect contributions and make refunds to EPF members.
Peoples Bank gave a new meaning to traditional new year customs performed by Sinhala and Tamil communities in auspicious times by introducing new year ganudenu custom through the bank in 1973. Today other banks also follow the same every year. Telecasting of Randoli Perahara of Sri Dalada Maligaya was also sponsored by the bank since 1990s.
The most important strength of the bank is peoples confidence. Their firm loyalty was first tested in 1992, when the then finance minister made a controversial statement stating that the bank was technically insolvent with negative net worth. But it had not affected adversely and depositors took the news very impatiently and assured their confidence further without making any panic withdrawals of deposits.
The secret behind this extra ordinary support of the customers was their firm loyalty which Peoples Bank had been successful in building over a long period of time.

Akinfeev stars as Russia stun Spain
Moscow, Sunday: Russia captain Igor Akinfeev saved two penalties in a dramatic shootout as the World Cup hosts dumped title contenders Spain out in the last 16 following a 1-1 draw.
Veteran Russia centre-back Sergei Ignashevich gifted Spain the opening goal on 12 minutes in Moscow when he unwittingly turned into his own net after grappling with Sergio Ramos.
Russia hit back just before the interval as Artem Dzyuba nervelessly converted a penalty awarded for a handball by Gerard Pique.
Spain controlled the game as expected but struggled to create genuine chances, with Akinfeev sharp on the few occasions they did before saving from Koke and Iago Aspas to seal a 4-3 win on penalties.
We are having a fantastic World Cup, said Akinfeev.
Not just our fans, but the fans of other countries got a sense of this atmosphere and understood that Russians really know how to play football and want to play football.
Russia will meet either Croatia or Denmark for a place in the semi-finals, as Spains rotten run against hosts nation at major tournaments continued.
Fernando Hierro made the bold decision to drop Andres Iniesta for Koke in central midfield, with Marco Asensio handed his first start of the competition.
Russia boss Stanislav Cherchesov left out leading scorer Denis Cheryshev, opting for three central defenders in a conservative 5-3-2 formation.
It was Nacho, in for Dani Carvajal at right-back, who won the free-kick that led to Spain taking the lead as he was caught by Yury Zhirkov to the right of the penalty area.
Asensio, who made two brief substitute appearances in the group stage, whipped in dangerously to the far post where the ball looped in off an unsighted Ignashevich as he tussled with Ramos.
Spain dominated the first 30 minutes, pressing Russia heavily as the hosts struggled to advance beyond the halfway line in humid conditions.
Aleksandr Golovin carved out their first chance of note, starting a move with a jinking run before bending just wide of David de Geas left-hand post.
Isco produced a series of regal touches with Spains King Felipe VI among those in the crowd at the Luzhniki Stadium, but Russia equalised shortly before half-time.
A deep corner was met by Dzyuba, whose header struck the outstretched arm of Pique, with referee Bjorn Kuipers contemplating his decision before pointing to the spot.
Dzyuba calmly sent De Gea the wrong with his penalty to join Cheryshev on a team-leading three goals.
Akinfeev snuffed out an opening for Diego Costa on the stroke of half-time as the Spain striker tried to latch onto a through ball.
The Russia goalkeeper was again involved early in the second half, flying to his left to pluck a spinning Jordi Alba effort from the air.
Cherchesov introduced Cheryshev for Alexander Samedov on the hour, a move greeted by a deafening roar from the home support.
Iniesta replaced David Silva, while Costa was withdrawn for Aspas, and the two substitutes went close to winning it late in regulation time.
A low 20-yard drive heading towards was palmed away by at Akinfeev at full stretch, with the angled follow-up from Aspas also pushed to safety.
Aspas nearly picked out Carvajal with a cut-back seconds into the start of extra time, which saw Aleksandr Erokhin come on as Russias fourth sub -- the first time the rule has been applied at the World Cup.
Spain followed suit as Rodrigo replaced Asensio, and the former went closest to ending the impasse, sprinting towards goal after a clever dummy only for Akinfeev to claw his shot away before the rebound from Koke was blocked.
Russia endured a tense wait when Kuipers was in communication with the video assistant referee following a late tug on Pique in the box, before Akinfeevs shootout heroics clinched an unforgettable triumph. AFP

Pricille D. Fernando
Humble human being
Two years ago on June 28, my beloved husband departed this world. Even two years after his passing, his abrupt departure continues to be an unacceptable, indescribable feeling in my life.
Dear Pricille, for you, life was a journey that was to be lived "your way", in the literal sense. That was to be concerned about others more than yourself; to make everyone around you more comfortable than you were. To bring forth joy and happiness to all around you. To live a life that would be meaningful in more than one way. You certainly achieved that and more.
He also built a network of friends and acquaintances. He loved his music and sang better than anyone else to keep a session going. Not only was he there for any event, but he made sure it was a memorable one with his joyful antics.
Pricille was always the first to help when a friend was in need. He loved others as much as he loved his family. These memories of you that we cherish will never fade away; it is firmly etched in our hearts. Caring and sharing was his theme. There was never a dull moment with him around. He was a man of wit, will and winning mindset.
Dear Pricille, for you, the present was far more important than the past, and you cherished every bit of it. Yours was a life of no regrets, while building the best around you, be it business or personal. Your goal was to make life a joyful journey of memories and fun; not one-centred on accolades and other achievements. To spread love and see a world filled with emotions.
Physically, you may not with us, but the memories you left behind will always be in our hearts, reminding us of great times well lived.
Until we meet you in person in the heavenly kingdom, please do intercede us to walk closely with our Lord Jesus Christ.
Monica

Peace Somaratne
She possessed boundless compassion
For me, to live is Christ and to die, is gain.
Philippians 1: 21
My beloved sister peace went to be with Lord Jesus on December 21, 2017. It is hard to accept that we will not see her smiling face or hear her gentle voice encouraging, comforting and guiding us anymore.
Akka was born on April 18, 1943, the second in a family of 5. She was just 15 months older than myself. For some reason that I cannot recall, we were in the same class in school from Grade 1. Though we were nothing alike in looks and temperament, we were often mistaken for twins. We were the best of friends, studying and playing together. It was hard for me when we were separated at the Ordinary Level class when she went into the Arts stream, while I selected Science.
She made her distinctive contribution as a student to Methodist College, being appointed a prefect for two years, Vice Captain of a school house for one, and Captain for another. She was also the Leader of the Sinhala Debating team and a member of the English Debating team. She entered the University of Peradeniya in 1961, to read for a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics.
She married Professor G. P. V. Somaratne in 1966 and accompanied him when he went to London to read for his PhD in History. She was his devoted and caring wife for 52 years.
On their return to Sri Lanka in 1969, she joined the tutorial staff of her alma mater Methodist College. She was a gifted teacher having the skill to kindle an interest in the subjects she taught; History, Sinhala and Economics in the Ordinary Level and Advanced Level classes. She was a strict disciplinarian, but earned the warm affection and loyalty of her students as they sensed her genuine concern and interest in their welfare.
Akka was an undergraduate when there was a revival of Sinhala drama under the influence of Prof. Ediriweera Sarathchandra. This exposure gave her the vision and skill to direct Chora Pabbathaya and Sakkaya Ditthi; two successful stylised Sinhala dramas.
Students and Staff alike were devastated when akka gave up teaching in 1982. She had been invited to join a team who had taken on the challenge of editing a new Sinhala translation of the Holy Bible spearheaded by the Ceylon Bible Society. She felt that part-time involvement was insufficient for such a tremendous task. Though she loved her profession as a teacher, she willingly gave it up as she was convinced that it was Gods calling for her. She was also responsible for editing a Sinhala study Bible which had not existed before. She got actively involved in supporting her husband, in helping with research, editing and proofreading many books wrote during the past two decades, which have enriched Christian literature.
She was indeed the wind beneath his wings.
Akka was the epitome of simplicity, often dressed in white. She shunned jewelry, wearing only a simple pair of ear studs. Her adornment was her beautiful smile which radiated her goodness and inner peace.
Akkas compassion and caring knew no bounds. She would reach out to those in need, those who were hurting, and was able to comfort, encourage and heal anyone. She was always ready to lend a helping hand and paying school fees for less-affluent students at Methodist College, providing regular supply of dry rations to families who were struggling to make ends-meet, all without publicity or fanfare. The daily maid who came to help with cleaning, tearfully told me that akka had given her Rs. 1,000 to buy Christmas presents for her two little boys, just before akka entered hospital in December.
She was a gifted speaker, but never was a show-off. She never used big words or high-flown theology. Her words were simple and touched the hearts of her listeners, making an indelible impact. When she prayed, we felt that she had a hotline to Jesus.
Akka has a son Dasharatha (a Chaplain in the USA Army) and a daughter Prarthana Devi (a Primary School Teacher), both who reside in the United States. She provided them with love, support and guidance, and most of all, inculcated a steadfast love for their Saviour Jesus.
These two well-balanced and outstanding young people are evidence to her good parenting. Akka has eight grandchildren and five great grandchildren.
She was priya akka to her many cousins and a much-loved loku achchi to her grandnieces and nephews.
After akkas demise, many of her past pupils at Methodist College, scattered throughout Sri Lanka and abroad, contacted me to express their sympathy. Many said that they were who they are today because of the sound moral and Christian values that were instilled in them by their teacher at a young and impressionable age.
Goodbye my dearest akka. Your departure left an aching void in our lives.
We will hold you in our hearts and find comfort in the sure knowledge that you are safe in the arms of Jesus. We look forward to the glorious day when we will meet again, beyond the sunset.

Lt. Gen. Parami Kulatunge
Outstanding military man
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. He does not set out to be a leader, but becomes one by the equality of his actions and the integrity of his intent.
- Gen. Douglas MacArthur
Ministerial motorcades with backup commando escort and outriders whizzing past us on the busy streets in and around Colombo were a common sight in 2006. But Lieutenant General Parami Kulatunga travelled to Army Headquarters in Colombo from his quarters in Homagama everyday in a marked green Peugeot, bearing a military license plate, followed only by a beat-up pickup truck. He had no outriders, no protective units assigned to him, no bulletproof or bombproof car. He wanted his quarters inside the Army Headquarters (AHQ) complex, but it was denied to him. So he had little choice.
As the third highest ranking officer in the Army, he travelled 28 km to the Army Headquarters in Colombo, spending two hours each day on the road covering 56 km both ways. The fact that he travelled to work every morning along the High Level Road, quickly became known to the public.
I was one of the first to stand beside him when he laid on that cold, grey slab at the General Hospital. After all the trauma, his face was serene. Many laid the blame squarely (and fairly) on the government, for having neglected to protect such an outstanding and astounding military man who had proved his mettle on and off the battlefield and was indeed a priceless resource in the countrys war on terror and beyond.
His family and friends were devastated. They thought he was invincible. I know of some who never recovered from the news, living now in eternal grief. His death evoked extraordinary indignation from the public. Malinda Seneviratnes tribute to him, Requiem, which I read recently, is extremely and deeply moving.
From a news report: There were about 100 people guarding his body at the National Hospital, five truck loads and five jeep loads of soldiers were on guard outside the funeral parlour and about the same number escorted his body from the parlour to his home in Kelaniya and yet another grand escort was given at his funeral. However, when he was alive and in service, he was only provided with one measly back up vehicle as security, said another grief-stricken relative of Lt. General Parami Kulatunga.
Parami was the youngest of Lionel and Leela Kulatunga of Lewela, Kandy and the adored and deeply missed brother of Lumbini, Samantha and Indu. A die-hard Trinitian, although he played rugby, his passion was for cadetting. He ended up the Senior Regimental Sergeant Major of the Senior Cadet Platoon.
He decided to join the army in 1971, when the country was in the throes of the JVP insurgency and he was commissioned to the elite Gemunu Watch. His detailed and impeccable 35 year military record is easily accessible.
He played a major role in the Vadamarachchi Operation of 1987, when the Jaffna peninsula was liberated under Lt. General Denzil Kobbekaduwa, as well as Operation Balavegaya I and II in 1991 and 1992 which saved Elephant Pass. He was the General Officer Commanding the 52 Division which stopped the waves of the advancing LTTE cadres in Eluthumattuval, after the Elephant Pass camp was overrun. Parallel to that, he was an integral stakeholder of the then ten Kinihira Operations, which were meant for the capture of Jaffna. He also played his part in the Valampoori, Yal Devi and Jayasikurui Operations. His decorations included the Rana Sura Padakkama (RSP), Uttama Seva Padakkama (USP), Sri Lanka Armed Services Long Service Medal, Riviresa Campaign Services Medal, Poorna Bhumi Padakkama, North and East Operations Medal and Desha Putra Sammanaya, amongst others. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Vishista Seva Vibhushanaya (VSV), the second-highest ranked medal for gallantry.
Parami could comfortably wear the badge of an officer and a gentleman. Nobody would ever deny him that. The manner in which he established rapport amongst the civil officials, religious dignitaries and members of the public in Jaffna or wherever he was stationed for that matter, was inspirational to all his junior officers and soldiers around him. I have personally seen how much he has done for disabled troops at Kuruwita.
Parami was a bulwark to his large and endearing Talwatte and Kulatunge families. Like with all his friends and colleagues he always found time to visit his aging aunts and uncles, lift their spirits, listen with patience to their woes and swiftly reconcile them when he suspected disunity.
He was there for everybody and caste, creed or religion was never a criterion during his association with people. I remember when I had to undergo surgery he was there when I was wheeled in and there when I was wheeled out. And then, when I lived in denial, he would visit me many times unannounced and prop me up with wonderful words of encouragement and hand me inspirational books to help improve my sagging coping skills. Parami was a devout Buddhist and although he struggled at times to balance the dhamma with the war, he finally succeeded in achieving the harmony he sought. He did not pay mere lip service to the Buddha, dhamma and the sangha, but truly took them as his refuge at all times. This was plain to see by all of us who knew him intimately.
As it had been said, he was bold, dashing and handsome, relentless in combat, magnanimous in victory and gracious to his vanquished enemies.

Captain Theja Liyanagamage
A valiant soldier who fought for the motherland
It has been 20 years since the passing away of Mangala Liyanagame, the gallant young soldier who was gunned down by LTTE forces on June 8, 1998 in the Kilinochchi jungles when he was only 27 years old. Although two decades have passed since his tragic demise, he still lives in my heart; not only as a beloved cousin, but also as a young hero from the South whose precious life was snatched away during the prime of his life.
Theja Mangala Liyanagamage, born on November 26, 1971, was the youngest of the three sons of former All-Island Justice of Peace late Piyasena Liyanagamage and late Prema Liyanagamage (nee Samaranayake); both government servants of Hapugala, Galle. Similar to his two elder brothers, Mangala too, attended Richmond College during his entire school career, where he was an outstanding sportsman. His forte was hockey, in which he captained the college team and later, represented the Southern Province and the army.
When he finished his school education, his parents wanted him to select a career other than the forces as his two elder brothers were already in the forces by that time. But that was not to be; without telling anyone, he applied to join the army and when he appeared for the interview. With his nearly six feet stature and brilliant achievements in sports as well as his family background, the army had no questions to ask. He was readily recruited on August 26, 1991, as a Cadet Officer. It was the beginning of a brief, but brilliant and exemplary military career.
Having undergone preliminary military training at the Diyatalawa Miltary Academy, Mangala was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and thereafter, during his entire career in the army, he served only in the operational areas in the North, including Elephant Pass, Paranthan, Venthalaikeni and Kilinocchi at a time when terrorism was at its peak within the country.
Mangala was one of the pioneer members of the 10th Battalion of the Sinha Regiment, which was set up in the year 1997. He was popular as an officer who served the army with unfaltering commitment and dedication. In the year 1995, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and in recognition of his bravery and commitment, he was awarded the Weera Wicrama Vibhooshana (WWV) medal.
Having served in the war-torn areas of the North for a continuous period of over six years, Mangala was eligible to apply for a transfer to a congenial area in the South. But he did not want to leave the battalion which he led with courage and dedication. Then came the fateful day; June 8th, 1998; when he was active in the battlefields in Kilinochchi. Mangala was killed by an LTTE bullet.
Mangalas eldest brother Air Commodore Ravindra Liyanagamage, who joined the Sri Lanka Air Force in 1988 as a Cadet Officer, is at present, the Ratmalana Air Base Commander; while his other brother Captain Jagath Liyanagamage, who joined the Sri Lanka Navy in 1990 as a Cadet Officer, is currently the South East Naval Command Logistic Department Captain.
If Mangala did not fall prey to the LTTE, by now, he would have risen to the highest echelons in the Sri Lanka Army. But unfortunately, fate decreed otherwise.
Dear Mangala malli, we are proud of you. You are our hero, you sacrificed your life for your country. Although we cannot see you, our fond memories of you are still fresh in our minds and you will never be forgotten. Since your departure, every year during the month of June, your parents provided a sangika dana to the Maha Sanga in your memory, to invoke blessings on you. All of us in our family circle as well as a large number of your friends participated in such annual alms-givings. After the demise of your parents, this tradition was continued by your brothers.
May the blessings of the Triple Gem be with you always throughout your journey in Sansara.
Damitha Samaranayake, Nawala.

Art for the upper crust
In Germany, a country known more for kuchen than pie, one baker has become a sensation for her design-savvy, American-style pastries.
Karin Pfeiff-Boschek makes three pies each week, posts pictures of them on Instagram  where she has 74,000 followers  and then gives most of them away to friends and charities. Her online pastry portfolio routinely garners thousands of likes and fan comments. Thats no surprise, given the stunning appeal of her dough decorations. Her creations, which she says must look good both pre- and post-baked, are embellished with intricate patterns of cut-outs and edible appliqus.
The result is a culinary theatre-in-the-round, starring a butter-pastry cascade of rosettes, hearts, leaves, vines, berries, braids, stars, paisley, perforations, diamonds and dots.
She also produces square and rectangular slab pies, a concept partly spurred by Pi Day (March 14, when the date matches the mathematical ratio) and the formula Pi r squared.
Her kitchen repertoire, like that of most households, reflects family traditions. The photogenic pastries are a marital merger combining Pfeiff-Boscheks background in textile design with a bit of apple-pie influence from the American Midwest. Her husband, northern Indiana native Bruce Boschek, moved to Germany in the 1960s to study for his PhD. He brought with him lessons in making pie from his mother, who was an award-winning baker.
I always liked his apple, rhubarb, pumpkin or blueberry pies, Pfeiff-Boschek writes in English via email. At some point, I thought the top crust would offer a good canvas for artistic creation.
She learned to bake from her mother and grandmothers when she was a girl in central Germany. Now at the age of 60-plus, Pfeiff-Boschek recalls that cakes were not so interesting because there are many fantastic cake decorators in her country, whereas pie decoration was virtually unknown. Both cakes and pies have their place, Pfeiff-Boschek says. I prefer cake with coffee or tea in the afternoon.
At times, Pfeiff-Boschek uses the fruit filling to create the pattern, as she did with a ropelike design made from green and red apples slices left in their skins for colour. (A light brushing with lemon juice keeps the fruit from yellowing, she says.) She also has experimented with colour by incorporating powder made from freeze-dried blueberries to create a dramatic purple pastry.
Producing her vision is a task of almost surgical precision. Her toolbox includes 100-plus cookie cutters (some antique, others purchased on Amazon, eBay and at her local kitchen shop) and a sharp knife for freehand work.
If the top crust is relatively simple, Pfeiff-Boschek decorates it on a flat, metal disk, then cools it and slides it onto the pie.
I often place it on the disk in the freezer for 10 or 15 minutes to make certain its firm enough to slide, she says. If its more complex, I put the crust on the pie and then add the decorations. It really depends on the design.
Mixing the basic dough takes about 30 minutes, which is followed by two hours of refrigeration, Pfeiff-Boschek says. Decorating is typically a two-hour task. It can take longer, however, for more complex designs.

Be a blind person's eyes
There are many things those of us who can see take for granted.
Knowing whether its shampoo or conditioner youre about to pour all over your head or whether the tin youre planning to eat from is cat food or beans are simple parts of life many can do without help.
An app has been created to take the hassle out of these everyday tasks for blind and visually impaired people, using volunteers from all over the world to lend a hand.
Be My Eyes is a free app that allows people looking for a virtual pair of eyes to call a volunteer who can receive a video call and decipher whatever the person needs.
Hans Jrgen Wiberg, inventor and founder of Be My Eyes, about how his own personal experiences led him to its creation. As a visually impaired person himself hes worked with the Danish Association of the Blind and understands the needs of someone in a pinch such as this.
While he had friends that used things like Facetime and Skype, there was nothing purpose-built for blind people.
After presenting the app at a startup event in 2012, Be My Eyes was officially released in 2015 and has been going from strength to strength ever since.
Be My Eyes has 1.4 million volunteers and over 84,000 blind or visually impaired people are signed up to the app.
Hans says that theyre also well-equipped to cater for people no matter their language:
We have volunteers for 180 languages. If its the middle of the night, we can match someone with a volunteer across the world. Some languages  like Icelandic or even Danish  are harder to find volunteers for late at night, but we have a secondary language feature, so if they also speak English or French, the app finds someone that way.
Theyre not planning on turning it into a social networking idea, instead focusing on quick interactions that are efficient and help the person in need right away.
You can ask what the weathers like in London or Denmark, but the goal isnt making friends.
Hans wants it to be more about random acts of kindness than some wider friendship-building exercise.
Basically, you get a call, help someone work out the expiry date on their milk or if theyre taking the correct medicine, and neither party has to give up too much time while something nice is done.
We call it micro-volunteering You dont need to go somewhere on a Wednesday at 7pm every week.
In terms of feedback, Hans gets emails upon emails praising the app.

Belgium wary of complacency as Japan chase history
ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia, Saturday: Dries Mertens has warned Belgium against the perils of complacency as they prepare to face Japan here Monday with one eye on a possible quarter-final showdown with Brazil.
The Belgians have emerged as dark horses at this World Cup, with their Golden Generation of players tipped to mount a deep run into the knockout rounds.
Roberto Martinezs side defeated England 1-0 in their last outing to top Group G, earning what on paper should be a straightforward last 16 assignment against Japan.
But Mertens says the Red Devils are wary of a possible repeat of their Euro 2016 quarter-final, when they crashed to a 3-1 defeat to Wales despite being favoured to progress.
I remember the Wales game, Mertens said. Everyone thought we were going to go through, no problem. And then suddenly, were out of the tournament.
Were not going to under-estimate Japan because they have a strong team. If they have got this far, it means theyre a good side.
After making nine changes for last Thursdays win over England, Martinez is expected to revert to the line-up which impressed in one-sided wins over Panama and Tunisia.
With nine goals so far in Russia, Belgium are the World Cups top-scoring team.
Striker Romelu Lukaku has claimed four with two against both Tunisia and Panama in the group stages.
The Manchester United star is set to face Japan after missing the win over England with an ankle knock.
Martinez has all his players fit as Belgium hope to improve their best performance at a World Cup finals, 32 years after reaching the semi-finals of Mexico 1986.
Barcelona defender Thomas Vermaelen, 32, who played for 76 minutes against England, has proven he is over the thigh injury he suffered last month.
Manchester City centre-back Vincent Kompany, also 32, who replaced Vermaelen late on against the Three Lions, could force his way into the starting side after shaking off a groin injury.
Japan meanwhile will be aiming to make history by reaching the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time.  AFP

Celebrating National Selfie Day
June 21st was National Selfies Day - a day celebrated since 2014. Selfies have become so popular that more and more inventions have been created to enhance the ability to take them, and more locations are being scouted by people looking for great places to take selfies.
There are few opinions about the origin of Selfie Day. According to Days of The Year in 2014, BBC officially declared June 21 a Selfie Day as part of their Who do we think we are project. According to Holiday Calendar, it was started by DJ Rick McNeely from Fishbowl Radio Network in Arlington TX on June 21st 2014 as a way to get people to enjoy taking selfies of themselves and to do it in a creative way.
Its also somewhat amusing to learn that the term selfie was reportedly coined by a drunk Australian on Flickr in 2004, a year after people starting taking pictures of themselves with their cell phone cameras and posting them on MySpace.
Youve probably noticed that were right in the midst of the selfie movement. The selfie movement is a strange cultural phenomenon that involves holding your camera-equipped mobile device out in front of your face and snapping a photo of yourself so that it can be shared on social media.
People take selfies very seriously these days. But how do you take a good selfie the first time without wasting time trying to get one youre finally happy with to post on Facebook or Instagram
The answer to that doesnt necessarily mean more makeup, bigger hair, or an entirely new face. Anyone can look great in a selfie, regardless of how they look in real life.
It might take some practice, but if you spend enough time looking at yourself on your camera screen and snapping photo after photo, you should learn how to take good selfies in no time. After all, selfie-taking isnt rocket science.

Chamara : Life snatched away too soon
Chamara Lakshan Kumara the Editor-in-Chief of the Silumina and Resa passed away on Saturday night after a brief illness. Chamara was 39 at the time of his death. He leaves behind his wife and four-year-old son.
Chamara who was a student of C. W. W. Kannangara Vidyalaya, Matugama later joined the Colombo University to read for his basic degree and later for his Masters in Political Science.
Chamaras advent to the media field begins with the Lakbima newspaper and thereafter he joined the Rivira newspaper which was published at the time by Richard Pieris and Co. Ltd.
He proved his mettle as a versatile feature writer in a short span of time and excelled in the field of journalism as an outstanding and extraordinary writer. His acumen and insight into politics was unparalleled, and his affinity with the pen and knowledge of historical facts be it politics or otherwise was amazing, so that he was offered many positions in many newspapers and news agencies in the country.
In 2015, he had a new opening when he was invited to join Sri Lankas foremost Newspaper Institution, the Associated Newspapers (Ceylon) Ltd. popularly known as the Lake House. He joined as the Associate Editor of the Dinamina which was hitherto known as the leader in the vernacular media since the days of late Mr. D.R. Wijewardene. After a short spell he joined the Silumina, the Sunday Sinhala newspaper creating new vistas for the Sinhala reader at a time a multitude of other national newspapers were competing to become the leader. This prompted the management to offer him a new assignment.
When the Associated Newspapers launched a new daily publication Resa he was made the founder Editor of the Resa which became popular among the readers in a short period of time.
Chamara, the versatile writer had a meteoric rise thereafter when the Associated Newspapers Ceylon Ltd. (ANCL) management offered him to be the Editor in Chief of the ANCL flagship newspaper Silumina.
It was hardly four weeks that he was appointed as the Editor-in-Chief, when he made a revolutionary change in the newspaper making it a newspaper with all the necessary ingredients to keep the reader spellbound.
His sudden demise created a void which is difficult to fill. Chamara was unique in every sense and he moved with everybody with a sense of humility. This unassuming personality is of a rare breed and we at the ANCL lost a friend with a smile while the country lost yet another outstanding journalist who could have turned things around for the better.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Chamara always promoted objective journalism - President
President Maithripala Sirisena issuing a condolence message on the death of Chamara Lakshan Kumara, Editor in Chief of the Silumina and Resa newspapers stressed that he is deeply saddened to hear of the demise of the Editor.
The achievements by Chamara Lakshan who was engaged in a highly responsible career which also played an important role in social progress has come in for high praise and recognition from his colleagues in the same field.
Chamara Lakshan who continuously enhanced his skills working at the Lakbima, Rivira and Irudina newspapers became the founding editor of the newly introduced Resa newspaper which brought a new dimension to the Sri Lankan media.
In a short period he etched his name in the annals of the countrys print media becoming the youngest editor of Silumina, a newspaper with an illustrious history.
These achievements were possible because Chamara Lakshan always promoted objective journalism, the Presidents message said.
He practiced his journalism while respecting truth and justice which are the qualities a learned society expects from a journalist and was never subjugated by political power or inducements.
The untimely demise of Chamara Lakshan, a journalist who always worked while respecting his social responsibility is a loss not only for the media fraternity in the country but for all people who believe in a just society.
I extend my heartfelt condolences to Chamara Lakshan Kumaras wife Dinupa Dilhani, his son, parents and other bereaved family members.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

He achieved a heap of victories within a short span - PM
It is justifiable to describe Chamara Lakshan as a youthful media personality who achieved a heap of victories within a short time by working in the Sri Lankan media sector with a new vision and great energy, states Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a condolence message issued on the death of the Editor-in-Chief of the Silumina and Resa newspapers Chamara Lakshan.
The message added that Chamara Lakshan who earlier worked in the Lakbima and Rivira newspapers later worked with great dedication to end a period of terror and misrule and bring the present government into power.
We are aware that Chamara who became a Senior Associate Editor of the Dinamina newspaper under the new government took great effort to add new energy towards the Lake House path.
The Resa newspaper launched under his Editorship won reader acclaim within a short time and the Resa proved that Chamara Lakshan was an efficient media person who reconciled roles, both as a journalist and an administrator. Chamara who was the youngest person to become Chief Editor of Silumina, a post adorned by some of the greats in Sri Lankas media history took great pains to link the paper with the modern world while safeguarding its proud history.
The untimely demise of this young media person who could have been a crest gem for the media world is a great loss to Lake House, our government as well as the entire nation.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while expressing his condolences to Chamara Lakshans family, relatives and friends wished him the Eternal Bliss of Nibbana.

Journalists have lost their standard bearer - ANCL Chairman
Few skills are scarcer in our society than the ability to focus an empathetic eye through the lens of history, to distil complex and divisive issues into striking, pithy words on a sheet of newsprint. Today, with the devastating loss of Chamara Lakshan Kumara, journalists across Sri Lanka have lost our standard bearer, our diamond in the rough.
When I first met Chamara, he was in his early twenties, he was a budding writer at Lakbima, who struck me immediately with his eloquence, maturity, and clarity of purpose, all virtues that most of us find ourselves wanting, even well into our thirties. I knew then, I knew in my bones, that Chamara would go far. The man was somehow blessed with not only the wisdom and kindness of our forefathers, indeed also with the energy and tenacity of our youth.
In the fifteen tumultuous years for which I had the honour of being a friend to Chamara, his loyalty, steadiness and judgment were constants that held me together through many a storm. In that time, I had the privilege of being by his side as he grew from being an exceptionally talented writer into one of the finest  and indeed the youngest ever  newspaper editors in the history of Lake House.
In my last year at Lake House, working side-by-side with Chamara every single day, he held himself up as an example to all of us, as a dependable operator and inspiring manager.
Even as his skyrocketing career was buffeted by the envy of those he left in his wake, he never took notice of or retaliated to the slights and barbs that came his way. Chamara was above the petty. He had a vision, and focused on seeing it through, while letting negativity around him dissolve like dust in the summer rain.
Indeed, at just 39 years old, editing two of Sri Lankas leading Sinhala newspapers, it boggles my mind and wrenches my heart to imagine how much more Chamara could have accomplished if he had another 50 years.
He rose to greater heights in those 39 years than almost anyone in his profession has accomplished in a whole lifetime. Our sincerest thoughts and most heartfelt prayers are reserved for Chamaras parents, sister, wife and his precious son. I wish them the courage to surmount their unspeakable loss.
Chamara, once, on Facebook you wrote that A man can be destroyed, but not defeated.
Courage is grace under pressure, you said. I hope you were right, my friend. Having to go on without you by our side, we will need all the courage we can muster.
- ANCL Chairman and Managing Director Krishantha Prasad Cooray

WHO IS TO BE BLAMED FOR THE PRESENT POLITICAL MESS
Has anyone thought seriously of the present political mess in this country and who is responsible.
He is none other than the former Chief Justice Sarath N Silva. His wrong judgement, which he admitted later, on temporary misappropriation of government funds allocated for Helping Hambantota being transferred to the private account of Mahinda Rajapaksa and later reimbursed.
Had the correct judgement being delivered, would this present situation of corruption and mismanagement take place Would we have had a better person to govern this country This is a random thought.

Cyaniq Bridge Tournament in Colombo
Cyaniq Global is partnering Vajira Bridge Center in hosting the inaugural Cyaniq Bridge Championship at Galle Face Hotel on July 8. The event partnership aligns with the companys commitment towards the development of intellectual capital and business level synergies between top-tier corporate entities and executives.
Vajira Bridge Centre is a friendly Bridge Club with a patronage of over 100 members who meet for Duplicate Bridge thrice a week at the Founders residence on Vajira Road, Colombo 05. At present, Vajira Bridge Center boasts a veritable list of VIP players, including: Ronnie Peiris, Shireen Canekeratne, Koluu Ranawake, Malini Wijeratne, Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane, MP Wasantha Senanayake and Dilanjan De Zoysa to name a few. The club which was founded by former national Bridge player Rex Perera is in its sixth year of play and regularly participates in national and international level competitions throughout the year.
Founder of Vajira Bridge Center, Rex Perera, stated, I am honored that the Vajira Bridge Centre, which started out of sheer passion and enthusiasm, has led entities like Cyaniq and Galle Face Hotel to notice the value it offers, and to help create much-needed awareness for a valuable game like bridge, which is widely played on a global level.
Contract bridge, or simply bridge, is a trick-taking card game using a standard 52-card deck. It is played by four players in two competing partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other around a table. Millions of people play bridge worldwide in clubs, tournaments, online and with friends at home, making it one of the worlds most popular card games, particularly among seniors. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and Martina Navratilova are a few prominent international figures that are fans of the game, while Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, and Winston Churchill were avid players of yesteryear too. Besides offering cognitive stimulation, playing bridge significantly lowers the risk of developing Alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia as per a study conducted by the College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.
The World Bridge Federation (WBF) is the governing body for international competitive bridge, with numerous other bodies governing bridge at the regional level. The inaugural Bridge Championship at Galle Face Hotel, which is a whole-day tournament, will feature top-level 48 national players, some of who have represented Sri Lanka in international championships, such as Commonwealth Nations Bridge Championships and Asia Cup Bridge Championships.
Chief Executive of Cyaniq, Rohitha Perera, said, As a company that has vested interest in all things that are intellectually stimulating and analytical, Cyaniq is proud to be part of this exciting inaugural Cyaniq bridge tournament, which serves to create awareness of the game of bridge, add intellectual value to society, and garner interest in the game from the next generation.
In its inaugural chapter, the Cyaniq Bridge Tournament will be contested for the Rex Perera Challenge Trophy and the participation of 48 players are expected at the event. The corporate patronage of Cyaniq Global has been rallied for the event and will be instrumental in the successful execution of the events proceedings.
Associate Director of Public Relations of the Galle Face Hotel, Shalini Perera, stated, It is an absolute pleasure that an opportunity like this has arisen where Galle Face Hotel can contribute in terms of intellectual association. Loved for its history and superlative levels of hospitality, I along with the management of Galle Face Hotel are thrilled to be hosting an event that is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka.
The winning pair who will get to carry home the Rex Perera Challenge Trophy will also receive gifts from Parker, Mlesna and Galle Face Hotel. The event is intended to be worked out annually for the Rex Perera Challenge Trophy and hopes to develop the standard of play within the country while also contributing to the participation levels of the game.

Defensive solidity as important to Brazil as Neymar, Coutinho
SOCHI, Russia, Saturday: Neymar may well be the centre of attention as Brazil chase a record sixth World Cup triumph in Russia.
But if the South Americans successfully emulate the class of 1958 by winning a World Cup on European soil, there is a strong likelihood that their rock-solid defence will have something to do with it.
In any World Cup, it is the exploits of the goal-scorers who provide most of the memories for the highlights reels.
But it is a fact that the trophy is usually won by the team with the best defence.
Germany conceded just four in seven games in 2014, and Spain let in just two in 2010, the same tally as Italys victorious squad in 2006.
So while Neymar will continue to hog the limelight, the good news for coach Tite is that there is plenty more to his side than the Paris Saint-Germain forward as they prepare to take on Mexico on Monday.
In football there is always one player who gets spoken about more. But you need to have a very good team, said Casemiro, the formidable Real Madrid defensive midfielder, this week.
It is inevitable that people will say the player we have who is above average is Neymar, but we cannot forget that we have other great players.
The flamboyance of the Brazil teams which lit up the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, when the likes of Zico and Socrates delighted fans but ultimately failed to deliver, has long since been replaced by pragmatism.
The World Cup-winning Brazil teams of 1994 and 2002 had plenty of attacking talent, but owed their success as much to defensive steel.
In 2002, only England scored against Brazil in the knockout stages, a solid back line providing the foundation for Ronaldo to get the goals that won his country a fifth World Cup.
This Brazil team is constructed on similarly formidable defensive ground, with just eight goals conceded in 28 matches after the 2-0 win over Serbia on Wednesday. We have a very balanced squad, intelligent, and composed when we have to be, said centre-back Thiago Silva, who headed in Brazils second goal against the Serbians.
Neymar, and especially Philippe Coutinho at the moment, provide the spark, but around them there are enough streetwise players to ensure this Brazil should not suffer a collapse even close to the scale of the 7-1 against Germany four years ago.
In defensive positions, it is not just four of us plus one holding midfielder, said Casemiro.
Brazils defensive strength starts from Gabriel (Jesus), then with Neymar and Willian. All 11 players defend and all 11 attack.
The ability of Paulinho, one of the few survivors of the 2014 squad, to power forward from deep and score goals like that against Serbia is perhaps not something one associates with a typical Barcelona and Brazil midfielder.
And behind it all, there is a strength in depth in the goalkeeping department that has not always been a characteristic of Brazil teams. In 2014 a veteran Julio Cesar, then playing for Toronto FC, was the first choice in goal.
This time around the excellent Ederson, a star in Pep Guardiolas Manchester City team, cannot get in the side because of the presence of Alisson Becker.
Guardiola has an ace in his team, but he has Alisson in his way, and at the moment he is the Pele of goalkeepers, said Claudio Taffarel, the custodian in the 1994 World Cup-winning team and now Brazils goalkeeping coach, earlier this year.
It all means that, while other pre-tournament favourites continue to fall by the wayside, there is reason for Brazil to dream of lifting a sixth World Cup even if Neymar doesnt hit the heights.  AFP

Democracy is assured now: Duminda
The government led by President Maithripala Sirisena assured democracy that the Rajapaksa administration denied, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the media at the Anuradhapura District SLFP Office recently. The Minister said journalists had to think twice in the past before they write articles or capture images and those who dared were punished.
The President and the Prime Minister are now criticised but media institutions and journalists are not punished: the Minister said.
The minister said everyone now live without fear. We now have disciplined, law-abiding citizens. Therefore, we do not need a Hitler to rule our country, Minister Dissanayake said.
The Minister said the former government misused power and carried out corrupted deals. The people were deprived of their rights in the past. Now they should reject those who demand Hitler like leadership for the country, the Minister said.
We do not back off seeing Gotabhaya Rajapaksa contesting the next presidential elections. He had excessive powers as the Defence Secretary under the former regime.
He cleaned the Colombo City using civil security guards. We do not exploit tri-forces like they did. Cleaning and dumping garbage will not qualify a person to rule a country. Leadership is more than that, the Minister said.
Electing a leader is not like appointing a secretary or a chairman. The group of 16 is now politically stranded. The integrated opposition has said they do not need them, the Minister said.

Derwent: Fine art brand appoints new distributor in Sri Lanka
Sri Lankan artists aspiring to transcend depth, colour and precision in their work now have the choice of the revered British fine art brand Derwent, with the appointment of Thef:;llstop as the brands new distributor.
Sri Lankas leading distributor of branded stationery and office products, Thef:;llstop has just launched a selection of premium products from the Derwent professional range exclusively at its flagship store at Crescat, offering drawing and colouring pencils that have not only been used in the creation of masterpieces over many years, but have also kept pace with the evolution of technology. Some of these products will be rolled out to select stationery stores throughout 2018.
Inspired by the dynamic landscape of the Borrowdale Valley in England which was the backdrop for artists, writers and poets including Thomas Gray, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Ruskin and Hemmingway, the Derwent professional range in its new distinctive blue branding is aimed at professional and expert leisure artists who require the best quality drawing materials. The comprehensive range includes graphite and colouring pencils, watercolour pencils and pens.
Notable artists who were commissioned for the brands new packaging include Irish artist Claudine OSullivan whose hand drawn illustrations were featured in the professional advertising campaign that won the 2017 World Illustration Award and the Greek visual artist and illustrator Alexis Marcou best known for his work for the Nike, PepsiCo, Hewlett Packard, Cisco, Atomic Skis, BMW, ESPN and Acco brands. OSullivan uses Derwents Coloursoft pencils for her work while Marcou enjoys working with the Derwent Graphic and Precision mechanical pencils.
The Derwent professional products that are available at Thef:;llstop include the innovative Derwent Inktense range and Derwent Watercolour pencils. Both pencils are water soluble but perform differently when dry. Layers created with Derwent Watercolour pencils can be worked by adding water on top to blend and create nuanced light effects.
Inktense pencils, blocks and paint pan sets on the other hand, dry to a vibrant ink-like layer and are permanent; layers added on top do not affect the underlying layers but result in bold and intense paintings. Since the pigment of these Inktense pencils is permanent, they can be used on silk and cotton fabric and even on canvas.
Derwent Coloursoft pencils are particularly suited for bold still-life drawings and contemporary landscapes. Velvety rich in texture, this range of 72 colours, produces a soft texture, brings out the richness of colour, and is perfect for blending.
The Derwent professional ranges come in handcrafted, high quality wooden boxes which make a sumptuous gift for the budding artist.
Committed to meeting the needs of professional artists, the unique pigments used in Derwent products are tested for lightfastness in the Derwent technical laboratory and graded from 1-8 on the Blue Wool Scale. Lightfastness refers to the chemical stability of a pigment under long exposure to UV light. Each pencil is individually graded; paintings created using higher graded pencils are more durable and have a non-fade effect that lasts over 100 years in gallery conditions.
Derwent has a rich heritage dating back to 1832, when the company first started producing high quality drawing materials and writing instruments.
The company produces a range of art materials that spans the first colouring pencil to the highest professional quality products, the majority of which are made in its British manufacturing plant in the Lake District, Cumbria.
The Derwent brand is owned by the ACCO Brands Corporation of USA which has been one of the worlds largest suppliers of business, consumer and academic products for more than a century.

Team had no clue on how to attack France
Diego Maradona slams Argentina
Following the exit of Argentina from the FIFA World Cup 2018, legend Diego Maradona slammed the national team for not being up to the mark against France in the Round of 16 clash on Saturday.
Teenage rising star Kylian Mbappe struck twice as France finally found their attacking edge to beat Lionel Messis Argentina 4-3 and move into the quarter-finals.
(Argentina) didnt know how to attack and what to do when they had the ball, Maradona was quoted as saying by Marca from Telesurs show De la mano del Diez.
France, on the contrary, have variety that seems to me that this Argentina never had, the 1986 World Cup winner added.
Maradona also said Argentina are a completely different team without the presence of Lionel Messi, who failed to make a mark against France. He also insisted that Messi should have played in the role of a false no.9, where he could receive more of the ball which could have made a difference.
Messi was very far from the goal and I said that if he was to be put as [a false] No.9, he would have to come looking for the balls, set up the game and attack the goal, without Messi, Argentina is just another team.
Meanwhile, Jorge Sampaoli was criticised for making an abrupt move to play without strikers against the Les Bleus. Maradona reckoned that the the Argentine players hardly knew about attacking inside the box and pushing forward against the centre-backs.
(I feel) bad that for another World Cup, Argentina couldnt manage to have a consistent team, however, you could already see it from the formation, as (we had already known) since we left Moscow that (Cristian) Pavon, (Lionel) Messi and (Angel) Di Maria were the ones who were going to attack against the French defence. I dont think they know a lot about (attacking) inside the box and pushing forward against the centre-backs.  NDTV

Dragging our kids back from the horrors of Heroin Hell!
Tuesday last, June 26 was the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. This year the organisers observe the theme: Listening to children and youth is the first step to help them grow healthy and safe.
Given the increased incidence of drug abuse in youth and kids, it is important to listen to them first. This initiative aims at increasing support for science-based prevention of drug use and invests more on the well-being of children, youngsters and their families.
During the last two decades or so the Sri Lankan authorities have targeted the drug menace as a major threat to the countrys security. The issue has become the focus of public attention again following some of the biggest heroin detections in recent times by the Military and Police Narcotics Bureau. The International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking is an effort of the United Nations aimed at strengthening action and spreading awareness about drug abuse and illegal drug trade in the world.
It is an expression of determination towards the goal of achieving an international drug-free society, that organizations across the globe support this initiative which aims at increasing awareness about how major a problem drug abuse is. Last years theme was Listen First - Listening to children and youth is the first step to help them grow healthy and safe.
Celebrated each year on June 26th, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime uses the commemorative day to highlight the dangers of drug use and their illegal trade and provides educational material to teachers and public officials all over the world to help spread the message about the extreme cultural and economic harm the trade in drugs is still doing across the globe one hundred years after the war on drugs was initially launched in Shanghai around the start of the 20th Century.
Fairly recent dope hauls at the Katunayake International Airport warrant serious concern especially since Bureau detectives believe that Sri Lanka is fast becoming a preferred transit hub of international drug syndicates, especially cocaine smugglers.
We now hear the distressing news by the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention last week which revealed that 13percent of schoolchildren island-wide, primarily those over 14 years of age, were addicts involved in some form of substance abuse.
Sri Lankan authorities responsible for the control of narcotics are finally admitting, albeit reluctantly, that the country is now a hotspot for trafficking drugs. Over the years, many anti narcotic organisations have identified the country as a transit point for drug trafficking, but the authorities have been reluctant to fully accept the fact.
However, several recent cocaine busts have put things more in perspective, says the National Dangerous Drugs and Devices Control Board (NDDCB)
In addition, complaints about drugs confiscated, as evidence in drug related offences ending up in the drug market again, has raised alarm bells within the authorities. Investigations have finally begun to determine where the loopholes are. Government agencies responsible for the controlling of drug trafficking and usage in the country are also unsure of the procedures followed to destroy court evidence.
While the incinerator which was set up to destroy confiscated drugs as per international standards remained out of order for some time, the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) had simply just flushed the contraband drugs down the toilet.
Anti-drugs sleuths say the unprecedented rise in tourist arrivals had created a huge demand for cocaine, which is a popular opiate in the West. Cocaine is a powerfully addictive stimulant and its powdered hydrochloride salt form can be snorted or dissolved in water and then injected.
Crack is the street name given to the form of cocaine that has been processed to make a rock crystal, which, when heated, produces vapours that are smoked. The term crack refers to the crackling sound produced by the rock as it is heated. The street value of a gram of cocaine, is estimated at around Rs 18,000 in Sri Lanka.
However, the widely used narcotic in Sri Lanka is cannabis followed by heroin. Last year some 29,700 addicts were arrested for using cannabis, 14,787 were arrested for using heroin while only four were caught for using cocaine and seven for hashish, according to PNB statistics. In detections made last year, 23 kilos of heroin, 10 kilos of cocaine, 18 kilos of hashish and 50,000 kilos of cannabis were taken into custody.
Until the mid 1980s, across the rest of the world like a plague. The first detection of heroin Sri Lanka had been spared the horrors of the drug menace when it was sweeping some two decades ago created quite a sensation in a country that had remained clean in contrariety to its regional neighbours. Ever since, the police, Customs and several anti-drugs organisations had been pointing out that traffickers had been getting away with ridiculously light sentences, mostly fines, because of Sri Lankas then outdated drug laws.
The government in 1997 imposed the death penalty for drug traffickers found in possession of 15g of heroin or morphine, 200g of marijuana, or 1000g of opium. Lesser quantities meant prison terms ranging from several months to life imprisonment. None of this appears to have deterred the remunerative trade, which is backed by influential international combines, according to enforcement officials.
That is because the drugs industry for all its myriad risks is simple and highly profitable. Its simplicity makes it easy to organise. Its profitability makes it hard to stop. It has also skilfully responded to changing markets and transport routes.
At every level, its pricing and its structure are shaped by the high level of risk from enforcement and the risk of seizure and jail. The costs of seizure are small compared with the profits.
The countrys war against drugs has two fundamental objectives - to shut down supply and eliminate demand. But that seems a tall order even for the countrys specially trained elite cadres of customs officers, sniffer dogs and anti-narcotics agents. Despite several successful detections at the Colombo Airport, law-enforcement authorities concede that professional traffickers get the better of them most of the time.
The couriers seem to have devised ingenious means to slip through the barriers providing an uninterrupted supply. Sri Lankan officials are concerned that that as long as drugs keep on passing through Sri Lanka, they will continue to be a tantalizing temptation to the countrys youth.
Cracking down on crack would be the only way for the administration to rid itself of crackpot governance and saving our youth from Heroin Hell.

The enduring enigma of Vra Nabokov
The more you leave me out, Vra Nabokov told Brian Boyd while he was researching his two-volume biography of her husband, Vladimir Nabokov, the closer to the truth youll be. Not that biographers could be trusted to follow her dictum: Vra destroyed all her letters to her husband; she blacked out her contributions to joint postcards to Vladimirs mother. In Vra (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov), Stacey Schiff characterizes this destruction a question of merit: His words, even his private ones, had a value for posterity. She felt strongly that hers did not.
But when Schiff describes Vras reaction to Vladimirs 1937 affair with Irina Guadanininot his only infidelity, but the only one that threatened his marriageanother reason surfaces. Until confronted with the fact that her husbands 1937 letters to Irina had survived, Schiff writes, she was ready to deny that any such affair had taken place. Schiff also remarks on Vras contributions to a published collection of Vladmirs correspondence. The four letters Vra asked the volumes editors to use were adoring; they had also been sent while Vladimir was courting Irina. It was, Schiff writes, a bold, unblinking strike on all other versions of their story.
Self-erasure
What other versions of their story Vras missing letters to Vladimir might suggest, we will never know. And yet: Her careful self-erasure creates a kind of black hole, a magnetic absence. Vra may well have been driven to destroy her letters to Vladmir by a desire for privacyof which there is ample evidence: when Vra was pregnant with their son Dmitri, she concealed her condition from many of the couples closest friends through careful dress and posture and silence. But her reserve piques, rather than dissuades, interest. And Vra, intelligent as she was, cannot have been ignorant of this possibility.
Into this absence steps Adrienne Celts Invitation to a Bonfire, a novel that imagines an affair between a young Russian refugee, Zoya Andropova, and a Nabokov-like novelist, Leo (Lev) Orlov; Levs wife is Vera, without the accent. Celt introduces intrigue of a more immediate sorta murder; a second death that occurs under hotly debated circumstancesbut the novels true interest is power; specifically narrative powerone of the few kinds available to women in the first half of the 20th century.
Mutual devotion
In the pantheon of literary marriages, Vra Slonims to Vladimir Nabokov is remarkable for the consistency of its mutual devotion: his to her; her to his work.
The Nabokovs were married for 52 years, and Boyd writes that they seemed like young lovers even in their sixties and seventies. No less astounding is the fact that, until 1968that is, until Vra was 66 years oldVladimir did not employ a regular secretary, leaving to his wife the bulk of the typing: not only his novels (which needed to be copied out in triplicate), but his correspondenceand this is to say nothing of the miles she drove, the contracts she negotiated, the meals she prepared.
In 1946, when Vladimir was suffering the stultifying effects of instructing undergraduates in rudimentary [Russian] grammar at Wellesley, Vra convinced her husband to propose a Russian Literature class he was eager to teach but unenthusiastic about prepping by promising to write the lectures herself.
Two years later, on the morning of the couples move from Massachusetts to Ithaca, New YorkVladimir had accepted a position at CornellVra shuffled her husband off to a friends apartment while she settled things at their own. I will never get this place cleaned out if he stays here, she explained.
Remarkable consistency

Foreign investment in CSE records net inflow of US$ 28.4 mn in April
Sri Lankas external sector strengthened in April 2018 with continuous inflows to the financial account of the balance of payments (BOP) despite the mixed performance demonstrated in the current account.
Higher inflows to the financial account, particularly with the proceeds of the 12th international sovereign bond (ISB) issuance, project loans and FCBU loans and foreign investment in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the government securities market, resulted in gross official reserves reaching the historically highest level of US dollars 9.9 billion as at end April 2018.
In terms of the current account, the trade deficit expanded in April 2018 as import expenditure increased at a higher pace while export earnings remained subdued. However, tourist earnings and workers remittances continued to record a healthy growth during the month.
The deficit in the trade account expanded in April 2018 reversing the deceleration observed in the previous month. This expansion was largely driven by the increase in expenditure on imports while earnings from exports remained stagnant.
In April 2018, merchandise export earnings remained unchanged at US dollars 795 million when compared with April 2017.
In April 2018, expenditure on imports increased to US dollars 1,794 million, registering a double-digit year-on-year growth. This growth was supported by the increase in all main categories. Import expenditure on personal vehicles, categorized under consumer goods, contributed mainly to the overall growth in imports due to the substantial increase in imports of small engine capacity vehicles, hybrids and electric vehicles.
Foreign investments in the CSE, including both secondary and primary market foreign exchange flows, recorded a net inflow of US dollars 28.4 million during the month of April 2018. Consequently, cumulative net inflows to the CSE in the first four months of 2018 amounted to US dollars 47.2 million.
With proceeds of the ISB issuance, the level of gross official reserves of the country increased to US dollars 9.9 billion, equivalent to 5.5 months of imports, at end April 2018. Total foreign assets, including foreign assets of the banking sector, were estimated at US dollars 12.3 billion as at end April 2018, which was sufficient to cover 6.8 months of imports.
Rupee depreciated by 3.7 per cent against the US dollar during the year up to 28 June 2018. The weakening of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar partly reflects a broad-based strengthening of the US dollar globally.

Foreign sell-off continues amid global equity market rout
The Bourse continued to lose ground as the ASPI decreased by 33.52 points (or -0.54%) to close at 6,194.63 points, while the S&P SL20 Index also decreased by 39.12 points (or -1.14%) to close at 3,388.88 points.
JKH was the highest contributor to the weeks turnover value, contributing LKR 0.98Bn or 33.26% of total turnover value.
Commercial Bank followed suit, accounting for 23.59% of turnover (value of LKR 0.69Bn) while Ceylon Cold Stores contributed LKR 0.26Bn to account for 8.97% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 2.94Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 2.97Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.74Bn (24.03% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.59Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.54% W-o-W (or LKR 15.65Bn) to LKR 2,893.76Bn cf. LKR 2,909.41Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 40.54% (or LKR 1.19Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Melstacorp and Softlogic Holdings which accounted for 96.37% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector meanwhile accounted for 38.86% (or LKR 1.14Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Commercial Bank, HNB (Voting & Non-Voting), Bimputh Finance and Sampath Bank which accounted for 83.73% of the sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 13.54% (or LKR 0.40Bn) to the market driven by Ceylon Cold Stores and Lion Brewery which accounted for 83.83% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Diversified sector also dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 32.67% (or 21.05Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 1.19Bn.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector followed suit, adding 32.33% to total turnover volume as 20.83Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR 1.14Bn of total market turnover value. The Hotels & Travels sector meanwhile, contributed 5.85Mn shares (or 9.08%), amounting to LKR 0.02Bn.
Top gainers and losers
E. B. Creasy was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 21.0% W-o-W from LKR1,122.30 to LKR1,357.90. Samson International gained 19.1% W-o-W to close at LKR105.80. Dolphin Hotels (+15.5% W-o-W) and Nation Lanka Finance (+14.3% W-o-W) were also amongst the top gainers.
Adam Investments was the weeks highest price loser; declining 50.0% W-o-W to close at LKR0.10 while SMB Leasing [NV] (-33.3% W-o-W), Printcare (-22.1% W-o-W) and Hunters (-19.4% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net selling position with total net outflow amounting to LKR 0.39Bn relative to last weeks total net outflow of LKR 0.16Bn (144.0% W-o-W).
Total foreign purchases increased by 23.6% W-o-W to LKR 1.76Bn from last weeks value of LKR 1.42Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 2.15Bn relative to LKR 1.59Bn recorded last week (35.81% W-o-W).
In terms of volume Softlogic Holdings & Teejay Lanka led foreign purchases while Melstacorp & Anilana Hotels led foreign sales. In terms of value Softlogic & HNB (NV) led foreign purchases while Ceylon Cold Stores & Melstacorp led foreign sales.
Point of view
Sri Lankan equities tracked the rout in Emerging and Frontier market assets, resulting in the benchmark ASPI posting losses for the 6th consecutive week.
Losses on EM/FM equity markets have heightened over the last three weeks as trade tensions between US and China have intensified, leading to concerns over how a trade war between the worlds two biggest economies could curtail growth at a time when the US Fed is accelerating its rate hikes and oil prices are rising1.
The foreign equity sell-off on domestic equities consequently continued for the 3rd consecutive week, pushing the broad-share Index to its lowest (6194.63 points) since April17 (6,146.69 points).
Tracking the general decline in EM/FM equity markets (which are expected to record its worst quarterly losses since Sep2015), foreign sales from the Colombo Bourse rose 36% this week, pushing the net outflow position on the CSE over the last 3-weeks to Rs.772Mn, and increasing the YTD net foreign outflows from the CSE up to Rs. 1.5Bn (from Rs.757Mn previously).
Local retail, HNI and Institutional buying also remained largely sluggish over the week, with daily turnover levels averaging just Rs.550Mn through most of the week.
A burst of HNI and Institutional buying on Thursday however, helped push daily turnover value to Rs.1.3Bn. Crossings over the week consequently amounted to 61% of total market turnover (up from the YTD average of 42%) with the majority of interest concentrated on blue-chips JKH, HNB and COMB, which cumulatively accounted for ~77% of the weeks total crossings.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue to take cues from global financial market movements & volatility.
June inflation edges up and LKR loses3.7% YTD
Urban inflation levels in Jun18 rose 4.4% Y-o-Y (up from 4.0% Y-o-Y in May18) as notable increases in certain Food & Beverage prices along with the pass-through impact of the fuel-price hikes in May mitigated the impact of base effects2 stemming from last years drought-led inflation pressure.
Sri Lankas external sector performance in April 18 meanwhile improved as continuous inflows to the financial account of the countrys balance-of-payments helped offset weaker trade and service account (ie: current account) performance. Inflows to the financial account stemmed from proceeds of the countrys 12th international sovereign bond (ISB) issue, project and FCBU loans and foreign investment in CSE and G-Sec markets.
However, Sri Lankas trade deficit over April expanded 23% Y-o-Y as import expenditure rose at a faster pace (+12% Y-o-Y) while export earnings remained flat. Despite stronger growth in tourist earnings (13% Y-o-Y) and workers remittances (11% Y-o-Y), the current account deficit widened over the month. Meanwhile, although the countrys gross official reserves reached a historical high of $9.9Bn by end-April and totaled $8.9Bn by end-May, the LKR depreciation against the USD as at Jun18 was 3.7%, reflecting in part the broad-based strengthening of the USD globally.
EM/FM currencies and equites are headed for their worst quarter since Sept15 as i) higher US yields and a stronger USD, ii) greater prospects for more Fed hikes, iii) the weakening narrative of synchronized global growth and, iv) stronger protectionist rhetoric have continued to damage sentiment and risk appetite for EM/FM currencies.

Hong Kong down Cook Islands on road to Rugby World Cup
AVARUA Sunday: Hong Kong won the first leg of their home and away series against the Cook Islands 26-3 in Rarotonga Saturday to move a step closer to a berth in next years World Cup in Japan.
The newly crowned Asia Rugby Championship winners outscored the Cook Islands four tries to nil and led 18-3 at half-time.

Matthew Mullany scored the Cook Islands only points with a penalty early in the game.
While the Asia tournament had sharpened Hong Kong, the Cook Islands were playing their first international in 10 months since they lost to Tahiti in the 2017 Oceania Rugby Cup.
That result was later overturned after Tahiti were found to have fielded ineligible players.
The return leg is in Hong Kong next Saturday with the winner on aggregate joining Canada, a yet-to-be-determined Africa side and the loser of the Samoa-Germany play-off in a repechage tournament to fill the 20th and final spot at the World Cup. -AFP

Junior Cadets achieve greater heights
The National Cadet Corps (NCC) has successfully contributed to mould the resource of well trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities and inculcated virtues to serve the nation with a proud history of 137 years since its inception in 1881.
Being true to its objectives, the NCC has today become an accomplished, resolute and innovative largest youth uniformed leadership development organization in the country.
The NCC, while grooming and shaping senior cadets, expansion occurred last year to train junior cadets after 35 years under the directive of the Prime Minister. The NCC history reveals that the Challenge Trophy that was presented in 1917 by AJR De Soyza an eminent scholar and philanthropist won by Junior Cadet platoon of St. Benedict College for the first time. In 1981 training of Junior Cadetting was stopped and subsequently the Challenge Trophy was awarded to the most outstanding girls platoon of the year to commemorate his name.
The model project was introduced to schools in Monaragala and Trincomalee districts to restart Junior Cadetting, students at the age of 12 - 14 were selected for training under the supervision of a platoon commander. This was a novel experience for the trainers since they had been handling students of grade 9 upwards. However these small guys were very enthusiastic and courageous upon the training and therefore the task became easy for our officers and instructors. Principals and platoon commanders had actively contributed immensely to make the target a great success.
It is the thinking of the Director NCC, Major General AKP Wickramasinge VSV USP that education is the prime discipline of a student since it has increasingly become the foundation for individual prosperity and social mobility and therefore other co-curricular activities come afterwards. With the aim of accomplishing his view training proper resumed in accordance with a specially designed curriculum consisting of physical training, foot drill, map reading, field craft, first aids, ethics and good manners, billet inspections, health and hygiene, motivation, personality development, confidence building and team building, leadership, adventurous journey, drama and prevention of drugs.
Upon successful completion of training they attended Assessment Camps at NCC Training Centre Rantembe to compete for the Junior Cadetting Challenge Trophy. At the end of the year 2017 the NCC was able to conduct 10 Assessment Camps providing exceptional privilege and opportunity to 807 platoons to get this versatile training.
The heightened momentum of the organization has paved the way to register 941 Junior Platoons up to date.
When Cadets attend Annual Assessment Camps at Rantembe they are exposed to immeasurable experience where they develop analytical thinking, deductive abilities also they are motivated and inspired.
Camping of Junior Cadets is limited to only five days at Rantembe. We have observed these young cadets behaviors during training sessions; they adhere to rules and regulations of the establishment. During Physical Training and Foot drill these teenagers engage with utmost satisfaction. Almost all the activities included in practical subjects carry out under the supervision of experienced instructors attached to the NCC from the Tri- Services and the platoon commander who is also a teacher monitors with a great sense of responsibility. They are aware the fact that by grooming these offsprings with utmost dedication whilst maintaining traditions of the NCC, we could expect one day that they will carry out their duties for the best interest of the nation. No ordinary teenager of this age gets an opportunity to instill values like,
****
* Sense of patriotic commitment to encourage cadets to contribute to national development.
* Respect for diversities in religion, language, culture, ethnicity, lifestyle, attitudes and habits to instill sense of national unity and social cohesion.
* Abiding commitment to learn and adhere to the norms and values enshrined in the Sri Lankan constitution.
* Understanding the value of a justice and impartial exercise of authority.
* Ability to participate in community development and other social programmes.
* A healthy lifestyle free of substance, abuse and other unhealthy practices.
* Sensitivity to the needs of poor and socially disadvantaged fellow citizens.
* Including habits of restraint and self - awareness.
* Understanding the value of honesty, truthfulness, self - sacrifice, Perseverance and hard work.
* Respect for knowledge, wisdom and power of ideas.
* To absorb good social ethics and manners.
The NCC has been playing a pivotal role to serve the nation by providing disciplined, energetic youngsters in thousands to the society throughout its illustrious history and many years ahead too.

Kenya stun Zimbabwe with last-gasp 45-36 win
NAIROBI, Kenya, Saturday - Debutant Dalmus Chituyi scored two crucial tries at the death to help Kenya beat Zimbabwe 45-36 in a dramatic Rugby World Cup qualifier in Nairobi on Saturday.
Kenya were staring at defeat after Zimbabwe, who were trailing 33-17 at half-time staged a dramatic comeback to score 19 points in the second half of the game.

Zimbabwe had Fortune Chipendu sin-binned in the 34th minute, but the visitors rallied with a commanding performance in the second half, scoring four tries, a penalty and a conversion as the home-side collapsed under the pressure.
Zimbabwe took advantage of a Kenyan yellow card in the 55th minute as England-based winger Matthew McNab took the opportunity to put his resurgent side into the lead for the first time in the match when he broke through the slack Kenyan defence down the left before making his dive to score their fifth try.
But Chituyi ensured Kenyas victory with the two late tries to keep the Simbas in contention for a place in next years Rugby World Cup in Japan. Kenya bagged four more points to remain in second position with eight, seven less than leaders Namibia, who overwhelmed Morocco 63-7 in Casablanca.
Although we lost three tries, it was a good performance in the end, said Kenya assistant coach Murray Roulston.
We have had a short time to train for the tournament but the boys have the potential to do better.
Zimbabwes South African-born coach Peter de Villiers was gracious in the defeat.
Kenya were more clinical than us.We allowed a few softeners in the first half and Kenya took their chances than us, and all credit to them.
Kenya will host Uganda in their match of the competition on July 7, while third-placed Zimbabwe, which last qualified for the World Cup in 1991 will entertain Tunisia away.  AFP

Mahindra set to dominate EV landscape
The fast evolving EV landscape is witnessing new breakthroughs, new products, new techs being tested and deployed at a rapid pace. These are the best times for innovators to thrive and survive. Entry Barriers were never this low and porous.
Till a Few Years back, Mahindra was just a tractor and MUV maker in India. The Average American would have still lived with the same perception, if Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA ) had not come up last November. MANA is the first investment in an automotive manufacturing plant in Detroit in the last quarter century. Its akin Silicon Valley not getting a single new Tech Lab or Dev Center for that long!
Last month, the world woke up to a press release from Rome, Italy. It declared Mahindras entry into the exciting and niche space of Electric Hypercars. The new identity for the electric Hypercars being Automobili Pininfarina.
In 2015, Mahindra acquired the legendary 88 Year old Italian Design house Pininfarina. It surely was the wake up call for the west, as a supposed tractor & MUV making company bought the house which designs Ferraris, Maseratis & Alfa Romeos.
Coming back to Mahindras Electric Hypercars, these Bugatti Chiron Challengers shall have the badging of Pininfarina, the unfulfilled wish of the Pininfarina patriarch and founder Battista Pinin Farina.
This development is anything but sudden. Its an exceptional master plan being executed with craft, experience and acumen. It has the speed of a garage startup and the business prowess of an established Business Tycoon.
In April this year Mahindra & Mahindra entered into a joint venture with Ideal Motors Ltd., a fully owned subsidiary of the Ideal Group, to assembly automotive vehicles in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka is one of Mahindras top three export markets and the new facility will not only contribute to human capital development, but will also enable collective development of local automotive components manufacturers to international standards under the global expertise of Mahindra. This is a leap forward for the Industry, adding value to the meaning of Made in Sri Lanka and opening broader opportunities for national growth, said Founder chairman of Ideal Motors, Nalin Welgama.

Messi, Ronaldo World Cup exits signal changing of the guard
MOSCOW, Russia, Saturday: Step aside Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo... there is a new group of kids on the block ready to seize the limelight and form the next generation of global megastars.
French teenager Kylian Mbappe announced himself in dramatic fashion on Saturday, overshadowing Messi as France beat Argentina 4-3 in the World Cup last 16.
That took his goal tally for the tournament to three -- two behind England talisman Harry Kane and one behind Belgiums Romelu Lukaku.
Messi and Ronaldo, captain of the Portugal side beaten 2-1 by Uruguay, also on Saturday, had been on a quarter-final collision course but the closest they will now come to each other in Russia is the airport departure lounge.
While they have set goal records tumbling both in Europe and Spain year after year, amazingly neither has ever been able to find the net in a World Cup knockout match in a combined 14 games.
For all Messis brilliance at club level with Barcelona, it appears the 2014 final defeat to Germany is the closest he will ever come to winning the World Cup.
Real Madrid forward Ronaldo, a European champion with Portugal two years ago, will be 37 by the time the next global showpiece rolls around -- meaning it is unlikely he will improve on a run to the semi-finals in 2006.
MBAPPE LEADS THE CHARGE
With the exits of the pair, both five-time world players of the year, confirmed on the same day, the stage is clear for a handful of young, hungry pretenders to seize the spotlight.
Leading the charge is the 19-year-old Mbappe, who achieved a feat no player had accomplished in 60 years, becoming the first teenager to score twice in a World Cup match since a 17-year-old Pele in 1958.
Im very happy, and its flattering to be compared to a great player like Pele, said Mbappe, born a few months after France won the 1998 World Cup.
But hes in another category. Still, its great to join the list of players that have achieved such feats.
The Paris Saint-Germain striker, who as a child had posters of Ronaldo plastered across his bedroom wall, has three goals in three starts in Russia.
He finds himself trailing England striker Kane in the race for the Golden Boot, but his terrorising of the Argentina defence underlined his growing menace. Hes not so much as arriving as arrived.
After four straight seasons with 20 or more goals in the Premier League, Kane is now demonstrating his ability on the biggest stage of all, leading Englands attack and captaining the side.  AFP

SAINT-PTERSBOURG, Russia, Saturday - Mexico do not have history on their side in their bid to dump Brazil out of the World Cup but the 2018 version of El Tri have already demonstrated a capability to surprise in Russia.
For a seventh straight World Cup Mexico have made it to the last 16, but, agonisingly, they have failed to go any further on the six previous occasions, turning the desire just to make the quinto partido (fifth match) an obsession.
Theres no greater memory than making history with a fifth match, said Mexico captain Andres Guardado. Were different players in terms of the mental aspect, but we know well be judged by whether we get through or not.
What greater motivation could you need when we face off against the five-time champions Its the perfect scene. Its the biggest game of our lives.
Mexicos last-16 misfortunes have often come down to the finest of margins. Defeat on penalties to surprise package Bulgaria in 1994 started an inauspicious run. They blew a lead against Germany four years later and against Argentina in 2006.  AFP

Miniature Pug
As you can see, tiny Otis-Woodys head is about the size of a tennis ball. This sweet little guy is four months old and only four inches tall.
The Cleethorpes-based pup may just be the smallest pug in the country  weighing in at just a couple of pounds  and may just pick up the title in the Guinness World Record books.
His owner Rachel East thinks he could be in with a shot, and that he may actually be the smallest example of the breed worldwide.
Otis has five sisters who are more than three times his size, but due to the fact he was the runt of the litter, he never quite caught up growing. Rachel calls the happy boy her cheeky little monkey because he is so energetic and a little bit mischievous. Apparently, he loves to chew on everything from tennis balls to feet and socks.
Whenever Rachel walks Otis, she ends up getting accosted by tons of people who (understandably) want cuddles and pictures.
She said, Every time I take him for a walk with his little kitten lead people are constantly stopping me and telling me how adorable he is and that he is so cute, and all I am really able to tell them is that I know, he is just wonderful. He is brilliant with my children Sienna and Brinley who just adore him. The only problem is that we have to be so careful whenever we walk around the house because he is so tiny we are worried that we might stand on him as he darts about between our feet.
Rachel will likely need to wait until Otis-Woody is fully grown before they enter him into the record books, but he doesnt seem to be showing any signs of a growth spurt just yet.Metro

Nine Computer Crimes Investigation Units to be set up
Plans are underway to establish nine Computer Crimes Investigation Units under the purview of Criminal Investigation Department at provincial level starting from this year, CID sources yesterday said.
The first of the nine provincial investigation units will be declared open next Wednesday in Kandy under the patronage of IGP Pujith Jayasundara, the source also said.
The Kandy Computer Crime Investigation Unit is to address and facilitate police investigations on all cyber related crimes in the Central Province.
The next Provincial Computer Crimes Investigation Unit will be established in Matara within this year to oversee the Southern Province, the source also said.
The units will be under the direct supervision of the Cyber Crime Division, CID. Five CID officers will be deployed to every provincial unit, the source explained.
The CID source also said that a website against computer crimes will be launched simultaneously to the opening of the computer Crimes Investigation Unit.
Approximately, 25 complaints on cyber-crime are lodged daily at the Cyber-Crime Division of the CID, the source also said.
The new establishments are expected to increase the efficiency of investigations carried on these complaints, the source pointed out.
When someone makes a complaint of a cyber-crime to a police station, the station can either forward it to the new Computer Crimes Unit or seek its assistance. If someone directly makes a complaint to CID head office via email, they can forward it to the Provincial Unit, the source also said.
Meanwhile, the Head of the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team Coordination Center Roshan Chandraguptha said that 1,250 cyber incidents have been reported to CERT CC as at end of June 2018.
Around 80% of these incidents have been social media related ones, CERT CC Head Chandraguptha said.
Many among these incidents were the cases of someone making a fake Face Book profile using another persons details and photographs. CERT CC provides technical facilitation to issues as these. There were numerous incidents where shared passwords between partners of their Facebook accounts being misused by one of the parties, he explained.
According to the CERT CC Head, there have been close to 10 cases relating to financial fraud via cyber space and about 12 internet scams on bank accounts.
Then there are complaints on scams done on people who have established long distance relationships with via Facebook accounts. Usually what happens is, one person who claims to be living or working abroad establishes a cyber-relationship with the victim.
Then the pretender claims to be sending a gift package to the victim that contains valuables.
Then someone pretending to be an agent of a local delivery company calls the victim to say that an additional payment should be done, lest the package be released. Ten such scams have been reported during the first six months of 2018, he pointed out.

North Korea concealing nuclear production
US: North Korea intends to maintain some of its nuclear stockpile and production facilities while potentially concealing them from the United States, The Washington Post reported Saturday, citing US officials.
The assessment comes on the heels of a landmark meeting between the Norths leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump, who has since the June 12 summit in Singapore buoyantly declared there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.
Evidence collected since the pairs historic meeting points to secret production facilities and the development of methods to conceal weapons creation -- implying Pyongyang is aiming to hide plans to continue its nuclear program from the US, having made contrary, if ambiguous, commitments to Washington.
Over the weekend NBC News first reported that Pyongyang has in fact recently been increasing fuel production for nuclear weapons at several hidden sites.
The US network, citing intelligence officials, said North Koreas regime was readying to extract every concession from the White House rather than giving up its atomic arsenal.
Theres no evidence that they are decreasing stockpiles, or that they have stopped their production, NBC quoted one US official as saying.
There is absolutely unequivocal evidence that they are trying to deceive the US, the official said, despite Pyongyangs recent curtailment of missile and nuclear tests.
The only uranium enrichment spot North Korea has acknowledged publicly exists is Yongbyon -- though reports of secret facilities have surfaced.
Experts have voiced fear that Washington may accept a lukewarm deal centered exclusively on Yongbyon that disregards known underground sites.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he plans to meet with Kim to flesh out details of the nuclear disarmament promise, but has insisted the North Korean leader is serious.
Theres a lot of work between here and there. My team is already doing it. Ill likely travel back before too terribly long, the top US diplomat said recently. We still need to flesh out all the things that underlay the commitments that were made that day in Singapore.
US Defence Secretary James Mattis meanwhile has reassured key East Asian allies that the US commitment to Seoul is ironclad -- despite Trumps unilateral suspension of military exercises with South Korea and his lauding of Kim as a talented guy. - AFP

NYT article is full of political prejudice: China
China responding to the New York Times article published on June 25 on the Hambantota Port said the article and the clarifications and responses by various parties from Sri Lanka are full of political prejudice and completely inconsistent with the fact.
A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Colombo in a statement said the Embassy stress that China has always been pursuing a friendly policy toward Sri Lanka, firmly supporting the latters independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and opposing any countrys interference in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
It is encouraging that all sectors of the Sri Lankan society highly appreciate Chinas tremendous support and selfless assistance for ending the civil war and post-war reconstruction in the Island nation.
The statement went on to say that despite any interference from a third party, China would like to work together with Sri Lanka to actively implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and concentrate unwaveringly on fixed goals, continuously promote the pragmatic cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiatives following the golden rule of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, to better benefit the two countries and their people.

OBrien brothers team up to deny their father Irish Derby
THE CURRAGH, Ireland, Saturday: Joseph OBrien denied his father Aidan a major victory, just as he did in last years Melbourne Cup, as Latrobe took the honours in the Irish Derby at The Curragh on Saturday.
The 25-year-old trainer -- who rode Camelot to Epsom Derby success in 2012 and also in the Irish Derby for his father but had to give up riding due to weight problems -- along with brother Donnacha on board 14/1 shot Latrobe beat home two of OBrien seniors runners long time leader Rostropovich and the even money favourite Saxon Warrior.
Its pretty incredible and its not really sinking in yet. Its a special moment, said Donnacha OBrien, who earlier this season rode Saxon Warrior to success in the English 2000 Guineas.
Weve always thought he was a really good horse and hes never run a bad race, but we just thought a few times that hed run better.
Hes shown today that hes very good, whose ride earned the Australian owner Lloyd Williams the princely sum of 855,000 euros ($1million).
For Saxon Warrior it was a second costly defeat after finishing fourth in the Epsom Derby earlier this month when also a hot favourite but despite looming large in the finishing straight he could not find anything extra under Ryan Moore and finished half a length and a neck off the first two.
Aidan OBrien accepted defeat with a rare quip.
I stopped giving them pocket money a while ago, said the 48-year-old.
Latrobe bore the same colours -- those of Australian Lloyd Williams -- the Joseph OBrien trained Rekindling donned to win the race that stops a nation last year with his fathers Johannes Vermeer second in Melbourne.
The Epsom Derby form took a hit too not only with Saxon Warriors disappointing performance but the runner-up Dee Ex Bee finished seventh of the 12 runners at The Curragh.  AFP

Over 800,000 low income families to get Samurdhi relief: Harrison
The government will grant Samurdhi relief to 800,000 families within the next 18 months. Initially, 200,000 families will be provided Samurdhi dividends, Social Empowerment Minister P. Harison said.
The Minister was participating in a official tour in Anuradhapura, Medawachchiya and Ikirigollewa to look into the problems that Samurdhi recipients are undergoing recently.
He said the Divisional Secretaries, Samurdhi Development Officers and Grama Niladharis are made aware of the revised samurdhi vision mission and of the strategies to implement the project more efficiently and successfully. The basic requirement of Samurdhi recipients will be their monthly income - Rs. 6,000 or less.
Average national poverty level was 6.7 oer cebt in 2012 and it decreased to 4.1 per cent now as per the survey and progress review reports. The Samurdhi Banks maintain assets worth Rs. 144 billion at present. The investment exceeds Rs. 100 billion. Under the revised Samurdhi programme, steps are taken to save the low income group, especially rural women from micro business racket and companies, the Minister said.
The Minister said the Samurdhi Bank is a tiny banking institute sans modern facilities.
It serves only to the low income families. We will increase the loan limit from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 2.5 million provided for the bank customers. Issues of Samurdhi Managers and Development Officers will be addressed very soon, the Minister said. The Minister said the Samurdhi banks are poorly maintained. Samurdhi means prosperity. Samurdhi recipients and the Samurdhi banks must prosper and achieve their goals, Minister Harrison said.
The Minister said the beneficiary families must be empowered socially and monetarily. A drugs and alcohol prevention programme is going on now under Samurdhi Beneficiary Programme. A counseling programme was launched to address alcoholism among rural people, the Minister said.

Pink flamingo record
Parks officials in Buffalo, New York, are tickled pink over claiming a new world record for having the longest line of garden flamingos .
A Guinness World Records official was on hand Thursday to certify the record - 1,500 pink flamingos  which were set up to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Buffalos Olmsted Parks system.
Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted designed Buffalos citywide system of parks and parkways. Parks officials took some liberties with his initials - F L O - to come up with the FLO-mingo event.
The previous record for the pink, plastic lawn ornaments was held by Pledge the Pink of Callawassie Island, South Carolina, which lined up 1,058 flamingos in 2016.
Buffalo residents were invited to adopt the lawn ornaments and display them at home. AP

The Prime Minister stated At this conference that he negotiated with Prime Minister Li and President Xi of China and came up with a proposal beneficial for both parties. Sri Lanka also informed the China that Hambantota cannot be used for military purposes. The Sri Lanka Navy is moving its Southern Command to Hambantota. There is no need to be frightened as security of the port will be under the control of the Sri Lanka Navy. Once an American has asked him, What would you do if the Chinese troops land in Hambantota The Prime Minister has responded saying that there is a full army division stationed at Hambantota. The Prime Minister never mentioned that we will not be resisting any invasion. Further, no Navy in the region has the capacity to land an army division in Sri Lanka.
As far as the Hambantota Port is concerned, it will only be a commercial port which will trigger off much needed economic development of backward districts of Hambantota and Moneragala very soon, the statement said..

PM pledges development revolution
The government will spend between Rs. 160 billion to Rs. 200 billion within the current and next year to bring about a development revolution in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickemesinghe said at Kelebokka, Panwila yesterday.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Kelebokka state plantation playground to mark the distribution of 500 plots of land in extent of seven perches blocks among plantation workers.
The distribution was made under the Haritha Bhoomi programme of the state enterprise and the Kandy Development Ministry aimed to provide plantation workers with land ownership.
The Prime Minister said that these monies will be allocated through three major accelerated development projects, namely, Enterprise Sri Lanka, the Gamperaliya and Grama shakthi and through decentralised budgeting with the aim to develop villages.
During the past few years, we developed the country in a systematic manner. We worked in accordance with a plan. We did not lie to the people. There was criticism as well. But, the people can see and feel their results now, he added.
The Premier said if the country goes forward in this manner for another 3-4 years the government will be able to provide unprecedented relief and benefits to the public.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe observed that the Good Governance government reduced the prices of food, fuel and other essential commodities and increased salaries at the same time.
He said the government during the past three years had also taken the country out of the debt trap.
The Premier recalled that when the present government took over in 2015, the country had massive debts, the high Cost of Living, rising unemployment among other issues.
When the economy develops, employment increases, income increases, houses increase and the education improves, he said adding that it is the society the government wants to create and the results can be seen now.
Wickremesinghe said the granting of land ownership to landless people was a policy adopted by the UNP since the D.S.Senanayake era.
He said all landless estate sector workers will be given land ownership by this government.
After the event in Panwila the Premier also distributed plots of land in extent of seven perches blocks among plantation workers in Hantana, Kandy.

Poor eye sight in old age drives cognitive decline
Poor eye sight in old age drives cognitive decline in older people, new research suggests. Both vision and mental sharpness decrease with age, which can cause a loss of independence and a reduced quality of life in sufferers, a US study has found.
Researchers believe poor vision reduces peoples abilities to participate in activities, leading to reduced brain stimulation. Another theory is cognitive decline and vision loss may both be caused by inflammation or deterioration of the central nervous system.
Cognitive impairment without dementia affects around 5.4 million adults in their 70s in the US, while more than 2.9 million suffer reduced vision. The researchers, from the University of Miami, analysed 2,520 people aged between 65 and 84 from Salisbury, Maryland.
The participants were followed for eight years. More than half of them died during the studys duration. Their eye sight and mental state was assessed four times, on average every two years, during the investigation.
Mental state was determined by their ability to orientate themselves to a time and place, their attention span, language understanding and ability to recall three words. The findings were published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology.
Poor people are 50 per cent more likely to develop dementia. This comes after research released last May suggested poor people are more likely to develop dementia. The 20 per cent most deprived adults in England are 50 per cent more likely to suffer from severe memory loss than the wealthiest 20 per cent, a study found.
Study author Professor Andrew Steptoe, from University College London, said: Our study confirms that the risk of dementia is reduced among well-off older people compared with those who have fewer economic resources. Many factors could be involved. Differences in healthy lifestyle and medical risk factors are relevant. It may also be that better off people have greater social and cultural opportunities that allow them to remain actively engaged with the world.
Study author Dr Dorina Cadar added: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with devastating consequences to individuals, their families and governments around the world. Our efforts are unified in identifying the risk factors associated with a delay in the onset of dementia or a slower progression.

Predicament of the legal profession
There has been a growing concern about the deterioration of the professional standards of the legal community in many countries. This trend is particularly seen in many third world countries including Sri Lanka. Deterioration in the professional standards is often reflected in the quality of legal output and the professional services rendered by the legal community. The decline in competence, efficiency and the standards of the legal profession is bound to bring about the corresponding decline in the standards on the Bench because it is the Bar, which nurtures and fosters those who aspire to a career in the judiciary.
We live in a time when core values of the profession are being threatened. As a result, the whole climate of opinion has become hostile to the legal profession. According to the latest survey conducted by the American Pew Research Centre, public esteem for the legal profession has declined sharply over the last few years. The legal profession has been ranked the lowest among the professions. For the Americans the legal profession is one of the most despised and hated professions. It commands little respect in their estimation.
Although much has been spoken and written on the deteriorating standards nothing substantial seems to have been done to arrest this trend by the authorities charged with the responsibility of regulating the profession in this country. There have been no genuine efforts to address the problems affecting litigants in many ways by the professional misconduct and malpractices indulged in by the few individuals in the profession.
Law and order
There is a multitude of questions connected with the legal profession. One thing is manifestly clear; unless and until serious problems confronting the profession are addressed in a realistic manner we must expect further deterioration of the professional standards and the eventual collapse of law and order in the county. One can see an attitude of complacency and resignation in the face of the declining trend. It is regrettable that there is a surprising and disturbing sense of apathy and inertia on the part of the authorities.
If you walk into some of the courts in the island particularly the Magistrates court you can see for yourself how touts and other intermediaries hang about in the environs of Courts in order to persuade prospective litigants to retain particular Attorneys-at-Law regardless of their abilities and capabilities.
In some courts Attorneys-at-Law themselves stand outside the courthouses with business cards in hand, offering their services to litigants; a disgusting practice which degrades the whole profession. They lack boundaries when stooping to low conduct. People are appalled by the shame and disgrace some lawyers bring to the profession and legal profession has suffered tremendous damage to its image by the conduct of few unscrupulous lawyers.
Then, there are some lawyers who depend entirely on the police for their practice. They resort to what is known as police touting for their survival. They have a secret arrangement with the police whereby police direct the litigants to their favourite lawyers and thereafter they split the fees. For each case, the police officer gets its share of the fees.
There are also instances where defence lawyers have made attempts to win over the witnesses with the cooperation of prosecuting officers with the intention of securing acquittals in cases. Touting has long been an offence under the Intermeddlers with Suitors Act of 1894. But prosecutions under this act have been few and far between. Therefore, it is time that all forms of touting and soliciting eradicated from the legal practice. It is also the responsibility of the Police Department and the Police Commission to take necessary remedial measures in regard to misconduct and malpractices resorted by the police in course of administration of justice.
Lack of civility and professionalism
It is essential that lawyers should be dignified in their speech. Some lawyers address police officers as Machan and the police officers in turn address the lawyers by their first names. Some lady lawyers too address police officers by their first names while the police officers too address them by their first names. People are profoundly concerned with this lack of civility and professionalism demonstrated by the lawyers and other agents involved in the administration of the justice system.
Members of the legal profession occupy a position of privilege because of the high nature of its calling. Not only in Sri Lanka but all over the world there is a high proportion of heads of state, ministers and high officials drawn from the ranks of the legal profession. For centuries lawyers have stood at the centre of the society. There were eminent and patriotic lawyers in the past who fought valiantly for the independence of this country. The legal profession has a rich and glorious past and members of the legal fraternity can justifiably be proud of its past.
Legal career has been a hallmark of prestige. For centuries, the practice of law has been considered a profession. The word profession suggests a certain stature and prestige. The legal profession claims to be an honourable and noble profession. But it should be remembered that the honour and nobility come to a profession by the conduct and the behaviour of its members.
There have been instances when the bar en masse refused to appear for certain litigants: a practice repugnant to the ethical principles of the profession. But it should be remembered professional ethics demand lawyer who practises his profession is duty bound to appear for any litigant who seeks his services regardless of the nature of the case or any opinion, which the lawyer might have formed as to the character, reputation cause conduct of that person. In some instances, lawyers confine their practice to a particular field of law and the lawyers who are engaged in notarial work invariably delegate their notarial tasks to clerks, secretaries and other laypersons. Such delegations would be proper as long as the lawyer maintains a direct relationship with his clients, and supervises the delegated work, and has complete responsibility for the work done. But there have been instances where lawyers have notarized deeds and other conveyancing documents drafted by their clerks and signed in the absence of the attorney in contravention of the Notarys Ordinance. It is illegal for a notary to notarize any previously signed conveyancing documents, and in these cases, the attorney attesting the conveyancing documents had never been present to testify to the identification of parties. This is a practice in conflict with the most fundamental requirements of the office of a lawyer doing notarial work.
Defalcates funds
A client visits a lawyer who is engaged in notarial work when there is an issue that needs addressing in the hope that lawyer would attend to his needs with fidelity. But his failure to perform his duties as a notary would result in not only immense damage to those directly affected by the impugned document but also undermine the integrity of the notary. Therefore, it is the duty of every lawyer who acts as a notary discharge his functions faithfully to the satisfaction of his client.
Although defalcation and embezzlement of money by lawyers acting in a fiduciary capacity is not a frequent phenomenon we cannot say it is rare. Because there have been instances in which some lawyers were embroiled in financial scandals and other fraudulent transactions. Public look to the profession to keep its house in order. When a lawyer defalcates funds belonging to clients the whole profession is blackened in the public eye.
Generally, every learned profession demands proper decent attire. Therefore, it is imperative for legal practitioners to dress appropriately in a manner that enhances respect for the legal profession and dignity of the court. It should be realised that the image of an attorney matters a lot and they should not look sloppy in appearance as a sloppy appearance would be likely to affect the perception of the litigants. What the lawyers wear in courts can have a major impact on the perception of litigants and the members of the public. A bad dress will make a bad impression on the clients and the people. There have been instances when courts have come down hard on Attorneys who have failed to dress appropriately. It is true that merits of an argument in a case and a good knowledge of the law are crucial to winning a case but the value of the image of an Attorney should not be underestimated.
The bar must maintain highest standards of integrity, as an honourable bar is a strong support to an honourable bench. Uprightness and integrity is something every client expects from every legal practitioner. Even the conduct unrelated to ones practice which may be demonstrably attributed to lack of integrity tends to lower the esteem in which the whole profession is held.
Over the past few decades, members admitted to the legal profession have increased by leaps and bounds. Along with that increase the profession has become highly competitive and commercialised. In an era of intense competition and commercialization legal practitioners in their race for survival will tend to place the monetary aspect of the profession higher than the core values and aspirations of the profession. It would be of paramount importance to all of us who are interested in the profession to work determinedly keep aloft the high ideals for which the profession has stood for centuries. We must resolutely conduct ourselves to measure up to the standards set and maintained by our predecessors. May the glorious past serve as an example for the members of the profession to tread the correct path. May the members have the wisdom and strength to do so

President wants construction of additional 2,500 km electric fence expedited
President Maithripala Sirisena directed the relevant sectors to expedite construction work of the additional 2,500 kilometre long electrified fence that should be added to the existing fences to ward off elephant attacks against humans, according to a well laid out systematic plan.
President Sirisena gave these instructions at a meeting with the relevant stakeholders at the Presidents Office regarding maintaining elephant fences.
The President emphasized the importance of maintaining the elephant fence properly to prevent human-elephant conflicts.
President Sirisena explained the urgent need to reconstruct the electric fences that are not active and broken. Over 1,800 Civil Defence Committee members are engaged in maintaining the elephant fences and it was pointed out that the amount of workers are not sufficient for the reconstruction of the elephant fences that covers about 4,000 kilometres islandwide.
Thus, the President ordered the officials to take action to fill these vacancies immediately.
President Sirisena who instructed to continuously provide the food allowance given to the Civil Defence Committee members, stressed the importance of conducting training programmes for them.
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka, Secretary to the State Ministry of Defence A.P.G. Kithsiri, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Kapila Waidyaratne, Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijeygunaratne and Security Forces heads were present.

Probe this one too
SLFP rebel MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, it was, who set the ball rolling in exposing the extent of sleaze in Sri Lanka's politics, unwittingly though. He would not have envisioned that, very soon, his guru Mahinda Rajapaksa too would be in the same predicament as he was.
Jayasekara it was, who first revealed that he received a cash cheque for a sum of Rs one million as an election donation. Though he revealed he had no idea who sent the cheque, a B report filed in the Colombo Magistrate's Court, before which the bond issue is being investigated, revealed that the sender was Arjun Aloysius, the owner of Perpetual Treasuries(pvt.) Ltd., the Primary dealer involved in the alleged scam. This was followed by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe too admitting that they received campaign funds from the same source.
Now comes the revelation that Mahinda Rajapaksa too had received an election donation of much larger magnitude, not from a local mudalali or a Primary dealer in Treasury bonds, but from a foreign country. The expose was carried in the prestigious New York Times, which has raised a huge scandal and unraveled the duplicity of Mahinda Rajapaksa who is fond of accusing the UNP of having links with foreign powers to the detriment of the national interest.
The article said it found evidence showing that US $ 7.6 million (around Rs.1.2 billion) had been transferred from the China Harbour Engineering Corporation's account at Standard Chartered Bank to members of Mahinda Rajapaksa's Presidential Election campaign team, days ahead of the poll.
It was only too well known that Rajapaksa, by this time, had placed all his eggs in the Chinese basket and was a great lover of China, a sentiment reciprocated by Asia's economic dragon. All the mega projects in the country was being handed over to the Chinese, among them the Hambantota Port project and the construction of the expressways.
It is in this light that UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna has called for the appointment of a Presidential Commission to probe whether the former President received US $ 7.6 million from CHEC, as per the New York Times article. "We have a suspicion that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa started the Hambantota Harbour project to receive alleged kickbacks he said adding that there was also a suspicion that there could have been an attempt to sell the port on the basis that it is unprofitable. "We are still paying for this debt, he said.
The MP's request is justified in that a Presidential Commission was appointed to probe the bond matter that was said to have caused much damage to the economy. Similarly, the re-payment of the huge debt that the government is saddled with, as a result of the Hambantota Port project, too, is now bleeding the economy and has resulted in a massive financial burden being placed on the people. Besides, it is the former President's constant refrain that the government has ruined the economy. Only a comprehensive probe will reveal to what extent Rajapaksa is responsible. This and other suspicious financial dealings too should be probed. Although, as State Minister Eran Wickramaratne told our weekend paper, the Sunday Observer, that it was fairly well known that China was funding the election campaign of Rajapaksa later there were reports that the FCID was investigating several suspicious transactions running into Rs. 3 billion. Mysteriously, nothing of this investigation or its current status is known today, as pointed out by Wickramaratne.
In the meantime bizarre and fantastic statements are being made by members of the Joint Opposition in denial of the NY Times article. One worthy said that Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, who were the General Secretaries of the UPFA and SLFP, respectively, at the time of the election, are the ones who will know for sure if such a transaction took place, a statement that, no doubt, is an insult to the intelligence of the people. To begin with, the duo, together with the rest of the SLFP rebels, are all but in name, members of the Joint Opposition today and are bound to pooh pooh the article. JO MP Shehan Semasinghe, in trying to refute the New York Times expose, also cast aspersions on the English language knowledge of Sri Lankan politicians when he, responding to Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake's statement that he (Ramanayake), contacted the author of the article and confirmed the facts, rubbished the claim based on the contention that the author did not understand Sinhala. Did the MP seriously think that Ramanayake spoke to the journalist concerned in Sinhala
Be that as it may, the article, if genuine, also compromises members of the Sangha. It says that US $ 38,000, or, a staggering Rs 60 million, was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting Rajapaksa's re-election bid. No wonder today that certain aramayas are virtually leased out to the Joint Opposition, from where its members carry out vicious attacks on the government, with their Chief Incumbents too joining the fun, and Buddhist temples turned into meeting venues of Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Quick medicine from `Healthnetbuy
Sri Lankas first online pharmacy healthnetbuy will allow patients or their families to obtain prescribed medicines through a few simple steps.
Partners Deeshana Basnayaka and Rangika Wijesinghe worked together in the pharmaceuticals trade. Later Deeshana went on to change careers as a marketer in the banking sector, whilst Rangika continued to be in the Healthcare industry to date since he started his career. However, they had both identified a void in the pharmaceutical industry where the task of fulfilling medicine from conventional pharmacies was difficult.
As regular consumers we kept seeing how patients or their families would need to stay in long queues to obtain prescribed medicine. We would also see how most pharmacies do not stock all the brands prescribed by doctors, so patients would have to visit several pharmacies to complete one prescription. There were also instances where pharmacy owners would push alternate brands to what is prescribed, and patients not wanting to take the risk. Sometimes medicine is just so rare that people would travel miles to obtain them. Most we knew had gone through at least one of these issues and we wanted to find a solution that best suited everyone, said Basnayaka.
Established in 2016, healthnetbuy first ran a pilot project on their website www.healthnetbuy.com where customers would place their orders via the dedicated hotline 0117 791791 or the website itself. Today, the process has further advanced to allow users to send an image of the prescription via WhatsApp or Viber. The medicines would then be packed with the correct indication of dosage and timing etc, before being delivered to the specified address (home, office or hospital) in a special container. To ensure that the correct medicines are delivered healthnetbuy only used qualified pharmacists to deliver medication and go a step further to educate and instruct patients on the storage, timings and dosages of the medicines being delivered. Medicines that require temperature control are delivered accordingly to ensure efficacy of the drugs.
While running the pilot project, we also worked on obtaining the necessary certifications from the National Medicines Regulatory Authority and other entities. The pharmaceutical industry in Sri Lanka is highly regulated and we wanted to make sure that the solution we were coming up with was in line with the countrys policies. Once that part was done we worked on getting the framework to be as user friendly as possible. healthnetbuy can even be used by senior citizens and is constantly evolving to serve customers better, added Rangika.
With its state-of-the-art storage facility in Colombo 5, healthnetbuy operates everyday (except Poya holidays) and guarantees prescription delivery within 2-4 hours of placing the order. Signing up with healthnetbuy is completely free, and delivery within 20km radius is also free for prescriptions above Rs. 5,000. For prescriptions below this amount a nominal delivery fee is charged. Deliveries are currently limited to the Colombo District, but the company has plans to expand their fleet to the entire Western Province shortly and subsequently for the rest of the island.

Reaching Out to the Needy
Surviving without a family is the most difficult thing for a child. Comprehending this SOS Childrens Villages are taking all efforts to pour out the love and affection on these little children. They want to take the message of love out to the public as well. They have been doing a lot of work to make sure the children of this country are supported. For this, they need the public to join hands with them. They are determined that the quality of care continues.
When you think of these children some have lost both their parents, some come from broken families, the single parent is deemed unfit to raise the child or the family is poverty stricken.
Daily News went to SOS Childrens Village Galle which was started in 1990 and celebrates 37 year of Service by SOS Villages in Sri Lanka.
At the village the first thing we all saw was the exhibits of the art exhibition and competition, where the schools around Galle on invitation of SOS, joined hands with the SOS Children.
Another feature of the village was the stall that belonged to the family strengthening program. Here they have identified the below poverty line families around the areas. The Children are supported for five years in the education. Their books, uniforms and meals are all provided. The parents are helped to develop skills so that they can earn money. These stalls are by the families supported by SOS Childrens Villages. These items are produced by the mothers, so that they may sell and make an income for their children.
Hermann Gmeiner is the Global Founder of SOS childrens Villages. This was a concept he initiated in 1949 after World War II. He understood the suffering faced by the children who had lost their parents. So he devised a new method to look after them. He himself was an orphan and had 10 siblings looked after by his older sister. So he thought of a system where a lady could play the part of a mother to a group of children. In this village in Galle we have 12 families with 120 children. Each mother looks after 10 children. They have lost their parental care for various reasons such as separation of the family, poverty or death of both parents. Some of them have one parent  father or mother. They are directed to us by the courts or probation department, said Director National Youth Care Programs Kapila Gunawardhana.
There are two programs  Short Term Care and Long Term Care. They provide long term care for children who have lost their parents. When it comes to Short Term Care, they provide care for a short time, maximum three years.
These children need care for a short time. After that we reintegrate with the parent, who maybe facing a court case or who has gone abroad. When they return from abroad the family gets together. So until the parent comes back, the child needs some short term care. At our village the mothers are well trained to look after the children, having undergone a thorough training. They are educated in child psychology, cooking and sewing. In other words everything a mother needs to know. When a mother retires the aunt will step into her shoes and with her experience and maturity become a mother of a house, said Gunawardhana.
SOS Childrens Villages National Director Divakar Ratnaduraipointed out that more than giving a child a house to live in, what they need is a loving home with a maternal figure.
SOS Childrens Villages are flourishing in 135 countries throughout the world. This is a reason for great joy. In Sri Lanka we have villages in Piliyandala, Nuwaraeliya, Galle, Anuradhapura, Moneragala and Jaffna. The villages are supporting children who have lost parental care. We also support the children who are at the risk of losing parental care. So in these two programs there are a very large number of children. In these 37 years we have managed to support 15,000 children. They live happily with their siblings and natural brothers and sisters. They belong to a community and they always have someone. They are supported until they are really settled in life, said Ratnadurai
Brand Ambassador for SOS Childrens Villages Roshan Mahanama, had absolutely no hesitation when he was asked to join the cause.
When I was invited to be a part of SOS Childrens Villages I had no hesitation. I have grown up in a culture where I was exposed to Social Welfare. I firmly believe that you need to spare a thought for the less fortunate. I am so happy that I have received this opportunity to do something for these children and children as a whole, said Mahanama.
Mahanama stressed on the fact that children are our future and that we as a society need to do the utmost for them.
We need to see that they have an education and that they are living a full and happy childhood. We need to do everything possible to provide them with love and care. I am actively involved in a foundation where we have built 47 pre-schools, and are in the process of building a center of excellence for kids with disability, stated Mahanama.
Mahanama believes in a social conscience. He feels that what we must do is not for profit but we must do the right thing in life.
I feel that I have a responsibility towards society, especially where kids are concerned. I feel I have so much to do because I know I have the capacity. I know my duties and responsibilities. I also feel that we need leadership at the political level. We need to be change makers. And I say this because it is something that comes from my heart. Our politicians should not be preoccupied with winning elections. They need to want to genuinely do something for our society and our children. I feel we need to get together, rally around and convince our leaders to take up this cause. We can all contribute in our own way, said Mahanama.

Ronaldo tight-lipped on future after World Cup KO
SOCHI Sunday: Cristiano Ronaldo saw his World Cup dreams slip away once again on Saturday but gave no hint as to whether he plans to continue playing for Portugal.
The reigning European champions were undone by two Edinson Cavani goals for Uruguay in their last-16 tie in Sochi, despite Pepe bringing them level at one point early in the second half.
It was not to be Ronaldos night, as he exited the World Cup on the same day as Lionel Messis Argentina were eliminated following a 4-3 defeat at the hands of France.
Ronaldo will be nearly 38 by the time the next World Cup comes around in Qatar in 2022.
Now is not the time to talk about the future, either of the coach or the players, the Portugal skipper said after the game. The 33-year-old did however say that the European champions could look to the future with confidence.
I am sure that Portugal will continue to be one of the best teams in the world. We have a young and ambitious squad, he said. Remarkably, neither Ronaldo nor Messi have managed to score a single goal in a knockout tie in four World Cups going back to 2006.
Ronaldo reached the semi-finals with Portugal in his first World Cup in Germany, but has never made it past the last 16 since then.
This has been his best World Cup in terms of goals scored, as he leaves with four in total, including a hat-trick in a 3-3 draw with Spain in the group stage.
His tally is one behind the tournaments current leading scorer Harry Kane, with Ronaldo also missing a penalty in the 1-1 draw with Iran.
He is an exceptional player, said Uruguays veteran coach Oscar Tabarez.
He is their leader, their captain. You need to really concentrate to make sure he is not successful against you, but that is very difficult. Portugal coach Fernando Santos was hopeful that the Real Madrid man will continue to represent his country for some time yet, with Portugals next challenge to defend the European Championship title they won in France two years ago.
I am sure he will. Cristiano still has a lot to give to the game, Santos said when asked if he felt his captain would carry on representing his country.
Portugal will take part in the inaugural UEFA Nations League later this year, beginning against Italy in September.
By that time, Ronaldos situation at club level will be clearer after he raised doubts about his future with Real Madrid in the wake of their Champions League final win against Liverpool in May.
There is another tournament starting in September and of course we hope Cristiano will be with us to help the younger players grow, Santos said.
We have many young players and it is important to have our captain there. -AFP

Rs. 49,231 m loss for CEB in 2017
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has increased its revenue only by 3 per cent for 2017 while incurring a Rs. 49,231 million loss, a 240 percent increase from 2016, the Treasurys Annual report shows.
CEB operational costs increased to Rs. 272,962 million from Rs. 231,147 in 2016. This significant increase in operational costs has resulted in a 240 per cent increase from last year, the report said.
The report finds that the CEB recorded a direct generation cost of Rs. 184.60 billion in 2017 compared to the Rs.152.00 billion in 2016 reflecting a 21 per cent additional cost.
Due to the absence of implementing a cost reflective price mechanism for the CEB, it had to manage its liquidity requirement through borrowings from State banks, which came to Rs. 8,691 million at the end of 2017 compared to Rs. 6108 million in 2016.
Although CEB has been able to achieve its household electrification network exceeding 99 per cent, the lack of new additional energy sources on the national grid has resulted in CEB purchasing emergency power at high costs.
The Long Term Least Cost Generation Expansion Plan prepared by the CEB has to be approved by the PUCSL augmenting the generation capacity by at least 400MW every year from 2018 to 2037. It requires an additional investment of Rs.85 billion (USD 550 million) every year, the report finds.

Rukshan ends the year in style
Rukshan Perera, the well-known composer, arranger, multi-instrumentalist and singer completed the Rotary year as the President of the Rotary Club of Colombo Metropolitan by becoming the overall Best President and winning the Best Club in the country while taking home 37 awards by the club and its members at the Rotary District Awards held at Grandeeza Hotel in Negombo recently.
Perera said As Rotarians we address the special needs in our communities and country while following the Rotary principals and guidelines in six focus areas - promoting peace, preventing disease, providing clean water, maternal and child health, education and literacy, and economic and community development. This year the Rotary Club of Colombo Metropolitan conducted more than 20 service projects spending more than Rs. 20 million and Making a Difference to our communities in need - our flagship project Sunshine Games brought 850 differently abled children from all over the country to Colombo to conduct a day of Special Olympic style athletic program. Three hundred underprivileged children at Gamini Vidyalaya benefited the vocational program learning English, Dance and IT skills, and the club conducted 10 special projects focused on children to highlight this years theme for Sri Lanka Making a Difference to a Child.
We are proud to announce two unique, out of the box projects for Sri Lanka we started this year - Child Friendly Police Station, a separate building as a pilot project at Ragama police station with specially trained officers for the children to give evidence in a comfortable, child friendly manner will be launched in the month of July and Little Minds Strong Values to teach ethics and values to children through songs and video animation, where Rukshan has composed 20 songs with each song containing a particular value or values.
These songs will begin airing on TV stations starting in the month of July and 5,000 DVDs will be distributed to preschools/schools free of charge later in the year aiming to bring back important values we have lost in the country, he added.
Perera is very thankful to the members of the Rotary Club of Colombo Metropolitan for giving their best to help the needy, and to the district officials for their guidance during the year to make a difference to our motherland.

Semenya and Samba sparkle in Paris
PARIS, Saturday: South African Caster Semenya, whose middle-distance career could be under threat because of a new IAAF rule, romped to the fourth-fastest womens 800 metres ever and Qatari Abderrahman Samba produced the second-best 400 metres hurdles of all time in a sparkling Paris Diamond League meeting on Saturday.
Olympic and world champion Semenya cruised home in a lifetime best 1:54.25 and the dominant Samba clocked 46.98 seconds for his fifth consecutive Diamond League win.
Semenya, who is challenging a new hyperandrogenism rule by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), took nearly a second off her personal best as she claimed her 25th consecutive final win in the event. Burundis Francine Niyonsaba was second in 1:55.86.
I did not expect that, Semenya, who ran without pacemakers, told reporters. I was thinking 1:54.99 could be possible but this was great.
The IAAF rule, against which Semenya has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), would effectively give her a choice of taking medication to restrict her testosterone level or move to longer-distance events. It is scheduled to become effective in November unless overturned by CAS.
I am just a human and if you want to be an inspiration to the world and to the youth, you cannot focus on negative things, Semenya said.
Only Czech world record holder Jarmila Kratochvilova (1:53.28), Ukrainian Nadezhda Olizarenko (1:53.43) and Kenyan Pamela Jelimo (1:54.01) have run faster than the South African.
Samba became just the second runner to break 47 seconds in the 400 metres hurdles. The other was American world record holder Kevin Young, whose 46.78 won the 1992 Olympics.
I made a small mistake at the start, lost my balance on the first hurdle so I did not expect to run so fast, said the 22-year-old, whose previous best was 47.41.
Russian world champion Mariya Lasitskene also continued her dominance, winning her 45th consecutive high-jump competition with a sparkling seasons best of 2.04 metres.
All told, seven yearly bests were set or equalled at the meeting.
American world champion Sam Kendricks soared 5.96 metres to win a high-quality pole vault over young Swede Mondo Duplantis (5.90) and French world record holder Renaud Lavillenie (5.84) and American Ronnie Baker gained a share of the years 100-metres top time with a personal best 9.88 seconds.
Kenyan world silver medallist Timothy Cheruiyot became the first 1,500-metres runner to dip under 3:30 this year as he easily won in 3:29.71, and countrywoman Beatrice Chepkoech led a Kenyan sweep in the womens 3,000-metres steeplechase with a personal best 8:59.36. - Agencies

## Title: Snapshots of Muriel Spark

Snapshots of Muriel Spark
On December 23, 1951, a six-winged Seraph flew low along the Zambesi at 70 miles an hour, away from the turmoil of the Victoria Falls, leaving behind an apocalyptic chaos of squalor and flames, and launching the astonishing career of Muriel Spark, whose centenary is celebrated this year. Her story was published in the Observer, having won their Christmas competition. She was living at the time a Grub Street existence, undernourished and hard up, and the prize was 250, quite a fortune in those days. When she saw the advertisement, she recalled in her memoir Curriculum Vitae (1992),
I put aside my work on Masefield and wrote The Seraph and the Zambesi on foolscap paper, straight off. Then I had to type it but found I had no typing paper. I scrounged some from the owner of an art shop nearby in South Kensington, typed it out, put my pseudonym Aquarius on the envelope and my name and address inside, and mailed it off to the Observer that afternoon.
Literary acquaintance
This first published work of prose fiction was followed by twenty-two novels and many short stories. It was a lucky start and it introduced her to critics and publishers (including Alan Maclean, the influential editor at Macmillan) and an altogether better class of literary acquaintance than that she had enjoyed through her editorial work at the cantankerous Poetry Society, which she satirizes mercilessly in two autobiographical novels and exposes without the veil of pseudonymity in her memoir.
Pisseur de copie is the insult with which her one-time lover, Derek Stanford (alias Hector Bartlett), is regularly greeted in A Far Cry from Kensington (1988). Spark admitted that in real life she was a poor judge of men. Her Camberwell landlady, Tiny (Mrs Lazzari in A Far Cry), told her she was a bad picker, and Spark agreed. She took her revenge in print. She kept the score, and all her paperwork to prove it.
Centenaries prompt reassessment and new editions. Polygon is publishing all of Sparks novels in a well-designed and pleasingly coloured format under the leadership of the series editor Alan Taylor. There are introductions by scholars, friends and fellow novelists which are resolutely up to date, complete with references to Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump. Spark has unquestionably achieved classic status, but what kind of a classic is she She founded no movement, and she belongs to none. The general reader is familiar with The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961), popularized by stage and screen, and perhaps The Girls of Slender Means (1963), both short and both dealing with female group behaviour.
The Girls of Slender Means, set nostalgically in wartime London  and as slim and elegant as the Schiaparelli dress which the girls share for their evenings out  has the narrative panache of its predecessor, and a more benign view of most of the girls. Biographers are drawn to Loitering with Intent (1981) and A Far Cry from Kensington, with their provocative reflections on the relationship of fact with fiction and their emphasis on the greater veracity of fiction.
Sexist prose
Independent and self-reliant, Spark was not an ideological feminist, although she portrayed strong and self-willed women, ranging from school teachers to film stars, abbesses, terrorists and billionaires. Even her admirers (among them Joyce Carol Oates, Ali Smith and Elaine Feinstein) use words such as arch, pert and sly to describe her prose, compliments which some feminists might reject as sexist. Catholics see her as a Catholic writer, but while her work has something in common with that of her supporter Graham Greene, her attitudes to her faith are far from conventional. Frank Kermode (who thought Spark our best novelist) describes her religion as bafflingly idiosyncratic.
She wrote of sin and suffering, liked to split theological hairs, and was particularly drawn to the Book of Job, but many of her portraits of believers are caustic in the extreme. The devout, gullible and multiple-bosomed Mrs Hogg in her first novel, The Comforters (1957), the pig-eyed treacherous convert Sandy Stranger in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, the divinely wicked Abbess of Crewe and her silly flock, and the camp and parasitical Jesuits, Father Cuthbert Plaice and Father Gerard Harvey (scholar of ecological paganism) in The Takeover (1976), do not show the Church in a good light.
The whisky priests and tormented adulterers of Greene fare better at the hands of their creator. This can be puzzling to readers of other faiths or none, though Greene, Evelyn Waugh and David Lodge  all fellow Catholics, and all admirers of Spark  do not seem to discern meaningful incongruities between faith and art.
Fortieth year
Despite the success of The Seraph and the Zambesi in 1951, it took some time for Spark to confirm her new status.
The years between her startlingly original Nativity story and the appearance of The Comforters, published in her fortieth year, were marked by mental anguish, physical ill health and the human confusion and ferment that the Seraph so signally lacked. Nevertheless (a word which Spark described as the characteristic word of Edinburgh, her birthplace), she displayed throughout this painful time the perseverance which was one of her most distinctive qualities, and managed, with the help of friends and supporters, to emerge from the chrysalis of doubt and paranoia as a more completed figure: mentally, bodily and spiritually transformed.
A surprisingly gentle poem that she wrote at this time, Chrysalis, describes the small violence of metamorphosis, as the butterfly emerges from the matchbox in which it had spent a London winter, forgotten by those who had saved it.
In his introduction to the Polygon edition of The Comforters, Allan Massie describes the nervous breakdown that preceded her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1954. To lose weight and suppress her appetite she took Dexedrine, a then fashionable amphetamine. She began to hear voices . . . . She also suffered verbal hallucinations, involving crosswords and anagrams and T. S. Eliot, who at one point she believed was posing as a window cleaner in order to pry into the papers of her friends. Massie says Spark . . . had a need to be in control.
In her novels, the narrative voice is always utterly assured. But I suspect that at the time she was scared stiff. Why, one wonders, did she need an appetite suppressant, if she was undernourished from living on post-war rations of Cornish pasties, cold lamb and beetroot, with the occasional treat of tinned herring roes on toast Was she simultaneously overweight and half-starved We know she was plump as a child, and the evidence of A Far Cry is that she was overweight around the time of her conversion.
Like her narrator, the young but Rubensesque widow Mrs Hawkins, who was at first comfortable in her fatness, Spark took drastic and dangerous measures to get rid of it after a young woman who I imagine was older than myself once got up in a bus to offer me a seat. - Times Literary Supplement

South African Rossouw gives lift-off to Hampshire Cup success
LONDON, Saturday - South African Rilee Rossouw didnt allow getting stuck in a lift on the eve of the match upset him as his sublime century propelled Hampshire to a 61 run win over Kent in the One Day Cup final at Lords on Saturday.
The 28-year-old -- who according to the BBC was stuck in a lift at the team hotel between floors for 45 minutes on Friday -- struck 125, his 12th century in the one day format, to help Hampshire set a new record total for a 50 overs final at Lords of 331-7.
Durhams 312 in 2007 had been the previous mark.
Im a very proud captain and couldnt have asked for more from the boys throughout the tournament, Hampshire captain James Vince told Sky Sports.
Our fielding was (electric) today. We probably saved 30 or 40 runs in the field.
Rossouw, who struck nine fours and three sixes, had been well supported firstly by his opening partner Tom Alsop, who made 72, and then former Kent skipper Sam Northeast punished his former team-mates with an unbeaten 75.
Kent -- who had done well to restrict Hampshire to just 68 runs in the final 10 overs at a cost of five wickets -- were never really up to the chase especially once their star South African Heino Kuhn, who had an average of 94.86 in the competition, made a poor call for a run and was brilliantly run out by Gareth Berg.
Kent lost another crucial wicket before they hit three figures as Joe Denly -- who had enjoyed a good spell with the ball taking 4-57 -- went for 12 caught by Vince off Berg.
Although both opener Daniel Bell-Drummond and captain Sam Billings scored half-centuries -- the former top scoring with 86 and the latter was last man out for 75 -- Hampshire had plenty in hand.
Billings -- who on Friday was omitted from the England squad for the ODI series with India -- said he did not regret opting to field first and predicted he and his team faced a golden future. Kent have not won a Lords final for 40 years, stretching back to 1978.
Eight defeats in one-day finals have followed since that Bob Woolmer-inspired six-wicket win against Derbyshire.
Theres definitely far more to come from this group of players, without a doubt, he told Sky Sports.
Score summary of English One Day Cup final played over 50 overs between Hampshire and Kent played at Lords on Saturday:
Hampshire 330-7 (R Rossouw 125, S Northeast 75 no, T Alsop 72, J Denly 4/57)
Kent 269 (D Bell-Drummond 86, S Billings 75)  AFP

Sri Lanka improves ranking on JLLs Global Transparency Index
Global real estate consultancy Jones Lang La Salle (JLL) launched the 10th edition of the Global Real Estate Transparency Index this month.
Sri Lanka ranked 66 out of 100 economies this year, improving from its 2016 debut ranking of 69. With peers Myanmar improving by 22 places to rank at 73, and Vietnam ranking at 61 in 2018, Sri Lanka must focus on maintaining its upward momentum in an increasingly competitive market for real estate growth. JLLs Global Real Estate Transparency Index meets a strong demand for accessible, in-depth analysis into the domestic property markets of 100 countries and 158 cities around the world. The index quantifies transparency based on 139 variables relating to the transaction process, regulatory and legal frameworks, corporate governance, performance measurement and data availability with higher real estate transparency being associated with stronger investor and corporate real estate activity. In 2016 it included Sri Lanka in its ranking for the first time, creating a sustained dialogue on the varied challenges faced by local and international investors while engaging in real estate transactions in the country.
The new report concurs with industry experts on the need for implementing a number of measures to maintain Sri Lankas momentum towards greater transparency in the real estate market. With Asia leading the charge in blockchain and property technology, Sri Lanka has an immense opportunity to leverage disruptive technology in order to implement public access to digital land registry services, digital survey protocols and to liberate planning approvals for public scrutiny. Moreover, there is a strong push for the Government of Sri Lanka to ratify the Foreign Mortgage Law, consider reforms to laws preventing foreigners owning land in Sri Lanka and introduce incentives for buying real such as residency visas.
Public Private Partnerships are tremendous engines for increased transparency, noted JLL Sri Lanka Managing Director Steven Mayes. Mayes references projects such as the USD 40 billion Western Region Megapolis Plan, the Colombo Port City and a number of other development projects to be financed via a PPP model. He added, As the market moves towards consolidated maturity, following a post conflict boom, measures that will enhance clarity and encourage investment include tax breaks and legislation to permit REITs to flourish and designated special economic zones that allow foreign companies the clarity to structure an orderly entry into Sri Lanka.
JLLs new report finds that the influx of related-service professionals in Colombo to facilitate large real estate transactions has led to the shortage of commercial office space in the city, with occupancy rates exceeding 95%. The business class, 4-star hotel sector in Colombo is also witnessing a strong demand while certain established 5 star brands languish some way behind. The report also offers a comprehensive overview of the influence of macroeconomic factors affecting the market, including the implementation of the governments Vision 2025 agenda, spill over effects of key growth sectors such as tourism and the pursuit of international trade agreements.

St. Nicholas International College celebrates World Environment Day
St. Nicholas International College celebrated World Environment Day in collaboration with the Youth Wing of the Sri Lanka Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) on June 13, 2018.
The event was organised by teacher-in-charge Nilmini Perera and the Science Society members in collaboration with the Girl Guides, under the guidance of the College Director Rev. Dr. Anthony Fernandopulle.
Representatives of the society held lectures on topics ranging from the endangerment of the Sri Lankan wild elephant and leopard populations as well as environmental pollution affecting both the country and the world. A representative of the WNPS pointed out the fact that the Sri Lankan elephant population had halved from 12,000 elephants to 6,000 within the past 75 years was a cause for apprehension as it denoted a rather bleak outlook on the future of one of Sri Lankas most unique and precious forms of life.
The lecture outlined the causes and effects of Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC), while also highlighting possible solutions that could be implemented. In doing so, Sri Lanka would conserve one of its main tourist attractions which would in turn, serve the community in the long run. Further, the deterioration of the natural habitats of wild animals occurring for the sake of insensible development and corrupt political agendas also pose threats to the survival of Sri Lankas apex predator, the leopard, which had also become an endangered species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, with only around 700 to 950 leopards still in existence.
The statistics related to the said animals come as a shock given the strict laws that surround the wildlife in Sri Lanka. Research revealed that while these laws do exist, their enforcement had become weak and hence, the ability of the law to cause effectual change, is crippled. Moving on to the issue of pollution had revived Sri Lankan memories of one of the most catastrophic disasters caused by garbage, which was the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump in 2017.
The need for more efficient garbage-management became painfully clear as it destroyed the lives of many Sri Lankans. Organizing your garbage at home comes as a first step in the management of waste, which could contribute to the world we live in. Alternatives to plastic were also discussed along with the importance of an effective recycling system within Sri Lanka.
The programme ended with a Q&A session during which students rose various queries to WNPS officials. While placing significance on the environment, it was important to also remember that our duty to protect and conserve the world around us must happen 24/7. After all, we only have one world to live in right now, so there will be no starting over once it has gone too far. Live and let live.

Substance abuse in Sri Lanka
Abuse of psychotropic substances is becoming a significant problem in Sri Lanka. People addicted to one or more of these substances, either after medical use, or to evade
withdrawal symptoms of heroin addiction, when heroin is not available in the market. Although these substances are controlled medicines, they seem to be freely available on the black market. According to the data and incidents reported in 2016, Western province shows a higher tendency for use of psychotropic substances and prescribed medicines
The most recognized drugs of abuse include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and ecstasy. Synthetic drugs are especially dangerous because they are difficult to regulate. Synthetic drug abuse affects the brain in similar ways to the naturally-occurring compounds they mimic. Sometimes these effects are even more potent because synthetic drugs are purer forms of the psychoactive substance.
Price of drugs
In 2016, the average street price of one kilogram of heroin was SLR 9 million. Compared to 2015, the average street price of heroin has increased by 13%. In 2016, the average street price of a kilogram of cannabis and opium was SLR 22,000 and SLR 1.5 million respectively.
Abuse of psychotropic substances
Abuse of psychotropic substances is becoming a significant problem in Sri Lanka. People addicted to one or more of these substances, either after medical use, or to evade withdrawal symptoms of heroin addiction, when heroin is not available in the market.

According to the data and incidents reported in 2016, Western province of the country shows a higher tendency for use of psychotropic substances and prescribed medicines.
Drug trafficking
Sri Lanka is a transit point for drug trafficking from Pakistan and India smuggled to Europe.
During the past five years, heroin seizures and arrest information revealed that South West Asian heroin (Brown Sugar) is mainly smuggled from India and Pakistan.
Treatment
The reported number of clients treated for drug abuse island-wide was 2355 in 2016. Among them, 826 (35%) clients were from the treatment centres of the NDDCB, 684 (29%) were from Prisoner Diversion Scheme of the Department of Prisons, 474 (20%) were from the nongovernment organisations and 371 (6%) were from Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre of Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation.
The majority (51%) of the clients were treated from Colombo district. Sixty two percent of rehabilitated persons were aged 30 years and above. Treatment admissions have increased in 2016 by 59% compared to that of 2015.
Statistical report on drug-related arrests in Sri Lanka (DAMS arrest report) - Volume 49
The total number of persons arrested for drug-related offences was 8,570 from January to June 2015 from recorded to the database. Of the persons arrested 1,795 were heroin users. 21% per cent of the persons arrested were aged between 30 and 34 years.
Of the reported arrests, the majority (2,350) were arrested from Colombo district. When considering all arrests, 38% was from the western province.
Among the reported persons, 99% were male and 1% was female. Of the persons reported 5,732 (67%) were married and 2,804 (33%) single. Among the total drug-related arrestees, 58% had studied between year 5 and 10.

Inadequate treatment facilities
The Drug Dependent Persons (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 2007 offers great hope to address issues of substance abuse offering voluntary as well as compulsory treatment pathways. We are though way behind having a sufficient number of clinics. The challenge though is to expand the treatment facilities on offer, rapidly fast-track the case review and management process and walkway from the current practice of placing people in Prisons.
The Police would need to become friends and not opponents of users whilst interventions have to be scaled up within locations where persons are being held currently and simultaneously for those in their own homes. They could ostensibly organise filed based clinics in neighbourhoods where usage is common; clinics have to be proactively conducted for those unfortunately committed within the walls of prisons which have a high population. The problem is universal and societal. It's not going to go away. Ultimately it calls for giving optional pathways for users working with kith and kin, families or caregivers.

Transparent electoral process to uphold democracy
The essence of any democratic country is the healthy functioning of ethical political parties and free and fair elections. To conduct free and fair elections, a country should possess a solid legal framework and a transparent electoral process. And, to acquire a transparent electoral process a country needs an institutional structure regulating campaign finance. This is the only way to adequately ensure that governance caters to the welfare of general public and not for special interests.
The recent disclosureby New York Times on China Harbour Engineering Company Limited funding immediate past Presidents election campaign has proven beyond doubt that its time to seriously consider the introduction of stringent regulation of election campaign finance in Sri Lanka.
Dimensions
Election campaign finance reforms advocate a simultaneous pursuit of transparency (limiting and capping of political donation whether cash or others) and deter cronyism (making disclosure mandatory).
Both dimensions are inter-connected to each other. However, some observers think that due to the prevailing corrupted political culture, it is only an independent body like Election Commission with a given set of clear laws and regulations can deliver the expected aspirations.
Corruption
For three decades since Independence, Sri Lanka had been a model for emerging democracies across the world. Having held periodic elections since 1947, the effectiveness of the electoral structures both at the national and state-levels has to a great extent defined our success as a modern democratic nation.
Unfortunately, over the past four decades, the essence of democracy has been continuously corroded by corruption in the electoral financing structure, criminalisation of politics and lack of genuine inner-party democracy. If the present government wants to reform the process, it is essential that the all-pervasive influence of illegal sources of money on the political culture must be addressed.
Of course, it is common knowledge universally that during an election, candidates and political parties require funds to promote themselves and their vision of governance. The general presumption is that access to greater funds would translate into a more beneficial electoral outcome, since they would have access to greater number of voters.
However, there can be some negative externalities associated with the process of seeking more funds. First, those who are already in a position to exert influence due to their political standing can pressurise businessmen and other sources for funds. Second, powerful private sources might work out an arrangement of quid pro quo with the candidate, which would result in elected candidates taking decisions for the welfare of special interests. Thirdly, this broad framework throws light on the conceptual problems associated with the process of democratic elections. Therefore, the need to regulate political finance flows from minimising such possibilities.
Political equality
Of the various ways in which citizens in Sri Lanka can be unequal, political inequality is one of the most significant and troubling. By political equality we refer to the extent to which citizens have an equal voice over governmental decisions.
Political equality is an essential feature of modern political discourse. Although the definition of this concept can be diverse, political equality is generally understood as a condition where control over governance decisions so that preferences of a special group of citizens are not weighed more heavily than the preferences of other groups of citizens.
When there is no effective regulation of political campaign financing, it will result in adoption of policies that disproportionately favour the electoral contributors at the cost of public welfare. Therefore, there is a visible linkage between degradation of political equality and the way political campaigns are funded.
In this sense, it is reasonable for a common citizen to feel that our current electoral laws have been unable to safeguard political equality and to preserve the fundamental idea of democracy of a vote being the voters proxy for participation in governance.
Loopholes
Its time, therefore the Government take a long hard look at Sri Lankas election campaign financing structure and methodology. First of all, it is prudent to address transparency by squeezing out channels of cash donations and ensuring that only accounted clean money enters the political arena through banks.
A cap on donations, is also a must, although it has become a controversial issue in a number of countries. Some countries have a cap of different figures, depending on what type of election it is (local, provincial or national). However, disclosure requirement is a progressive step and it becomes all the more so since auditing disclosure statements have proven to be politically and administratively feasible.
Spending limits on campaign can also be introduced. These exist in, many Asian countries such as Bangladesh, and Thailand. To be really effective, spending limits need to be enforced on parties as well as candidates, so that money cannot be back-channelled to one via the other. Similar loopholes can be closed by making both candidates and parties responsible for adhering to spending limits, anonymous donation bans and reporting requirements.
Apart from legal changes, Election Commission, as the oversight authority, could be further strengthened to deal effectively with any high amount of unreported money.
Since enforcement starts with transparency, it may be a good idea to make party expenditure information available online. But Election Commission should also find ways to go beyond information gathering and apply sanctions more rigorously.
Political parties themselves need to consider less expensive campaigning. By raising large numbers of small donations, parties will not only become less dependent on a few large donors but also broaden their popular support. They also can use pocket meetings and social media. All three techniques have already been successfully tried on a smaller scale in India and Indonesia.

Legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay could face further punishment from Sri Lanka Cricket in wake of his unsanctioned night out in St Lucia.
Vandersays tour of the Caribbean was cut short on June 23, when he was sent home due to the incident, which was in breach of his contract. Sri Lanka team manager Asanka Gurusinha has submitted a special report on the matter to SLC, which will investigate further and take action as needed.
Once we [review] the managers report, we will decide the next course of action, Kamal Padmasiri, the Competent Authority in charge of Sri Lankan cricket at present, said.
But there will definitely be an inquiry and if found guilty, he will be punished.
Padmasiri and SLC CEO Ashley de Silva are both currently at the ICC meetings in Dublin, and the matter is likely to be taken forward only when they return to Sri Lanka.

Verstappen wins in Austria as Vettel grabs lead in standings
Spielberg, Sunday: Max Verstappen made the most of a rare Mercedes double retirement on Sunday by claiming his first win this year, and Red Bulls first at home, in an incident-packed Austrian Grand Prix.
The Dutch tyro grabbed victory after both Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas pulled up with power and gearbox failures respectively as their teams run of four straight Austrian wins came to an abrupt end at the Red Bull Ring. It was the first time Mercedes had suffered a double-retirement since Verstappen won on his Red Bull debut at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix after Hamilton collided with team-mate Nico Rosberg on the opening lap. It was Verstappens fourth career victory as he came home ahead of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel, who regained the lead in the drivers championship ahead of Hamilton by a single point.
Romain Grosjean was fourth ahead of his Ferrari-powered Haas team-mate Kevin Magnussen, Esteban Ocon and his Force India team-mate Sergio Perez. Two-time champion Fernando Alonso came home eighth for McLaren ahead of Monegasque rising star Charles Leclerc and his Ferrari-powered Sauber team-mate Marcus Ericsson.
Verstappens Red Bull team-mate Australian Daniel Ricciardo was also forced to retire on his 29th birthday. AFP

## Title: Writing beyond English
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C

Writing beyond English
I write novels set in South India. In English, I invent characters shaped by other languages, primarily Tamil, but also sometimes Hindi. Many of my characters dont just not speak English, they dont think or feel English; which is to say, their interiority, the infinite and often occult world of their minds and hearts, is not English. Of course, neither the speech of my characters nor their interiority can be seen as separate from their society and their history. To imagine my non-English-speaking characters in English I must translate not just their speechtheir dialoguebut entire worlds, internal and external.
Translate is simply shorthand. Writing a novel in English about a Tamil world may involve actual translationof a real or imagined piece of Tamil text, for examplebut the writing of the novel is not in itself translation except in the most metaphorical of senses. We should rigorously distinguish writing a novel in English about a Tamil world from translating a Tamil novel into English. Why Because, if the aesthetic integrity of the novel is to be maintained, the novel has to be invented in/through English, not Tamil.
Written elsewhere
You have to invent, in English, Tamil speech, feeling, action, philosophy, faith, family, friendship, hostility, love, work, and all the other things that go into the making of a world. You invent in English a Tamil world. Certainly, you can learn from translation how to go about this inventionas I did when I translated Komal Swaminathans great Tamil play Thaneer, Thaneer into Englishbut invention is not the same as translation because at its bottom, as I have written elsewhere, translation is interpretation of a prior text.
Invention is not this kind of interpretation. So something mysterious has to happen: you have to find within English the wherewithal to depict a Tamil world. Language itself is your ally here; it is itself a resource. I dont mean by this the capability of a specific language such as English or Tamil but rather the generative power inherent in all languages as language. Philosophers of language like Walter Benjamin and literary theorists like Gayatri Spivak have spoken of this power, which is the power of a language to transcend its own specific historical location. The English-language novelist confronted by the challenges of creating a non-English world needs to discover and access this power.
Alongside language, genre is at issue. How should we classify novels in English extensively populated with non-English-speaking characters Writing fiction in English about communities that dont function in English raises such specific challenges of craft and ethics that we should really think of such fiction as a genre unto itself. Neither scholarly criticism nor creative writing has sufficiently acknowledged this obvious notion because the challenges attending the writing of such fiction are still inadequately understood.
Postcolonial literature
Recently, criticism has spent substantial energy in a historical and theoretical mode on exploring postcolonial literature written in English. This literature more often than not depicts non-English-speaking communities. Criticism has had interesting things to say about this literature. However, it has, in a manner typical of criticism in general, remained oblivious to questions of craft and technique.
For its part, creative writing pedagogy has not fully acknowledged the peculiar difficulties of creating realistic non-English-speaking communities in English. At most, these difficulties are addressed in the writing of dialogue. Would such a character speak in quite this fashion is a question sometimes posed in a creative writing context. Certainly, such questions put needed pressure on dialogue as the external mark of a characters authentic interiority. However, the challenges of inventing a non-English-speaking world in English through the tools and rules of the novel go beyond dialogue.
They include narrative voice. For ethical and political reasons, my concern throughout my most recent novel, Ghost in the Tamarind, is to tell the story in a way internal to the narrativethat is, to imagine and narrate the Tamil world of the novel from the perspective of someone who is an integral part of that world (though perhaps critical of it).

Zaman career best 61 underpins Pakistan
Harare, Sunday: Pakistan cruised to a 74-run win Sunday over their hosts in the opening match of the Zimbabwe Twenty20 Tri-Series.
A career best 61 from opening batsman Fakhar Zaman, and a late flurry of boundaries from Asif Ali and veteran batsman Shoaib Malik set up Pakistans imposing 182 for 4.
In reply, Zimbabwe mustered just 108 all out, with the wickets shared around Pakistans bowling attack. Mohammad Nawaz, Usman Khan, Mohammad Hafeez and Hasan Ali picked up two apiece.
We decided that whether we batted or bowled first didnt really matter, said left-arm spinner Nawaz. But with the start Fakhar Zaman gave us, and with Asif Ali and Shoaib Malik finishing it off, we felt we had enough runs.
Zamans efforts were vital to Pakistans total. He kept Pakistan steady through the first half of their innings while Zimbabwe, having opted to bowl first, chipped away at the other end with regular strikes.
With Mohammad Hafeez, Hussain Talat, and captain Sarfraz Ahmed all falling cheapy, Pakistan were helped by Zamans fluent scoring at the other end, and he brought up his second T20 international half century from 33 deliveries with a flick through square leg in the 13th over.
Zaman appeared settled at the crease, but two overs later he missed a heave at Chisoro and had his leg stump pegged back. AFP
