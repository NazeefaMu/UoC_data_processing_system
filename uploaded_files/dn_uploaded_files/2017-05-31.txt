The capacity development in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations of the Army should be further enhanced to meet any emergency, said Chief of Staff of the Army Major General Mahesh Senanayake.
The Army renders yeomen service in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations and further enhancing its capacity could improve its service delivery in future natural calamities, he added. Major General Senanayake was delivering the key note address as the chief guest at the biannual academic sessions of the Officer Career Development Centre (OCDC) at Buttala during the weekend.
Referring to future of military engagement, the keynote speaker highlighted terrorism to be considered as the prioritized security concern. We are the guardians of all Sri Lankans and the Army is the nations means to seize, retain and exploit the opportunities. Terrorism is at the forefront of our security concerns and we have to nip the origins of terrorism in the bud. Constructive engagement with international and regional intelligence players is therefore a must. The Army should be, all the time, agile, lethal, versatile and modernised to suit tomorrows operations. That is the need of the hour. Close combination with Navy and Air Force is another essential component since the Army should act as a capability-based force and not a threat-based one because threats are always hard to predict.

Automation Company startup registrations begins
Turning a new page in Sri Lankas business history, the entire company registration process is to be fully automated thereby slashing the waiting period for the birth of a new Company.
The groundwork has been going on for this e-Registration of Companies Project (eROC) for some time and today I am pleased that we are launching work on this pioneering initiative in Sri Lankas business sector said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, addressing the MoU signing event of eROC project between the Department of Registrar of Companies (DRC) under his Ministry and KPMG Sri Lanka, the supplier of the automated solution.
The total number of companies registered in Sri Lanka (under the Companies Act) surged by 11% to 85587 in 2016, from 77116 in 2015.
This project is part of the business development vision of the Unity government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Minister Bathiudeen.
The eROC envisions the entire company registration process (such as Ltd, Pvt Ltd, Guarantee Ltd,) done by DRC-currently around three days is to be fully automated and waiting period for the birth of a new firm drastically reduced to just one day.
Rs 57 million is funded by the Companies Fund of the Department. The project is executed by KPMG Sri Lanka for DRC under Ministry of Industry and commerce.
The online system is scheduled to go live in March 2018. All the required documentation could be submitted online as well as payments too could be made online.
The main objective is to reduce unnecessary time consuming paperwork and help more startups registration as well as to speed up the process said Registrar General Siriwardena.
The DRC, in developing and fostering a trusted business environment, implements, administers and enforces the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, the societies Ordinance (Chapter 123), The Public Contract Act No. 03 of 1987 and Cheetu Ordinance.

Beautiful Yalpanam
Book review:
In the light of the recently unearthed evidence, Lankan history has to be rewritten. Particularly the early period needs to be understood by non-partisan historians and rabid politicians. This I say after reading a book in Tamil on the History of Lankan Tamils by the eminent historian and Chancellor of the University of Yaalpaanam  Prof S Pathmanathan. The Tamil title of the book is Ilankaith Thamilar Varalaaru. This massive 550-page hardcover book is published by the Hindu Cultural Affairs Department under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and is priced at Rs 2500/- The book covers the period 250 B C- 300 AD when the Tamils and Nagas lived in East Sri Lanka.
In his Preface to the book written in English he clearly delineates four main sources of the early history of the country.
1. The Dipavamsa, Mahavamsa and other Pali Chronicles,
2. The monuments and other remains of the Early Iron Age Culture,
3. The Brahmi inscriptions written in hybrid Prakrit
4. The Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions that have remained unidentified until the dawn of the 21st century,
The documentary evidence is in three languages: Pali, Prakrit and Tamil.
He rightly says: the study of the Proto-History and Early History of the island are heavily dependent on archaeological sources.
According to Prof S Pathmanathan:
The fourth category of sources is the Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions, which were contemporaneous with the Prakrit inscriptions. These inscriptions, which were recently identified, are concentrated for the most part in the northern and eastern parts of the island. They are also found in the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Hambantota and Puttalam districts. As sources of historical information, they are of the utmost importance.
A large proportion of the Nagas had become Buddhists. It is noteworthy that the Nagas were responsible for the links between the culture of the Early Iron Age and that which is discerned from the Brahmi inscriptions.
The main revelation of the respected scholar who relies on field work rather than mere theorising is:
The fourth category of source materials for the study of the history and culture of this period consists of a vast number of Tamil Brahmi inscriptions that have been identified in recent years. Although words and expressions inscribed characters on stone pillars, images and other such items. This is rather surprising because Tamil Brahmi inscriptions inconsiderable numbers are found at museums in Jaffna, Vavuniya and Colombo. They are found on some of the items exhibited there.
I will stop here. Lankan ancient history must be reviewed impartially taking into account all evidence that is being unearthed to bring about the real understanding of us Lankan, irrespective of ethnicities and move towards reconciliation.

BIRMINGHAM, Tuesday: Upul Tharangas 104-ball century and Sri Lankas challenging total of 356-8 proved insufficient to stop New Zealand from posting a thumping six wickets win with 23 balls to spare in the Champions trophy one-day warm-up match played at Edgbaston on Tuesday.
Sri Lankas invited to bat first rode on Tharangas 110 that comprised 13 fours and 3 sixes and was supported by half centuries from Kusal Mendis (57) and Dinesh Chandimal (55).
However with Sri Lanka resting skipper Angelo Mathews and their star bowler Lasith Malinga, the Black Caps made hay while the sun shone taking the bowlers to the cleaners. They maintained a healthy run rate of 7  runs an over to coast home comfortably.
Martin Guptill led the Black Caps run chase with a stunning innings of 116 off 76 balls before retiring out having slammed 10 fours and 5 sixes. Equally harsh on the Lankan bowlers was New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson who cracked 88 off 60 balls (7 fours, 4 sixes) before he too retired out.
New Zealand who cantered along at jet set pace eventually won with plenty to spare finishing on 359-4.
It was the final warm-up game for both teams before the tournament commences on June 1.

Celebrities even in retirement
They may have retired from international cricket two years ago but Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene still continue to hog the limelight in the cricket world sometimes more than the Sri Lanka cricket team whom they were staunch members of not so long ago.
The two cricketing legends inseparable in many ways during their playing career and even after, are making waves even during their retirement. While Sangakkara, the incredible run machine continues to light up the English cricket fields representing county Surrey and setting up new batting records, Jayawardene, one of the astute captains produced by the country is in great demand for his coaching skills. No sooner had he guided Mumbai Indians to a landmark third IPL title in the 10th edition of the cash-rich league with an astonishing one-run win over Rising Pune Supergiants Jayawardene is grabbed by Bangladesh Premier League side Khulna Titans on a two-year contract.
Jayawardene who succeeded former Australian captain Ricky Ponting as coach of Mumbai Indians will replace another former Australian Stuart Law as Khulna Titans coach.
"We were thrilled to see him win the IPL recently as the coach of the Mumbai Indians. I am sure all of us at Titans will learn a lot from him and the tournament will be enriched by his presence," Khulna Titans Managing Director Kazi Inam Ahmed said. The fifth edition of the BPL is set to begin on November 4.
In addition to his coaching stints Jayawardene who turned 40 four days ago, still continues to actively participate in the game having signed with English county Lancashire to play in the NatWest T20 Blast during the current season.
He (Mahela) is not registered as an overseas player, having received a spousal visa through his Danish wife, and will be available for the entire competition. There is no formal coaching element to his deal with the Red Rose county, but as head coach of Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians he will be a huge source of information and advice for the clubs younger players, The Guardian (London) reported.
Lancashires coach, Glen Chapple, said: Mahela is a truly world-class batsman who scores runs all around the wicket. Hes a true competitor and a winner too. He is a legend of the game and is one of the greatest batsmen to have played cricket in the modern era. It will be a fantastic opportunity for our young players to learn off him and for our fans to watch one of the games greats. The NatWest T20 Blast is due to commence from July 7.
Having signalled his intention to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the ongoing county season Sangakkara, the former Sri Lanka captain certainly wants to make a memorable exit from Surrey and on a high where his name will be treasured and remembered for time immemorial.
SANGA MISSES WORLD RECORD
Having reeled off five consecutive first-class centuries for Surrey, a record for the county, Sangakkara narrowly missed out joining the distinguished company of Australian Don Bradman, Englishman Charles Fry and South African Mike Procter who have made six centuries in a row.
Despite the ICC Champions trophy being around the corner and the ODI series between England and South Africa currently on, it has been difficult for the English media to keep Sangakkaras master class batting performances out of the news. He started his record breaking run with 136 against Lancashire, followed by 105 against Warwickshire and 124 (n.o.) against Hampshire before celebrating the unveiling of his portrait at the Home of Cricket  Lords by scoring a century in each innings (114 & 120) against Middlesex.
Following the end of the drawn contest against Middlesex, Sangakkara told BBC Sport: 'You try to fight the inevitable but you need to get out while you're ahead. It's the last time I'll play a four-day game here at Lord's. I'll be 40 in a few months this is about the end of my time in county cricket.
Even before the dust had settled on that twin centuries at Lords, Sangakkara was on the road towards rescuing Surrey from a disastrous start stroking his way to an imperious double century against county table leaders Essex. Thanks to Sangakkaras monumental innings Surrey recovered from 31-5 to post a healthy 369. In the second innings too Surrey had to rely on Sangakkaras experience to escape with a draw after being reduced to 177-7. The elegant left-hander was well within reach of joining the likes of Bradman, Fry and Procter with six consecutive centuries when he was dismissed for 84 in the second innings.
Nevertheless the season is not half over yet and more batting records are expected to tumble before Sangakkara finally bows out. He is already the leading run-getter in English first-class cricket this season with an aggregate of 876 runs from 5 matches (8 innings) at an average of 109.50 that includes 5 centuries and 2 fifties.
Sangakkaras one-time former teammate, current Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews said of his exploits: "He's just a freak. He keeps scoring hundreds and hundreds. He's got the Surrey record as well and I'm pretty sure he's going to break many more records in his last season."
As any cricketer will tell you all the runs you score are not worth the effort if it does not help your team to win the title. Helping Surrey win the Championship will be the best farewell Sangakkara can give the county. Surrey are currently lying second, a point behind Essex.

Doctors mafia in action
The Hippocratic Oath taken by doctors becomes a great joke today. To us, it sounds very hypocritical when we look at the trend it is taking today. The elite and erudite class of doctors is fast diminishing in this country and this is accelerated by the actions of doctors themselves who agitate and resort to industrial action disrespecting their own ethics whilst endangering the lives of innocent patients.
This is a great shame.
The time is therefore high for the Government to step in and place restrictions on this new breed of doctors who care a dime for the welfare of the patient. In a new stance, they now try to pressurise the Government into facilitating elite schools to absorb their children. Sri Lanka is reputed for its high standards of education although our universities are invaded by students who do not value the free education offered. Government doctors are also employees of the Government and naturally, fall into the category of Government Servants.
Special privileges should not be given to any class of Government Servants as all should enjoy the same status. The same spoon must serve all. Such a policy must be strictly maintained in order to be equitable and fair by all.
It is also my humble opinion that the Government must devise a means of honouring public servants for their zeal in providing noteworthy and devoted service to the people. Many will strive to secure such prestige and in the process lead to the creation of a good order in society.

Cosmetic named happiness
We all want to be happy. That is natural. However, each one will have a different way of becoming happy. Some may indulge in sports and some may pursue academic distinctions and some may simply try to get that happiness through family life.
Please note that no matter which way you try to get happiness, it involves interactions with the external world. This would mean that because the cardinal characteristic of the external world is Change with time, our attempts to get happiness will inevitably meet with many difficulties. This happiness also involves an individual whether it is I or Us. Since I as an individual is also subject to the inevitable change, what was once happiness may not continue to be happiness due to this change
My purpose in writing the following thoughts is to introduce a totally different kind of happiness. I prefer to call it joy because it is not created by anything or anyone. Also, it is internal as opposed to the happiness which is based on interactions with the external world. One can gain access to this joy by doing the exact reverse of how we obtain happiness. In other words, the mind (thoughts) is projected inwards and an attempt is made to still the mind. Of course, this is an extremely difficult task because the mind is so used to going outwards; it is next to impossible to stop that flow. A way to do this is to inquire where the thoughts come from.
I have discovered that they emanate from a pin point on the right side of the chest. In fact, in a previous article on the Moment of Death, I suggested that life ceases not when the physical heart stops but only when the life force at the right side of the chest ceases. If one is able to focus on this point, one can feel the enormous force that emanates from this pinpoint. Gradually, one loses the feelings of the different parts of the body. In fact, when you do this meditation (Atma Vichara) seated cross-legged, it will come to a stage when one feels that one is up in the air because the touch of the bottom part of the body with the floor is lost. This ensuing lightness of the body gives a sense of joy which is impossible to get with any external activities. The crucial difference is here, the joy is not created as with happiness which is created with external interactions.
Having experienced almost all the so-called happiness in the external world, nothing comes even near in comparison to the inner joy I get even at the stage I am in at the moment. It is beyond imagination what the ultimate joy would be when at the final stage the sense of the body totally disappears and with it the external world also ceases to exist because the body as well as the external world has no independent existence and is created by thoughts, and as such, when all thoughts cease all must vanish. It is the ultimate paradox that true joy can only come when the seeker of that joy ceases!! I am writing this article now because if things happen the way I think they will happen, individuality will completely cease and only Pure Consciousness (Sat-Chit-Ananda) will remain and there will be no Dr Thenuwara to write any articles!! Prince Siddhartha had to do whatever he wanted to do before the fateful day under the Bo Tree. I will conclude with a beautiful and appropriate story involving the famous Nasruddin. Apparently, one day someone saw Nasruddin searching frantically inside his barn.
Naturally, he asked from Nasruddin: Nasruddin, what are you searching for
I am searching for my keys, was the reply.
So the man also joined in the search. After a long fruitless search, the man asked: Nasruddin, where did you lose your keys
The astonishing reply was I lost my keys inside the house.
He couldnt believe this and asked: If you lost your keys inside the house why are you searching for them in the barn
Nasruddin replied, Because there is more light here!
Did you say, how very foolish of Nasruddin Well, maybe, just maybe we are also equally foolish.
To end, what better way than to quote the most appropriate saying First, you find the Kingdom of Heaven within you! Please note, the crucial two words first and within. Are we doing this The way to do this, be still and know that I am.
Be still, absence of all thoughts, I am the ultimate and the only reality  Pure Consciousness.

CYCLONE MORA HITS BANGLADESH; OVER 300,000 EVACUATED
BANGLADESH: Over 300,000 people have been evacuated from southern coastal areas of Bangladesh as a cyclone dubbed Mora was forecast to make landfall on Tuesday, authorities here said.
Mora is forecast to make landfall near the southeastern tourist city of Coxs Bazar and the seaport city of Chittagong, the Bangladesh Meteorological Agency said.
More people were still waiting for evacuation, CNN quoted Abu Syed Mohammad Hashim, acting director general of the countrys Disaster Management Department, as saying.
Residents were seeking shelter in schools and other safe buildings in 17 coastal districts, Hashim said.
Officials have organised 3,800 relief centres ahead of the storm. Medical teams have been formed and doctors and nurses have had their leave requests cancelled in anticipation of the storms landfall, according to Bangladeshi state media.
Some low-lying areas of Coxs Bazar are already underwater due to an unusually high tide, reports CNN.
The countrys two main seaports in Chittagong and Mongla have stopped operations, and river transports across Bangladesh have been suspended. Chittagong and Coxs Bazar have been advised to hoist the number 10 warning signal -- the highest level -- and other areas the lesser number eight signal. - PTI

Difficult to pick a winner but England has been a real revelation
Former Sri Lanka captain previews the eight teams ahead of the Champions Trophy opener on June 1
Bilateral One-Day International cricket has a place in world cricket and, at its best both well-scheduled and evenly-contested, can be captivating. However, there is always something extra special about a multi-nation tournament. Indeed, for me, the multilateral environment brings out the very best of the format.
Its a very different experience playing one team for a three or five match series and participating in a major ICC event. Some players relish the environment, rising to the occasion, as do certain teams, most obviously Australia in modern times.
And then there are teams with a history of underperformance in major tournaments, the reason for which might be hard to explain given the calibre and character of its players. South Africa is, unfortunately for them, the most obvious example of a team apparently uncomfortable in such environments, although happily for them they performed extremely well in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015.
This ICC Champions Trophy  the first since the 2013 edition in England and Wales, a tournament where India triumphed, justifying their world champion status after their ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 success, is particularly intriguing because there are so many realistic contenders.
There was a time, not so long ago, when one or two countries dominated the format, but in the past few years we have seen several teams develop tremendously and now we have four to five teams who are very evenly matched, all with realistic ambitions of winning major tournaments.
Perhaps the most obvious example of this is the current England ODI team. Its progress in the past two years has been a revelation. It used to trail behind other teams in terms of its strategy and approach, but now it is one of the most progressive teams. It used to be one of the teams that traditionally struggle in big tournaments, but under this set-up  shrewdly overseen by coaches Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace with Andrew Strauss a strong Director of Cricket  its past record is perhaps not relevant.
ENGLAND is playing an aggressive and exciting brand of cricket and it has some world-class players driving that. Ben Stokes is an outstanding all-rounder, and both he and Chris Woakes will have benefited from their time in the IPL. Joe Root and Jos Butler will drive the batting.
AUSTRALIA is one of the strongest contenders. It have been playing some great ODI cricket of late and it is probably the best-balanced team in the competition. Its batsmen are also in-form and its bowling attack is potent.
SOUTH AFRICA dont have a great record in ICC events as already mentioned, but it certainly has a strong-looking team and will be desperate to throw-off the chokers tag once and for all. It will be thrilled to have AB de Villiers back and also Quinton de Kock, who brushed away some cobwebs with a powerful century last week.
Their presence bolsters an already-strong batting line-up. The one disappointment for South Africa will be that Dale Steyn is not available. It has some quality bowlers, but Dales skill and experience in the conditions given two white balls would have been invaluable.
NEW ZEALAND is a team which seems to thrive in tournaments. It is very professional and play a very clinical and basic style of cricket with a really positive mind-set. That has really helped it punch above its weight over the years, carrying it deep into tournaments.
This time I would expect it to be similarly well-organised and well-disciplined, but it also has some world-class players. Its bowling with Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan and Tim Southee is looking pretty potent and the batting is dangerous too with Kane Williamson and Martin Guptill.
This year we also have four Asian teams in the tournament and clearly INDIA is current the pack-leaders in the region. It won in 2013 and it has a team capable of winning this year too. In fact, the team is arguably stronger, better balanced with real firepower in its fast bowling.
Its spinners Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are exceptional in ODI cricket and I am sure Virat Kohli is going to be desperate to bounce-back after a disappointing IPL. The only slight concern I have for India is that its selection was perhaps a little conservative, but it is still very strong.
BANGLADESH is real dark horse. It comes into the tournament with a lot of hope and promise. Under head coach Chandika Hathurasingha, it has made rapid progress in the past two years.
He is fortunate to have a very hungry and talented bunch of players. What you see in Bangladesh right now is a growing confidence and enhanced game-awareness.
It is learning how to win matches and that makes it very dangerous opponents. I am not sure it will go all the way, but I am confident it will cause problems.
SRI LANKA is one of the teams which has a proud tradition of performing well in major tournaments and it will be hoping this year to also punch above its weight.
The team remains young and inexperienced, and this lowers expectations. This I think will help the side, reducing the pressure and tension, which will allow it to go out there and express themselves.
The return of Lasith Malinga for the first time in an ODI since 2015 is going to be a huge boost. He looked like he was getting better and better as the IPL progressed. His partnership with Nuwan Kulasekara, who is skillful and experienced in English conditions, will provide confidence.
The batting unit has settled down a little in recent months and that has been good to see. With Angelo (Mathews) slotting back into the top order after injury, they definitely have the capability to win against anyone if they play an exciting brand of cricket.
Finally, PAKISTAN. Like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, its perhaps not expected to be a contender, but its also true that it appears to be making positive progress under Micky Arthur.
He is developing the game-awareness of players and that makes strong and prodigiously talented players very dangerous. Pakistans strength is its bowling. The pace attack is very threatening and its also has great spin options. The big question will be whether its batting unit is able to consistently fire and be able to chase down big totals.
So, there are eight strong teams in this ICC Champions Trophy and that makes it very difficult to make predictions. I think picking finalists is too tough, but my favourites for the semi-finals would be Australia, England, India and South

Dream on your feet
Clive Barnes in his unique contribution to Thrift Books discusses Ballet as a combined operation of the arts - dancing, music, scenic design, and frequently drama, all have their roles to play. Of these contributory arts dancing is the most amazing counterpart. A kind of ballet can survive without, say, but the idea of a ballet without dancing is unthinkable. Apparently the members of the audience will draw their attention on its performers, the dancers much as the violinist playing a concerts than in the concerto itself.
However the important person concerned in forming the dances is the dance-arranger or the choreographer. The choreographer's task is in some ways comparable to that of a director of a film. And like directors, choreographers frequently receive part of the credit that should more properly belong to their artistic collaborators. Nonetheless the lion's share should go to its choreographer.
The question of what makes for classical mime, one accosts in the older ballet may be of immediate significance. This is a rather stilted though charming, sign-language, earlier adapted from the more naturalistic mime of the Italian tradition.
When the war ended in 1945 the national ballet was in a dangerous predicament. It had certainly survived, it is true. What is more it had achieved a degree of public recognition and critical esteem far beyond what had been given to it in its earlier days. But unfortunately, the position was had to believe. Artistically through no fault of its own. British ballet seemed to be on the decline. The first few months following the end of the war must have been a critical time for British ballet.

Ending the tobacco menace
Tobacco is one of the single biggest causes of death worldwide, at seven million people every year (both primary consumption and passive smoking) and rising. Despite a massive anti-tobacco campaign, cigarette consumption has actually increased in many developing countries. Scientific studies show that there are around 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke; at least 250 are known to cause disease and 51 of them are known to be carcinogenic. They can also be breathed in by anyone who is near a smoker. Among these chemicals are Tar, which has many chemicals which cause cancer, Carbon Monoxide which reduces the amount of oxygen in blood and of course, the highly addictive nicotine itself. Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for cancer, causing 22 per cent of global cancer deaths and 71 per cent of worldwide lung cancer deaths.
Since many of the victims of smoking are productive individuals, tobacco is increasingly being viewed as a disease that can affect a countrys development. Hence the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the theme for World No Tobacco Day (WNTD) which falls today is Tobacco  a threat to development. The campaign launched for WNTD by the WHO and its partners this year is meant to demonstrate the threats that the tobacco industry poses to the sustainable development of all countries, including the health and economic well-being of their citizens. All countries have been encouraged to include tobacco control in their national responses to 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (SDGs).
From his days as Health Minister, President Maithripala Sirisena is in the vanguard of the campaign against tobacco consumption, earning the wrath of multinational tobacco giants in the process. He has initiated several programmes aimed at reducing tobacco consumption. Sri Lanka is one of the few countries where smoking is on the decline, helped no doubt by a very high tax band (73%) on tobacco, which is actually more than WHOs guideline of 70 per cent. Through increasing cigarette taxes worldwide by just US$1, an extra US$ 190 billion could be raised for development projects. High tobacco taxes contribute to revenue generation for governments, reduce demand for tobacco, and offer an important revenue stream to finance development activities.
Higher taxes on tobacco products are certainly effective, but this has also led to more attempts at smuggling tobacco. This adversely affects the Government as well as the smokers. The smugglers naturally do not pay any taxes to the Government and those who smoke these cigarettes (which are cheaper than the legally available cigarettes) face a more severe risk of contracting cancer or other diseases as the illicit manufacturers do not follow the quality control standards followed by the legal manufacturers. The Government must make every effort to crack down on these smugglers at the points of entry.
The Governments moves to introduce plain packaging and graphic warnings and very soon, restrict the sale of loose cigarettes will also help. The latter is very important, because only a very few can afford to spend a minimum of Rs.1,000 on a pack of cigarettes at once. This will automatically reduce tobacco consumption. Sri Lanka can take further cues from the UK and Europe, where even packs containing 10 or 12 cigarettes can no longer be sold. E-cigarettes are just entering the mainstream here, but stricter regulations must be enacted from now onwards. The UK has also banned so-called menthol cigarettes from 2020.
How does tobacco use affect development Tobacco use costs national economies enormously through increased health-care costs and decreased productivity. It worsens health inequalities and exacerbates poverty, as the poorest people spend less on essentials such as food, education and health care. Some 80 percent of premature deaths from tobacco occur in low- or middle-income countries, which face increased challenges to achieving their development goals.
Tobacco growing requires large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, which can be toxic and pollute water supplies. Each year, tobacco growing uses 4.3 million hectares of land, resulting in global deforestation between 2% and 4%. Tobacco manufacturing also produces over two million tonnes of solid waste. Did you know that each year, 4.5 trillion cigarette butts are littered worldwide (by far the most littered item), with a significant percentage finding their way (surprisingly) to the oceans Clearly, tobacco is no longer just a personal or even a simple community health issue. It is a global scourge that also affects sustainability and development. The problem is only likely to get worse, particularly as smoking rates continue to escalate in many low- and middle-income countries.
While the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) guides the global fight against the tobacco epidemic, individual countries have to do more to fight the slick marketing campaigns of the tobacco companies that seek younger consumers. Fortunately, more than half the worlds countries (including Sri Lanka), representing nearly 40% of the worlds population (2.8 billion people), have implemented at least one of the WHO FCTCs most cost-effective measures to the highest level. The Government must thus continue its progressive anti-tobacco measures to rid the country of this socio-economic menace.

FAO calls for putting an end to illegal fishing
We are about to celebrate the first anniversary of the entry into force of the FAO Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA), the worlds first binding international treaty aimed at combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUU Fishing).
This illegal modality accounts for around one-sixth of all fish caught in the oceans, and constitutes a great public danger as it undermines global efforts to make sure that fish  the worlds most produced, consumed and traded animal protein is a sustainable resource for global nutrition and food security, as well as for millions of jobs.
The PSMA, which currently has 46 parties including the European Union, marks a sea change both in its legal form and in its practical potential.
Under its protocol, foreign fishing vessels must show all required operating licences, their activity logs, and submit to inspections of their catch. Port authorities are obliged to deny services to vessels in violation of the rules and to report them to other countries, making it harder for illegal operators to offload and sell the fish they catch elsewhere. FAO, which brokered the treaty, is also delivering other tools to put an end to IUU fishing. It has a new initiative to improve flag-state compliance, a new set of voluntary guidelines on Catch Documentation Schemes  a passport of sorts without which fish can lose access to markets and is in the process on creating a transparent and comprehensive Global Record of Fishing Vessels. All of these instruments complement the PSMA.
It is noteworthy that the new treaty was in fact enhanced and expanded, not watered down, in its journey from draft text to binding law.
That clearly shows how seriously the international community supported a powerful, viable and enduring instrument to end IUU fishing.
The FAO calls upon all nations that have not yet joined the PSMA to become part of it.
As important as it is to make its remit universal, what is more important is making the new rules stick. Implementing the PSMA will require a host of actions, including streamlined cross-border real-time communications systems, national legislative reviews, and skilled inspectors capable of identifying actual fish both by species and likely age, as well as ascertaining whether the gear used to catch them is allowed.
The new rules ultimate strength will be determined by the weakest link, so all countries have a stake in making sure that no member lacks the technical capacity to deliver on treaty obligations. The PSMA explicitly acknowledges that developing countries and small island states may need assistance in carrying out the monitoring, control, surveillance and compliance tasks the treaty requires, and all parties have pledged to provide that assistance.
The FAO is confident that many countries will join the United States of America, Norway and Sweden, which have already confirmed their contribution to this global capacity-building programme.
The FAO is already committing substantial resources of its own to this effort.
Ocean governance is evolving quickly, and FAO has played a central role in steering capture fisheries towards sustainable management.
With the PSMA, the international community has produced a powerful, viable and enduring instrument to serve as a basis for effectively combating illegal fishing.

Farewell rescue warrior
A half-built house, his wife; 36-year-old K. Lakmali and a young son Anursara Lakshan, is what 37-year-old Warrant Officer Senaka Yaparathna of the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) leaves behind.
His home, located almost 2km from the SLAF Trade Training School in Ekala, is surrounded by airmen. They also occupy the cemetery nearby, building an extravagant burial site for their fellow serviceman. As one approaches his house, in Kotugoda, a man known to be humble, friendly and an all-rounder by his family and friends is now a local as well as national hero.
Yaparathna, along with his wife and son moved into the area around four years ago and those who attended his funeral are either relatives from his wifes home town of Nittambuwa or from his own in Dehiattakandiya and his friends and colleagues from the Air Force. He is also graced by a continuous train of politicians from the area and province who flood in to their home, glad to share the limelight of the hero.
The local government authorities have also made arrangements to supply drinking water to his house as the region unlike other parts continues to suffer acute water scarcity.
I did not know he was such a hero, he would only send me pictures when he passed his various training courses. Many politicians have come, they say they did not know that such a hero lived in the Western province, said Chapa Anjali Yaparathna, his 42-yeaar-old elder sister as she greeted guests at the door.
On May 27, Yaparathna helped airlift a stranded woman from the Neluwa area in Galle by suspending himself on a cord hanging from the helicopter; she was rescued but he fell. The late sergeant fell to his death at 25ft from the ground.
Yaparathna who had served the SLAF for the last 17 years, was promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer on May 28 and provided him with a ceremonial burial on Monday (29).
Why did he fall
As disasters plague the country one after another, the SLAF has taken on a major role in rescue operations, otherwise inaccessible to other forces. During the recent floods, the Air Force deployed 13 helicopters and two fixed wing air crafts for flood relief and rescue operations. From Saturday to Monday alone, the pilots had completed 100 flying hours. On Monday, 143 sorties were carried out while 65 were done on Saturday. The Air Force is also providing around 15,000 cooked meal packets per day to flood victims.
Given the flurry of activity along with Yaparathnas death, questions have risen over whether there has been a case of negligence or lack of quality control in equipment used in rescue operations. Sources within the Air Force however revealed that while the same cords and ropes were used continuously in many operations, over the years, there may have been lapses in ensuring that required standards were maintained.
The cable did not break, it was intact- we are not aware conclusively of how it happened, said SLAF Spokesman, Group Captain, Gihan Seneviratne, when questioned on how the accident took place.
Newspaper reports state that the cable he was hoisted on brought the woman back up and then he fell, when it was sent back to rescue him. Another person was sent using the same cable to rescue others too, there is no problem with the cable, stressed the SLAF Spokesman further.
He assured that there would be an investigation to find out what really happened.
We have never claimed that the cable had broken and until such time the investigation report is out, we dont want to cast aspersions at him or the Air force, said the Group Captain. He observed that it was an inherently dangerous job and added, These things can happen, we are aware of the danger and we take precautions but at the end of the day we need to get the job done. Yaparathna too was aware of the danger and responsibility of his task. His brother, Shan Yaparathna, 41, recalled that he was always the first to volunteer for any fire and rescue operation. He proudly explained that even the Air Force Commander had noted that his brother had an exemplary service record.
He was on leave on that day and had to go for a wedding, but he cancelled all plans and said he had to go to Galle to save people from the floods, said Shan. He has been involved in rescue operations for some time, he was also in the Iranamadu camp and at Batticaloa during the war. Since then, he has got involved in almost every rescue operation from building collapses to landslides, he added.
His aunt, Nandani Tennekoon remarked that they hardly used to see him around as he was very committed to his work. The last time we visited, he was involved in rescue operations in Meethotamulla, she said.
We have served in the Air Force together for the last 12 years, he was a great all-rounder. He has been training in rescue operations for the last 10-12 years, said Sanjeewa Attapattu, 38, his colleague and brother-in-law.
Yaparathna, who enlisted in the in the Air Force on January 19, 2001, received his basic training at CTS Diyathalawa and advance training at SLAF, TTS Ekala. He has served at the SLAF Base Katunayaka, SLAF Base Anuradhapura, SLAF Base Rathmalana, SLAF Station Colombo, SLAF Station Batticaloa, SLAF Station Iranamadu and SLAF Trade Training School, as a reputed fire and rescue operator.
His training included the basic RED course, Air rescue course, Bronto Skylift course, fire all-round driver and Air Field driving. Hence it seems unlikely that he would be careless in his operations.
As the floods continue, the SLAF had its second mishap with a SLAF Mi 17 Helicopter crash landing in Baddegama when delivering food items. A technical fault in the aircraft has been cited as the main reason for the crash. No casualties were reported.
We are not sure what caused the crash but there will be an investigation. We know that there was a technical fault in the helicopter, the pilot had sounded the emergency and fortunately it was flying low as it was approaching Baddegama. The ground condition was not that good so all he saw was water, not an ideal condition for landing, which caused some damage to the air craft. Dont know what happened, explained Group Captain Seneviratne.
He reiterated that all air crafts underwent stringent tests every day before they were flown and that this was unexpected.
A heros death
Back in Kotugoda, Yaparathnas family is preparing to say their farewells. His father, can barely walk and sits in almost a trance as he said that he found solace in the fact that his son died a hero.
My son has been immortalized in our countrys history as one who sacrificed his life to save others. He is a brave man, and that is how I pacify my heart, said the former forest officer turned farmer.
I got him educated at two schools, first in the Dehiattakandiya Sooriyapperuma School and then I sent him to the Asgiri Maha Pirivena. He got to a good place through his grades.
His first duty was for me, he told me that he would build me a house so that we will have a proper place to have a funeral. But, I am here for his, said Senior Yaparathna close to tears.
Chapa who looked after her two younger brothers, Shan and Senaka after their mothers demise when the latter was one and a half years old, too is coming to peace with the fact that her brother died a martyr.
I am proud of him but this is too much to bear, she said and added that it was she who filled out the application for him to join the Air Force. He was chosen to study in the Science stream at university, but he said he could not wait too long for the results, so I was the one who asked him to apply to the Air Force and sent in the application, said Chapa as she turned to tell Senakas story once again to a new group of visitors.
S. Diyagahage
The son from the Air Force came down from the helicopter and threw a rope towards me. Then he got me on something like a boat and rescued me. I did not know that he fell while trying to rescue me. I got to know that the son who rescued me had fallen and died after I came to hospital, said A.D. Gnanawathi who is currently receiving treatment at the Karapitiya Teaching hospital. She was gravely injured when the Neluwa Duwili Ella Tea Factory canteen collapsed due to the recent heavy rains. At around 12 am, our bosses came and informed us that there were landslides on the mountain next to us and that we should evacuate immediately. As they said that, the mountain collapsed all at once. We did not even have time to run. Two of us got trapped in a room at the front. They tried to rescue us but failed to do so. As the heavy rains continued, we were soaked to the bone by it and we lay there till morning.
Around 6.30 am we were rescued. My legs were trapped underneath a block of concrete so they could not take me out of there, she recalled.
It is then that they came in the helicopter and threw a rope to me.
I was then taken by a boat. I did not know that the boy who rescued me, fell. I am heartbroken by this news, it is hard for me to bear, added Gnanawathi as she recovers from her injuries. The collapse of the Duwili Ella Tea Factory due to a landslide killed eight people. Gnanawathi and one other woman are its sole survivors.

Flood damaged houses to get upto Rs 2.5 mn
The government has decided to grant a compensation upto a maximum of Rs. 2.5 million per each house destroyed in the adverse weather conditions, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said.
The deaths will receive a compensation of Rs. 100,000 per each individual, Senaratne said.
Meanwhile, the number of deaths has been increased to 193 and disappearances have gone upto 94, Disaster Management acting Minister Dunesh Gankanda said. The displaced families amounts to a 149,678, he said. A total of 383 relief camps have been established. 1,326 houses are fully damaged and 6,979 houses are partially damaged, Gankanda said.
Minister Senaratne speaking at a media briefing held at the Disaster Management Ministry said the government insurance scheme that covers all the houses in the country, has enabled such compensation to be allocated.
All unauthorised constructions will be removed and the illegal dwellers will be moved to alternative residences.
Changes have also been made to the financial allocations made for dry rations given for the affected families, he also said. Accordingly, the government has allocated Rs. 1800 for a family of four per a day. The allocation for each meal prepared for a displaced, have been increased to a Rs.300 as well.
Compensation programs are currently being prepared to aid small and medium scale tea estates that got caught in landslides, Minister Senaratne also pointed out. The government will take necessary steps to increase the compensation package in due time, as there is a considerable inflow of foreign aid as well.

## Title: Flooded with woes

Flooded with woes
The massive downpour and the subsequent floods experienced especially in the districts of Ratnapura, Kalutara, Matara, Galle and Hambantota dominated the TV and newspaper headlines last week. The floods have so far claimed more than 180 lives with 112 missing and 557,500 people displaced. Only the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami had claimed more lives and displaced more people. The floods that occurred in recent years did not claim so many lives.
Two words could summarise this huge tragedy: Disaster Unpreparedness. There have been many allegations in the media and by the affected people that the responsible agencies were either not aware of the magnitude of the looming rains or ignored the warning signs. In fact, nearly all the agencies dealing with disaster preparedness were caught unawares as the catastrophe unfolded. A visibly angry Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at an especially convened meeting at Temple Trees did not mince his words when he blamed the responsible agencies for failing to inform each other and coordinate the response to the situation. This institutional failure must be remedied with immediate effect because we seem to be prone to natural disasters with alarming regularity.
Although Sri Lanka has been having a Disaster Management Centre (DMC) for several years, what is worrying is the lack of a long-term plan for disaster preparedness and mitigation. Instead, ad-hoc measures are adopted every time a disaster occurs, be it floods, landslides or even the recent collapse of a garbage mound in Meethotamulla. This response is usually chaotic and does not serve the victims very well. This time, the DMC and other agencies were totally unprepared for the events that took place. On Saturday when others perused the essential items list in the disaster preparedness agencies it indicated ZERO. There was nobody to take responsibility for this huge mistake. The lack of coordination and a huge communications gap prevailed. The Prime Minister pinpointed that there was a huge communication gap among the Government agencies.
The Government agencies even said that landslides occurred in areas where they never expected.
This is an irresponsible statement by the disaster preparedness agencies including the National Building Research Organization (NBRO). They should constantly check for developments in the landslide map and take precautions where necessary. In Sri Lanka, we are generally wise after an event, not before it. This trend should be changed at least now.
For starters, they all knew that a very long drought usually culminates in a massive downpour for which you have to be prepared. They could have used army camps and other Security Forces installations spread throughout the country to store essentials and even boats. That is what neighbouring India does and India responded to our call very fast since they had supplies in the Tuticorin Naval base and rapid deployment was possible. So far, a couple of Indian ships have arrived here with supplies.
A longterm plan and national policy for disaster preparedness and mitigation must be formulated even at this late stage. It should cover everything from food preparation to the temporary shelter for the victims, leading up to resettlement and reconstruction. The proper roles of all the agencies should be clearly spelt out and the roles that can be played by the Security Forces, the private sector, NGOs and the public should also be taken into account. There is now a tendency to pass on all aspects of the search and rescue effort to the Security Forces and the Police. This should not be the case. Civilian agencies must necessarily be involved.
Proper disaster management plan
Among the agencies that must be included in a proper disaster management plan (not in any particular order) are the DMC, NBRO, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, Coastal Conservation Department, Marine Pollution Prevention Authority, Urban Development Authority, Highways Ministry and Road Development Authority, Health Ministry, Education Ministry, Met Department, Security Forces and Police, Provincial Councils and Local Bodies, Divisional Secretariats, Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the SLTB and Railways Department (this list is not exhaustive).
It should be a holistic approach to every type of disaster imaginable including earthquakes. Experts are of the opinion that an even an earthquake could occur around Sri Lanka due to recent geological phenomena. Floods and droughts are occurring more frequently in our part of the world due to the phenomenon of global warming. Indeed, man is responsible for the fallout of damaging the natural environment. Deforestation, soil erosion, excessive fuel consumption, indiscriminate waste disposal, unauthorised constructions on water retention and landslide-prone areas and other such aberrations take a heavy toll on the environment. There could be more floods in flood prone areas and a prolonged drought in drought-prone areas. This was quite apparent when floods were experienced in one area but the effects of the drought continued in other areas such as the North Central Province (NCP) with little or no rain.
The problem with the Sri Lankan psyche is that we come up with grand designs which often fall by the wayside after a few months. We will forget even this flood in two weeks and wake up only when another flood strikes next year or year after next. The USAID some time back gave a proposal to set up a rapid response team but this seems to have gone into cold storage in some obscure place. A disaster management centre was to be established in Katunayake close to the BIA but after having done all architectural designs it remains a mere proposal. These are shortcomings that have to be addressed urgently.
Things get even worse when Government agencies act on false information or act on their own without getting the correct facts. In one instance, the Police jumped the gun in Bandaragama and Wadduwa areas alerting the people of a major bund burst in the vicinity but it was found to be a false alarm. The Government together with telecom firms developed a rapid SMS alert system following the tsunami, which could be extended to other disaster types and perhaps targeted at subscribers in certain stipulated areas. The public will then have confidence that it is a verified warning or alert. We are a very politically active nation and we tend to blame the Government for everything, the weather included. While the Government cannot indeed do anything about the fury of nature which is unleashed from to time, it can take certain steps to prepare for and in the aftermath of a disaster. This is what the Premier insisted on at the meeting in Temple Trees, where he exhorted Ministers and MPs from the flood affected areas to be in their respective electorates/districts at this time. The only exception was granted to Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa (who was in Mexico attending a conference) and Acting Minister Dunesh Gankanda who have to coordinate relief efforts from the DMC in Colombo. This is seen as a very good move since there have been many public complaints that Ministers and MPs rarely visit their electorates even in a normal situation. Some have not visited their hometowns for months. (It is a mystery as to where they go because many seats in Parliament are also empty on any given sitting day). It is hoped that the flood will motivate them to visit their respective areas for relief work.
The Cabinet of Ministers decided to stop the importation of vehicles for ministries and ministers this year, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday. This was also confirmed by Minister Harin Fernando via his Twitter feed.
The Government faced criticism from the media and the Opposition earlier for deciding to import a number of new vehicles for certain ministers and ministries.
Minister Fernandos Twitter post said in the aftermath of the flood devastation, the Cabinet has decided to cancel all vehicle imports for Ministries this year. Samarasinghe said the President had directed that funds allocated to purchase the vehicles be used to provide relief for the flood victims. Ministers will be requested to use the vehicles they already have.
A supplementary estimate to seek Parliaments approval to get Rs.360 million to purchase vehicles for some ministers and renovate the official residences of several other ministers was presented last week.
New Cabinet Ministers
Most other political developments took a backseat during the past week as the country grappled with the floods. Most of the newly appointed Cabinet Ministers began work without much fanfare, given the flood situation. The focus was very much on the two swapped ministries  Foreign and Finance. Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, in an interview with our sister newspaper
The Sunday Observer, blamed two unnamed officials for his ousting from the Finance Ministry. However, he said he would be committed 100 percent to his new job, paying more attention to trade and commercial diplomacy, which would be more familiar for him to start with. It appears that he will retain control of the two lotteries boards and a few other institutions from his old ministry. This is a unique situation and there were reports that several other ministers have requested similar arrangements which have apparently been shot down by the President and the Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, at the Finance Ministry, Minister Mangala Samaraweera also faces a steep learning curve and has only around six months to formulate Budget 2018, which is a daunting task for even an experienced Finance Minister, leave alone someone completely new to the job. Again, his experience as Foreign Minister should come in handy, as Finance is now very much an internationalised subject given the closer global economic integration.
The One Belt One Road (OBOR) project is one such initiative that seeks to bring the world closer together. Spearheaded by China, the project will basically more closely connect Europe and Asia by land and sea. Sri Lanka features prominently in OBOR maps. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who led the Sri Lankan delegation to the recently concluded OBOR Summit in Beijing, forwarded a Cabinet paper on the same. Leaders from countries such as Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Argentina, Belarus, Chile, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Turkey, Vietnam, Cambodia, Fiji, Hungary, Italy, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Poland were present at this discussion.
According to cabinet paper presented by the Premier, excerpts from the Joint Communiqu issued by the leaders are as follows:
a) Pursuing dialogue and consultation in order to build synergies in development strategies among participating countries, noting the efforts to strengthen cooperation in coordinating the development of the Belt and Road initiative with other plans and initiatives and to promote partnerships among Europe; Asia, South America, Africa and other regions.
b) Conducting in-depth consultation on macroeconomic issues by optimising the existing multilateral and bilateral cooperation and dialogue mechanisms, so as to provide a robust policy support for practical cooperation and the implementation of major projects.
c) Strengthening cooperation on innovation, by supporting innovation action plans for e-commerce, digital economy, smart cities and science and technology parks, and by encouraging greater exchanges on innovation and business start-up models in the Internet age in respect of intellectual property rights.
d) Promoting practical cooperation on roads, railways, ports, maritime and inland water transport, aviation, energy pipelines, electricity, fibre optic including trans-oceanic cable, telecommunications and information and communication technology.
e) Promoting public-private partnership in areas that create more jobs and generate greater efficiency; welcoming international financial institutions to increase support and investment for infrastructure development.
f) Deepening economic and trade cooperation; promoting trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation; enabling the general public to benefit from trade
g) Expanding trade by nurturing new areas of trade growth, promoting trade balance and promoting e-commerce and the digital economy, welcoming the development of free trade areas and signing of free trade agreements by interested countries.
h) Advancing of global value chains development and supply chain connectivity.
i) Enhancing cooperation in the protection of the environment, biodiversity and natural resources, addressing the adverse impacts of climate change, advancing of renewable energy and energy efficiency.
j) Enhancing customs cooperation with a view to costs.
k) Jointly working on a long-term, stable and financial infrastructure and connectivity to facilitating trade including by harmonising the sustainable financing system
L) Encouraging dialogues among civilisations, cultural exchanges, promoting tourism and protecting the worlds cultural and natural heritage.
This understanding would result in synergizing connectivity of development policies- and strategies, deepening project cooperation for infrastructure connectivity, expanding industrial investments and enhancing the financial cooperation and financial connectivity among the countries which are part of the roundtable discussion.
OBOR also ties in perfectly with the Colombo International Financial City (Port City) and the Western Province Megapolis plan which aim to develop the Western region. Sri Lankans must give up their island mentality in order to get ahead. Closer integration with the world economy is essential for this to happen. Both Colombo and Hambantota Ports are essential cogs in the OBOR wheel.
Incidentally, new Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has vowed to restore the former glory of the Colombo Port which has the potential to become one of the top 10 ports in the world (Present ranking 23). Finance, Foreign and Ports Ministries will have to work together to make Sri Lanka an even bigger hub for world trade.

The work on phase one of the southern railway extension came to a sudden stop due to the heavy deluge that inundated the Matara district last Thursday and Friday.
Most of the base camps established by China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) were submerged and the staff had to be evacuated.
The flood waters have caused considerable damage to machinery, equipment and our camp sites, said CMCs HSE Manager Gu Feng. We did not have prior warning and had to evacuate our staff when the water level kept on rising. We are lucky that none of our staff were injured.
Work on the project was stopped, but we have resumed work where ever possible. Earth work cannot commence until the rain stops and the ground dries up, Feng added
CMCs machinery was deployed to clear road ways and drains and even private compounds that were affected to the flood waters. As the flood water is receding, we are in the process of cleaning up, he added.

Gnanasara Thera absent in Court today

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera was not present in Court today regarding a Contempt of Court action filed against him for allegedly behaving offensively inside the Homagama Magistrates Court.
President's Counsel Manohara de Silva appearing on behalf of Gnanasara thera tendered a medical certificate to Court informing that Gnanasara Thera is receiving treatment at a hospital for an illness.
 The Court of Appeal Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe observed that the Court wanted the accused to be present in Court on June 12.
 This case is to be taken up for argument before two-judge-bench comprising Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena on next hearing date.
 At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
 Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
 At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
 At another occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
 In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
 Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
 Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appeared for the Attorney General.

Govt loses Rs 42 bn in smoking related health spending
Today is World No Tobacco Day (May 31). Annually around 25,000 Sri Lankans die due to smoking and related health issues.
Sri Lanka was the first Asian country and the fourth country in the world to ratify WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).
According to Health Ministry sources, the Sri Lankan Government receives Rs. 100 billion as tax from tobacco but spends Rs 142 billion to treat people who fall sick with Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs).
The loss is Rs. 42 billion. In Sri Lanka 24 percent of men and 2.3 percent of women smoke. Bhutan is the least smoking country in the region and Sri Lanka comes second. Sri Lankan schoolchildren experiment to smoke between age 13 and 18. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has presented a cabinet paper to ban cigarette sales within a radius of 500 meters from a school, sources said.
Another cabinet paper had been submitted to ban the sale of cigarettes in loose form. Plain packaging will be introduced for cigarette packets soon, the sources added.

Grace under pressure
S. Thomas has bred a leader of men in the form of Head Prefect Sebastian Sansoni. A resourceful young man, Sansoni rose up through the ranks to where he is now, the Head Boy of STC. Perfect Prefect features Sebastian Sansoni, who leads by example having learnt the art of handling pressure.
Currently I am the President of the Drama Society. I am the Senior Editor of the College Magazine and Captain of the Debating Team in College. I played Tennis until last year. I was captain for two years. The leadership qualities a Head Prefect should possess, in terms of leadership, is to be exemplary in leadership. There are many qualities a leader should have but to name a few, one is being able to make proper decisions. You should be able to lead those around you and inspire them towards a common goal so they can work towards that, said Sansoni.
Deal with difference
The pressure can make you break. But some people do not break under pressure. Some people grow out of pressure.
It is also being able to handle pressure and being able to deal with different people because as the Head Prefect of the school no student is going to be the same. So you have to know how to deal with different types of students and handle the mix that schools always have, explained Sansoni.
Sansoni has not forgotten the underlying values in his life and the person he was.
Also in terms of terms of leadership, it is important to stay true to who you are, the person that you were who got you to this post. It is important to keep the values that the school has ingrained in you throughout the years and keep those values as a leader. Because as the Head Prefect you are the embodiment of what the school stands for. You should represent the values that the school has imparted in you, then that will make you a good leader, pointed out Sansoni.
The Head Prefect is appointed by the Warden who considers all aspects of ones performance and personality.
Extracurricular activities
You cannot write the criteria on a piece of paper and then select the Head Boy. It depends on his personality, it depends on his character and of course, your achievements do play a part in your school with the leadership qualities you possess. You have to be well disciplined and you need to do well in school academically as well as extracurricular activities. Those aspects determine your capacity. But mainly it is your personality and what you show to be a good leader, added Sansoni.
Of course, before being appointed the Head Prefect, the boys are school prefects for a good six months.
So as a school prefect you get to show your quality, exhibit your leadership qualities and the calibre you stand for, stated Sansoni
The post of Head Prefect carries with it a lot of duties and responsibilities.
My primary responsibility as a Head Prefect has been maintaining discipline. I feel it starts from the prefects and then spreads to everyone in the school. I think that is important because that is why the prefect system was established - to maintain discipline. But it is also very important as the Head Prefect to guide the students and mould them to becoming better people. That is something I have seen in the prefects before me who represented everything that a student would want to be. They inspired the students to aspire to the better angels of their nature. It is a duty that we do undertake and we take this seriously. It is a great privilege for us, I and my fellow prefects, to get to be the leaders of the school and take the school in the direction we feel is best. It is our duty to be committed and loyal to the school, elucidated Sansoni.
Having a prefect body in a school is good for many reasons.
In terms of discipline, they are very good at handling it, because at the end of the day they are students as well. They have gone through the system and they know how to system works. They know how to deal with people around their age. Further, I believe it is good because it is important to have student mentors. Being a prefect means many things. It is a prestigious post, an important appointment and it is a privilege because it is given to only a few students in the college. It is relevant because other students look up to us and want to be like us. We love the school because the school has done so much for us. So we want to give back to our school. You can serve the college and help college maintain those great standards and values, informed Sansoni.
One important skill Sansoni has learnt is how to balance his obligations.
Prioritisation
Having to balance school work and extra-curricular activities and my obligations as a Head Prefect, it is difficult as currently, I am in charge of three extra-curricular activities. It is very tough, but in a way it can help you move forward, demonstrating that balance is always going to be a part of life. School level is the time when you are young enough and have the energy and capability to handle all of that. At this age I can do the most I can do and make the most of myself. That is something you tell yourself all the time and it motivates you and helps you to keep that balance. Finding time is difficult so you have to make the sacrifices as well, explained Sansoni.
Prioritisation is a necessity of the post.
You also get to prioritise, and in doing so you get to sacrifice things that are not that important like watching TV. So being committed to what you are doing is a good thing. You have to know that your goals are important. And you suddenly start to realise that this will help you at some point in your life. Also, I feel that it is always good to test your limits. If you dont give it a shot you never know what you are going to be and what you have within you. And then you actually discover hidden talents, shared Sansoni.
STC has always been a school of gentlemen.
At S. Thomas we have always been taught how to be a gentleman. It has always been very much part of the culture of our school. We have been shown why it is important to be a gentleman. Good principles are the foundation of this college. So we learn how to treat each other, said Sansoni.
The advice Sansoni gives to any boy who wants to take up a leadership role at STC is to trust oneself and the person that he is.
Correct attitude
At that time, you are given the role because of the person that you are. Mistakes may happen, but you need to rise above them and rise up to the challenge of being a leader. You are doing this because you are serving the college and serving the student population. If your mind is focused on that goal, then that is the correct attitude, said Sansoni.
One of the best parts of being a prefect is the support he gets from his school mates.
I get to share a very special bond with my friends who are prefects. You can have a normal friendship but once you are a prefect there is a special bond created with the other prefects. They do what I ask them because it is my vision and because they understand that they need to give their support to me. That respect is there because of their fidelity to me. That is the most rewarding aspect of being a Head Prefect, enthused Sansoni.
Sansoni owes a lot to his family.
They gave me the space to do what I wanted to do. They gave me that freedom to do what I wanted to do. They gave me that independence. They never interfered or were too pushy. Whenever I have needed them, and there have been struggles, they have always been there. They have always been supportive. They realised that when I was appointed they needed to be more supportive. I really appreciate that, and I owe a lot to them. I have four sisters and they have always taught me the difference between right and wrong. They have always been helpful and I could always talk to them if I have a personal issue, explained Sansoni.
Currently, Sansoni is concentrating on his studies to get into a good foreign university.
The teaching faculty have been very supportive and moulded me to be the person I am today, in my studies and my extra-curricular activities. They have been a huge influence in imparting values to me and my fellow brethren. I would not have been here without them. I enjoy learning a lot and am excited about the prospect of discovering where I can go and what type of career or profession suits me, summed up Sansoni.

He pierced deep into expression
It was quite unbelievable for us to hear the demise of Professor Siri Gunasinghe (1925  2017). We who used to be intimate with him feel that he is still around us, shuttling from Victoria in Canada to Atulkotte, Adikaram Place in Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte. He used to come from Canada at least once or twice a year to stay with his brother in Sri Lanka, Dharma Gunasinghe, the former Principal of Nalanda Vidyalaya, Colombo.
Siri Gunasinghe, our friend, teacher, and literary activist, I feel, had ushered in a new thinking vision in almost all the segments connected to arts and culture. My mind goes as far back as the late 1950s when he was a Sanskrit lecturer attached tot eh tutorial staff of the University of Peradeniya. Though he was a lecturer in Sanskrit, he was more known as a poet, an artist and a literary critic. He was more of an unconventional person who drew the attention of a free verse genre, where the peak achievement he showed to the local readership by his collection of poems titled as Mas Le Neti Ata (Bones sans blood and flesh).
This free verse collection drew the attention of many a scholar as a tour de force as well as a turning point in Sinhala poetic structure, poetic vision and experience.
The free verse genre which he denotes as Nisandas happened to be a controversial topic as it was pointed out by no other person than Professor Senarat Paranavitana that a type of free verse known as Mukthaka Kavi has already been there prior to this tradition. But Siri Gunasinghe who was more vibrant in his views penned that free verse is not only free in structure but also should be free willed.
Followed by the success and controversies woven around the creative debut, Siri Gunasinghe brought out two more poetic works: Abinikmana and Ratu Kekula. In most discussions that ensued with him, both in literary seminars and broadcasts, he pointed out the broad vision of breaking the narrow barriers of traditional patterns of literary creative methods. This enhanced him in the creation of his first Sinhala novel, Hevanella, which was later translated into English as The Shadow by his wife, Hemamali Gunasinghe.
This novel received attention on two counts. The creation centred around a character named Jinadasa, resembling the character of Stephen Dedalus in James Joyces novel, A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, was more introspective than a tradition-bound narrative. This offbeat mode of writing transcended the mere plotting of a story. Then comes the literary technique in which it was written like Joyce and Virginia Woolf, Siri Gunasinghe adopted his own technique of the stream of consciousness where he excelled.
Hevanella drew the attention of most budding young creative writers who believed that Gunasinghe had paved the real track for their creative format and expression. Coming on to his research, one could find at least 50 learned articles written by him to journals of varying types at home as well as abroad.
To the well-known journal a the turn of the century, he wrote an eye-opening research article titled as Sinhala Contributions to the Buddha Statue. Gunasinghe drew attention to the gradually waning murals of most temples.
He in association with the late painter and scholar L T P Manju Sri tried the best to restore the temple murals. Manju Sri, a close relation of mine, once revealed that Gunasinghe is one of the few who knew the value of the ancient temples and other murals in various places in the country. His mainstay in research happened to be Sigiriya.
About Sigiriya, he brought out an outstanding work several years before his demise.
This work published in Sinhala and later translated into English was known to the reader as Sigiriya: Kashyapage Saundarya Pranamaya (2010). The English one was known as Kassapas Homage to Beauty (2008). These two contributions happened to be his most prestigious gifts to the reader.
Siri Gunasinghes enthusiasm in the cinema was unabating. From the late fifties until her departure to Canada he was interested in the creative aspects of cinematography. As a result, he had the chance of creating the trendsetting Sinhala film Sath Samudura in 1965, produced by Linus Disanayaka.
Those who assisted in the creative process included stalwarts such as Mahagama Sekera, D B Nihalsinghe, Wasantha Obeysekara, W D Amaradeva and Somadasa Alvitigala. They are no more. Denawaka Hamine, Edmund Wijesinha, Cyril Wickramage, Leena de Silva were some of the leading players identified with Sath Samudura. Once Gunasinghe said that he was inspired initially by an Irish play, Riders to the Sea written by John Millington Synge. Gunasinghe happened to know at least six languages: Pali, Sanskrit, French, English, Hindi and Sinhala. But he was outspoken enough to say that it is not the strict use of conventional grammar that matters but the flexibility in expression.
In a series of radio broadcasts during the mid-60s, he pressed this view. The radio talks were later compiled into a collection of essays titled as Chiranthana Sahitya Saha Kala. From time to time, he used to bring back to our mind what has been forgotten in order to kindle our interest in all creative moods.
I go down the memory lane, as far back as the early sixties. I had an assignment with the Arts Council of the then Cultural Affairs Ministry. I was commissioned to translate the UNESCOs publication of J M L Peters Teaching about the Film. I was in need of help from Professor Siri Gunasinghe who lived at the time in the Mahakande of Peradeniya campus. We sat around 6 pm and went on till 8 pm at a stretch.
But I found it difficult to finish my translation as it consumed time. Even later on we used to sit together but failed to fulfil the task. I learnt a lot from the professor for which I am grateful.
I cease to believe that he is no more.

Hold on, pain ends!
What happens when it hurts too much to live Can it really be too painful for someone to live one more moment with emptiness, depression, and despair Yes, for some people suicide seems like the only way out.
The rationale behind suicide, which is defined as the intentional taking of one's own life, can be as simple or as complex as life itself. The person who commits suicide may see his or her actions as some sort of solution to a severe physical or psychological dilemma. Many people each day walk the pavements of life with enormous amounts of emotional pain. Living is difficult when you lose the one you love, your job, feel backed into a corner or entangled in financial constraints. Some will say there is no reason to live after the spouse has died when there is no way out of the financial troubles, no more purpose of living after serious injury or illness. This thinking can trap a person into a narrow chute, seeing their demise as the only reasonable choice.
But not everyone contemplates suicide. Some may hold on to strong religious beliefs that prevent them from ever taking such action. Others hold on to an important value in life which gives them hope and help them seek another way. People with good emotional health are in control of their behaviour and their emotions.
Challenges of life
Emotionally healthy people are more than capable of handling the challenges of life. They are more able to cope with difficult situations in life, bounce back and move on. However, not all of us are blessed with good emotional health and sadly many people do consider thoughts about ending their life. Wanting to die is not enough to trigger suicide. To end their own lives, humans need the guts and the means to carry out their plans. Every person who contemplates killing themselves is not truly interested in ending their time on earth. For many, suicidal thoughts are about escape. It is merely the idea of leaving the bonds that bind them to other people, responsibilities, burdens and the despair of what they cant change. Sumithrayo, a government approved charity organisation, is taking untiring efforts to alleviate human misery, loneliness, despair and depression and thereby prevent suicide in Sri Lanka.
Global suicide rate
Suicide is a complex problem for which there is no single cause or single reason. It results from a complex interaction of biological, genetic, psychological, social, cultural and environmental factors. It has no racial or class distinctions and suicidal thoughts have no holidays. They can occur anytime, Jomo Udaman, Trainer and represent of the Council of Management, Sumithrayo said.
A person who is suicidal feels isolated and alone with his or her problem. At times like this talking about their stressful situation with a non-judgemental, accepting, understanding and caring person can throw a different light on the situation and help diffuse the suicidal impulse.
People faced with an emotional crisis mostly require informal and confidential emotional support. A friend, who has the time to listen, does not advice or criticise but helps the person to come to terms with the situation and feel confident to cope with it, he added.
Sumithrayo, founded by Joan De Mel in 1974 is at present housed at Horton place, Colombo 07. The organisation was incorporated by Act of Parliament No.10 of 1986. Sumithrayo shares the same vision as Samaritans of UK and Ireland and as a member of Befrienders Worldwide, the international arm of the Samaritans, follow the same principles and practices.
There are about 100 volunteers in our organisation. The volunteer service is available 365 days of the year to provide confidential emotional support for people who are experiencing, feelings of distress or despair, including those that may lead to suicide. A better network of a support system should be established to prevent suicide, Uduman said.
Uduman highlighted that Sumithrayo has been at the forefront of suicide prevention. This is a free and confidential service. We are open from 9 am to 8 pm every day of the year. Anyone who needs their support can call 2692909, 2683555, 2696666 or visit us at 60B Horton Place Colombo 7 or email: [emailprotected]. People of all ages seek to befriend from us for concerns that include marital, family, domestic violence, sexual abuse and harassment, relationship issues, mental health, grief, loneliness and low self- esteem, he said.
Instead of sympathising, we empathise with their shame, anger, embarrassment, guilt or rejection. Attempting Suicide is never the result of a single factor or event and is likely to have several inter-related and complex causes. The single factor or event like a scolding or a broken relationship is the trigger that causes unbearable pain coupled with the inability to cope leads to suicide, Uduman added.
Suicide in Sri Lanka
According to global statistics of the World Health Organisation, one person commits suicide every 40 seconds (16 per 100,000 population). The projected global suicide rate for the year 2020 is one in every 20 seconds. Suicide is now among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15 to 44 years. More males commit suicide while more females attempt.
At an average, 12 persons commit suicide in Sri Lanka every day. Whilst suicide is rapidly increasing around the world, the suicide rate has greatly reduced from an alarmingly high rate of 47 per 100,000 population in 1995 to a rate of 16 (police statistics 2010) in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka had the worlds highest rate of suicides in 1995. Although the number has reduced gradually, the number of attempts which is 10 to 20 times more is steadily on the rise. This clearly indicates that there is still an acute national need to help those who need emotional support. Death by suicide is more common in the rural areas where agricultural chemicals are readily available, despite great attempts made with respect to use of less toxic chemicals and safe storage, Manisha Wickramanayake, Trainer/representative of Management Council, Sumithrayo said.
Young adults and the elderly are the most vulnerable in our society. Poor coping or decision-making skills and the absence of a support system is one important factor that leads to suicide. In 1996 when the special Presidential Task Force set up the National Policy on suicide prevention, it was recognised that mental illness, alcohol and drug use, poor coping skills, are all contributory factors that lead people towards suicide in Sri Lanka. Services are therefore targeted towards helping people who fall into these categories, she added.
Media coverage of suicide
Reporting of suicide on media at times promotes suicide. Dramatic coverage on suicide stimulates the vulnerable readers and we are unconsciously promoting suicide. Thus the coverage should include stories of hope and recovery, information on how to overcome suicidal thinking and increase coping skills, Surangi Gunawardane, Trainer/ representative of Sumithrayo Management said.
The potential for online reports, photos/videos, and stories to go viral makes it vital that online coverage of suicide follow site or industry safety recommendations. Social networking sites often become memorials to the deceased and should be monitored for hurtful comments and for statements that others are considering suicide. Message board guidelines, policies, and procedures could support the removal of inappropriate and/or insensitive posts.
We are currently tackling Facebook, Internet and other social media sites. People get involved in these when they are isolated. We hope to reach out the young generation in this regard, Gunawardane said.
The stories of suicide might have an effect on vulnerable individuals or people connected to the person who has died. Providing information on how to contact appropriate local and national sources of support can encourage people experiencing emotional problems or suicidal thoughts to seek help which in turn can save lives.
Details of suicide methods have been shown to prompt vulnerable individuals to imitate suicidal behaviour. Thus care should be taken when giving any detail of a suicide method. Reporting on suicide methods may also drive people to the internet to search for more information and vulnerable individuals may identify with a person who has died, or with the circumstances in which a person took his or her own life. It is also important not to brush over the complex realities of suicide and its devastating impact on those left behind.
Reporting suicide as a tragic waste is more beneficial in preventing further deaths. A sensitive story that explores the emotional devastation of a suicide on family and friends may prompt people with suicidal thoughts to reconsider or to seek help thus further curbing the rate of suicide in our society.

How to clean your well after floods
The flood-affected and contaminated wells can be re-used after cleaning. The wells can be cleaned by following the instructions issued by the <U+200B>Public Health Officer / MOH etc of the relevant area.<U+200B><U+200B> <U+200B>Further details<U+200B>, instructions and required chemicals<U+200B> <U+200B>can be obtained <U+200B>from those officials, Health Ministry sources<U+200B> said.
According to the sources, the PHI or MOH of the relevant area should be consulted before starting to clean the well. The well should be emptied using a motor or manual mechanism. Inside walls of the well should be thoroughly cleaned using a brush. Then let the well fill with natural water. After filling the well, a fresh water bucket should be taken from the cleaned well. Then two table spoons of TCL powder obtained from the PHI or MOH of the area should be thoroughly mixed in the water bucket. The bucket with the mixture should be put into the well carefully using a tug. The bucket should be moved inside the well water up and down several times in order to mix the mixture with the well water, the sources said.
The well water can be used after 30 minutes of this process. Mixing TCL powder with well water (as described above) should be done three times a day. One tablet of chlorine should be used for five litres of tap water if people cannot assure the cleanliness of tap water they consume, the sources added.

Huawei ELTE SafeCity wins CCW2017 Future Technology Award
Huawei's eLTE SafeCity solution won the Future Technology Award at Critical Communications World 2017 which was presented by TCCA (TETRA and Critical Communications Association).
This honor recognizes Huawei's technical leadership and contribution to continued innovation in the area of critical communications.
Established in 1994, TCCA is the world's foremost authoritative organization in the field of critical communication. Today, the TCCA continues to support and promote the use of trunking communications technologies and is stimulating industrial synergy in the development of future mobile broadband capability for both users and providers of critical communications.
Traditional narrow-band communication networks, which support only basic voice services, cannot satisfy today's emergency networks' demands for mobile policing, multi-services, all-round monitoring, intelligent command, and intelligent dispatch. The eLTE SafeCity solution is Huawei's answer to such a challenge. It features convergent command, while encompassing E2E eLTE broadband trunking, broadband data applications, mobile video, wireless video backhaul, and accessory products. This reliable comprehensive solution supports broadband and narrow-band communication, service convergence, multiple sensors, and mobile cloud.
Huawei advocates open cooperation and follows a being integrated strategy in seeking innovation in public safety to facilitate the digital transformation of mobile policing. Its contribution to the industry entails three parts, namely standard development, technical breakthroughs, and ecosystem formation.
The future-proof solution meets both the B-TrunC and 3GPP standards and supports long-term evolution for investment protection. As a council member of both TCCA and PPDR (Public Protection and Disaster Relief communications), Huawei is actively engaged in promoting the development of standards to encourage industrial advancement.
Tailored with the needs of each industry, Huawei make use of its technical advantages and successful experiences thanks to years of accumulated experience in the 3GPP telecommunications field, aiming to bring benefits to users in different industries. The releasing of eLTE SafeCity follows last month's unveiling of the eLTE SmartGrid and the eLTE Smart Campus solution at Hannover MESSE 2017. The solution provides convergent command and comprehensive urban safety networks that feature visibility, connectivity, mobility, and accuracy. The reliable broadband trunking can cater for all services, while the eLTE mobile video solution supports non-stop all-around surveillance.
Huawei incorporates an open application platform interface (API) in its eLTE solution to boost cooperation among industry players and advance ecosystem formation. The successful launch of the all-round convergent command solution which integrates voice, video, data, and GIS (geographic information system) services in a single network is the result of a joint effort between Huawei and its partners.
Multiple police applications installed on each trunking terminal are connected to the central cloud database, which allows more efficient case management, identity recognition, and onsite law enforcement.
Huawei is currently engaged in the extensive roll out of broadband trunking applications. By the end of Q1 2017, Huawei's eLTE broadband trunking has been deployed in over 150 networks across 57 countries.

Indian economy to grow at 7.2% this year: WB
The World Bank expects Indias economy to expand at 7.2 per cent this fiscal, but said that the note ban temporarily disrupted growth last fiscal, which slowed to an estimated 6.8%.
Indias economy was slowing down in early 2016-17, until the favorable monsoon started lifting the economy, but the recovery was temporarily disrupted by the governments demonetisation initiative, it said in its India Development Update released on Monday.
The report comes ahead of the release of provisional estimates of national income for 2016-17 by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on May 31. The CSO, in its advance estimates, had pegged GDP growth at 7.1% in 2016-17.
The World Bank had in January scaled down Indias growth forecast to 7% for 2016-17 and had estimated growth to rebound in 2017-18 to 7.6%.
However, it expects the economy to recover gradually and growth to increase to 7.7% in 2019-2020.
India remains the fastest growing economy in the world and it will get a big boost from its approach to the goods and services tax, said Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India.According to the report, reforms such as the insolvency code and measures to deal with bad loans of public sector banks, including promulgation of the new ordinance will also be crucial to enhance growth.
It expects inflation and external conditions to remain stable this fiscal. The World Bank highlighted issues of weak private investments, low credit growth and rising anti-trade rhetoric globally as challenges to growth.
The report also stressed that job creation, especially for women, should be the next focus for the government after GST, which can boost growth into double digits.
India has only created jobs equivalent to 0.9% of the adult population between 2005 and 2012 and most of these regular wage jobs created went to men, it said.
Indias potential GDP growth can rise by 1% point if half the gap in female labour force participation rate (LFPR) with Bangladesh or Indonesia is closed, according to an assessment by the World Bank.
Six months after the demonetisation of high-value currency notes, the World Bank termed it a gargantuan and unprecedented exercise.
While it helped curb black money, the report said that the challenge will now be to sustain compliance by tax-payers as well as the shift to digital transactions from cash payments.

Ireland's O'Brien steers MCC to win over Germany
FRANKFURT, Germany, Monday  Having scored his maiden century for Ireland earlier this month, Niall O'Brien fell just short of his second tonne in a fortnight in helping the MCC beat Germany on Monday.
Ireland's wicketkeeper was guesting in an invitational team for the Lord's-based MCC -- the Marylebone Cricket Club -- the world's oldest club, in
the first of their seven-game tour of Germany this week.
O'Brien's knock of 96 was the MCC's highest score as they scored 323-7 in the 50-overs match, then bowled Germany out for 247. "I enjoyed it, it was a nice pitch and they have a good attack, there are some good bowlers there," said O'Brien after sweltering conditions in Frankfurt.
"It's a shame I didn't get my hundred, but there is always tomorrow." O'Brien claimed his maiden international century for Ireland in Dublin two weeks ago, hitting 109 when New Zealand opened their tri-series with a 51-run victory.
However, he was left kicking himself -- literally -- about the way he gave his wicket away against Germany.
"It was a funny way to get out -- hitting my own wicket," he admitted.
"I tried to get inside the line of the ball to hit it to the leg side, but I stupidly kicked my stumps.
"It's the first time I've been out like that."
Minnows Germany have a second 50-overs match against the MCC in Frankfurt on Tuesday.
The hosts are preparing for next month's Europe Div One tournament, against the likes of Austria, Belgium, France, Norway and Sweden, which acts
as a World Cup qualifier. -AFP

JO prepared to join Govt. in flood relief operations
In a rare show of consensus, the Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said they were prepared to set their differences aside and work with the government to help the disaster-hit people.
Speaking to the media in Colombo, JO member Bandula Gunewardene MP said the JO was ready to carry out relief work with the government and also support any endeavours to collect funds to assist the affected.
Gunewardene proposed that funds allocated for the Parliamentarians official needs, such as, vehicles, renovations to existing office premises, equipment etc. should be diverted to help provide relief to the affected.
He also said that the government should take prompt measures to remove the hurdles which obstruct state sector officers in taking urgent measures to help the victims.
Gunewardene also called for the setting up of District Coordinating Committees to carry out relief measures and noted that the JO was prepared to take part in such committees. Meanwhile, Prof. G.L.Peiris said that if all Pradeshiya Sabha members are more active,it would greatly help carry out the relief measures.
Peiris recalled that there were 2,628 PS members in the country and they could play a pivotal role in relief work as they are political representatives who are connected to the people at grassroots level.

To join the brimming river
The brilliance and radiance of the Victorian period of English poetry are partly owed to one of the greatest poetic icons, Alfred Lord Tennyson. I might have come to this understanding due to the very reasons how my teachers at the school and the university level would have imparted their knowledge to me in such a penetrating manner or my further reading about the poet for my literary pursuits.
A profound study into the depth and width of his poetry paves one to widen his spectrum of aesthetic faculty while the affective and cognitive domains also would effortlessly propel him to land in a quite new world of reawakening. The ultimate bliss for him would rest in his eagerness to empower the fellow human beings to follow suit.
The teachers of the yesteryear were the genuine pathfinders of the modern world. Such is the noble duty of the teacher.
Let me revisit The Brook by my muse Alfred Lord Tennyson hopingly to take you to a brand new world of poetic experience to the amateur and a poetic retreat to the literati. The brook he saw in England then is the same throughout the world in the profound sense except a little fretting here and there. To a more advanced learner, it would be more interesting and inspirational to remember the eagle in The Eagle by the same poet.
Authentic details
In the poetic narration, it is implied that the poet might have walked the whole length of the beautiful flowing of the brook. It is evident in the authentic details given in the poem. Would you kindly imagine that you are at the very place where the water is gushing out to start the brook
The Eagles may be in flight in the blue deep. We are enveloped in the lush green. The cooling effect would wrap you as we are in a virgin jungle away from human habitat. Tiny drops of chilly water are at your feet, better to remove your shoes to feel it. While the Eagles are clasping the rock face of the high mountains and some others are in a picturesque circling in the deep blue, see how the coots and herns are very near you in their haunts.
Please do not disturb them, it is their natural habitat. The place is slippery, take utmost care and keep your balance. See how the little brook is making a sudden attack and splash sparkling among the ferns. What a wonderful wealth for a poet! The Brook is going to bicker all the way down the valley.
I come from haunts of coot and hern
I make a sudden sally
And sparkle out among the fern
To bicker down the valley.
The coot and the hern are two kinds of small birds that live close to the water courses in shady places. They make our walk down the valley quite interesting and harmony among natural elements is beyond our imagination.
See around! You could count around thirty hills in a very natural array. Lets go down on the untrodden paths. The brook is slowly getting speed so lets quicken our steps. You can see the mossy stones with the violets very nigh, yet half-hidden from the eye. See the lovely slipping of the brook between the narrow and raised parts on her way. Down there are the villages twenty in number.
Our journey is not tedious; we are on the flat land.
See the town at the distance, a little one. On the way, with the brook, we have to pass fifty bridges. Dont you feel tired Lets have a rest on the bank of the brook in the shade of the lush green.
By thirty hills I hurry down,
Or slip between the ridges,
By twenty thorps, a little town,
And half a hundred bridges.
From pure nature, we are entering the dreadful mouth of peril, environmental pollution. Pure water in our beloved brook would get putrid also.
Philips farm is ahead. She flows down by the farm. Some comely damsels are reaping the harvest. Please do not disturb. Stop here or gently pass. The lovely flow is heading towards the brimful river. It is her desire and of us all, the tiny spring, then the stream is pregnant with water. The writer is also pregnant with aesthetic feelings. The brook flows looking for the river to end in the sea.
Tennyson adds a bit of his philosophy into the brook but not to flow with water to an unknown destination, yet to open the eyes of the people to the truth of life that will come to light at the end of the poem when the brook joins the brimful river.
For men may come and men may go,
But I may go on for ever.
Varying sounds
The brook flows down on a rocky surface. It is in personification. She chatters all the way in varying sounds, musically in a high pitch sound. She takes a lovely circular shape. The beauty of this brook s dance is at the helm when she bubbles on pebbles. Her gait on the small round stones with the auditory effects tantalises us. Tennysons diction is superb, Bubble on the pebbles The alliteration produced by bb creates mesmerising poetry to the aesthetically aroused reader.
How the brook is fretting the banks takes us to our common scenes in the tranquil idyllic life by a river. Tennyson rhythmically takes us to his aesthetic world. Tennyson describes the catchment area with many a field and fallows with Willow weed and mallow. Again the array of the consonant w creates a lovely scene. The repetition of the chattering sound with the desire of joining the brimming river reminding how men may come and men may go, yet she is on a continuous journey without stopping to reach her aim, gives us the message.
The book tells us the sounds that she makes, she chatters and clatters  can you hear her sounds. Lets go along parallel to her, yet the bank is slippery and so, take utmost care, dont embrace her, now she is proud as her belly is large. She has a strong desire  to join the brimming river. She always reminds us that her journey is unstoppable, yet men may come and men may go.
The lovely journey is now very picturesque a blossoming sailing not only that strong and lively trout fish `are in brook waters and by her, you can see grayling , a kind of duck. The bucolic neighbourhood is eye catching. The flow of water makes foam. Now she flows over golden gravel. Taking all these things she is hurrying towards her aim, the brimming river. She reminds us, men may come and men may go
The vicinity of the water snake-like Brook now is greenish with lawns and grass. She flows romantically. She sees the forget me-nots of the happy lovers. You can just imagine the idyllic environment that pleases our senses, it is purely palpable, the loveliest of all is as follows,
I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance.
The short action words are frequently used by Tennyson in his oeuvre. It is a peculiar way of the poet. How she gets into a dancing mood is in the company of the sunbeams is kinesthetic and the water is shallow above the sands. The scene is picturesque and very inviting, pleasing the eyes, a watery treat to our tedious journey down the brook. It is a soothing balm to our weary mind.
Poetic excellence
The letter l in the above line performs an enormous duty as alliteration. Again sl followed by gl create a magnificent line in poetic excellence. The effect of the visual imagery arouses our emotions, gives ideas and we form attitudes about her, the brook. She is a very active promising damsel now.
Among my skimming swallows:
I make the netted sunbeam dance
Against my sandy swallows.
Her lovely gait gains new beauty with moonlight in the starry heaven. Sometime, she may join her brimming river tonight itself. Murmuring sound under the moon and starlight is perfectly matching. With the flowing brook, we are also making for the brimming river in another sense.
Thick vegetation along the bank is mainly bramble. The fragrant enchanting environment is palpable even in the moonlit night. She is very proud. She takes everything around her as hers. Cresses belongings to the cabbage family. She says, my cresses she is loitering, not flowing. In fact loitering around her cresses. In this penultimate line, Tennyson prepares the springboard to enter the bringing river.
She negotiates her last , yet the comely bend she is taking prior to joining the brimming river.
And out again I curve and flow
To join the brimming river.
By this time, I do believe, you may be feeling awfully tired on this long journey with me. Heres good news. You might not have expected to end the journey because of the cooling effect of pure nature with her watery treat and the virgin soil at your feet and the sylvan glades, I showed you. The immortal pleasure for being able to take you down all the way unhurt on a slippery path, keeps me kicking.
 For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
The tapestry of English literature is gem studded. In a way, the bards who brought this wealth to us are redoubtable.

Knowledge, competence of FM to boost Commercial Diplomacy - NCE
The knowledge and competence of the new Minister of Foreign Affairs will boost the program to implement Commercial Diplomacy - states the NCE.
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) which is the private sector Chamber exclusively serving Sri Lankan exporters, whose member exporters make a substantial contribution to the economic development of Sri Lanka through exports, welcomes the strategy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively engage in Commercial Diplomacy through the Sri Lankan Missions overseas, announced by Dr. Harsha De Silva, Deputy Minister at a recent Forum of the Chamber on the GSP + facility regained by Sri Lanka. President of the NCE Ramal Jasinghe is of the view that the knowledge and competence of Ravi Karunanayake, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs will be an asset to effectively implement the programme given the vital role he has played to boost the economy of Sri Lanka as the former Minister of Finance.
According to the Deputy Minister the Sri Lankan Missions in overseas markets, especially those in the markets of vital importance to Sri Lanka to develop and expand exports, which have hitherto focused their efforts mainly on activities other than international trade will henceforth be required to focus their efforts on Commercial Diplomacy by working closely with the relevant state institutions and private business houses in their markets to promote and develop the export of Sri Lankan products and services to achieve the economic development targets of Sri Lanka.
In this regard the performance of the relevant staff in Overseas Missions will be strictly monitored related to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Lanka Ashok Leyland records Rs. 11.4 bn revenue
Lanka Ashok Leyland ended another successful year with improved results touching total revenue of Rs. 11.4 billion owing to an excellent fourth quarter where revenue reached Rs 3.8 billion.
Lanka Ashok Leylands foray into export markets made significant gains this year which contributed in expanding the gross profit margin to 9% against 8.4% a year earlier.
Non-recurring expenses relating to tax charges and an impairment provision amounting to approximately Rs 120 mn drove up operating expenses by 44% to Rs 502.7mn from Rs 348.7mn in 2015.
Higher interest rates during the year drove up net finance expense by 64% to Rs 91.1mn against Rs 55.7mn in 2015 while interest bearing liabilities fell almost 9% to Rs 1.8bn from Rs 2 bn a year ago. Inventory levels rose 3% to Rs 3.9 bn for the same period. Profit before tax grew 12% to Rs 351.6mn compared to Rs 314.0mn posted for 2015.
Taking into consideration the non-recurring expenses and the improved performance, the board of directors has declared Rs 30 per share as a dividend representing a 20% increase over last year.
Commenting on the results, Umesh Gautam, CEO of Lanka Ashok Leyland said, despite of frequent changes in the import duties, restricted leasing facilities and adverse market conditions, this years performance has been a reflection of the prudent financial management, collective effort by management and all our employees.
The bottom line remains healthy, notwithstanding the extraordinary line items on the firms operating expenses.
For another year, the key macro variables trended against us as average weighted lending rates rose approximately 200 basis points impacting demand while the Lankan Rupee lost around 4.5% against the US Dollar driving import prices up and negatively impacting our margins.
However the depreciation was not as severe as 2015, where the LKR fell over 9%, and we were able to navigate the risks better.
In focusing on the variables within our control, Gautam said I am proud of the marketing teams innovation, industry, and effort throughout the year to increase our market share and sales in the midst of a challenging environment.
Overall unit sales increased 10% year on year despite rising costs, partly driven by the construction sector which continues to be a driving contributor for national output
We remain well capitalized as interest bearing liabilities fell almost 9% while inventories rose 3%. During the year, we were granted better terms of import through our principal Ashok Leyland, greatly helping our working capital positions.
Looking ahead, we continue to see strong demand emanating from key economic sectors such as the construction industry going into next year despite a challenging external environment for the rest. Interest rates may start to fall in the latter part of the year, however it depends on other economic factors and the success of government reform to tackle its foreign debt position. Addressing our overreliance on domestic vehicle sales as a disproportionate portion of revenue, our export push has grown over 700% in the last year and we hope to make further gains.

## Supertitle:

Is Loolkandura or Rothschild the first tea estate
On the occasion of the forthcoming celebrations connected with 150 years of the tea industry in Sri Lanka and the 125th death anniversary of James Taylor, I would like to focus attention on a very important aspect.
This countrys great industry before tea was coffee, and it was because of one virulent leaf disease that Sri Lanka is today one of the greatest tea producers of the world.
It was during the late 1820s that some of the first coffee estates were opened in the hills around the ancient capital, Kandy.
Over the following forty years every mountainside rang to the sound of axes, the giants of the primeval forest fell.
Somewhere in 1869 there were 176,000 acres were under coffee. However, within a comparatively short period of twenty years this great industry had fallen due to a leaf disease ( Hemileia vastatrix ) known as coffee rust. That was the coffee industrys peak time.
In fact, today there are thousands of acres of tea bushes that grow on old coffee land on the graveyard of the old coffee estates.
During the British period, when the Jewish Benjamin Disraeli was Prime Minister, many British Jews sought their fortunes in the new colony, Ceylon. Among those were the De Worms Brothers, related to the aristocratic Europeans bankers, the Rothschild family.
Somewhere in 1835 or 1837, Maurice B Worms (a nephew of Nathan Mayer Rothschild who was a high-ranking government official as well as an influential personality among the mercantile sector) came to Ceylon. Seeing a new and potentially profitable life for himself, he bought a substantial piece of land at Pussellawa and named it Rothschild. He then invited his brother Gabriel to join him.
The two brothers cleared a huge stretch of jungle in Nuwara Eliya district to plant coffee and named it Rothschild Estate. The estate they founded yet flourishes, proudly flaunting its aristocratic Jewish name though no longer owned by the pioneering De Worms.
In 1841, Maurice (born Moritz) De Worms went on a voyage to China and brought back a number of cuttings. They were China jat and duly planted on the Rothschild estate.
In the same year, the government obtained two consignments of plants from China and Assam. Those from China were planted on Rothschild and the Assam variety on Penyland Estate, Dolosbage.
The brothers pioneered planting coffee on their estate, and later, when coffee failed, they became the first in Ceylon to replant their estate with the new crop--TEA.
Almost twenty years after Maurices death, a statement was made by his nephew George De Worms in a letter to The Times: My late uncle Mr Maurice B Worms brought the first tea plants from China to Ceylon in September 1841, and formed a nursery of them on his estate at Pussellawa (vide Sir J. Emerson Tennents Ceylon, Vol. 2, Chapter 7 ). Samples of the tea grown there were often sent by Maurice Worms to friends in England and found to be excellent.
Anyway it was clear that the brothers were involved very early on with experiments in tea growing and indeed that they succeeded in moving beyond the simple experiment of trying to persuade tea bushes to flourish on Ceylon soil and reached the point of turning the shoots into drinkable tea according to the letter sent to The Times by their nephew in England and the The Times quoted that certainly they have come to be regarded as pioneers, if not, the founding fathers of the Ceylon tea trade.
However, no one knows how far they moved to make a commercial success. The fact remained that, for the rest of their working life, it was coffee which was the mainstay of their estate.
The brothers were well regarded in the colonial establishment and even contemplated a career in politics. Gabriel De Worms contested the elections, under a limited franchise to the Legislative Council in 1847 and won a seat. He then went on to make history. Being a Jew, he declined to take oaths of allegiance on the Holy Bible.
The Jews should swear the standard oaths of allegiance on the true faith of a Christian. Gabriel thus forfeited his seat failing to be the only Jew to be elected to the Legislature.
De Worms left Ceylon and their estate in 1865. The China jats they planted out on Rothschild today complement the growing conditions in the mountains of central Sri Lanka which bring about Rothschilds unique Ceylon characteristics in its flavour.
Rothschild Estate yet flourishes under the same name  though no longer under its Jewish founders.

Moonlight Sonata
Even a casual play with your camera at night will reveal its remarkable ability to see much more than your eyes can, and in full colour too. All it takes is exposures up to 30 seconds long with the aperture wide open and the ISO up reasonably high. Of course you still need to think about lighting but if you can get away from the city, there is one obvious and natural light source.
The moon makes a great light source at night, but what you cannot see is that many of the considerations that photographers naturally take into account during the day also apply when the sun goes down. When the moon is high in the sky, like the sun in the middle of the day, the light is harsher and colors are subdued. When the moon is low in the sky, the light is softer with scenes appearing nicely saturated.
It takes some practice to visualise how your images will look at night before you take them, so experiment with different angles and review them on camera. It can be great fun and always delivers a few surprises. With practise youll be able to anticipate a little more about how the moonlight and other illumination around you will work in your images.
Indranatha Thenuwara needs no introduction in that area, because it is his forte. Capturing the same scene from the other direction, the moon as the light source was behind Thenuwaras camera, bringing out the colors and texture of the timber and rusty iron gate.
Later in the night, the moon set, so it required a longer exposure to achieve a sky background bright enough for silhouettes against it.
For Thenuwara the striking effect of the light rays come in various colours.
Unlike the sun, the moon itself varies considerably in brightness, depending on its phase which changes over the course each month. At new moon there is no moon at all, as it is almost in line with the sun. And while the full moon can itself look spectacular, as a light source it is often too strong, washing out all but the brightest stars from the sky.
It seems that Thenuwara has fallen in love with night sky photography, a few days after new moon, especially when it gets a slender crescent moon low in the west as night sets in. This provides soft illumination of the foreground without washing out the night sky. A few days before new moon, there is also a slender crescent moon in the east just before dawn, but this is not the most convenient time of day for most people to be out taking photos!
Indranatha Thenuwaras latest attempt with moonlight photography will come to the fore as an exhibition at J D A Perera Art Gallery on June 9, 10, 11 and 12.

Morning in the bowl of night
There are several genres categorised in the literary domain. In the evaluation of works of art, the critics attempt to study, investigate and interpret the rich and varied shades of meaning generated by them. The craft of imaginative writing is observed in all forms of literature.
A high degree of craftsmanship in the imaginative application of suitable linguistic forms is observed in areas such as theme, title, the point of view, discourse, planning, construction, organisation, dialogue, setting, characterization, plot and style so forth. The pragmatic critical approach is focused on the communicated meaning by the artistic creation and this discipline is none other than Pragmatic  the study of meaning.
Pragmatic criticism is not myopic but offers a large scale view of evaluation. It supports the other forms of critical activity. The justification of pragmatic criticism is that by appropriate, relevant, thoughtful and creative application of linguistic knowledge, it is possible to unlock insightful, stimulating new meanings generated from an artistic creation.
In poetry, for instance, the meaning is not literal. There could be various shades and levels of meaning such as indexical, referential, symbolical, preferential, metaphorical, implicational, inferential, logical and cryptical meaning. In poetry more gets communicated than is said. The use of language involves a high degree of creativity.
Human experience and conversation too are infinite. The process of putting linguistic units cannot be divorced from the process of putting together conceptual units, and the ways in which such conceptual combinations produce meaning that is infinitely variable. In this sense, language is able to cope up with the infinite variability, and open indebtedness of human experience is precisely the fact that it does not make use of finite means.
Notions of pragmatic competence, construal (different linguistic forms that produce the same meaning) perspective (point of view), foregrounding (highlighting a specific component in an event), metaphor (a device that involves one domain of experience in terms of another) and frame (background knowledge) often interact to produce significant and meaningful implications and entailments. All these effects are the products of linguistic application in genre or kitsch. Kitsch is used to describing objects or works of art that are very elaborate and often very colourful. Kitsch is also used to describe any art to literature which is pretentious or in bad taste,
Awake! For Morning in the Bowl of Night
Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:
And Lo! The Hunter of the East has caught
The Sultans Turret in a Noose of Light.
The opening poem of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (Edward Fitzgeralds First Version) presents a scenario of someone still asleep being motivated to rise up in the morning. It is essentially a speech event woven around a speech act. The speech act is Awake! Its morning a directive as well as a declarative with a communicative purpose (illocutionary act) and it produces an effect on the listener (perlocutionary effect)to rise up or to continue sleeping. In the last two lines, there is also another speech act which is expressive. Expressing surprise (The Sun has caught the Sultans Turret in a ray of light). But the poet has used figurative language in the entire verse.

Nadal, Djokovic cruise as Muguruza downs ex-champ
PARIS, Monday - Rafael Nadal launched his pursuit of a record 10th French Open title in convincing fashion, while defending champion Novak Djokovic eased to victory under the gaze of new coach Andre Agassi.
Reigning womens champion Garbine Muguruza began her Roland Garros defence with a straight-sets triumph over 2010 winner Francesca Schiavone.
Nadal, who was forced to withdraw before last years third round with a wrist injury, brushed aside 45th-ranked Benoit Paire 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 inside two hours.
Im very happy to be back here after what happened last year. Its great to feel the support, said the 14-time major champion.
Nadal broke Frenchman Paire eight times and recovered from a slight second-set wobble when he dropped serve twice in a row to surge into a round two meeting with Dutchman Robin Haase.
Title-holder Djokovic strolled through his opener against Marcel Granollers of Spain, advancing 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
With 1999 French Open champion Agassi in the players box for the first time after agreeing a short-term coaching role, Djokovic experienced some trouble against the world number 77, being broken four times.
Its great to have Andre Agassi as coach and as a mentor. I will try to learn as much as I can from him, said Djokovic.
The Serb, seeking to become the first man in the Open era to win all four majors on at least two occasions, will take on Portugals Joao Sousa next. Muguruzas middling form this season saw her arrive in Paris with just three wins on clay, but the Spaniard dispatched former Paris champion Schiavone 6-2, 6-4.

Nifty Tips and Tricks For Using Your Smartphone
Smartphones have revolutionized the world in so many different respects, from the ease of communication they provide, to the applications we can download, which have turned our phones into multi-functional tools. And this technology is continuously improving too! So, although smartphones facilitate your needs extensively, there are probably some extremely useful things you don't know much about, such as taking a screenshot with your phone, having text displayed larger, and even read out to you.The following tips come with instructions on how to use them on both Android phones and iPhones:
Take a screenshot
You can easily take a screenshot on a computer, so youll be happy to know that taking one on a smartphone isnt any more difficult. Use this when you want to quickly share something you've received (such as a text message) or something you've seen on social media.
iPhone instructions Press and hold the Home button WITH the Sleep/Wake button (simultaneously).When the screenshot is taken, you will hear a shutter click.The screenshot will be automatically saved in your Camera Roll or Saved Photos Selection.
Android instructions Press and hold the Power button WITH the Volume Down button (simultaneously).You should hear a sound and/or see a flash on your screen, when the screenshot is taken.The screenshot will be automatically saved in the Captured Images folder in Gallery,
Block calls and texts
If you're getting bothersome phone calls or texts, your smartphone gives you the possibility to block them from reaching your phone. This is done through a simple setting you can change whenever you like.
iPhone instructions (iOS 7 or later)
For calls: If the caller is on your phone's contact list, find the contact in your list and tap on his name. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Block This Caller. Then tap Block Contact.If the caller isn't on your phone's contact list, tap on the Info button next to the number, scroll to the bottom of the page and select Block this Caller. Then tap Block Contact. For texts: Whether the person is on your contact list or not, open the Messages app and select a message received from this person (if you have more than one, pick any). Tap Contact in the upper right of the screen and tap the Info button. Scroll to the bottom and tap Block this Caller, followed by Block Contact.
Editing blocked contacts: Go to Settings > Phone > Blocked - (for callers).Go to Settings > Messages > Blocked - (for text senders).Go to Settings > FaceTime > Blocked - (for FaceTime contacts).
Android instructions Open Settings and tap Call Settings, followed by Call block. Under Incoming Calls, find Call Block List, and tap Create. Enter the number you would like to block, or select it from your contact list or call log.
Use a real password instead of a digit code
The default way of unlocking a phone from the lock screen is by using a 4-digit PIN. As long as it is not super easy and obvious, this is a pretty safe system. But to make it even more secure, you can change this to a set string of characters of your choice, making it more like a password.
iPhone instructions Enter Settings, and go to Passcode. Swipe off the option that says Simple Passcode.Now you can set your passcode to any combination of characters.
Android instructions Enter Settings, and go to Screen lock. Here, you can select which level of security you want from the options.
Tap Password and create the password you want, using any characters.
Enlarge Text
Sometimes, it can be difficult to read what's on your phone's screen, especially if your phone is quite small. Resolve this issue by setting the font size of your phone to a larger or bolder one, so it is easier for you to read.
iPhone instructions Enter Settings, select General, followed by Accessibility. Turn on Bold Text and/or Larger Text, according to your preference. If you select Bold Text, you will need to restart your phone for the setting to be activated.
Android instructions Go to Settings, then select Accessibility. Under Vision, select Font Size and set it to Large. Certain smartphones even offer the option of setting the size to Huge, which is bigger than Large. -Tech Radar

NITF reinsurance cover increased to Rs 15 bn
The government has decided to increase the reinsurance cover for natural disasters to Rs 15 billion this year.
The Cabinet yesterday granted approval to increase the sum allocated to insure all citizens for loss of life and property during times of natural disasters such as Tsunami, floods, landslides, and incidents of lightning.
This is an increase of Rs 5 billion from last years cover where the Rs 10 billion insurance cover was split into Rs 8.5 billion for property damage and Rs 1.5 billion for compensation to victims.
This year Rs 12.5 billion will be allocated to property damage and the rest to cover loss of lives.
National Policies and Economic Affairs acting minister Niroshan Perera said he submitted the above proposal to Cabinet under the directive of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
Under this scheme, in the event of a natural disaster, Rs 100,000 will be paid in insurance claims in the event of a death while a maximum of Rs 2.5 million is paid for property damage.
The acting minister further explained that the government was the only government to provide free disaster insurance cover to all people.
At present the government has already paid Rs 125 million in compensation to flood victims in addition to the Rs 150 million in emergency payments, Perera said.
In 2016, the very scheme gave Rs 2.95 billion to pay 53,000 claims and in the next 2-3 weeks a further Rs 1 billion will be paid to around 7,000 late claims from the 2016 floods.
In 2015, the government took a national insurance cover for all citizens from the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) to help them during times of natural disasters. As a result, Cabinet this year already approved Rs 500 million as premium payments to the NITF.
Minister Perera noted that this year too the government will take action to ensure that those who have been affected are given the necessary compensation to get back on their feet again.

No one can sabotage countrys development programmes: Navin
The government would not allow anyone to disrupt or harm the countrys development programmes, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He made this observation at a ceremony held yesterday to grant compensation of Rs.6 million and promotions to 66 employees of the Coconut Cultivation Board who were subjected to political victimisation during the previous regime.
He added that victimisation has become part of our political culture which should not continue any further.
It is the responsibility of the employees of this ministry not to create a situation for the next government to organise a similar ceremony to grant compensation for employees subjected to political victimisation, Minister Dissanayake said.
Political vengeance is not accepted by disciplined societies.
One should be able to accept the views of the opposition as well, the Minister said
Minister Dissanayake further stated these employees had been subjected to political victimisation since they had supported the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya during the previous regime. He added that however, those employees had been granted 50 percent of their demanded compensation.
The future of coconut cultivation, coconut development and research looks bright since we are seeking USD 50 million funds for the same, Minister Dissanayake said.
The Minister also pointed out that it is the responsibility of the Ministry employees to achieve the desired targets set for them, as they are being paid with the tax payers money.
He also said the Plantation Industries Ministry also has planed to grant compensation and promotions to employees of other institutions who had been subjected to political vengeance during the previous regime.
Plantation Industries Ministry Additional Secretary Kumari Somaratne and Coconut Cultivation Board Chairman Kapila Yakandawala spoke.

Not detrimental to national interests: Mahinda
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the country's national interests is of paramount importance. Therefore, nothing will be done to harm the country's national interests or security when entering into bipartite agreements with any country relating to the Hambantota Port development.
The Minister said that the country will not enter into agreements which can be detrimental to its national interests and national security.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
Minister Samarasinghe added that he will have a discussion with a Chinese company on Friday regarding the Public Private Agreement which is going to signed in the future regarding the Hambantota port development.
The government is engaged in trying to get the best agreement for the both parties aiming to obtain a win-win situation, the Minister said.
The Hambantota port will never be sold, but leased out as it is a financial burden to the Treasury. Many sections of the old agreement have already been amended by now. This will be a win-win situation for both parties, he said.
Speaking on the recent state visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to Australia, Minister Samarasinghe refuted allegations that the President was not invited by the head of the state of Australia for his recent visit. The Minister said that when he contracted the Australian High Commissioner last morning, he confirmed that the President was invited by the Governor, who is considered as Head of Australia.
Minister Samarasinghe said that the country received many benefits from the President's State visit, including the signing bilateral agreements for the betterment of several fields and issuing a joint declaration. Under those agreements, measures are to be taken to mitigate kidney disease, stop human trafficking, receiving a grant of Australian $ 15 million and more.
Speaking on the measures taken to bring relief to the people affacted by the bad weather,the Minister said Rs.2,000 million has been allocated for this purpose.
He added that 44 countries have come forward to help the country during these difficult times. All foreign financial relief will be utilized for constructing houses of affected people.
The Finance Ministry will launch a mechanism to utilise these foreign funds to the maximum benefirt of the affcted people. Unlike in the past, a National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) report is necessary when constructing new houses. Projects which received NBRO approval are given permission to carry out the construction, Minister Smarasinghe said.

Over 1.5 million smoke 11 million cigarettes daily
A total of 1.5 million people in Sri Lanka smoke 11 million cigarettes daily. The percentage of smokers above the age of 15 in Sri Lanka is 15 percent, National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday in connection with World No Tobacco Day (May 31), he said although Bhutan has banned cigarettes, 17 percent above the age of 15 smoke in Bhutan.
The percentage is 60 in China and around 20 percent in the West, Abeykoon added.
According to Dr. Abeykoon, at present, smoking in Sri Lanka has gone down significantly when comparing with the situation before 10 or 15 years.
Annually, between 20,000 and 25,000 Sri Lankans die from smoking and smoking related health issues. Ten percent of them die due to passive smoking and third-hand smoking.
Cabinet papers had been presented in connection with banning the sale of cigarettes within a radius of 500 metres from a school and to ban selling single cigarettes. Sri Lanka will introduce plain packaging for cigarettes in the future.
Already, around 11 countries have introduced plain packaging for cigarettes. Tobacco cultivation in Sri Lanka had been reduced to around 300 hectares, he added.

Palette beyond blue and grey
A picture says a thousand words, you'll realise this well-known saying whenever you see a painting done by an artist. Arts and crafts, contemporary art, art exhibitions, art galleries and now even art fares are the related phenomena when we discuss art in our country. Here art galleries play a major role to promote art among the general public and private art galleries are the common sight in the developed world.
We are fortunate to have such a private art gallery in our country, which is very popular among both local and foreign art lovers named Semage's Art Gallery formed by an outstanding artist Kala Suri Jayasiri Semage, which is at No. 3, Lilian Avenue, Station Road, Mount Lavinia, situated in a highly residential area, closer to the country's main city, Colombo and walking distance from the well-known Mount Lavinia hotel.
Semage's Art Gallery is so unique with compared to those private art galleries which are in Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, France, Italy, or Germany. Here the viewer has no barriers like seeing certain creations from a distance, banding photographs or hands-free from the exhibits on display. The gallery is opened throughout the year, including the government and mercantile holidays and this is a place where the viewers can enjoy their freedom of feeling the art in a calm and quiet atmosphere. Jayasiri Semage who shot up to the prominence from a humble newspaper illustrator to veteran painter has made it a point to display most of his acrylic, watercolour and oil on canvas paintings at his art gallery.
Some of the visitors to the art gallery are Sri Lankans working abroad. They invariably visit the gallery to purchase their favourite painter's artworks. Most of these Sri Lankans buy Semage's paintings as they remind of their countries heritage. They appreciate how Semage has done his paintings showing the Sri Lankan identity with the good use of colours and dexterous brush strokes. Their candid comments can be seen in the visitors book kept at the Semage's Gallery.
In addition to the regular visitors, many students can be seen frequently at the gallery as no entrance fee is charged. Jayasiri Semage attributes his success to his style has attracted many art lovers to the gallery. A few months ago Semage held one of his solo exhibitions in Tokyo, Japan. Also, he has exhibited his paintings in many countries around the world like Nepal, Switzerland, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia and Finland. One of his paintings is on permanent display at the United Nations Hall in Geneva. Those paintings exhibited in other countries can also be viewed at this Gallery. What is remarkable is that Semage creates all his paintings in his gallery. He conducts his classes there as well on regular basis. As a result, many people visit the gallery to see how an artist finishes his art.
You can learn a lot by viewing how an artist uses his brush lively by sitting in an art class. You will find it a new experience to see how the artist uses his brushes, mix colours, and finally, gives life to their artwork, said Jayasiri Semage, turning to give the finishing touches to one of his latest paintings.

President cancels vehicle imports for ministries
No new vehicles will be purchased for ministries or government institutions until the end of this year.
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed ministers at the Cabinet meeting held yesterday, not to purchase new vehicles considering the outcome of the adverse weather conditions, which caused havoc in the country, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said. Asked whether the vehicles which have already been approved by the Cabinet a few days ago, will be imported, the Minister said that he is not certain about it. The Cabinet has already approved several supplementary estimates presented to the Cabinet, to import vehicles for several Ministries.
I am not certain whether vehicles will be imported through supplementary estimates, which have been already approved by Cabinet. But the President advised ministers not to import new vehicles until the end of this year he added.
President Maithripala Sirisena has agreed to cancel all vehicle imports for ministers this year, Digital Infrastructure and Telecommunications Minister, Harin Fernando tweeted yesterday.
The import of luxury vehicles for ministers and MPs have been a strong point of debate among the public for over a year as legislators face public outcry over their decisions to purchase expensive vehicles.
Parliament took up the debate on a supplementary estimate last week which sought approval to spend more than Rs 360 million to purchase vehicles for some ministers and renovate official residences of others. The debate took place amid heavy rains wreaking havoc in many parts of the country.
The vehicle budget consisted of Rs. 154 million to purchase new vehicles for the Defence Ministry, Rs 120 million for vehicles for the Finance Ministry, Rs.43 million to purchase a vehicle for the Rural Economy Deputy Minister and Rs. 16 million to purchase a vehicle for the Development Strategies and International Trade Minister.
The government provides each cabinet, deputy and state minister with an official vehicle and two other vehicles as well as a vehicle permit. In addition, vehicles are also provided to the personal secretary, media secretary, the two coordinating secretaries and public relations officer of every minister.
Cabinet this year also approved a request made to increase the maximum price of a vehicle by eight million rupees and to provide funds for only one vehicle for a cabinet, state or deputy minister.
Earlier in March, the government had sought Parliamentary approval to spend Rs.288.2 million to purchase vehicles for several ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers.

President expresses gratitude to public servants: Sagala
President Maithripala Sirisena has expressed his admiration of all the public servants, for executing their responsibilities to the highest degree while responding to the calamitous events caused by the adverse weather conditions, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said. The Minister was speaking at a media briefing at the Disaster Management Ministry premises yesterday.
Minister Ratnayaka said it is unfair by the public servants, to say they were inefficient in responding to the disaster situation.
Minister Ratnayaka pointed out that the government is faced with severe difficulties at the initial stage of assessing and responding to the situation following a power failure, loss of land access to affected areas and a loss of communication due to mobile-signal towers being out of service.
The most prompt response to the disaster situation was given by the Sri Lanka Police, Minister Ratnayaka said. By 12 midnight on day one of the disaster, Sri Lanka Navy boats started rescue missions from Pitabeddara,the Minister said.
An Air Force officer dedicated his life rescuing affected citizens, Minister Ratnayaka pointed out.
All these officers representing the government of Sri Lanka, we should not forget, Minister Ratnayaka pointed out.
I saw an officer from the Ceylon Electricity Board stationed at a tower working in the dead of night while his family was displaced and taken to relief camps. That was the dedication shown by public servants during this natural calamity, Minister Ratnayaka added.

Prosperous Capital and Credit wins Green Leadership award
Prosperous Capital and Credit Limited (PCCL) has won global accolade and has being nominated for a Green Leadership award at the Asia Responsible Entrepreneurship Awards (AREA).
The awards ceremony organized by Aruna Liyanage, Senior Programme Manager, Prosperous Capital and Assurance Ltd, said that PCCL was set up just three years ago and receiving an international award speaks volumes about their success.
The project (Green Word) for which the award was won included the promotion of Green Agricultural practices.
This also included introduction of renewable energy, collecting e-waste, promoting organic farming and proper garbage recycling and disposal system.
Some of the key objectives of this award-winning project included giving support to achieve United Nations sustainable development goals, reduction of environment pollution, supporting domestic financial management, creating savings habits among people, increasing family health conditions and helping to increase their revenue and promoting organic farming.
PCCL Managing Director Madhawa Edussuriya said they are currently incorporated as a private limited company and has applied for the micro finance licence along with several other players from the Central Bank.
Edussuriya said the company which is run by a Board of veterans in the industry with over 20 years of local and foreign experience opened their first branch in Sooriyawewa, in August 2014.
This venture can be regarded as one among the firsts in the finance industry involving a region where micro finance had not yet penetrated. He said that they hope to open more branches in the North and East this year as they see a great demand for this model from these areas.
The awards ceremony would be held on June 1 in Thailand and is being organized by Malaysian-based Enterprise Asia, a non-governmental organization in pursuit of creating an Asia that is rich in entrepreneurship as an engine towards sustainable and progressive economic and social development within a world of economic equality.

Rabada sparks England slump as Proteas win 3rd ODI
LONDON, Monday: Kagiso Rabada sparked a dramatic England collapse as South Africa won by seven wickets to record a consolation win in the third one-day international at Lords on Monday.
England slumped to 20 for six -- the first time in an ODI that six wickets had gone down in the first five overs of an innings -- after losing the toss.
Jonny Bairstows fine fifty helped England recover to 153 all out.
But it never looked like being enough and South Africa finished on 156 for three, JP Duminy sealing victory with a four off David Willey.
England took the three-match series 2-1 but this was a morale-boosting success for the Proteas ahead of this weeks start of the Champions Trophy -- a tournament featuring the worlds top eight ODI nations.
Fast bowler Rabada took four wickets for 12 runs in his first three overs on his way to four for 39 in nine.
New ball colleague Wayne Parnell took three for 43 in eight.
There was something there for the bowlers today that all of us could capitalise, said Rabada.
There was a bit in the wicket in the first 10 overs and a bit of a bounce, which bodes well for the Champions Trophy.
England coach Trevor Bayliss added: We didnt play too well today but a 2-1 series over South Africa... well take that every day. We probably didnt read the conditions as well as we could have done but credit to them on a wicket which had a little bit in.
Todays result ensures we go into the Champions Trophy without big heads, the Australian said.
Bairstow apart, the only other England batsmen to make double figures were Willey (26) and number nine Toby Roland-Jones, who made an impressive 37 not out on his ODI debut, in a match played on the pacemans Middlesex home ground.
Hashim Amla (55) and Quinton de Kock (34) put on 95 for the first wicket but both openers fell on that total.
Amla became Roland-Joness first ODI wicket when he bottom-edged a pull onto his stumps and, three balls later, de Kock was yorked by Jake Ball.
But Duminy (28 not out) and South Africa captain AB de Villiers (27 not out) wrapped things up in a match where only 60 overs out of a scheduled 100 were bowled.
The consolation for England was their inept batting display had come before the Champions Trophy, which they launch across London against Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday.
An overcast morning and a green-tinged pitch meant it was no surprise when de Villiers opted to field first upon winning the toss.
The stats show theres something in it for the first 15 overs, said de Villiers at the toss. AFP

Sangakkara falls short of record-equalling century
LONDON, Monday - Kumar Sangakkara just missed out on a record-equalling feat when he failed to get to three figures for Surrey against Essex at Chelmsford on Monday.
The Sri Lanka star was bidding to become just the fourth player in the history of cricket to score hundreds in six successive first-class innings.
But he was dismissed for 84 when he chipped the ball back to occasional spinner Tom Westley in a First Division County Championship match.
That meant there was no place in the record books for Sangakkara, alongside England's CB Fry, Australia's Don Bradman, arguably cricket's greatest batsman, and South Africa's Mike Procter, all of whom made hundreds in six consecutive first-class innings.
Fry achieved the feat back in 1901 for Sussex and the Rest of England, Bradman in 1938/39 when playing for South Australia and his own DG Bradman XI and Procter in 1970/71 when representing Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in South African first-class cricket.
Had he got to his century on Monday, it would also have been the 100th hundred across all formats of left-hander Sangakkara's illustrious career. Last week the 39-year-old said he intended to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the English summer.
In that case he's certainly bowing out in style, with 853 runs in red-ball cricket at an average of just over 106 so far this season.
Sangakkara's last six first-class innings have seen him score 136 against Lancashire, 105 against Warwickshire, 114 and 120 against Middlesex -- in a match where his portrait was unveiled in the Lord's pavilion -- and 200 and 84 against Essex.
It had looked at one stage
that Sangakkara might not even get the chance to equal the record, with bad light leading to a stoppage of more than an hour on Monday when he was 79 not out.
His latest Championship innings saw Sangakkara face 107 balls, including 12 fours.
The four-day match itself ended in a draw, a result that saw Essex maintain their one-point advantage over Surrey at the top of the table.
Surrey and Essex meet again next week at Guildford, southwest of London, in what could be a key match in deciding the destiny of the Championship title. - AFP

Seven international teams monitoring disaster situation
Seven international search and rescue teams are currently monitoring the disaster situation in Sri Lanka with two teams ready to deploy upon receipt of official request, the UN office in Colombo said.
The UN office, in a statement, said that authorities have confirmed that no additional international search and rescue teams are required for the moment; however, should the situation worsen, the requirement will be reviewed, the statement added.
The statement goes on to say, based on previous emergencies, drinking water and non-food items (NFIs) were identified as immediate needs by the National Disaster Relief Services Centre.
The full extent of damage and needs is expected to be more clear once additional areas become accessible. The DMC has activated the International Space Charter Centre to obtain satellite imagery to support analysis of the flood damage. Cloud coverage, however, is constraining collection of images.
Five major river basins (Attanagalu, Gin, Kelani, Kalu and Nilwala) remain flooded. Water levels in Baddegama, Putupaula, continue to increase. The police headquarters announced that the Bolgoda Dam is at high risk of collapsing, putting Bandaragama, Panadura and surrounding areas at risk.
Mobile networks remain disrupted due to power failure. Electricity was cut in Avissawella, Bulathsinhala, Eheliyagoda, Embilipitiya, Kahawatta, Ratnapura and Ruwanwella districts as a safety measure due to the floods. The government continues search and rescue operations and have prioritized evacuation of people in high risk areas. Evacuation notices were issued in 33 divisional secretariats and surrounding areas in Galle, Hambantota, Kegalle, Kalutara, Matara, Nuwara Eliya and Ratnapura districts.
To date, over 1,000 people have been rescued by the Sri Lanka Armed Forces and Police. India has also deployed military assets and rescue teams to support the national response. Over the past several days, bilateral assistance was provided to the government and national partners. On May 28, China announced that a US$2.2 million in emergency humanitarian disaster relief goods (including tents, blankets and other NFIs) will be donated to communities affected by the floods and landslides. In addition, the Red Cross Society of China granted $100,000 in emergency cash grant to the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society. The United States also indicated it will provide 15 million rupees ($98,000) for the emergency response. Pakistan indicated additional relief goods are being mobilized.
On May 29, an ad hoc Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) meeting was convened to take stock of the ongoing response and existing in-country capacity to provide additional support. HCT member partners are supporting ongoing rescue operations and have donated hygiene kits, jerry cans, water purification tablets for distribution by local authorities.
The HCT is also providing technical support to line ministries on information management, analysis and coordination of medical teams.

In the shadow of time
From the 1950s up to 1980s, the photographic studio shone. It was the habit of parents to get a studio sitting of their children on special occasions like birthdays, Holy Communion, school victory events. As a family, they walk into a studio with their relatives to pose for group photographs. Wedding photographs were for Christians after the church mass, while Buddhists made it following the Poruwa to secure memories. The photographs, toned in black and white, could be kept for several decades.
But now it is quite different.
By the time the Poruwa ceremony is over like the hot cakes just taken off the oven, the studio located near the Poruwa. Video too has entered the scene. With all this, the vintage photographic studios idle around and the photographers have lost the money spin in the field. Sadly the coloured pictures taken spontaneously cannot be kept for several decades. The colours of a photograph or the video clip just get damaged.
Then it comes to stenographers. What is shorthand, the 21st-century teenagers would ask. Stenos are no more. The taping devices and computers have already encroached into this field.
But at parliament and courts, still, the stenographers are recognised but behind the screen. A secretary or a personal assistant is not wanted as the boss himself operates the computer.


The traditional reel is also affected by the modern techniques. If not for a salient story, people just feel it is a wastage of time sitting at a cinema studio for two to three hours.
For oriental dances, cha-cha-cha, jive, waltzes, there are no academies. People look forward to freestyle steps. These dances depict some disciplined culture. Where singing is concerned, the lyrics in the 1950s had some value to the nation. The modern era has introduced lyric-writing with no meaning at all. The tunes with rap and other methods have harmed the original singing.
In time to come, the postman will not be required especially in developing and developed countries. The modern techniques have introduced wonders; within seconds one could contact anyone in any continent.
The radios will come to a standstill. The artists will have to perform in concerts and shows. People will prefer more sophisticated media.
It was such a custom when a bride would leave home. The lion flag was hoisted to show everyone that a wedding is around the corner. The raban players, the lighting of crackers, and all that has been buried. Today the families with the bride go to hotels, booking rooms, one to the bridegroom and one for the brides crowd. At the auspicious time, bride leaves a hotel room seeing the groom by the side.
What beauty it was then. The excitement at homes is nowhere now. The parade of cars accompanying the bride and groom is nowhere in sight. This escalates family unity and the strength of the family. Now nobody knows anybody.
In funeral houses too it is quite different. Some are in the habit of wearing coloured dresses to rejoice that the deceased has entered heaven. Mourning colours black and white is not visible. Also, it is the vogue behind which they hide their feelings and do not cry. They just hold a hanky to the nose silently and weep. The vogue is that.
The toddy-tappers are hard to find as much as the goviralas with the mammoty on their shoulders. The buffaloes are not to be sighted, the machines have taken their place. The world has vastly developed the paddy field owners child too would like to be a desk officer with a computer in front rather than taking the risks. Children would prefer carrying a computer to a mammoty.
The seamstresses have faded away. Sewing does not count. The teenagers order their style through the Internet. The old ladies used to knead jerseys and do needlework. The modern personalities have grown old and they are not aware or seen these knitting and needlework, which you found gonna the days beautiful baby kits in wool and lovely frocks with stitched birds/animals/fairies/butterflies. Most of all the people would prefer to wear shorts and jeans rather than butterfly type hand stitched dresses. This sewing too embraces the family together. The sewing machine is now out of sight. A dowry for a girl to be married was another qualification during the bygone days.
But they admire the modern dress with straps and short kits. The olden-day brides wear full white and fully covered dresses.

Thunder hidden in silence
Come, all of Humanity, Irrespective of cast, creed or religion, and awaken to taste Rumi's religion of love. The world is whirling to the beat of love. Learn the secrets of the whirling dervishes.
You who possess not Love, it is lawful to you-sleep on;
Be gone, for Love and Love's sorrow is our portion  sleep on.
We have become motes of the sun of sorrow for the Beloved;
You in whose heart this passion has never arisen, sleep on.
You who are not anguished by the question Where is He  sleep on.
(Jalaluddin Rumi)
Have, the mesmerizing drumbeats of war, hatred and terror, of a fanatic fringe, that spares no border, entranced the rest of mankind into a languid stupor of apathy and fear
Have, we forgotten God's joyous pronouncement:
O Mankind, we created you from a single pair of a male and a female, and made you in to tribes and nations so that you may know each other (not that you despise each other). (Al-Quran, from Chapter 49, Verse 13).
Have these words been confined to scriptures
I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear (Bhagavad Gita 9.29).
There is a neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus'.
(Bible, Galatians 3.28) and;
So what of all these titles, names, and races They are mere worldly conventions (Buddhism. Sutta Nipata 648).
Is it not time for the silent masses, to wake up from their slumber to celebrate the joy of creation and reach out to God in love and ardour
What better way to do so than to swirl in the whirlpool of Jalaluddin Rumi!
At every instant and from every side, resounds the call of Love:
We are going to sky, who wants to come with us
We have gone to heaven, we have been the friends of the angels, and now we will go back there, for there is our country.
We are higher than heaven, more noble that the angels:
Why not go beyond them Our goal is the Supreme Majesty
(The above verse is from the Sufi Poetry of Jalaludin Rumi)
Awaken Sri Lanka, as we will soon have amongst us, in our very own shores, the renowned Ahamed Dede Pattisahusiwa, teacher of the Whirling Dervish Meditation, who is one of the most devoted followers of Jalaluddin Rumi the great Sufi, Saint, Poet, Mystic and Scholar.
Ahmad Dede Pattisahusiwa, with eastern roots and a western upbringing (Indonesia and Netherlands respectively), presently leads the Haqqani-Mevlevi Suif Order. He has made it his life's mission to propagate the teaching of Jalaluddin Rumi. He travels the world, preaching the spirituality of love and conducting workshops in the art of meditation through whirling. Spreading Rumi's Religion of Love, he strives to repose in the hearts of the discerning seeker the secrets of meditation though whirling.
He is guided by Rumi's vision of love that transcends the bounds of cast, creed and colour:
What can I do, Muslims I do not know myself. I am neither Christian nor Jew, neither Magian nor Muslim,
I am not from east or west, not from land or sea, not from the shafts of nature nor from the spheres of the firmament,
Not of the earth, not of water, not of air, not of fire. I am not from the highest heaven, not from this world.
Not from existence, not from being. I am not from India, not from China, not from Bulgar, not from Saqsin,
Not from the realm of the two Iraqs, not from the land of Khurasan. I am not from the world, not from beyond, not from heaven and not from hell.
I am not from Adam, not from Eve, not from paradise and not from Ridwan.
My place is placeless, my trace is traceless, no body, no soul, I am from the soul of souls.
(The above verse is from the Sufi Poetry of Jalaluddin Rumi).
Whirling is not just a technique, whirling is not just a dance or simply a meditation. Whirling is learning about Love and connecting the heart with heavens. I reality, behind the veil of whirling there is a spiritual opening. Whirling becomes a door in the form of an active meditation that aims to help the Lord's servants to experience unity and annihilation so that only God's beauty manifests through them.
So:
Come, come whoever you may be, come again,
And be you non believer, Magian or idolater, Come again,
For Ours is not a Dergah of despair!
Though you may have broken Your repentance a hundred times
Come Again and Again

UN chief Guterres says climate deal is essential

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said it is "absolutely essential" that the world unite to combat the threat from climate change.
Speaking in New York, Guterres said if any country doubted the need for the2015 Paris climate accord, then other countries must "stay the course".
He was speaking after US President Donald Trump refused to join other leaders of the G7 group of rich nations in reaffirming support for the accord.
He is due to decide the US stance soon.
President Trump has previously dismissed global warming as a "hoax" created by China and has threatened to pull out of the Paris accord.
Guterres was making his first major statement on climate since taking office as UN chief five months ago.
"If any government doubts the global will and need for this accord, that is reason for all others to unite even stronger and stay the course," he told the audience at New York University.
"The message is simple: the sustainability train has left the station. Get on board or get left behind."
He added: "The world is in a mess. It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris agreement."
Responding to questions, he said: "We believe that it would be important for the US not to leave the Paris agreement.
"But even if the government decides to leave the Paris agreement, it's very important for US society as a whole - the cities, the states, the companies, the businesses - to remain engaged."
New York and California have already pledged to combat climate change without the Trump administration's support.
The UN chief said he intended to convene a summit in 2019 to review progress on implementing the Paris accord.
"Climate change is undeniable. Climate action is unstoppable," he said.
The US is one of more than 140 countries and organisations that have ratified the agreement, but Trump railed against it on the campaign trail saying it was bad for the US economy. He has repeatedly promised to strengthen the coal industry.
The Paris deal is the world's first comprehensive climate agreement, with the aim of keeping the global average rise in temperatures below 2C.
In order to do that, countries pledge to reduce their carbon emissions.
Last weekend President Trump left the G7 summit in Sicily without reaffirming his commitment to the accord, unlike the other six world leaders in attendance.

Wagner taunts critics as Huddersfield hit promotion jackpot
London: David Wagners arrival at Huddersfield Town was greeted with scorn, but just 18 months later the German has silenced the critics by masterminding his clubs fairytale promotion to the Premier League.
When Wagner was plucked from his role as Borussia Dortmunds reserve team coach by Huddersfield owner Dean Hoyle in November 2015, many pundits claimed his lack of experience in the cut-throat world of the second-tier Championship meant the appointment was doomed to failure.
Ian Holloway, then a television pundit and now Queens Park Rangers manager, labelled Huddersfield as candidates for relegation at the start of this season.
But Holloway and the rest of the doubters underestimated the urbane Wagners pioneer spirit, inspirational personality and tactical prowess.
Having revitalised his team with a host of youngsters signed on loan from the Premier League, Wagner rewarded Hoyles faith in spectacular fashion at Wembley on Monday as Huddersfield beat Reading 4-3 on penalties after a 0-0 draw to return to the top flight for the first time in 45 years.
Winning promotion, which is worth 170 million ($218 million, 195 million euros) to the Terriers, was a sweet moment for Wagner and, drenched in champagne from his players celebrations, he arrived at a post-match press conference keen to remind his critics how far he had come in such a short time.
By the way Ian Holloway, all the best for next season, Wagner said.
I know a lot of the pundits wrote us off. Im so happy to prove experience is not essential, especially here in England which is so traditional.
Ive been in confrontation with experience ever since Ive been here. People said Im not used to English football, Im not used to not having a winter break, and Id never been in the play-offs before.
Well, experience is important, but if you have passion and ideas you can match it.
Wagners triumph is even more impressive when you consider Huddersfields budget ranked among the lowest in the second tier. AFP

Zverev, Konta flop at French Open
PARIS: Alexander Zverev, the man seen as a potential French Open champion, crashed out in the first round Tuesday while Johanna Konta became the second top 10 womens player to exit.
Zverev, just 20 and fresh from his sensational Rome Masters demolition of Novak Djokovic, slumped to a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 defeat to Spains Fernando Verdasco, 13 years his senior.
I played absolute shit, thats why I lost, said Zverev.
But life goes on, its not a tragedy. In Rome I played fantastic, I won the tournament. Here I played bad, I lost first round. Thats the way it goes. In a match controversially suspended on Monday at one set each, Zverev was defeated in a fog of mistakes and despondency.
The beanpole German committed 50 unforced errors and drew jeers from the Philippe Chatrier court crowd when he took out his frustration by hammering his racquet into the clay.
Konta is the second top 10 woman to lose in the first three days after world number one Angelique Kerber was also dumped out in the first round.
I tried very hard and gave myself a big chance. Every time I tried to run as fast as I can and get the ball back, said Hsieh, who won for the just the second time in seven trips to Roland Garros. nta has yet to win one match in the main draw in three attempts. AFP
