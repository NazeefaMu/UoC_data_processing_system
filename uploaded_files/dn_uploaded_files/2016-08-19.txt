Bolt cruises into 200m final

Rio de Janeiro, Thursday: Usain Bolt takes the second step towards immortality and Copacabana is the battlefield for the remarkable Brownlee brothers at the Olympics on Thursday.
Usain Bolt advanced to the final for the 200 meters with the fastest time of the year and is one win away from his eighth Olympic gold medal.
Bolt ran 19.78 seconds, pushed all the way by Canadas Andre de Grasse in the lane beside him, in the second of two semifinal heats at Rio. He earns an automatic place in Thursdays final. De Grasse finished in 19.80 seconds to advance.
Justin Gatlin, who ran Bolt closest in the 100m on Sunday, failed to make it out of his semi.
If Bolt triumphs that will leave him requiring a win in Saturday's 4x100m relay to achieve the triple triple of sprint titles from the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Games.
The 200m is one of 26 medals on the table as Rio approaches the home straight with only four days of the first Games to be staged in South America remaining.
The men's 400m hurdles includes Ireland's Thomas Barr who was so surprised by his semi-final win asked endearingly: When is the final!
There are also gold medals on offer in men's shotput and women's javelin and the decathlon.
US star Ashton Eaton leads Germany's Kai Kazmirek going into the five concluding legs of the decathlon -- 110m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1500m.
At 2359 local time a whistle will be blown on Copacabana to signal the start of the men's beach volleyball final.
The midnight match sees hosts Brazil up against Italy.
Earlier, the iconic beach location will be the setting for the latest battle between British siblings Alistair and Jonny Brownlee in the triathlon.
Alistair struck gold in London 2012, with Jonny, two years younger, claiming bronze.
In the boxing ring, Julio Caesar La Cruz is trying to complete Cuba's Olympic gold medal set.
Cuba have won gold in every category, except light heavyweight. Standing in La Cruz's way is Kazakh Adilbek Niyazymbetov.
It's a hectic day on the water with four finals at the canoeing and another four in sailing after two regattas had to be held over from Wednesday.
In the pool, Russia are out to continue their total domination of synchronised swimming stretching back to the Sydney 2000 Games in the team contest. And it's the women's 10m platform diving final. Up at the Deodoro military camp, Argentina and Belgium clash in the men's hockey final, both countries having their first shot at Olympic gold.
There are also golds to be had in women's wrestling and taekwondo.
At the badminton it's Japan v Denmark in the women's doubles final.
And at the basketball, in women's semi-final action, Spain face Serbia and France take on the USA. AFP

Jamaicas Elaine Thompson  wins womens 200m gold

Jamaicas Elaine Thompson won Olympic gold in the 200m to complete a sprint double in Rio.
Thompson, 24, clocked 21.78 seconds to beat Netherlands world champion Dafne Schippers by 0.13sec and add the 200m title to the gold she won in the 100m.
USAs Tori Bowie took bronze in 22.15, while Great Britains Dina Asher-Smith, 20, ran 22.31 to finish fifth.
It is a very special and welcoming feeling for me. I think my light has shined, Thompson told BBC Sport. Watching Veronica Campbell-Brown, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and then putting my name there is an amazing feeling. Campbell-Brown won the Olympic 200m title at Athens 2004 and retained it in Beijing 2008, while Fraser-Pryce took 100m gold at both Beijing and London 2012. In all, Jamaica have won 10 of the past 11 Olympic golds in the 100m and 200m, with Usain Bolt a strong favourite to extend that record in Thursdays mens 200m final (02:30 BST, Friday).
Asher-Smith ran from lane two in her first Olympic final - posting her fastest time of the year but 0.24secs under her personal best. I am really happy, I think I still could have done a bit better but I cant be disappointed with that, she said.
It is a learning curve and hopefully Ill have more world championships and Olympics to get it right. Schippers, 24, has a personal best of 21.63, making her the fastest European in history and one of the five quickest women of all time.
However, she could not quite get the better of Thompson, who pulled away from her in the final 50 metres. BBC

Deputy Foreign Minister calls  for greater US investment

Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva requested the US government to urge American businesses to invest in Sri Lanka.
This was emphasised at several bilateral discussions he held with US officials in Washington DC on August 16.
The deputy minister was on a brief visit to the US capital to continue Sri Lankas expanding engagement with the United States on multiple areas of cooperation.
The deputy minister met with US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labour Tom Malinowski, Assistant Secretary of State for Commerce Arun Kumar and Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Michael Delaney, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Trade Policy and Programmes William Craft, and Deputy Vice President of the Millennium Challenge Corporation Thomas Kelly.
Dr. de Silva, during his conversations briefed the officials on recent developments in Sri Lanka with respect to reconciliation as well as economic and investment policy reforms. Recalling the governments twin policy objectives of reconciliation and development, he reiterated the governments aim to ensure a peace dividend for the people, for the country to progress toward enduring peace and development.
The US government officials acknowledged the vast progress Sri Lanka has made since the government came into office last year. The regular visits by high level US officials to Sri Lanka mirror the interest and the potential for multifaceted engagement with the United States in the burgeoning bilateral relationship. Ongoing cooperation with Sri Lanka under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) since December 2015 is yet another important element of US bilateral development assistance to Sri Lanka.
It was reiterated that US engagement in Sri Lanka through its development agencies such as United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and MCC will continue to evolve to assist Sri Lanka in meeting its needs and priorities, both in short and long-term.

Party membership of those who go against Party Constitution to be suspended: Duminda

The party membership of those who go against the Party Constitution will be suspended, SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said. 
He was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday on the remark of President Maithripala Sirisena that the 51 MPs who try to divide the party and violate the party discipline could lose their Parliament seats. 
However, the minister declined to elaborate on the comment stating that it was an internal matter of the party and would be revealed in due course. 
He said the revision of electoral and district organisers was made, not considering their personal affiliations, adding that it was a move towards the restructuring of the party. "None of the new appointments was based on the fact whether they were aligned with President Sirisena or whether they hold anti-Mahinda Rajapaksa views. Some were removed as they had not performed their duties. We have no intention of removing the Joint Opposition members from the SLFP. However, all members should hold the party line if we are to carry forward the party," he said. 
Dissanayake said despite removing from organiser posts, all have been invited to take part in the SLFP 65th Convention to be held in Kurunegala. He said former Presidents Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga have been specially invited as they are senior patrons of the party, adding that as of the reservation of seats President Sirisena would be flanked by both the former Presidents. He said this arrangement was done to send a strong signal of unity and power of the SLFP. 
He said the representatives of all other parties, including the UNP have also been invited to take part in the party's convention to add their well wishes. 
He said the SLFP with its new organiser appointments would give special concern for the youth, trade union leaders, professionals and women. He said the party has expanded its activities in the North and East, adding that the vacant organiser posts in these areas would be filled shortly. 
Former MP Shantha Bandara said 95 percent of the newly appointed Electoral and District Organisers were supporting former President Rajapaksa during the previous elections. 
"All those were expecting the victory of the 'betel leaf'. If the party had been led by either former Presidents Rajapaksa or Chandrika Kumataunga, the decisions of party restructuring would have come much earlier. President Sirisena was patient for so long as he wanted to unite the party," he said.
