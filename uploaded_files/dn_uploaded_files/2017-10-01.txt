Heavy vehicles banned from entering Galle World Heritage site

The Police has taken measures to ban heavy vehicles from entering the Galle world heritage site from October 01.
According to the decision, vehicles exceeding 3 meters in height and 5 Tonnes in weight will not be allowed to enter the Galle world heritage site.
Although the gazette notification in this regard was issued in 2009, it was not put into force for nearly eight years.
The measures is aimed at preserving and protecting the site which is considered one of the most prominent historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument in the world .
In February, this year, a lorry crashed into the arch at the entrance of the Galle Fort and damaged its structure.
"Apart from the preservation and protection of heritage properties, this will also minimize traffic congestion inside the Fort during rush hours and ensure the safety of pedestrians," the Police Media Unit said.
