Stipend paid to nurses increased by Rs. 10,000

The allowance paid to the lecturers who teach at Nurses Training Schools (NTC) will be increased by Rs. 10,000, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a ceremony held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) in Colombo recently to mark the International Nurses Day he said that the relevant circular to pay Rs. 10,000 was issued by the Finance Minister on May 13.
The over-time payments of health employees will be paid with effect from January 01 in 2016, he said.
According to Dr. Minister Senaratne, the salaries of public sector employees had been increased by Rs. 10,000. At least another 10,000 more nurses are required for the service. But adequate number of nurses are not being produced. The four-year nurses training programme cut down for three years due to various pressures and this is very unfair, he said.
At the moment lecturers of NTCs receive only Rs. 10,000. There are about 168 lecturers in NTCs at the moment. Nursing profession will be made an eminent profession in next two years, he added.
