Lahiru hands England U19s their first home-defeat after six years
Lahiru Kumara, stoutly-built seamer from Trinity College, Kandy completing an outstanding bowling effort with eleven-wicket match haul fired Sri Lanka U19 to a seven-wicket victory in the second and final Youth Test against their English counterparts at County Ground, Northampton to win the two-match series 1-0. It was England U19s first home defeat in a 4-day game after six years and it was the same opposition that defeated England on that occasion too in 2010.
The young Lions after they got acclimatized to English conditions sooner than expected played so well in the first leg of their tour, the two-match Youth Test series that even in the first four-day Test Sri Lanka after following on came back very strongly to force a stubborn draw in the end before their series-claimed victory in the second.
Unlike in the first match, Sri Lanka maintained their dominance right throughout the second Test especially with the ball as they could restrict the home team, who batted first on invitation, to a below-par 208 despite skipper Max Holdens unbeaten century after an opening stand of 91 with Olly Westbury who made 45. From healthy 91 for no loss, they suddenly hiccoughed to 107 for six after Lahiru Kumaras dramatic first spell that earned him the first five wickets to fall in the Englands innings before he wrapped up the innings to a meagre 208 with two more wickets in his second spell bringing his wicket-tally in the first innings to 7 for 82.
Lankans in their reply lost Dilan Jayalath, Wanindu Hasaranga and Sammu Ashan cheaply, but Avishka Fernando (49) and skipper Charith Asalanka (33) repaired the damage with two good stands for the second and fifth wickets before Navindu Nirmal who top scored with an unbeaten 80 and Jehan Daniel scoring a brisk 52 saw Sri Lanka gain a healthy first innings lead of 99. George Panayi and Ed Barnes claimed three wickets each for England.
Though England needed a good second innings total if they were to make any inroads in this crucial match, they could not quite do it after Lahiru Kumara who added four more wickets to his match tally and Praveen Jayawickrama claiming three wickets reduced Englands second innings to 192 in which only Olly Westbury could make a substantial score.
Sri Lanka requiring just 94 to win gunned down the target in just under 11 overs to win the match by seven wickets thereby winning the series 1-0.
England U19 : 208 in 82.2 overs (MDE Holden 111*, OE Westbury 45, Lahiru Kumara 7/82) and 192 in 66.4 overs (OE Westbury 41, Lahiru Kumara 4/52, Praveen Jayawickrama 3/38)
Sri Lanka U19 : 307 in 84 overs (Navindu Nirmal 80*, Jehan Daniel 52, Avishka Fernando 49, Charith Asalanka 33, George Panayi 3/51, Ed Barnes 3/38) and 94/3 in 10.2 overs (Charith Asalanka 40, George Panayi 2/25)

Heshan Flex claim MCA F-Div. Championship
The all round contributions of Buddika Prasad and Risith Upamal Dias immensely helped Heshan Flex clinch 2016 MCA F-div. Championship when the former scoring a match-winning 41 and the latter claiming a five-for steered Heshan Flex to a 36-run win over Nippon Paint in the finals of MCA F-div. concluded recently at MCA Grounds.
Heshan Flex batting first after winning the toss scored an imposing 198 in 25 overs with Buddika Prasad (41), Gayan Prasanga (28) and Harshana Deshan (27) making the bulk of scoring. Nippons Heshan de Silva and Daham Liyanage shared seven wickets between them.
Nippon got off to a reasonable start on the back of 69 scored by Tharanga Indika, but his isolated effort was not sufficient to save them from defeat as Risith Upamal Dias claiming a match-winning five-for restricted Nippon to 162 in just over 24 overs to win the match for Heshan Flex by 36 runs.
Heshan Flex : 198 in 25 overs (Buddika Prasad 41, Gayan Prasanga 28. Harshana Deshan 27, Heshan de Silva 4/42, Daham Liyanage 3/57)
Nippon Paint : 162 in 24.4 overs (Tharanga Indika 69, Risith Upamal Dias 5/21)

Five teams qualify for the final stage
The second round of 2016 under 17 division-one tournament comprising the 32 teams qualified from the first round has now progressed up to a position with 15 teams qualified to the pre-quarter stage of the final round out of the 16 due after they became Group-Champions and runners-up of the 8 groups in the second round.
Despite the fact that only one out of the two qualifiers from Group Q has been selected as two more matches remain to be played in this group, both qualifiers of other seven groups have already been declared.
Only five teams; St. Sebastian's College (A) Moratuwa, D.S.Senanayake College (A) Colombo, Ananda College (A) Colombo, St. Aloysius College Galle and Richmond College Galle out of the ten qualified to second round as group champions of the first round have been able to go through to the final round whilst the rest, Maris Stella College Negombo (unbeaten in the first round), Mahanama College (A) Colombo (unbeaten), St. Joseph Vaz College Wennappuwa ( won all six), St. Johns College Jaffna (won 5 out of 7) and Dharmaraja College, Kandy (won 6 out of 7) all failed to qualify.
In groups R, S and W, the two qualifiers had to be decided on Net Run Rate as the top three teams finished their second round matches on equal points. Lumbini, Dharmapala and St.Sylvesters were the three unlucky teams whose NRR was not sufficient to go through to the final round.

As in group C, the two teams next to the leader SSC in Group D, Chilaw and Kalutara with same number of wins met each other at FTZ, Katunayaka in an extremely decisive tussle today before Chilaw won the battle by 62 runs to gain the ascendancy. When Chilaw took the first lease, Thikshila de Silva (62) and Raveen Yasas (32) helped them reach a competitive 160 before Chilaw bowlers led by Charith Rajapaksha bowled splendidly to restrict Kalutara reply to a total fewer than hundred to win the match by a wide margin.
Chilaw MCC U23: 160/8 in 20 overs (Thikshila de Silva 62, Raveen Yasas 32*, Gayan Chamara 2/32, Geeth Perera 2/18, Rusiru Ravishanka 2/28)
