State, Government must defend former Army Commander from war crimes allegation: Champika
The State and the Government should intervene on behalf of Former Chief of Defence Staff and Commander of the Sri Lankan Army Jagath Jayasuriya to defeat the war crimes allegations levelled against him by a South American Human Rights Organization, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Leader and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing a media conference held yesterday at the JHU office.
"The Sri Lankan military defeated the LTTE in 2009 putting an end to the killings of civilians and armed groups. Even the countries such as the USA, France, who considered LTTE as liberators are now experiencing cruelty of terrorism," he said.
The Minister urged the Tamil communities not to promote any attempt that destroy peace and reconciliation of the country.
Commenting on the incident of distributing leaflets in the North claiming that the LTTE was still in operation and was planning to revive its operations, Minister Ranawaka said such incidents occurred during past few years after defeating the LTTE.
He stressed the necessity of suppressing any attempt of destroying prevailing reconciliation of the country cold kindheartedly.

A strange revelation
Director General of the Bribery Commission Sarath Jayamanne PC has made a strange revelation at the eleventh hour, as it were. He says that the Bribery Act and the Assets and Liabilities law , in their present form, lacked teeth for the Commission to go on an all out offensive to tackle bribery and corruption. Speaking to the Daily News, he said that although the 19th Amendment enabled the Commission to act on its own volition, without waiting for complaints, they were hamstrung for want of sufficient muscle power in terms of a strong Bribery Act and also by way of manpower and infrastructure. He says the Act, has not been changed for 21 years. Although the 19th Amendment is there, it has been rendered ineffective due to existing legal barriers and lack of infrastructure. He went onto state that in other countries there were specialized intelligence units operating all over the country and their anti graft bodies were filtered with information provided by those intelligence officers. We do not have such a system here. If we are to initiate investigations on our own we need witnesses and evidence. He also said the Commission was not empowered to investigate into money laundering although this is a serious offense.
So, now we have the Head of the countrys premier bribery investigating body claiming that its hands are tied due to the archaic anti- graft legislation in the statute books. Why, pray, was no action taken to remedy this situation, at the outset, when the 19th Amendment was passed, over two years ago Surely the Attorney Generals Department should have picked on this anomaly Was this glaring omission not pointed out to the former Justice Minister who burnt the midnight oil to get the 19th amendment into shape So, now, according to the DG's own admission, things are still in abeyance because nobody thought it fit to ascertain if the Bribery Act needed to be amended to go hand in hand with the 19th Amendment. It is only now that it has dawned on the DG that the Act needs amending, after taking over his new duties over one year ago.
True, the role of the Bribery Commission has got somewhat diluted with the advent of investigation bodies such as the FCID, but even in the best of times, the BC, it has to be said, had been dawdling. This is in contrast to the days of Ian Wickramanayake, and to a lesser extent, Nelum Gamage, where the Bribery Commission, admittedly, was more dynamic and result oriented, even with the archaic Bribery Act to contend with. The BC was always in the news for netting in high profile figures, though it could be argued that these were mostly political vendettas. The DG also says that they have succeeded in clearing the heavy backlog of case files to a great extent amidst limited resources. He said they have brought down the number of pending cases from 10,000 to 4,050 during the last two years. The Commission filed 24 cases in the magistrate's court and 26 cases in the high court this year, he says.
But, apart from the successful prosecution of a lady school principal, some police constables and Grama Sevakas, the public have yet to witness the arraignment of a big time crook. Or is it the DGs case that they are helpless to apprehend those who have amassed illegal assets, due to the inadequacies in the Assets and Liabilities law and that only those falling within the scope of the Bribery Act, in its present form, such as school principals and police constables are fair game Whatever happened to all the bribery cases against the Rajapaksa acolytes What became of the case of a former deputy minister in the Rajapaksa government, who pleaded that he was stung by a polanga, when summoned by the Bribery Commission (during the time of the former regime) to answer how he acquired assets to the value of Rs. 40 million. True, this case is still being heard and the suspect told to appear and reappear in court for what seems to be an interminable length of time.
Be that as it may, the Bribery Commission should play a more dynamic role and go after the big fish, now that it does not a need a complaint to act. It should move for the necessary amendments, without delay, bestowing it with full powers to act effectively and independently.
WWs love for the police
Joint Opposition front liner Wimal Weerawansa has taken up cudgels on behalf of the Police officers serving in the North. He has reportedly told a newspaper that police personnel are being harassed in the north and they were prevented from performing their legitimate duties.
This is the same individual who led a mob that grabbed a police officer from his uniform while another hooligan removed the policemans hat, opposite the UN compound in Colombo, after he (Weerawansa) was given the green light by Gota to do as they please.

In his petition, MP Sumanthiran cited D.M. Swaminathan the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, Arcellor Mittal Construction France and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioners stated that there are irregularities in the tender process awarding the contract to construct houses for the war affected to the French company. He further said that there is lack of durability of the said prefabricated steel houses and environmental unsuitability of the said prefabricated houses. The petitioner further alleged that the respondents are not employing local labour in the implementation of the project to construct the said prefabricated houses.
"I am further aware that the District Co-ordinating committees of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts of which I am a member also passed unanimous decision on or around September 27, 2016 rejecting the said prefabricated steel houses," the petitioner added.

Toddy tapper files FR against Police
Seeking bribes from persons engaged in lawful businesses:
Falsely prosecuting persons to meet targets:
A person engaged in the lawful business of toddy tapping as his vocation yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court. He was challenging the activities of the Kitulgala Police to produce persons who refuse to comply with the wrongful demands to provide toddy free of charge, before Courts purportedly in relation to illicit liquor offenses.
Gamaralalage Siril Kumara of Kitulgala filed this petition along with two other relatives naming Inspector Chanaka Wijeratne, the OIC of Kithulgala Police Station, SI Gunasena, SI Senaratne, Sergeant Sandamal, Sergeant Gunawardena of Kitulgala police station and IGP Pujith Jayasundara as respondents.
The Petitioners stated that various officers of the Kitulgala Police engage in the wrongful and illegal practice of requiring persons engaged in the lawful business of Toddy Tapping in the Kitulgala area to bribe the said officers of the Kitulgala with quantities of Toddy for their consumption. They said Kitulgala Police engage in the wrongful and illegal practice of producing persons who refuse to comply with the wrongful demands to provide toddy free of charge, before Courts purportedly in relation to illicit liquor offenses. They occasionally prosecute various persons on the false basis of possession of illicit liquor to meet the prosecution targets set by the superior officers of the Police Department. Such persons prosecuted in such a manner are compelled to plead guilty for the possession of small quantities of illicit liquor and pay penalties ranging from Rs.1,000 to Rs.15,000. The failure to comply with such illegal demands results with further harassment and intimidation by the police officers.
The Petitioners stated on July 28, 2017 at around 4.30 p.m. the 3rd and 4th Respondents arrived at the 1st Petitioners residence and took into possession a small quantity of Toddy which was lawfully tapped by the 1st Petitioner and claimed that the 1st Petitioner has illegally tapped Toddy.
When the 1st Petitioner offered to provide the Permit issued by the Department of Excise the 3rd and 4th Respondents refused to accept the said document stating we dont care about those things and demanded that the 1st Petitioner prepare himself to go to the Police Station.
The petitioners stated that the 1st Petitioner having not committed any offense, as he lawfully might, refused to comply with the unlawful and illegal instructions given by the 3rd and 4th Respondents, being very well aware that the 1st Petitioner would be falsely and wrongfully arrested, remanded overnight and produced before the Magistrate of Ruwanwella on a possession of illicit liquor charge. Thereafter the 3rd and 4th Respondents forcefully dragged the 1st Petitioner out of his residence and assaulted the 1st Petitioner whereupon the 1st Petitioner collapsed to the ground due to the excruciating pain he was subjected to.
The Petitioners state that the brazen attack on the 1st Petitioner who was laying on the floor in pain was in full view of those who were gathered including the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners, who commenced recoding the incident using their mobile telephones.
They stated the assault on the Petitioners the wrongful and arbitrary arrest of the Petitioners and institution of action on false and fabricated charges leveled against the Petitioners are violative of the 2nd Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 11, Article 12(1), and Article 13(1) of the Constitution of the Republic.
They further sought a sum of Rs.5 million as compensation from the respondents.
This petition had been filed through counsel Thisya Weragoda and Niluka Dissanayake.

United we win!
The power of love and vision can be seen in the Drama Club of Maris Stella College where drama is a gift given to the students. Dramatic Moves features the Maris Stella Drama Club which have a reason to be proud for their prowess in drama.
Teacher in Charge of Maris Stella College Drama Club, Nirmala Wijedasa is known as the Mother of Shakespearean drama at Maris Stella. It was she who identified the potential value of the Shakespeare Drama competition. Her vision and love was shared by the school authorities and Maris Stella began their stellar journey
The students through drama build up self- confidence and I have seen how they are doing so well in their future careers. They have enjoyed and they have gained a lot from doing drama. They have built up their personalities. I am proud to say that the old boy Ashan Dias is acting in the silver screen and is very successful. Daminda Wijeratne is also successful. Daminda Wijeratne comes and helps in Shakespeare competitions in a big way, said Wijedasa.
Drama is loads of fun but doing practices can be very tiring, practising after school and late night and then coming back to school in the morning. However it is not in vain. The happiness that victory brings cannot be measured in words. For Wijedasa and her young thespians words are inadequate to describe the pleasure they receive when they emerge victorious or even get into the finals. The tension awaiting for results can be nerve racking and nothing is sweeter than being announced the winner.
Wijedasa mentioned that Delon Weerasinghe, is one of the Best Directors they have ever had along with Jerome De Silva. She always gives her fullest support to the Director while overseeing the practices. Then it is only a matter of pulling off a really good production.
I always speak to my students about dedication, commitment and sacrifice and spur them on! Without that we cannot achieve anything. I always keep on telling them this. I am also a little strict with them as well. One of my duties is to see that they have studied the lines when the director comes. The team spirit is also very important. It is not a one man show because everyone has to be united, said Wijedasa
Wijedasa always has an ear. She understands that in order for an actor to completely be immersed in his role, he needs to detach himself from any problem. So she is available day or night to talk.
Very complex
President, Maris Stella Drama Club, Sheran Costa feels that the greatness of Shakespeare is that though he lived during the 16th  17th century, his content is so relevant to real life in the 21st century and will still be relevant in the future.
One Shakespearean character that he mostly relates to is Benedick from Much Ado About Nothing. The character details of Benedick are strikingly similar to his own experiences. Hence he does not need to put much of an effort into playing the character since it comes naturally to him. Those who have read the plays of the bard would agree with Sheran that characters like those in Shakespeares plays can be seen in real life. This is why Shakespeare is read even today because he is timeless. We see these characters in real life. One would say that this is a trait of all great writers. Even Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen or Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte contain characters that are real life copies. You can see them in society.
Sometimes I see my father in Shakespearean plays. I see a certain Catherine in Mrs. Nirmala as well! She is strict but nice. I see a Don John (Much ado about nothing) in Reshain, said Costa.
Costa pointed out that the reason he was able to face our interview was because of Drama. It has definitely molded his diction. We are able to understand what kind of mindset villainous people have. What kind of mindset would a cunning person have In a way students of drama can predict a persons reactions.
Costa also pointed out that he has once played Mark Antony. Antony was considered Caesars right hand man. After the Ides of March, Antony delivered a powerful speech showing the Romans how great Caesar had been, turning public opinion against Brutus and Cassius. Mark Antony was the kind of person who could influence peoples minds through his oratory.
You need to have a certain tone and a certain amount of passion in your words to make people listen to you. I find it very complex. Once I think about the complexity of the character it kind of scares me. But Mark Antony is a role someone would die for, said Costa.
One method Costa uses to get into the character is to relate real life incidents into the play. It makes it easier. So you need to study your role first and use every possible resource you can to get into the character. Everyone plays their character in a different way. It requires effort and sacrifice. Once you are in your character and you forget your lines you know what to do next.
You do something the character would do. If I was Caesar and forget my lines, I think what sort of a thing would Caesar do It is like improvising, said Costa.
Costa pointed out that through drama he has gained the all- important skill of diction. He also pointed out that the service rendered to him and his cast by Mrs. Wijedasa is most valuable. She has been a pillar of strength knowing the capabilities of the cast.
Shakespeare is a writer that has impacted the world in an incredible way. Thousands of school going students all over the world is learning from his writings. The Dramatic Moves column features countless students that have been changed by Shakespeare.
Excitement
Secretary, Maris Stella Drama Club, Reshain Perera feels it is the social messages it contains that have turned Shakespeare into something like a cult following
We learn to understand different decisions from different people. We have transformed from youngsters to seniors,that put us in a position to help the other juniors. Mrs. Nirmala is always watching over us. The directors play their vital role. Our families of course have to be understanding because of late night practices. Drama teaches us decision making, how to enact a role, getting to know people and how to work as a team, said Perera.
As Costa saw himself in Benedick, Perera sees himself in the character Falstaff that he did in 2014. Maris Stella came third that year all island. Perera says he is able to adapt to that character easily. The fascinating thing about Shakespearean plays is that Shakespeare always writes a play with an example from society. There is a meaning behind every character. Julius Caesar was a real life person. We see a Romeo and Juliet a lot in society. So in Shakespeare there are social messages given to us.
We understand through Macbeth and are able to fully appreciate that there are power hungry people. So we can learn a lot through those characters. Shakespeares inspiration is straight from society and real life. Macbeth is a very political play so you can even see certain kind of replay of this tale in not only Sri Lankan politics but in the present day international politics. What Shakespeare has written is timeless. It is very relevant. We can even see a sort of spirit of Macbeth not only in Sri Lanka but in the world at large.
Drama gives you a dangerous level of freedom. Imagine what it would be to walk down the road as a Macduff or even as an Othello! How exciting would that be!
In the future either we should work in a company or start a company. We get the basic foundation from the Drama Club. Getting to know different characters through Shakespeare and doing different dramas, we learn about different characteristics of different characters. From that we derive knowledge and information and through that we develop different skills. To be a female and understand a female as a man, that is an advantage for us when it comes to facing society. That will help us to face challenges and be with people and assist in integration. Of course enacting a female role is very tough, said Perera
Currently Maris Stella are doing Shakespeare and national drama competitions. Thinking about dramas, they have been doing comedies a lot and are now thinking about giving priority to tragedies. They have the talent so why not They have proved their mettle by winning the championship three times doing comedies. Since they have the potential it is most likely that we might see Maris Stella win a championship doing a tragedy.
Wijedasa and the boys especially wanted to thank the school for all the support saying they would do anything for the boys to become champions. Wijedasa stressed that Past Principals Rev. Bro. Mervin Perera and Rev. Bro Sunanda Alwis and current Principal Rev. Bro. Chinthana Nonis have been pillars of strength and courage to her.

US Marines, Navy conduct field training exercise
The Field Training Exercise (FTX), conducted jointly by the US Marines Forces, Pacific Command (MARFORPAC) and the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) as part of the 16th Non-Lethal Weapons Executive Seminar (NOLES), concluded successfully at the Welisara Naval Complex on Wednesday.
The Director General Operation, Rear Admiral Piyal de Silva attended the closing ceremony as the Chief Guest. The Director General Training, Rear Admiral Dimuthu Gunawardene, the Commander Western Naval Area, Rear Admiral Niraja Attygalle, senior SLN officers and Deputy Defence Attach of the US Embassy in Sri Lanka, Jacob English were also present on the occasion.
The 09-day FTX consisted of a series of theoretical and practical training sessions on the use of non-lethal weapons, which are designed to incapacitate equipment and personnel while minimizing fatalities and permanent injury to personnel, and undesired collateral damage to property. The seminars held in the morning imparted the theoretical knowledge while hands-on training conducted in the afternoon each day provided the much-needed practical knowledge.
A total of 140 Sri Lanka Navy personnel took part in the FTX held under the supervision of 17 US Marine Corps Forces personnel. The multi-faceted training focused on force orientation, communication skills, Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) techniques, manning vehicle check points and searching procedures.
Participants were highly impressed by the practical demonstrations; the use of non-lethal weapons such as Tasers and pepper sprays in particular, drew their attention since the stunning effect generated was highly effective in controlling unruly persons. They were also briefed on the provisions laid down in the internationally accepted conventions such as the Geneva and Hague Conventions which are applicable to the custody and detention of rioters disrupting law and order.
On the sidelines of the NOLES 2017, a serious of programmes has been organized by the Sri Lanka Navy to enhance the friendship and camaraderie between the two forces. They included visits to the Temple of the Sacred Tooth in Kandy and the Elephant Orphanage in Pinnawela as well as a traditional martial art demonstration by the SLN Angampora Pool.
Meanwhile, the Non-Lethal Weapons Executive Seminar (NOLES), the second segment of the US Pacific Commands premier multi-lateral theatre security cooperation event, got underway at the Hotel Galadari in Colombo today.
It is being held for three consecutive days with the participation of forty-one (41) military personnel representing 18 foreign countries and six (06) representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), senior officers and other ranks from the tri services and Police. The executive seminar provides a common platform for all stakeholders to deliberate on issues related to peace support operations.

We aim to be No 1 player in SL's smartphone market - Micromax VP
Micromax, the Indian consumer electronics company, strives to make a more noticeable impression in the Sri Lankan smartphone segment by introducing more and more smartphones which deliver tremendous value for money, said Sameer Kakar, Vice President and Head of International Business, Micromax.
Sri Lanka is an exciting and critical market as far as Micromax's future growth targets are concerned. We were flabbergasted by the love and affection received from the Sri Lankan customers over the last five years. Having reached that position, we are now keen to make a more noticeable impression in Sri Lankas smartphone segment, Kakar told Daily News Biz ICT.
According to Metropolitan, which is the authorized distributor of Micromax phones in Sri Lanka, over three million Micromax mobile phone devices have been sold in the Sri Lankan market over the last five years, while the brand has managed to secure a market share of around 20% in the mobile phone segment.
Kakar further added that the company doesnt have definite plans to launch wearables in the near future.
Commenting on the local mobile phone industry, Kakar mentioned that consumer demand for mobile phones is growing at double digit numbers. Nevertheless, the overall smartphone penetration is still very low. "I think as a mobile device manufacturer, we have a very important role to play in attracting more and more customers into this segment."
This is the reason why we want to bring more and more smartphones which deliver tremendous value for money consumers and then more customers can migrate from feature phones to smartphones.
"Furthermore, Micromax has received good reviews and response from customers following the launch of Micromax tablets in Sri Lanka. However, the market is quite small as far as our sales are concerned.
Going forward, Micromax intends to introduce a wide range of products including tablets which would fit the requirements of Sri Lankan customers.
Micromax holds the second position in the overall mobile phone industry and has secured the first place in the feature phone segment and it is among the top four brands in the smartphone category.
In the smartphone category, Micromax is in the top four brands and we would love to be in the top three and two; ultimately to be the number one player in this market.
According to latest available data, Micromax has up to now sold 140 million plus devices over the world.

What Trump got right about foreign policy
You gotta give the man credit. Like a viral video you just cant stop watching, President Donald Trump knows how to hold on to our attention. His administration may be losing appointees faster than a sheepdog sheds in the summer and his approval ratings may be tanking, but his train wreck of a presidency has still got us riveted to our TV screens and Twitter accounts. If only this were just a summer stand-in series and we could look forward to returning to the regular lineup in the fall.
One overlooked feature in this ongoing tragedy is that Trump isnt wrong about everything. Some of his critics wont admit it, but several of the themes he sounded during the 2016 campaign  such as the need to rebuild Americas deteriorating infrastructure  were correct (if far from original), and some of his foreign-policy instincts were sound even if his command of details was not. A minimally competent president could have made substantial progress on most if not all of these fronts, thereby leaving the country better off and enhancing his prospects for a second term. Sadly, minimally competent are not words that apply to the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
Many of the illegal drugs flowing into the United States come by air or sea.
Still, it is worth remembering what Trump got right and exploring how he has managed to miss so many 2-foot putts.
Relations with Russia
Trump believes a better relationship with Russia is in the U.S. interest, and he has resisted the foreign-policy establishments reflexive tendency to demonize Vladimir Putin. Hes not wrong here: Russia is not solely responsible for the deterioration of relations (see: NATO expansion), and Russian help would be valuable in Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, and, over the longer term, with China. Whatever his tangled personal connections with Moscow might be, Trumps desire for a more constructive relationship with Russia is correct.
Unfortunately, he has handled this issue in the worst possible way. His stubborn refusal to release his tax records inevitably led to questions about whether there are in fact skeletons lurking there. His reluctance to denounce Russian interference in elections here and in Europe reinforces those same suspicions. Even worse, it is now clear that some of his close associates (including his son Donald Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and his first national security advisor, Michael Flynn) met with some suspicious Russian characters, yet they have been unable to tell a straight and consistent story about these dealings. Then Trump fired FBI Director James Comey for doing his job and refusing to halt the FBI investigation into these matters. Whatever the truth may be, Trump & Co. have consistently acted like people who really do have something to hide.
The upshot is that Trump cant mend fences with Moscow now, even if he really wanted to and even if it were the right thing to do.
The upshot is that Trump cant mend fences with Moscow now, even if he really wanted to and even if it were the right thing to do. Instead, Congress has imposed new sanctions on Russia over Trumps opposition, plunging relations with Moscow even further into the deep freeze. Trumps instincts on Russia were sensible, but his blunders helped betray them.
The need to reform the world trade order
One of the central themes of Trumps campaign was his claim that bad trade deals had allowed countries like China to steal American jobs. Trump also railed against other states that run persistent trade surpluses with the United States (such as Germany and South Korea) and seems to think these imbalances are due to clever skullduggery on their part rather than to broader macroeconomic behavior (such as Americas chronically low savings rate).
Details aside, Trumps core belief that existing trade arrangements need work is correct. China isnt manipulating its currency anymore, but it does engage in widespread industrial espionage, and its aggressive efforts to obtain advanced technology from U.S. companies have led the Trump administration to launch a Section 301 investigation of these practices. Similarly, while Trump is wrong to see the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, as a net loss for the United States, it is nearly 25 years old and badly needs updating.
In short, Trump was not wrong in saying some aspects of U.S. trade policy and some features of the international trade regime needed to be improved. The problem is that he had no good ideas for fixing what was broken, and he has repeatedly acted in ways that undercut U.S. leverage and complicated efforts at reform.
He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his third day in office, even though it would have helped American businesses by creating a more level playing field in Asia. Instead of playing hardball with the Chinese on trade issues during his first six months in office, he held off in the naive hope that he could sweet-talk them into cracking down on North Korea. So much for the art of the deal.

Wonder Woman Gal Gadot backs mocked Sri Lankan cosplayers
(Amaya Suriyapperuma)
Hollywood actress Gal Gadot has thrown her support behind two young women in Sri Lanka after they were cyber-bullied for cosplaying as Wonder Woman.
The two had become the target of a wave of online memes, body-shaming and harassment.
Both Gadot, who played the character in the recent blockbuster movie, and its director Patty Jenkins tweeted support and encouragement.
The case triggered a fresh debate about online bullying.
When Amaya Suriyapperuma and fellow cosplayer Seshani Cooray decided to dress up as Wonder Woman at the Comic Con 2017 event in Colombo, they were not expecting it to send them on a rollercoaster ride of demeaning online memes.
After the first day, photographers at the event began sharing their pictures online and photos of the two women were picked up by Facebook groups mocking them for their appearance.
It was only the next day the two found out. It was Suriyapperuma's birthday, and friends who had spotted the memes tried to keep them secret, but that was bound to fail.
"First I was shocked," Suriyapperuma told the BBC. I didn't really let it get to me although I was genuinely baffled at why these people would spend their valuable time hating someone they don't even know."
Her fellow cosplayer. "I was offended and shocked at how the internet reacted," said Cooray.
(Seshani Cooray)
"Most of the memes and comments I received seemed to objectify me."
She was drawn her to the character of Wonder Woman because of how she feels it empowers young women like herself to be independent and strong minded.
Suriyapperuma says she didn't reply to any of the comments or publicly retaliate because she thought they didn't deserve her energies.
"Instead, me and my friends and the whole Sri Lankan geek community would band together and silently report every single meme and post and page. Some even got unpublished on Facebook as a result."
What then happened was a remarkable reversal of the tide and an overwhelming wave of support started building up online.
"There was immense support on the Facebook page of Geek Club of Sri Lanka and people I didn't even know personally were messaging me asking me to stay strong," Suriyapperuma recalls. "It was amazing."
One such tweet by a complete stranger pledging support went viral - and that's how the story found its way to Hollywood and reached Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot.
And once the two of them threw some serious Hollywood weight into the ring, the attention the two Sri Lankan women went to a whole new level.
"It definitely feels amazing to be recognised and praised by Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot herself!" Suriyapperuma said. "I'm a huge fan of Gal Gadot so this has been amazing."
Cooray was equally stunned that their idols actually recognised them. "It felt amazing - my inner fangirl is never going to forget this!"
Triggering a broader debate
Their case sparked a wider online debate around the problems of bullying online.
"I think it's actually a good thing that this is a public story," Suriyapperuma explains. "If we didn't get this much coverage this would've been just another case of cyber-bullying.
"But now everyone knows it and thus we have opened a very important conversation about bullying and body shaming."
As just one example, an online petition has been started to put more pressure on Facebook to monitor content for hate or cyber-bullying and block such posts.
But the case goes beyond just the online world, Suriyapperuma points out. It ties in with the broader goal of empowering women generally.
Looking at her own experiences growing up in Sri Lanka, she says the country's society needs to see examples of women who stand up to hate without running and hiding away or retaliating by going down to their level.
"If people start seeing women being strong as a normal thing - which is what the movie tried to do as well as what I want - then more and more women will stop tolerating harassment."

Gem trade needs to be further liberalised
Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim yesterday called for greater liberalisation of the gem trade for the future growth of the industry.
Hashim addressing the opening of the FACETS International Gem and Jewellery Exhibition at BMICH pointed that the Sri Lankan gem industry which ranked in US$ 500 million in revenue each year could do much better.
Hong Kong with no gem mining earns US$ 25 billion in revenue per year while Thailand which sources most of its gems from Sri Lanka earns US$ 11 billion, he said.
The gem industry which was initially liberalised by former UNP Minister Ronnie de Mel in 1979, was later further liberalised in 2001 by the Prime Minister at the time Ranil Wickremesinghe, according to Hashim.
While 75 of the 200 classified precious stones in the world are found in Sri Lanka, gem trading has been mostly a family run business functioning on mutual trust` between various known parties.
The minister however stressed that the government needed to play a more active role in supporting the industry which has over 500,000 people working in it.
He asked that it be liberalised further and the business of importing rough stones for processing and thereafter re-export be supported through tax exemptions.We also have a major issue with the National Gem and Jewelry Authority.
It needs to have less control over the business and have less bureaucratic red tape.
The Authority needs to be revamped; it needs a different look and regulatory mechanism to allow gem merchants to do their job more freely`, said the minister, a onetime gem merchant himself.
The Minister also asked that gem mining activities be less restricted, without mining you cannot find stones.We need to do mining taking into account environmental impact but mining has to be allowed`, he said.
He also proposed that funding mechanisms be provided to gem merchants and that more effort is taken to brand and market Ceylon Sapphires to the world.
Hashim believed that if that is done, most of the infrastructure in the country, similar to Thailand could be funded by revenue earned through precious stones. A special gem and jewellery zone was also proposed to bring all services to one area to make trading and export easier.

UPFA parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday said the Joint Opposition (JO) was against the proposed Local Government Bill as it has many deficiencies.
The Local Government mechanism will be in disarray if the government decides to implement the new bill, Alahapperuma said.
He was addressing a press conference organised by the JO at the Dr.N.M.Perera Memorial Center, Borella.
He said the Government deceived the people by stating that after establishing the Election Commission, the powers to hold polls would be vested with the Commission.
Alahapperuma said it was proven now that the Commission has no power to hold polls. It was the Government in power which ultimately decide.
He said the new Act was presented in haste and the requests for a reasonable discussion had fallen on deaf ears.
He said the new bill had serious flaws and they should be rectified.
Alahapperuma said decision to deprive the rights of youths by prohibiting the government servants to contest the election was a crime.

Answer to teething problems
Next Monday Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena will jointly unveil a Three Year plan of Development of the consensus Government. Up to now the Government has been drifting like a ship without a rudder. Hence, this is a positive step. However, an assessment of the plan could be made only after it becomes public. We hope the Government would heed public opinion and adjust the plan, if necessary instead of vetoing peoples representations offhand.
Sri Lankas experience in planning has been not so smooth. In 1956 a National Planning Council was established for the first time. It produced a 10 Year Plan in 1959. However, it was almost forgotten after few years or it became irrelevant due to various problems that arose. Then in 1965 the Government set up a new Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs which engaged itself not in the formulation of a national plan but a series of plans for various ministries. It was followed by a five-year plan 1972 -76. Again in 1975 a Two Year Plan was put forward followed by a new Five Year Plan 1978 - 83. None of these plans were implemented completely.
Too much emphasis was given for interests of power politics in the formulation of plans or insufficient attention was given to scientific and technical requirements.
Development and environmental issues
One of the basic shortcomings was the lack of a holistic vision of development, plans being at best a collection of several separate sectional constituents without much co-ordination. A plan should not only embrace all segments of the economy but also have an integrated structure that coordinates those segments into a unity. Moreover, economics cannot be separated from politics. Hence what is needed is a political economy approach to development.
This involves the participation of all stakeholders in the process of planning and more so in its implementation. This participation is vital for successful implementation of plans. Any major development is bound to face environmental issues as well as re-location of human settlements, manpower problems besides those of a purely economic nature as investment capital, technology and material infrastructure facilities.
No development would be meaningful if it does not guarantee equity to affected population, especially to marginalized sections. Hence, investment should be sufficiently productive so that the wealth newly created could offset the expenditure on the project including its foreign contribution or foreign debt. In this respect city beautification projects as well as the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport project did not bring any benefits to the population in the short-term pushing the country to a colossal debt trap. They did, however, benefit a few crony capitalists who amassed personal wealth at the expense of the people.
The Uma Oya development project is a classic example of an ill-coordinated project initiated bureaucratically without popular consultation and proper environmental assessment. It displays not only bad coordination but also bad management. It should be remembered that the biggest beneficiary or the biggest loser in any development project is the public and not the government or the investors or creditor.
Holistic approach to planning
Let us show by few examples the results of lack of a holistic approach to planning. We have been experiencing a shortage of labour of all grades- skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled- for a considerable time. The problem has become so acute that it has become necessary to import labour while there is a considerable efflux of our own labour to the Middle East and elsewhere. Development plans do not include provision for labour force reinforcement. Low salaries and wages in many trades discourage youth to join them.
Though we speak of introducing modern technology and machinery to agriculture so as to attract youth, hard nnounced its intention to form cooperative farming enterprises nothing has happened so far.
Nor has sufficient attention been given to water management even in the face of a severe drought. Rain water harvesting and urban garden cultivation are projects that could be done with community participation. Both could be used to alleviate the high cost of living besides improving agriculture- especially vegetable and fruit growing.
The disjointed nature of planning becomes more apparent when one considers the mismatch between education and economic planning. Often students are blamed for selecting social science courses instead of Science, Engineering or Medicine. Few only know that only a minority of schools in the country has facilities for science education at Advanced Level. Thus correction should begin much earlier in the Secondary education classes.
Unemployment of graduates
On the other hand, University academic courses are ossified for a long time. They have to be constantly upgraded and opportunities should be there for studying multi-disciplinary subjects. Another reason for the unemployment of graduates is the stagnation of the economy. Specialized employment opportunities will be created when the economy gets revived. Development plans should also include the development of adequate human capital. Till recently technical and vocational education was almost neglected. It should receive at least the same attention as academic higher education.
Efficient management of services such as transport is a sine qua non for rapid development. This has been a neglected sphere in which ad hoc decisions have made the situation worse. The Railway is under-utilized as a means of transport of goods. No use of waterways as a mode of transport has been despite a history of such use. Long term planning of the road network is lacking which causes a need for perennial widening of roads and highways inconveniencing the public. Public transport is much neglected, the only reform being the permission granted to run private passenger transport services.
Most important factor of development is raising productivity of material and human capital. It calls for constant upgrading of the technical basis of machinery, improvement of the soil, developed methods of production and raising the productivity off labour et al. This is very important since we have to produce for the international market which is competitive by nature. Without higher productivity export orientation of the economy will not produce results.

The key factor that helps Blue Ocean set it apart from industry competitors is fulfilling a property seekers requirements by providing them with a dream home. This is why Blue Ocean Group chooses to provide the expertise of Blue Ocean Facility Management to enable buyers to have reliable property maintenance.
This connection between the different arms of the Blue Ocean Group also helps in the construction phase of the properties. As the group also engages in manufacturing ready mix concrete, importing building materials, heavy machinery and providing engineering and architectural consultation, clients have access to all the capabilities that Blue Ocean has to offer.
It also means there is less likelihood of barriers in coordination that can occur when a builder has to work with different organisations in order to obtain materials and expertise to complete a project.
Their apartments have appreciated in value by 50 to 70%. All Blue Ocean projects have been governed by ISO 9001:2008, 14001:2015 and OSHAS 18001:2007, in addition to meeting other international standards.

The engineering arm has been one of the very few companies who have won accolades from the major Contractors Association of Sri Lanka, the Green Building Council, the Construction and Industrial Development Authority and the Chamber of Construction Industries.
For all these reasons, homebuyers and astute investors have decided to choose from the Blue Ocean Groups wide selection of apartments.
The Groups consistent year-on-year improvement in financial results is a signal of the financial sustainability of its business model.
From a social perspective, its infrastructure projects across the country have a significant bearing on the communities in the area and have improved the standard of living of its stakeholders.

Cell phones: tools or toys
Mobile phones are handy and are very useful if it is used in a proper moderate way. Sadly, it is misused in various ways. Most significantly, cell phones are used as toys by the kids. In the free trade and modern world, it has become an additional and fashionable rather than the real need. In the present days, most commonly, both the parents are employed and engaged in their official matters and other commitments. They rarely find time to keep an eye on their children as they are exhausted by professional and the household chores. As a result, they need some relaxation, by the time they allow their kids to be engaged in any of practices.
In common, children ask a lot of questions with full of energy, enthusiasm and with great mobility. So that parents feel it is appropriate to give a smart phone and let the children watch funny videos or get involved in some game. Knowingly, if they snatch the cell phones, they would start crying or nagging. Further to that, it is extremely a difficult task to pacify them. Therefore, they do not want to interrupt the kids as well as their peace. I have noticed and heard many mothers, simply saying that their child smashed the cell phone on the floor and it does not work. Since cell phones are electronic devices, they should be handled with utmost care at the appropriate stage. On the long run, it may affect the small ones brain and speech disabilities as well.
Remarkably, parents must be serious about this issue. Noticeably, children strictly should not be given the cell phones as toys they are tools. A humble request for parents.

Dozens dead as 'unsafe' building collapses in Mumbai

Authorities scrambled to rescue survivors from the rubble of a three-story building that collapsed on Thursday morning in a working-class neighborhood of Mumbai. At least 24 people were killed.
Mumbai firefighters were also trying to extinguish burning debris that could further endanger people who were still trapped in the building.
"The fire in the debris continues to cause a hindrance in the rescue work and is possibly suffocating victims trapped in confined spaces," said Mumbai Fire Brigade Chief P.S. Rahangdale.
Thirty-seven people were rescued, many of whom were hospitalized. Seventeen were being treated and the remainder had been released, according to a Mumbai police spokesperson.
A spokesman for the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai said the building was 117 years old and had been deemed unsafe years ago, raising questions over why it was still inhabited.
"The building was served an 'unsafe to live' notice in 2013," said the spokesman, Vijay Khabale-Patil.
"Ten families used to live in the building and some of them had vacated the property recently. So we don't have an actual count of the missing people."
An official told CNN there are likely to be hundreds of other buildings in the city in a similar condition.
It was a chaotic scene as the rescue operation took place, with an excavator digging through the mountain of rubble, dumping broken concrete, shards of thin wood and bits of twisted metal into trucks. Whistles sounded as ambulances drove up to the site in expectation of more bodies.
As night fell, the sound of megaphones and desperate shouts continued as the call to prayer sounded from the many mosques in the area.
Monsoon misery
The building collapse comes after heavy rains and flooding in Mumbai this week, which have killed at least five people. Authorities would not say if the collapse was connected to the rainfall.
South Asia has seen a historic amount of rain and flooding this month, the height of monsoon season.
More than 1,200 people have been killed in India and Bangladesh and some 41 million have been affected by flooding, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Nepal has also been hit hard.
Thursday's building collapse is the second significant one to hit India's financial hub this summer. More than a dozen people were killed when a five-story building collapsed in the Ghatkopar neighborhoodin July.
In May, a wall collapsed at a wedding, killing 24 people.

EU and ILO help develop skills among youth in Mannar
Creating job opportunities for young people and promoting 'productive employment and decent work' are important elements in the International Labour Organizations (ILO) mandate.
As a former conflict-affected region, Mannar is now moving towards rehabilitation and sustainable development where human capacity development plays a key role in reaching the goals set by the government of Sri Lanka.
As a step to achieving this goal, the European Union Support to District Development Programme (EU-SDDP) with a total financial envelope of Rs. 8.8 billion aims at supporting the thrust of the Government of Sri Lanka towards economic and social development in seven conflict-affected districts.
In Mannar District, the ILO joined hands with Technical College, Mannar, to improve access to relevant and quality skills training in the district.
Mannar was identified as having high growth in construction due to the post-conflict resettlement process of displaced families, infrastructure development and rehabilitation of community structures. The ILO, through the EU-SDDP support, initially supported the Mannar Technical College with equipment worth Rs. 4.70 million to conduct courses on construction related trades.
The first course helped to graduate 54 youth on construction site supervision. Another Rs. 3.9 million worth of equipment will be provided for motorcycle and scooter training.
The official handing over of training equipment under EU-SDDP took place at Mannar Technical College on August 30 with participation of the European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Head of Cooperation Libuse Soukupova, Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET) Deputy Director, Academics P. M. C. N. Balasooriya and Mannar Government Agent M.Y. S. Deshapriya.
During the event, the graduates of construction site supervision course received their certificates of successful completion of the training. EU-SDDP has aimed at contributing to the transition from post-conflict relief to reconstruction and development by supporting selected districts in the North and East as focus districts in line with respective local development plans.

Under the 'local economic development' component of the programme, ILO undertakes a comprehensive and integrated approach to enable young women and men to make a smooth transition to work through skills training. ILO has partnered with vocational training institutes in the district of Mannar to conduct quality skills training based on labour market demand.
Under those agreements 320 youth received skills training in nine selected high demand trades, namely, plumbing, electrical, welding, heavy equipment operating, modern dress making, automobile repairing, hospitality trades, ICT and construction related trades at selected training centres.
The trained youth are linked with District Public Employment Services (PES) Centres also established under EU-SDDP for employment placement.
EU-SDDP also supports and aims to achieve the one million jobs for the youth initiative of the present Government through enhancing market oriented vocational training.

Fertilizer subsidy extended to maize cultivation
Chena cultivators who grow maize in crown lands will be entitled for the government fertilizer subsidy from the forthcoming Maha season.
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake gave this assurance to a group of Anuradhapura district maize cultivators who were present at the minister's Anuradhapura office recently.
The minister told the Daily News that the prohibition existed so far for chena maize cultivators from getting the fertilizer subsidy since they did not own the cultivated lands. Yet, this will be done away with. Thousands of chena cultivators who grew maize and lost due to the prevailing drought have been denied the compensation for crop damages as they had cultivated in crown land.
The government will offer the fertilizer subsidy to the chena - based maize cultivation if they produce a certificate from the relevant Grama Niladhari confirming that the particular farmer has cultivated maize in the crown land, being counter signed by the Divisional Secretary, the Agriculture Minister said.
He warned chena cultivators that this certificate shall not be instrumental to give any land ownership to the chena cultivator. If any farmer was detected in expanding the plot of crown land where he has been permitted to grow maize, he would not get the fertilizer subsidy nor the land for cultivating again. We understand that many farmers have been working as stooges of businessmen who have encroached lengthy crown landscapes in rural areas for growing maize thus creating an irrespirable environmental pollution and soil erosion. This practice shall be thwarted. Grama Niladharis shall not issue certificates to fake chena cultivations and such offences would be severely dealt with, Duminda Dissanayake emphasized.
It is planned to cultivate maize in Anuradhapura district in 60,000 acres in the forthcoming Maha seasons including chena cultivation.

Great Kings Eden Giant Stone Book
Man constantly attempts to recreate Eden and there are many examples of such endeavours throughout history and the world but there is one example in Sri Lanka that sticks out and was discovered, quite by accident, by the British army in 1820. A Lieutenant Fagan no less, commanding a brigade from Batticaloa to Minneriya, and fortunately with a considerably more civilised outlook on life than the previous army of savages that swept through like a tsunami, and turned the city upside down, committing the most heinous crimes known to man and leaving it absolutely destitute having gouged out the eyes of its King before torturing him to death  a treacherous serpent with pure evil and envy in its heart.
A hydraulic civilisation
Before the great kingdom of Polonarruwa was destroyed, the place had become famous throughout the world for the ingenuity and attitude to water and nature in general. Walking around the site I learn how the Romans traded here for the gems, Arabs for the spices and even the Iranians came to do business as recently in a archaeological dig a great deal of Iranian pottery was discovered. Not even a single drop of water that comes from the rain must flow in to the Ocean without being made useful to man, King Parakramabahu was heard to say, making him one of the first recorded recyclers and creators of a hydraulic civilisation.
He was also credited with building three huge river dams so that the use of water could be controlled minutely for all the inhabitants and extended canal systems so that the large irrigation tanks of Minneri, Kaudulu and Kantale were all linked together, thus completing an impressive array of water engineering feats that were both highly technical and beautiful to behold, and described thus, a giant blue ribbon wrapped around a mystical garden city that even by todays terms was ahead of its time, and on a huge scale, It is of such a width that it is impossible to stand upon one shore and view the other side. Other canals were constructed to discharge additional water from swampy lands to make them suitable for paddy cultivation.
As well as farming hundreds of varieties of rice, they harvested honey from bees both to eat but also, interestingly, to seal their fresco pictures in the picture houses and on caves, as honey is a well known preservative and can last for millennia in the right mix and conditions. Living as part of nature this civilisation would have been aware of the dangers of monoculture and the need for diversity to support all the different creatures within an ecosystem; they would certainly not have needed to be encouraged to sow wild flowers to save the bees, something we are being warned might signal the end of a huge range of plants and indirectly animals, even many of us, in our world today.
Furthermore, the Kings boulder gardens reflected the Eden like majesty of the place, and were built with defence moats, though sadly these were not capable of repelling the rapacious barbarians, in 1215 AD, of the South Indian King Kalinga Magha, a malingerer who couldnt be bothered to create his own slice of paradise, instead destroying anothers and its people.
The importance of spirituality
During the time of Great King Parakrambahus largesse also extended to establishing alms halls to feed the poor, and promoting intellectual debate and the discussion of new ideas through scholarly teaching to everyone. Besides building a great city he was also an expert physician, to boot, building stone baths for healing with oil, as well as a hospital and special halls for attending sick people, truly a great philanthropist and visionary.
But his skills and those of his people go beyond these hydraulic marvels and in some cases tap into them, like the arrangement of gravity fed pipes and water channels that are used for creating open air domestic showers downstream of the dams or from the vast water tanks.
The rooms of these ancient palaces and temples were also built thick and made to last with the added bonus of having excellent insulation qualities that negate the need for aircon as even in the heat of the day the thickness of walls keep the rooms cool. Similarly, houses were to some extent built with open ends to allow and facilitate the free flow of air through them both to keep them cool and to prevent the build up of harmful house dusts. Another revolutionary and extraordinarily visionary invention of the time involved the strategic placement of statues opposite windows within houses and inserting gemstones in their eyes, which would reflect the light, entering through the windows as the sun rises, and sending light around the room, so brightening it up with colours and being like a free electricity supply.
As with many great civilisations they left records, via stone inscriptions on giant books the most famous one being the gal potha stone book weighing25 tons, which was brought over 90km from Mihintale by elephants rolled on logs. It took a year to get the stone book to the city and is a fascinating read as it covers many aspects from wars that took place to the cities rules and regulations. All in all this was a very advanced civilisation that fully appreciated and lived within natures needs and constraints, helped the poor and needy, was extremely sophisticated with its engineering, and recognised the importance of spirituality as a key part of the healing process. Some say the Great King was inspired from Pali inscriptions from temples in the area even older than the ancient ruined city we see today. Take a walk back in time and you will with the right guide from EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa Hotel receive a Kings scholarly tour of one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world. An education that might even encourage you to build your next home differently and look at gem stone lighting as a serious alternative to electricity.
Something that was also used thousands of years ago to guide ships safely into the island natural harbours, where trade became a key island feature.

Hajj rituals fills a Muslims heart with in peace and tranquilly. Various rituals of Hajj purify ones body and soul. Hajj Festival is also an occasion to propagate unity among all, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine M Fawzan Anwer in a Hajj message said. His message adds, Hajj, one of the five main pillars of Islam, has a message for the benefit and well being of all people, be they Muslim or not. The wonderful message of Hajj is that a Muslim should live in peace with his brothers in humanity, even if they are of different faiths. Though Hajj is obligatory, once in a lifetime on financially and physically capable Muslims, every single Muslim, man or woman, rich or poor, dreams to repeatedly offer it. During Hajj rituals, a Muslim respects and accepts the opinion of different juristic schools.
He should never fight or quarrel with anyone, even those who are different from him in stance and conduct. He lives in peace, leaves others to enjoy peace and trains himself to be peaceful and forgiving. Thus, respect, mercy, kindness, and tolerance prevail and dominate the Hajj rituals.
The celebration of Hajj with a shared spirit of joy should strengthen their commitment to live in harmony with all other communities in the cause of peace, reconciliation and national unity./M. Fawzan Answer

India committed to preserve, advance regional cooperation - Swaraj
The Indian External Affairs Minister yesterday assured her neighbours that India's vision for the Indian Ocean Region was to 'preserve its organic unity while advancing cooperation'.
Minister Sushma Swaraj addressing the second Indian Ocean Conference at Temple Trees stressed the importance for ensuring and peace and security in the region which transported 90 percent of India's trade by volume and all of its oil imports.
'Clearly, it is but natural that Indias role as the key pivot in the Indian Ocean region is a given, not only geographically but by virtue of a shared historical and cultural heritage that binds us all across these waters', she said.
She added that her country would use their capabilities 'for the collective well being, and the mutual benefit of our maritime neighbours and island states in building their capabilities` and that it was the primary responsibility of all states in the region to ensure 'peace, stability and prosperity of the Indian Ocean'.
Prime Minister Modi through his concept SAGAR -"Security and Growth for All in the Region in 2015 set out a clear path for India`s engagement in the Indian Ocean through; `enhancing capacities to safeguard land and maritime territories and interests; deepening economic and security cooperation in the littoral; promoting collective action to deal with natural disasters and maritime threats like piracy, terrorism and emergent non-state actors; working towards sustainable regional development through enhanced collaboration; and, engaging with countries beyond our shores with the aim of building greater trust and promoting respect for maritime rules, norms and peaceful resolution of disputes`.
The challenge, she noted was to 'ensure intra-ocean trade and investment, and the sustainable harnessing of the wealth of the seas, including food, medicines and clean energy'.
Through PM Modi's Sagarmala initiative; which aims to establish new ports and modernise old ones, India has set her eyes on improving maritime logistics in Sri Lanka,Maldives, Mauritius and the Seychelles, Swaraj said.
As India looks to expand its influence in the region, she said security was fundamental for SAGAR.'If the revitalised maritime economy of the Indian Ocean region is to be a force for global economic growth in the coming years, it is essential that the waters remain peaceful, stable and secure.It is imperative too, that all stakeholders abide by a rules-based global order', Swaraj said.
She added that India was prepared to bear its share of responsibility and their response 'to security challenges in the Indian Ocean would be based on our national capabilities, complemented by participation in relevant regional platforms'.
One such platform is 'effective response mechanism to address humanitarian crises and natural disasters is perhaps the most visible element of the evolving Indian Ocean security strategy'.
India was the "first responder to calls of assistance - providing relief supplies and medical assistance to flood ravaged peoples of Sri Lanka in June 2017.
'We see the Indian Ocean as not just a water body, but a global stage for continued economic, social, and cultural dialogue', concluded the Indian Minister of External Affairs.

India lost 1% of its GDP to Modis hunt for elusive black money
Finally, the Reserve Bank of India has deigned to release the cold hard facts on Demonetisation.
Of Indian Rs 15.44 lakh crore worth of currency denotified, almost all came back, save currency worth Rs 16,000 crore.
The Central Statistics Office estimates Indias 2016-17 GDP to be Rs 151.84 lakh crore. That means black money worth 0.1% of GDP was extinguished.
To achieve that, 1% of GDP was sacrificed, if we go by the Economic Surveys estimate of the impact of Demonetisation on economic growth. Demonetisation has been flop, as far as tackling black money is concerned.
But Demonetisation has been a big political success for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. People give him full credit for trying to rein in the illicit rich. And were willing to suffer some pain, if that would serve the larger public interest.
Of course, those with black money held as cash, a tiny fraction of unaccounted wealth, ended up with somewhat less black money: you had to part with some of the cash to get it laundered through the accounts of those with nothing to hide. At some point, this cost was something like 30%.
Which means that Demonetisation had a redistributive effect. About 30% of the black money got redistributed to those involved in the money laundering transactions, many of them poor. And the balance got converted into legitimate money.
People do not appreciate losing any part of their income. Which is why they do not pay taxes. So being forced to surrender about 30% of the cash makes the class of cash-holders very upset with the government and its political leadership.
What Demonetisation achieved was to bring about a change in the support base of the ruling BJP. The traders who traditionally supported the BJP and hoarded cash have turned lukewarm, but the poor, who have mostly voted the BJP only in anger against the Congress, see it is a party that hits the rich where it hurts them the most, and therefore, is a party of the poor.
Demonetisation, in essence, was a clever way of using the class anger of the poor against the rich to shore up political support for Modi and his party. Will that support evaporate, if it is demonstrated that this claim of championing the poor was built on false premises, that Demonetisaton did little to remove black money That depends on getting the message home to the people at large.
Popular communication has been Modis forte and that of his party with its hundreds of thousands of Whatsapp groups and their incessant propagation of news, fake and real.

Japanese military seeks record budget after Korean missile
JAPAN: Japans Defence Ministry said Thursday it will request its largest-ever annual budget, just days after nuclear-armed North Korea fired a rocket over the country in a provocation that drew global condemnation.
The ministry announced it is asking for 5.26 trillion yen ($47.9 billion) for the fiscal year through March 2019 to beef up its missile defence.
That follows on five straight years of budgetary increases as territorial tensions with China also aggravate Japans security concerns. The current proposal calls for spending on new SM-3 Block IIA interceptors -- developed jointly with the US -- to counter potential attacks by simultaneous missile launches, as well as a next-generation early-warning and radar system.
Adopting a land-based Aegis missile defence scheme to complement Japans sea-based system is also included in the multi-billion-dollar budget request.
The proposal comes two days after the North fired a ballistic missile over Japan.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- who has been pushing to expand the role of his pacifist countrys Self-Defence Forces -- denounced the launch as an unprecedented, serious and grave threat.
He agreed with US President Donald Trump to increase pressure on North Korea -- which has so far been mainly through sanctions -- to abandon its nuclear weapon and missile development programmes.
The two leaders had a telephone call early Thursday, their second this week, while Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera spoke with his US counterpart Jim Mattis.
Japan is closely allied with the US on security issues and hosts American bases and tens of thousands of troops on its territory, which North Korea considers a threat. The Norths official KCNA news agency decried Japan in a commentary late Wednesday, saying the allies military nexus had become a serious threat to the Korean peninsula and Japan was accelerating self-destruction.
Japans latest defence budget proposal also asks for money to buy a half dozen F-35 stealth fighters, a pair of frigate ships and high-tech gadgetry to protect remote southern isles in waters where China has shown its expanding naval ambitions.
The uninhabited islets in the East China Sea are administered by Japan, which calls them the Senkakus, but are also claimed by China which refers to them as the Diaoyus.
Japan has been boosting defence ties with the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations, some of which have their own disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea.
The previous years defence budget amount was 5.13 trillion yen, meaning the current request is for a 2.5 percent rise. - AFP

Japans Platform Foundation JPF has offered grant assistance for flood and landslide affected families in 15 GS divisions at Deniyaya, Kotapola and Matara, Project Manager Chisato Takahashi told the Daily News.
She said, Under this relief project, we have offered needed financial assistance to 150 families to repair and rebuild their badly damaged houses following the floods and landslides due to heavy rains in the area during the last monsoon.
In addition, the project is also helping tea smallholders in Deniyaya to shift from artificial fertilizer and insecticide to nature friendly organic manure and pests control processes of tea cultivation, she added.
We have been working with tea smallholders in Deniyaya since 2011 to provide them technical know how to do organic tea cultivation. In this process, we offered them financial support to do away with artificial fertilizer and poisonous pest control chemicals.
She also said tea smallholders with financial assistance from the JPF have increased their tea yield with low cost as a result of making use of organic manure. Now, they would not have to spend heavily on artificial fertilizer and insecticide. On other hand, their tea production had increased and in turn, it had fetched higher prices in the Japanese tea market.
The group of these small scale organic tea farmers now supply their tea leaf to the Nilmini Organic Tea Factory, where they produced organic tea. We also have taken initiatives to further expand the organic tea market in Japan and Europe, to bring more benefits to organic tea smallholders in Deniyaya, he added.

Kurunegala  Plantations remits  Rs 35mn to Treasury
At the recently held Progress Review meeting of the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development chaired by the Minister Kabir Hashim, it was revealed that the Kurunegala Plantations Ltd has provided Rs. 35 million to the Treasury from their profit of Rs 155 million in 2015.
The company which mainly produces and processes coconut, rubber and varied interim crops owns 4971 hectares with its 08 estates located in various agro-climatic zones in Kurunegala, Gampaha and Anuradhapura districts.
The Chairman of the company Upali Piyasoma said that the company which was established in 1992 as a fully state owned company could make such profit by operating under the good governance with the guidance of Minister Hasim since September 2015.
Further, he stated that the profit for 2016 is now being calculated and it would be the most efficient year in companys history.
Consequently, the coconut production, the main production of the company has been increased to 16.65 million nuts in 2016 from 14.06 million in 2015.
It is an 18% increase comparing to 2015. As well, the highest revenue of Rs. 61 lakhs earned from cashew nuts in the history has been recorded this year and it is a 201% increase comparing to 2015.

The Minister pointed out that the funds which were to be used for the welfare of the employees had to be used to maintain the institutions since they had been bankrupted with the interference of the former politicians of past governments.
He stated that the said success was able to be achieved by appointing skilled officers to manage those institutions and assign the responsibilities properly under the new economic program of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Minister further stated that the other plantations under MPED; Chilaw Plantations Ltd (CPL), Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB), Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC) and Elkaduwa Plantations Limited (EPL) have also achieved a great progress more than the previous years.

Lanka suffers fourth straight defeat of series
Sharma, Kohli send bowlers on leather hunt with centuries:
Another appalling performance in the fourth one-day international against India saw Sri Lanka suffer their fourth straight defeat of the five-match series and left them in danger of being whitewashed 5-0 for the first time in a home rubber.
Yesterday at the R Premadasa Stadium, Sri Lankas fast diminishing cricket image took another beating when India handed out to them a thumping 168-run defeat.
The moment Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli compiled a double century partnership for India, the writing was on the wall for Sri Lanka and it was no see surprise to see them go down by such a big margin.
Indias total of 375-5 the highest ever made by a visiting team against Sri Lanka at home left the hosts with few alternatives or none at all. It proved to be too big a task for a team that has barely managed to scrape together 200 plus runs in each of the first three matches. In the event Sri Lanka got to 207 in 42.4 overs before they were bowled out with 44 balls to spare.
The only redeeming feature of the innings was Angelo Mathews knock of 70 off 80 balls (10 fours). The former captain found himself in the middle by the ninth over and throughout the series he never had an opportunity to express himself because he always came to bat when the chips were down.
Sri Lankas job was made even more difficult when they went into the match one batsman short. They opted for young all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga despite having Dhananjaya de Silva in their squad. De Silva was a late replacement for Danushka Gunathilaka who could not recover in time from a shoulder injury.
Even history was against Sri Lanka for no team had successfully chased a score beyond 288 on this ground. Even to get thus far Sri Lanka needed a launch pad and Niroshan Dickwella with his third opening partner in the series  Dilshan Munaweera failed to provide that. By the ninth over the Lankan innings was in tatters at 27-3 and there was only one result in the match unless bad weather intervened before the 20th over to make it a no-result. However luck was not on Sri Lankas side as has been the case throughout the year and, with the match played to a finish saw Sri Lanka humbled again much to the disappointment of a few thousands of fans who made their way to the venue. It was a rare sight to see the R Premadasa Stadium not even filled to half its capacity of 35,000 for a one-day international. To such a low level has the interest in the game dwindled following the spate of defeats the national team is currently undergoing.
For the first time in the series India after winning the toss chose to bat first on a placid track that was full of runs. Shikhar Dhawan missed out on that golden opportunity when he was dismissed for four in the second over, but that brought together Sharma and Kohli who tore the Lankan bowling to shreds with a stand of 219 off 168 balls.
On a track that didnt offer much for the bowlers the Lankan line up was badly exposed. Even Lasith Malinga with all his experience in international cricket was hardly effective going for 82 runs in his 10 overs. The only joy that he had was dismissing Kohli for 131  a wicket that brought him his 300th in ODI cricket, making him the fourth Sri Lankan bowler to achieve the milestone and the 13th overall.
Man of the Match Kohli was in imperious form dominating the partnership scoring his runs off just 96 balls with the aid of 17 fours and two sixes. It was his 29th ODI century and seventh against Sri Lanka.
Sharma was not far behind his captain moving to his second successive hundred of the series  104 off 88 balls inclusive of 11 fours and three sixes and the 13th of his career and fourth against Sri Lanka.
After the partnership was broken by Malinga, Sri Lanka managed a few cheap wickets with Mathews taking the wickets of Hardik Pandya (19) and Sharma off successive deliveries and, when Akila Dananjaya had Lokesh Rahul chipping a catch to midwicket India had half the side out for 274 in the 38th over.
But once again the MS Dhoni factor proved to be Sri Lankas stumbling block. The former Indian skipper making his 300th ODI appearance figured in an unbroken century partnership  his third in consecutive innings to take India to their record total in Sri Lanka.
On this occasion he formed a liaison with Manish Pandey playing his first match of the series and one of three changes made by India. While Pandey went onto score an unbeaten half century off 42 balls Dhoni missed at 25 by Munaweera at backward point made 49 not out off the same number of balls.
Sri Lankas bowling was poor and the attack showed its lack of depth and experience against a vastly skillful Indian batting line up. In his first match as ODI captain Malinga used as many as seven bowlers to try and contain the Indian batting but to no avail.
Shardul Thakur (India), Malinda Pushpakumara and Munaweera (Sri Lanka) made their ODI debuts.

A loving home needed for starving dogs
The principal of a certain school has made a huge fuss about a particular teacher who feeds three female harmless dogs that live inside the school premises. (There was a request not to disclose the name of the relevant school and principal)
Unfortunately the cleaner/worker at this school has also made a complaint to the principal about these dogs and regarding the teacher who feeds them. This eventually led to a staff meeting in which the principal declared that, no food should be given to these three dogs, as they are a nuisance.
Yet in spite of the difficulties and complications faced, this compassionate kind teacher continued to feed these dogs secretly outside the relevant school premises. She was very concerned as these dogs had no other source of food and depended on her for their only meal.
However this secretive feeding resulted in bigger problems as more complaints were made to the principal by other staff members and students. Thereafter the security guards were requested by the said principal to prevent and or discourage anyone from feeding these dogs outside and or even near the school premises.
Therefore this plea is on behalf of these three dogs who are currently starving and have not had any food the past couple of days.
The said teacher is unable to adopt them as she does not have a garden and she is currently prevented and obstructed in school from feeding them as well.
The three dogs have been sterilized and vaccinated and are extremely lovable and friendly.
If you can adopt even one of them or need more info PLEASE call on 112913980 or 0777567122.
Transport will be arranged when rehoming the dog.

Omentra to bring freedom of online  marketplace to Sri Lankan businesses
Omentra.com one of Sri Lankas largest ever complete Business-to-Business (B2B) online marketplace for business supplies are working hard to further expand its network of suppliers and partners.
In an interview, Omentra Head of Operations, Nadun Kumar shares his views on concept behind omentra , its special features , local e-commerce industry outlook and etc
Q: What is Omentra.com
A: We provide 360 B2B procurement related solutions, where we give businesses the convenience and simplicity of selecting from the best suppliers and finding solutions for their daily procurement related business needs.
Q: How does Omentra.comhelp businesses
A: Essentially, Omentra.com is an online marketplace that businesses can use to simplify and ease their procurement related activities in a manner that frees up companies from the burden of administration and logistics related to B2B procurement processes, by enabling the effective digitization and optimization of procurement procedures  whether that is in order to find suppliers for daily raw material inputs, or to find suppliers for a last minute order of laptops or office chairs.
Our goal with this platform is to enable companies of any size, and working in almost any sector to gain free, easy, and reliable access to whatever products or services they require to make their businesses run better. This can span absolutely anything from IT products, electronics and office supplies to engineering, manufacturing and construction equipment and related supplies and services.
In total, we have eight sales categories and within each of these is an already impressive diversity of products and services, including several global and local firsts in terms of business models and value-added services.
Q: What is Solution Guru
Solution Guru I would say is first time in the world. It is something similar to a start-up accelerator. We understand that there is an increasing number of start-ups coming out in Sri Lanka.
I believe we should all help them in any way possible, as it is a healthy sign for the countrys economy. Solution Guru is a simple help for such start-ups.
It enables a start-up to find business suppliers to simply set-up office and if needed even to reach out to financing companies or venture capitalists (business angels).
I really believe this would be promising for all Sri Lankan start-ups.
Q: Are there any fees applicable for a business to use the website
This website is absolutely free to be used by businesses to ease and simplify their daily procurement related needs.
Q: How do we identify whether the vendor is genuine or products are original, which is displayed in Omentra.com
The products of Omentra.com meet all the quality and acceptable standards. There is an initial verification process done by the Omentra team before on-boarding a vendor and their related products, in order to ensure the maintenance of this standard.
Q: What is the level of development for the Sri Lankan e-commerce industry and its importance moving forward
A: e-Commerce is easily one of the most important new business models in the world, especially with regard to developing countries as it provides greater market reach, enhances participation in international supply chains, and improves firm-level and market efficiencies.
In many ways it is considered the great equalizer in international trade, providing new Business-to-Business (B2B) opportunities that previously did not exist.
Globally, B2B e-Commerce is projected to increase at a rate of 19% YoY with sales reaching $6.7 trillion by 2020.
In comparison, B2C e-Commerce is set to grow at 17% YoY approximately half that amount in the same time. Annual consumer sales in Sri Lanka are valued at Rs. 300 billion and currently online sales are just 1% of it.Closer to home Indias e-commerce industry is slated to skyrocket by as much as 71% in 2015 and reach an incredible US$ six billion, according to Gartner.
If we connect properly, Indias spillover effect could have dramatic impact on Sri Lankas business landscape. The e-commerce industry in Sri Lanka is likely to expand more than threefold by 2018.
Hence, we believe that Sri Lankas e-commerce industry is at an inflection point.
Even though the market is getting saturated with a plethora of Business-to-Consumer (B2C) e-Commerce platforms, there has been no successful B2B e-Commerce platforms that have been launched and established itself successfully at a national scale and we believe that this is an area which Omentra can help usher in drastic changes.

PM moots Indian Ocean Fund
Stresses stable order for freedom of navigation:
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka will take a leading role in establishing a stable legal order for the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean and promote regional trade.
The Prime Minister also proposed the establishment of an Indian Ocean Fund which will provide much needed capital for national banks in the regions to promote business expansion.
Addressing the inaugural session of the second Indian Ocean Conference held at Temple Trees, the Prime Minister stressed that Sri Lanka placed enviably at the centre of the Indian Ocean was well poised to play a significant role in its future.
The Indian Ocean Conference organized by the India Foundation seeks to bring together countries in the region to discuss matters of common interest. Last year the conference was held in Singapore.
Global power, however was shifting to Asia, and the Prime Minister quoting the HSBC World in Focus report stated that 19 countries among Asia would be among the largest in the world by 2050.
By 2030, Asia is expected to surpass the West in global power in terms of population, GDP and technology and military spending.Furthermore by 2030, it would be a multi-polar world with the USA, China, India, Japan, Russia and Germany taking the helm.
Given this structure, the Prime Minister pointed that it was important for Sri Lanka`s future development to promote peace, progress and prosperity- this years theme of the conference. The challenge, the PM noted was the lack of political will among the nations in the Indian Ocean region to promote inter regional economic cooperation - especially trade liberalisation and connectivity. Thus South Asia remains the least economically integrated region in the world.
Wickremesinghe in his demand for greater trade in the region, asked that the littoral states, implement the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Action Plan 2017-2022 recommendation on trade and investment agreed to in Jakarata, within the next four years.
Let this conference recommend to IORA a need for a credible strategy which would include reducing protectionist trade measures, implementing ease of doing business measures, commitment to the WTO trade facilitation agreements and remove by tariffs, para tariffs and non-tariffs over an agreed period of time`, said the Prime Minister.
Given the lack of a multilateral trade agreement in the region, the Prime Minister said Sri Lanka would embark on bilateral trade agreements with all countries to push greater prosperity.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also urged all countries to concentrate on a Blue Economy and have IORA coordinate efforts from all countries to address overfishing, pollution and habitat losses.
Coming back to security, the Prime Minister reiterated his call for the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean and there be unhindered lawful maritime commerce according to international standards.
World major powers have deployed substantial military powers in the Indian ocean. Vital sea lanes of communication should be open for all and must be used for mutual benefit in a sustainable manner`, he said.
As he touched on the maritime build up of major players such as India, Australia, China, USA and Japan from ocean and the latter three increasing their forward naval presence, Wickremesinghe warned of the need to watch out for naval competition among these major powers.
He also remarked that the current clauses from 34-56 of UNCLOS too were insufficient to deal with modern threats from terrorism to the 10 choke points in the Indian Ocean and thus Sri Lanka was prepared to work with all partners to create a shared vision for economic and security engagement.
A code of conduct which ensures freedom of navigation will be an essential component of this vision, he said.
He thus encouraged the littoral states to join Sri Lanka in discussion on establishing a stable legal order based on freedom of navigation so that the states themselves can decide their fate in the Indian Ocean.
The Prime Minister assured all gathered that Sri Lanka will not enter into any military agreements with any country or make its bases available to foreign countries, We will continue military cooperation such as training, supply of equipment and joint exercises with friendly countries, he said.
Just a few 100m from Temple Trees lies an Ocean destined to decide the future of the world, the Sri Lankan Prime Minister said as he signalled that Sri Lanka was ready to pave the way for cooperation rather than conflict in the region.

Price of lunch packets to increase by Rs. 10 in protest of polythene ban

The price of a lunch packet will be increased by Rs 10 from today as a token of protest against the ban on lunch sheets, Sri Lanka Canteen Owners Association President Asela Sampath said.
Speaking to the Daily News, he said the average price of a rice packet is Rs 120, adding that this would be raised to Rs 130. He said the Association would meet today and decide on price revision of other food items such as string hoppers, kottu, fried rice, pittu etc as they are also usually wrapped in lunch sheets.
The food sellers are seriously affected due to the new ban on polythene and lunch sheets. The take away concept became successful because of lunch sheets. There is no proper alternative for lunch sheets. There is no fixed price for other alternative products, and the importers of such products try to sell them at Rs 6-8 to us. The price of a lunch sheet is Rs 1.70. If lunch sheets are not used, food sellers water bill will rise sharply as all the plates must be washed, he complained.
Insisting that the Government should do away with the new ban on polythene, he said they would help the Government with segregation of waste and recycling.

Rapid agriculture revolution from October: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said the entire country will be subjected to a rapid agriculture revolution from October to gain significant progress in the agricultural sector.
The President asked all to get ready for this giant leap and to contribute to the national drive. Accordingly, the first week of October will be named as the Jathika Govi Sathiya. All Ministries will be a part of this national move.
With the onset of rain, a programme under the theme Waga Sangramaya will be launched countrywide aiming to cultivate 800,000 hectares of lands.
The President made these observations after commissioning an Agriculture In Service Training Institute (ISTI) at Karadiyanaru, Batticaloa yesterday.
The ISTI in Karadiyanaru was first established in 1980 by the Agriculture Department aiming to provide specialized training to agriculture extension officers in the Eastern Province, practically oriented residential training for officers as well as farmers.
However, with the terror attack on the ISTI in 1986, the institute was dilapidated. The ISTI has been reconstructed at a cost of Rs 103 million allocated jointly by the European Union and the Sri Lankan Government.
When the President was requested by the political leadership of the area to allocate Rs 90 million for further development of the institute, the President said that he will take immediate measures to allocate Rs 25 million of the Rs 90 million this week itself. He promised to allocate the rest when the process is being carried out for the further development of the institute.
Addressing a large gathering, the President said the ISTI is important to agriculture areas such as Batticaloa. As an agriculture country, it is important to strengthen every aspect of the agriculture sector.
The President noted that the Government will provide the entire requirement of seed paddy. The country needs 4,000,000 bushels per year and moves have already been taken to meet the entire requirement, he added.
We all are here to work for the development of the agriculture sector, he noted while stating that he firmly believes that the future prosperity of the country depends mainly on agricultural developments.
We are proud to mention that we have inherited an agricultural history. Therefore, more attention is needed towards agriculture development and the betterment of the people involved in the agriculture sector.
The President noted that the farmer community is always ridden with various issues relating to agriculture such as water scarcity, lack of technology, financial burdens, land issues and more. It is important to increase the productivity of agricultural crops to ease the farmer community, who are ridden with those issues.
The Provincial Agriculture Ministries and the Agriculture Ministry of the Government are mainly responsible to take measures to increase the productivity of crops aiming to ease the burdens of the farmer community.
The farmers are among the main forces that contribute to the countrys economy and therefore the government takes the responsibility of safeguarding farmers while uplifting them, President Sirisena said.
The Government has paid more attention on the development of the Eastern Province.
The Presidential Secretariat has launched a programme to renovate 100 irrigation tanks in the Trincomalee district and of them 40 tanks have been renovated by now. He said he hopes to allocate funds for the renovation of tanks of the Batticaloa district.
A national agriculture action plan was prepared by this Government after coming to power. However, the plan could not be properly carried out due to the prevailing drought situation experienced by millions of people.
We spend over Rs 3,100 millions monthly for providing facilities for 800,000 drought affected families. Agriculture production has reduced by 50 per cent due to the severe drought.
The President said he is familiar with agriculture being a son of a farmer.
The President added that a friendly country will grant 250,000 MT of rice to be distributed among drought affected families by next month. The President said the country cannot depend on others and rice cannot be imported as it is a disgrace to the country.

RDA Chairman cites technical reasons
Rs.36 b increase in Southern Expressway cost:
Road Development Authority (RDA) Chairman Nihal Sooriyarachchi yesterday cited technical reasons for the increase of Rs.36 billion in the cost of the Southern Expressway project.
RDA Chairman Sooriyarachchi responding to COPE Chairman JVP MP Sunil Handunettis allegation that there was a loss of Rs.36 billion incurred due to an extension, explained that the road extension was a result of their soil investigations in the area and environmental concerns.
In addition, he said the road was initially planned to be built on a soil embankment but had to be later changed to be on elevated columns.
Handunetti had charged that the project was initially launched with an estimated cost of Rs.243 billion; a loan from the Chinas EXIM Bank.
The government had also agreed to bear 15 percent of the cost of the first and second phases of the project. Later on the Chinese company constructing the expressway; FSDI had asked for an additional estimate of Rs.36 billion to extend the flyovers by 2.78 km,the COPE Chairman said.
Environmentalists pointed out that we needed to keep space for animals to cross over and in addition, there was a flood in the area and the road got flooded, so we had to change the plan to have the road built on elevated columns, the RDA Chairman further explained.
There is a big difference between a road on a soil embankment and elevated columns, so yes it is true that we have changed the plan and the cost, but that was due to technical reasons, he added.
With regard to extending the road by 2.78 km, he explained that while the elevated section was indeed extended thus, sections on soil embankments were reduced to compensate for the increase.
He also denied Handunettis claims that the RDA had granted permission for the Chinese company to hire foreign employees without first checking their qualifications.
The Chinese company asked that certain Chinese advisors be brought into the project. We have checked all qualification, we would not be able to work with them otherwise, Sooriyarachchi said. The RDA Chairman however assured that he had directed their audit department to conduct a fresh audit of the project in order to investigate further into the claims made by Handunetti.

Reviewing Policing Practices
Continued from August 30, 2017....
The committee appointed to study reforms to the Police has identified five key elements in reforming the Sri Lanka Police; one of them discussed yesterday was quality recruitment and strengthening of the code of ethics. The rest are as follows:
In terms of Improving Transparency and Accountability, the main demand by public was a fair and impartial police service, free from language, religious, gender, ethnicity or class bias. In the Police Survey, 96 percent of officers indicated that there was a need to improve transparency and accountability in the system. When asked what can be done, 68 percent indicated the provision of better facilities at work; 59 percent stated increasing the number of interaction programmes with the community and 57 percent stated having proper processes for promotions and transfers.
The various consultations pointed to a multi-pronged approach to accountability, which included strengthening internal oversight mechanisms, as well as external oversight mechanisms such as social audits and stronger oversight by the National Police Commission.
Strengthening Ministerial Oversight
Strengthening Ministerial Oversight required improving measures to raise public awareness of how to report a complaint against the police to the NPC. It entailed all police officers to submit asset reports to the Ministry of Justice as per procedure applied to Chief Inspectors and above.
Developing Public Oversight could be achieved by introducing social audits/community scorecards to be conducted at police station level, as well as publicising police approaches and strategies to promote transparency and public understanding.
Use technology to reduce corruption and enhance accountability.
A. Review and prioritize projects which are currently in hibernation (e.g. Spot fine through payment gateway; introducing ICT systems in police emergency cars, etc.)
B. Review the use and monitoring of CCTV in stations to determine its effectiveness before a decision is taken to expand installation of CCTV cameras in police stations in future, bearing in mind the cost/benefit.
C. Explore feasibility of the use of body camera/dashboard cams for traffic police and patrol vehicles. Amend laws to allow for automated kiosks or mobile phone payment for traffic fines. Relevant proposals are pending approval with the AG's department.
Enhance coordination with other government departments and agencies. This could be achieved by exploring coordination mechanisms or opportunities to tackle corruption with, for example, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Excise Department.
Ensuring Respect for Human Rightswas one of the main recommendations. The police as well asthe public recognize the need to improve application of human rights standards in policing in Sri Lanka.
There is an allegation of arbitrary arrests, torture and beatings of suspects, and not producing suspects before court as violations of human rights in nearly all locations. Another issue of concern is the complaint that information of the informant/complainant is leaked to the accused.
Communities stated that this result in threats directed to the informants. The inability to record a complaint in Tamil language was also identified as a violation of fundamental rights as well as language rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
The treatment of children and women was highlighted as a particular issue of concern, particularly the sexual harassment faced by women motorists, and women making complaints. It was stated that in general, police are slow to act against a domestic violence complaint, and often take too long to respond.
The OA found that human rights were not clearly understood in the policing context. None of the focus groups could satisfactorily answer policing scenarios that posed a human rights dilemma. This also concerns the way in which the Sri Lanka Police responds to public order situations.
The Policing Reforms underscore the importance of broad principles of human rights which include equality, freedom and dignity and recognize that it is important to look beyond the provisions of fundamental human rights. Therefore, the PRC highlights the importance of the SLP recognizing and taking steps to ensure that in every engagement between a member of the Sri Lanka Police and a civilian, the rights of the civilians are respected and protected, regardless of whether that civilian is a suspect, complainant, victim or witness.
Furthermore, it is imperative that the Sri Lanka Police recognize that although crime prevention is an important task of policing, it should not be performed in a manner that conflicts with the respect owed to civilians and their rights.
Ensuring Respect for Human Rights
The Commission made the following recommendations for Ensuring Respect for Human Rights:
Strengthen prevention and response to gender based violence.
A. Introduce a Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy for the Sri Lanka Police.
B. Complete a gender audit of police stations to create an enabling environment for women police officers and members of the public who visit the station.
C. Optimize deployment of existing Women Police Officers based on prioritized policing needs and functions.
D. Ensure each station has private spaces for recording statements, especially for women and children.
E. (Refer 2014 regulations, in keeping with the Policing Reforms and ensure implementation in all police stations. The regulations include separate entrance for women and childrens unit, separate interrogation room, public bathrooms, recording facilities for juvenile offenders etc.)
F. Enhance partnerships with local and national government agencies and/or NGOs working on gender base violence to provide referrals and support services to victims by
- Participation in District or Divisional Forums against gender based violence
- Linking with Women Development Officers at Divisional Level
G. Roster women officers to be on duty at stations at night to record statements and provide related services  building on the current practice of the On-Call system.
H. Analyse, develop and streamline Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and ensure facilities are in place to ensure the effective implementation of this recommendation.
Strengthen the Human Rights Division within the SLP
A. Increase recognition and resource allocation.
B. Ensure that the Human Resource Development is staffed with qualified legal professionals.
C. Appoint a senior responsible officer to ensure that Sri Lanka Police policies, procedures and behaviour are compliant with human rights standards, and consider the human rights impact of new initiatives. This could be an advisory role linked to the Human Rights Commission.
Strengthen Human Rights Training
A. Refine training on practical application of human rights in different aspects of operational policing.
B. Introduce and strengthen investigation and interrogation manuals and training for police, in line with international and domestic human rights standards.
Strengthen Public Order Management
A. Ensure specialized Public Order Management training and resources are available to the SLP that meets international human rights standards.
B. Ensure Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are developed and in place to respond to public order incidents through a human rights framework.
C. Improve coordination between various Units within the Police involved in Public Order Management.
Ensure adequate supervision and leadership  strengthen command responsibility
A. Expedite disciplinary inquiry of allegations of human rights violations.
B. Collate and learn lessons from case law, and feed this into training. Ensuring dissemination among police ranks.
C. Ensure that the performance management system has an explicit focus on past human rights records.
Establish a Police Stress Management Unit
A. Situated within the Police Medical Division, with access to a clinical psychologist.
Identify police officers experiencing severe operational or personal stress and guide them to this service.
B. For more general counselling needs for police officers and their families, seek to build partnerships with existing state service providers (trained government Counselling Officers and Counselling Assistants at District level).
Implement recommendations of the Anti-Torture Programme of the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development. This would require better integration and alignment of the current Anti-Torture Programme of MLOSD with the Policing Reform Action Plan.
Preventing and Controlling Crime, and Reducing Fear of Crime
Preventing and Controlling Crime, and Reducing Fear of Crimeare considered one of the mostimportant issues for the Sri Lanka Police. Community consultations highlighted that to prevent crime, police should appoint qualified personnel to positions, adhere to rules and regulations and codes of conduct such as being unbiased, refrain from corruption and bribery, and not be susceptible to political influence.
In the Police Survey, only 37 percent of police officers indicated that the police were very effective in investigating and prosecuting crime.
When asked what measures could make the police more effective at investigating and prosecuting crime, 75 percent stated increased use of technology in investigation; 61 percent indicated working closely with the community and 42 percent indicated investigating a wider range of suspects.
The Community Police Unit; the Minor Offences Branch and the Traffic Branch were identified as units that can contribute to improving police-community relations as well as adversely affecting police-community relations. Responsiveness of police was highlighted as a primary factor contributing to public perceptions of safety, with public indicating dissatisfaction with the current response time by the SLP. Recommendations for Preventing and Controlling Crime, and Reducing Fear of Crime are given below:
Increased Police responsiveness could be achieved by:
A. Enhanced visibility through regular patrolling.
B. Identify core and non-core policing tasks (such as traffic control, dengue eradication, environmental issues) and conduct study on deployment of personnel and resources in non-core and core police duties on a day-to-day basis at police station level.
C. Increase use of technology to free police officers from non-core activities e.g. CCTV technology for traffic control.
D. Increase police responsiveness to reported crimes by ensuring access to adequate vehicles and fuel at station level.
E. Improved 119 responses in all three languages and publicize local police numbers.
F. Introduce smartphone app for increasing access to regular police services.
G. Formalize and improve coordination of criminal intelligence collection and management process in line with international policing standards. Monitoring of suspects (especially re-offending gangs) released on bail.
Ensure efficient and effective criminal investigation and prosecution processes to ensure appropriate conviction rates.
A. Review of the current criminal investigation and prosecution process on the part of the police.
B. Strengthen the Legal Division in the police.
C. Enhance the role of OICs in overseeing criminal investigations.
D. Professional lawyers (police officers) deployed at Divisional level to prosecute police cases/ recruiting professional prosecutors.
E. Investigation of (murder, rape) grave crimes to be led by OIC or OIC Crime.
Enhance the prevention of crime
A. Strengthening the research, planning and statistics functions of the police at the National and Divisional level, including deploying a crime analyst to each police Range.
B. Introduce a data driven system of collecting and analysing data of crime, incidents and trends.
C. Develop a participatory multi-stakeholder crime prevention strategy, with a specific focus on juvenile offenders and organized crime. (Linked to digitalisation of data and use of technology to identify profile of offenders.)
D. Develop partnerships with other government departments and NGOs for referral services for offenders (e.g. alcohol and drug treatment programmes).
E. Conduct studies and develop a strategy to control the circulation of illegal weapons (linked to gang violence, organized crime).
Establish a dialogue with the Ministry of Prison Reforms and Rehabilitation and Prison Department to develop a collaborative intervention programme to reduce overcrowding in prison and manage offences within prisons. This included improving coordination and dialogue/discussions on reducing remand backlogs, Review of jail time for minor offences, Increasing rehabilitation programmes to support reintegration into society (e.g. learn a trade), Addressing crime organization from within prisons  secure prisons and remove access to mobile phones, Monitor convicted criminals (eg. electronic tagging) to minimise reoffending; identify case officers to ensure proper management, Prison officials to inform local Police when suspects are released.
Increasing Public Trust and Confidence
Increasing Public Trust and Confidenceis among the main issues considered. Communityconsultations revealed that public lack confidence in the police due to the perception that the police do not act fairly, are dishonest and disrespectful. Certain groups believe that they can evade penalties for crimes by bribing police officers. In terms of police perception about their relationship with the public, only 16 percent indicated that the relationship was very good, the majority, 55 percent stated it was good.
Overall, the Community Consultation on Police Reforms suggested that Community Police Committees could help with identifying a village level plan to prevent and respond to crime; and recommended steps to formalize the Community Police Committees, stressing the importance of a clear constitution process for selection or election of office bearers, gender balance and introducing expert opinion into the Committee.
The Organizational Analysis found that community engagement is primarily via the Community Policing Committees and the Police Advisory Groups. However, the Organizational Analysis was of the opinion that this is far too large and cumbersome with nearly 15,000 such groups, with the expectation that each will hold a monthly meeting with the police. None of the Community Police Committees and Police Advisory Groups had received training or detailed advice about their role.
Recommendations to ensure Increasing Public Trust and Confidence
Enhance community policing
A. Establish a multi-stakeholder committee to review the community policing approach in Sri Lanka to develop a Community Policing Policy to embed this as the overarching approach for Sri Lanka Police.
B. Police officers to be trained in the concept of community policing as the underlining ethos of the police service that applies to all functions.
C. Review the effectiveness/impact of the recent OIC training (122 Station OICs) on community policing.
D. Review effectiveness of Community Police Committees including how representative they are of, and accountable to, communities.
E. Introduce a problem-solving approach and use this in partnership with government and non-government agencies and CPCs in the area to develop station-level community policing and crime prevention plans.
F. Review and improve mechanism to give feedback to public on progress in investigations of reported crimes and complaints.
Develop a communications strategy (Linked to the Change Management Division but not limited to Policing Reforms)
A. Ensure that public information is regularly updated on the police website and social media accounts in three languages.
B. Provide visible notices (such as existing HRC regulations) in all three languages at stations on human rights and how to make a complaint.
C. Enhance the SLPs Annual Report as a means of accountability and publish on website. Review format of Annual Report for effective reporting of the achievements/status of implementation of the Policing Reforms.
D. Effective use of print and electronic media.
E. Review the present media and communication policy of the SLP to determine type of information that OICs can share with media. Especially considering the prevalent use of social media.
Seek to ensure a greater sense of procedural justice in SLP interactions with the public.
A. Conduct and assess impact of training for SLP functions that interact the most with the public
(traffic, community policing, miscellaneous complaints, women and childrens desks) on ensuring respect and dignity for complainants, suspects, victims etc.
B. Conduct and assess impact of training for SLP officers on treating each other with greater respect and dignity.
Design and establish police stations that are welcoming and people-friendly.
A. Increase the use of police mobile clinics/ temporary police stations to take police services out into communities.
B. Introduce police station open days to promote a stronger community-police relationship.
C. Establish one model police station per division every six months.
Enhance public outreach through police-public partnerships
A. Liaise with the Human Rights Commission or other third parties to raise awareness among the public on human rights.
B. Work with civil society partners to create awareness on how the public can work constructively with the police; raise awareness on community policing.
C. Establish closer collaboration with youth organisations at local level with the support of relevant national organisations like the Youth Services Council, Sports Ministry, and Universities, to develop and implement programmes to bring the police and youth closer together.

ROY a stylist and LIONEL a record setter
Two batsmen who were made in the mould of West Indian maulers. And when at the wicket they sprayed bowlers around the world and over it with superb timing, power and elegance. They were two of kind : LIONEL FERNANDO in the pre Test era and ROY LUKE DIAS in the post Test era.
Both FERNANDO and DIAS were exciting to watch when in the hunt for runs. And there was a lot to learn watching them, the manner in which they pierced the field and left the fielders beaten as they caressed the ball to the fence with ease.
FERNANDO emerged from St Annes College Kurunegala to St.Benedicts College, Kotahena and DIAS was a pure bred batsman from the School by the canal, St.Peters College Bambalapitiya. Both captained their respective schools, shone with the bat, scoring heavily and then continued to give continuity to their careers which culminated in playing for the country.
A little anecdote
Talking of the canal by the Bambalaptiya school a little anecdote related by Carlton Seneviratne a former Peterite cricketer and athlete and Sports Editor of the DAILY NEWS. It went like this. He said: Every time an athletic meet was held on the Peterite Ground, records used to tumble especially in the track events. When queried he said: Because athletes were dashing away from the stench emanating from the canal, to much laughter.
First to DIAS. He started his career which showed great promise under the expert coaching of former Peterite cricketer Mike Chanmugam. Chanmugam noticed in Dias the enormous natural talent and all he had to do was to talk to the young man, make him believe in his natural talent and only polish the rough edges in his batting. Chanmugam did that to a nicety.
One match DIAS wont forget was the Big match against St.Josephs when the side he captained collapsed for 36 unable to counter the amazing and well controlled seam and swing bowling by Josephian South Paw Rajiv Benedict.
That bowling feat of 8 for 6 will not be equaled or bettered. He was on a hat trick but young Bernard Wijetunge coming in next who was later to captain St.Peters deprived him of that rare feat.
Big runs for school
DIAS scored big runs for his school, captaining it and then threw his talent with the Colts Cricket Club where his coach Chanmugam was a member. He continued his run making in the Sara Trophy tournament and national colours were not long in coming. When the country rejoiced after gaining that elusive admission to the big league and when the inaugural Test against England was played at the Colombo Oval, DIAS found himself in the Sri Lanka team and penciled to bat at the fall-important number three slot.
But his first strike in the big time ended in disaster when he made a debut blob. Many top notch world batsmen have begun their career with ducks at the first time of striking and gone on to rewrite the batting record books. And it was no different with DIAS.
Style and elegance came naturally to DIAS. He was always in line with the ball and watched it hawk-eyed until the ball kissed his bat before executing the stroke that brought him bag full of runs in club as well as international cricket.
He was an example
He was an example to all youngsters watching and could be bracketed alongside Michael Tissera, Anura Tennekoon, Ranjan Madugalle, Sidat Wettimuny and Marvan Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara as batting stylists sadly not seen in todays game.
Although DIAS made a disastrous debut first knock against England in the inaugural Test with a duck with a delivery from England pacie Bob Willis that was unplayable, he made the England players watch his elegant stroke play in the second innings making a grand 77 in this game where Duleep Mendis, Ranjan Madugalle and Arjuna Ranatunga also made half centuries.
In the Tests to follow h formed the Lankan batting backbone with his skipper Duleep Mendis, like did Michael Tissera and Anura Tennekoon, Asanka Gurusinha and Aravinda de Silva, Mahela Jayawardena and Kumar Sangakkara. DIAS continued his good form scoring 295 runs in the series against Pakistan in Pakistan with 98 at Faisalabad and a magnificent 109 at Lahore against an attack led by that once in a life time all rounder and a master of swing bowling Imran Khan.
Marvelous century
I was there on that tour as a journalist and with commentator and journalist Qamar Ahmed marveled at his century. Ahmed who had a score of covering cricket for over 50 years ( like the writer I might add) predicted a bright future for the youngster and DIAS strode the field scoring heavily and seeing Ahmeds prediction come true.
DIAS played in 20 Tests scoring 1285 runs including three hundreds and 8 fifties with a highest score of 109. In the one-day career he played 58 matches, made 1573 runs including 2 centuries and 11 fifties. He began his Test career against England in 1982 and played the final Test against vs New Zealand in Colombo in 1987.
His one-day career unfolded against New Zealand at Nottingham in 1979 and ended against England in Pune in 1987. Incidentally ROYs father RICHARD and brother NORMAN were Benedictines and played soccer for the college and RICHARD played for Ceylon later on.
Benedictine LIONEL FERNANDO
LIONEL FERNANDO was a heavy scoring stylish right hand batsman in school cricket for St.Benedicts College, Kotahena in late 1950s. He was also a handy right arm bowler who bowled medium pace both way cutters.
He captained SBC in 1959 and I was his vice captain. In a game against his old school St.Annes he created a rare record that will probably stand the test of time.
On the first day he bagged all 10 wickets for 24 including a hat trick to dismiss the opponents for 50 and slammed a double hundred in 157 minutes on the turf wicket at Kotahena which was believed to be unique in world cricket and earned him mention in crickets bible  WISDEN.
FERNANDO later played for Nomads and earned his Ceylon cap and played from 1964 t 1971. He first played for the Board Presidents X1 when Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan in 1964. He top scored with 40 in a one dayer for Ceylon against MCC.
He also toured Pakistan and played in an unofficial Test and a few days later made 48 and 72 against a strong West Indies side at the Colombo Oval.
FERNANDO later played league cricket in England before migrating to Australia where he continued his career where he played several seasons of club cricket.
ROY and LIONEL deserve to be in the list of SPORTS LEGENDS.

Single law to control gem industry
A comprehensive piece of legislation which will consolidate various legal controls of the Gem Industry into one has been proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister, who addressed the opening of the FACETS International Gem and Jewellery Exhibition at the BMICH yesterday, noted that the multiple laws and regulations imposed by various authorities only sought to stifle the industry and its progress.
The industry, he explained, had stagnated since 1990; a time when President Ranasinghe Premadasa had chosen to launch exhibitions such as FACETS to promote the gem and jewellery as a major foreign exchange earner in the country.
Since then, we lost our momentum. If we had maintained it, Sri Lanka would have been a prosperous country not only in terms of gems and apparel but also other sectors, he said.
The Government under President Maithripala Sirisena has the opportunity to relook at economic development.
For me the criteria for development is trebling foreign exchange earnings, ensuring more people are employed and ensuring that the Government's revenue is not in any way hindered, the Prime Minister said. He asked export industries to take the opportunity and increase their trade. The Prime Minister asked the stakeholders to concentrate on the jewellery industry more and take into account environmental concerns when developing gem mining.
"Many of our traders travel out to bring gems to Sri Lanka. Many countries like Hong Kong, which are not even connected to gems, are now major trading hubs. Sri Lanka too has this opportunity, the Prime Minister said.
He suggested that at least another 100,000 more can be employed in various other areas in the gem industry and that during the first phase, a goal of USD 1-1.5 billion be targeted as foreign exchange earnings.
The Prime Minister said the Export Development Board, National Gem and Jewelry Authority, Finance Ministry and the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, would work together with stakeholders in the industry to achieve the goal.
He invited proposals from the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewelry Association to improve the industry.
All this time, we were looking at debt which many people said we wouldnt be able to solve. So it took a lot of time. But now we are looking to expand that economy, the Prime Minister said.

SLFP to celebrate sober, dignified 66th anniversary
Fisheries Minister and UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the 66th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will be the biggest event in the recent political history and it will be free of alcohol.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said Presiedent Maithripala Sirisena has instructed all electoral organisers that alcohol will be strictly prohibited during the event.
The 64th anniversary of the SLFP was held in Polonnaruwa with the participation of about 10,000 supporters after President Srisena took over the leadership of the party in January 2015.
The 65th anniversary was held in Kurunegala with the participation of a record number of people including the large number of people from the North and the East and it was a biggest successful rally in the history.
He said the 66th anniversary would see the largest attendance for a party anniversary in the country in the recent past.
"Passenger buses heve been hired from the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and the private sector after payment and no State transport service, property or funds were abused for the SLFP anniversary".
"We will introduce the future Political Programme of the party at the event.We have invited all parties including members of the Joint Opposition. The event will be held under the theme of a pure and clean national political campaign for the future of the country.
It is the whole aim of the President creating a SLFP as a pure and clean political party.
"The President has instructed us not to entertain any corruption and fraud because he will be compelled to take action against each individual regardless of their position. The Minister further said that the SLFP leadership and the members have now reached the decisive moment that action has to be taken against those trying to split the SLFP through the formation of new party.
"We thought that they would unify with the party and now many party rankers in the grassroot level are questioning us as to why no action is being taken against these people.
He added that several media outlets which still strike fear of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa do not broadcast or telecast their voice cuts.
"They should not be afraid of their work as the Yahapalana Government has given media freedom suppressed by the dictatorship rule of Mahinda Rajapaksa," he said.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha and State Minister of rehabilitation, Resettlement M.L.A.M. Hizbullah spoke.

SLFP submits proposals on Constitutional reforms

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has submitted proposals on Constitutional reforms to the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly yesterday, Parliamentary sources told the Daily News.
The Steering Committee was awaiting the SLFP proposals to finalize its interim report, which will pronounce the contours of constitutional reforms. The report, which deals with vital aspects of Constitution including the electoral reforms, devolution of power, and nature of the State, is expected in the Constitutional Assembly this month.
The Steering Committee sources confirming that it received the SLFP proposals from Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said those would be put before the committee at its next round of meeting scheduled from September 6.
The Steering Committee has been ready with the interim report since December last year, but its presentation delayed because the SLFP was bidding more time to articulate its position on constitutional reforms.
Ministers Nimal Siripala, Dilan Perera and Susil Premajayantha are representing the SLFP at the Steering Committee headed by the Prime Minister. Many SLFP stalwarts over the past months insisted that the executive presidency should not be abolished and that they were not in favour of any Amendment that requires a referendum.
The SLFP proposals will be important in reaching a common ground as to whether there will be a new Constitution or only an Amendment.

Smart innovations in claim settlement lift Softlogic Life to become number one in Sri Lanka
Sri Lankas fastest growing and most innovative life insurance company Softlogic Life PLC was crowned recently as the undisputed claims service leader in Sri Lanka, after it won the prestigious Excellence in Claims Service award at the Sri Lanka Insurance Industry Awards 2017 by Fintelekt.
Softlogic Life shared the stage with all the top Indian Insurance companies who were awarded at the gala Fintelekt event that combined India and Sri Lanka awards held on July 2, in Mumbai, India. The high profile awards ceremony recognized and honoured the achievements of insurance companies in India and Sri Lanka that have met measurable and tangible business objectives.
The Excellence in Claims Service Award honoured Softlogic Lifes unwavering efforts which demonstrated companys overall leadership and commitment to effective and speedy claims settlement in Sri Lanka.The parameters for evaluation included volume and value of claims settled, average turnaround time for claims payment, repudiation rates and speed in claims settlement.
During 2016, Softlogic Life had superiorly lead the way in claims settlement metrics such as rate of settlement, speed of settlement and low repudiation. This strong performance, which is above par in the local life insurance industry, was greatly supported by the companys focus on the use of technology for improvement in customer service through better empowerment and convenience during the claims settlement process.
Commenting about this significant industry recognition, Softlogic Life Managing Director, Iftikar Ahamed stated, As the leader in the insurance healthcare sector, the company has significantly improved its health claim settlement ratio from 20% in 2015 to 60% in 2016 in terms of on-the-spot settlement. 80% of health claims were settled within a day and overall 98% of the total claims settled within three working days. This is a significant improvement in the service level of the company and it achieved with the technological modification to the existing operation.
Softlogic Lifes extensive expertise in IT-enabled multi-channels has increased their ability to leverage on greater efficiencies, helping the company to deliver greater convenience to customers as well to become the best in claims settlement in the industry. Policyholders of Softlogic Life are empowered via their LifeUp smartphone application where it enables customers to access their policy details and make necessary amendments, pay premiums, intimation of claims, upload claim documents, view payment history and so on. For an instance, customers can intimate claims and download claim with a single click of a button, without physically visiting the branch. By uploading the photos of claim-related documents to the app, customers have been able to receive settlement within a short period time, giving them the breathing space to send original documents at the later stage.
Taking advantage of disruptive technologies further, Softlogic Life also launched a real time claim meter on their website, which enhanced greater transparency on claim settlements of customers. Introducing Cashless Hospitalization, a facility that is available in 60 hospitals island-wide, Softlogic Life eliminated the need for patients to settle their hospital bill as the company pays it directly to the hospital, leaving the patient stress-free. Softlogic Life is the only insurance provider in Sri Lanka with international cashless facility, which is available in Apollo Hospitals India and Parkway Hospitals Singapore.
The company went the extra mile to introduce the super branch concept to its customers, where a modern branch fully equipped with technology provides superior customer experience as a one-stop shop; there, customers can personalize policy features and could purchase Softlogic Group products as well. Softlogic Life is also the first to empower policyholders to customize their own policies without a one-size-fits-all approach.
These significant improvements in claim servicing have created a benchmark for other industry players to follow Softlogic Life. We believe every claim is an opportunity to serve a customer and paying a claim is the guaranteed way to build customer confidence towards life insurance, which will ultimately have a positive impact to improve penetration level of life insurance in the country, said Ahmed further.
Softlogic Life Insurance PLC is a subsidiary of Softlogic Capital PLC and is part of the Softlogic Group, which is recognized as one of Sri Lankas most diversified and fastest-growing conglomerates, with interests in Healthcare, Retail, ICT, Leisure, Automobiles and Financial Services. Significant stakeholders in the company also include FMO and DEG, who are rated AAA Development Financial Institutions from the Netherlands and Germany, respectively.

Sri Lankas banking system outlook negative - Moodys
Moodys Investors Service says that the outlook for Sri Lankas banking system is negative, with both asset quality and profitability under pressure.
The economy will only see a modest growth rebound as the governments fiscal constraints continue to limit public investment and private spending, despite stronger goods and services exports, said Srikanth Vadlamani, a Moodys Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.
Moodys conclusions are contained in its just-released Banking System Outlook: Sri Lanka, Macroeconomic risks from weak fiscal position and deteriorating bank asset quality underpin negative outlook.
Moodys outlook assesses five key factors: operating environment, stable;asset risk and capital,
deteriorating,stable; profitability and efficiency, deteriorating; funding and liquidity, stable; and government support, deteriorating.
Credit growth was very high over the last two years, with the credit multiplier (credit growth/GDP growth) shooting up to an average of 2x over 2015 and 2016, up from 1x in 2014. As the loans made over this period start seasoning, asset quality will deteriorate. In addition, rising interest rates add to repayment burdens.
However, increased loan loss reserves will provide some comfort, said Vadlamani. In addition, profits will come under pressure as higher funding costs offset the benefits from higher loan rates,
while credit costs move higher, added Vadlamani.
At the same time, capital will remain stable as the banks are raising capital and reducing dividends to comply with Basel III requirements, though execution and market risks could derail fund-raising efforts. Under our baseline scenario analysis, capital, as defined by tangible common
equity to risk weighted assets, will decrease to 7.6% at end-2018 from 7.8% at end-2016, without any additional equity raising.
The funding profiles of the banks are set to improve after weakening in recent quarters, as loan growth slows down. Furthermore, Sri Lankan banks hold sizeable liquid assets to cover their
liquidity needs and movements in deposits.
The rated banks liquid assets averaged around 30% of tangible banking assets as of December 2016, thereby providing considerable buffers against funding risks. On the other hand, a high debt burden and contingent liabilities relating to state-owned enterprises restrict the governments capacity to support the banks.
