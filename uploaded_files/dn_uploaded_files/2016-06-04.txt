Kyrgios pulls out of Olympics, lashes AOC
SYDNEY, FRIDAY: Fiery Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios on Friday pulled out of the Rio Olympics, blaming unwarranted attacks on him by Australian Olympic chiefs after he was warned to behave.
His decision follows fellow Australian Bernard Tomic making himself unavailable for Games selection last month after widespread criticism about his recent on-court attitude and behaviour. Unfortunately, while I have expressed every intention of trying to win a medal for my country in Rio, it's very clear to me that the Australian Olympic Committee has other plans, the world number 19 said in a statement.
AOC's unfair and unjust treatment of me over the last four weeks, as well as the organisation's crystal clear position on whether they want me to be a part of the Australian Olympic team, has solidified my final decision.
His bombshell announcement follows a war of words with the AOC's chef de mission Kitty Chiller, who had voiced concerns over selecting Kyrgios and Tomic due to their behaviour.
She acknowledged Kyrgios decision in a brief statement Friday, adding that in regard to selection every athlete in contention is treated equally and fairly.
We have no further comment on this issue.
Volatile 21-year-old Kyrgios is no stranger to controversy, frequently falling foul of tennis authorities.
Most recently, he received a code violation at the French Open for shouting at a ball boy and was fined for an audible obscenity during his thrashing at the hands of Richard Gasquet.
He said playing for Australia at the Olympics had been a childhood dream and blasted the AOC for not talking to him.
While I have received assurances from Tennis Australia that I will be nominated for the Olympic team, the AOC has chosen to publicly and privately disparage me, he said.
Not one member of the AOC has reached out to me, my family, my team, or representatives of Tennis Australia, asking for a meeting or the opportunity to discuss their concerns.
The AOC's unwarranted attacks on me demonstrate the organisation's inability to understand the circumstances surrounding highly competitive sports.
In the wake of Chiller's criticism, Tennis Australia publicly backed Kyrgios, saying he was making a concerted effort to improve his performance and behaviour. TA president Steve Healy said Friday that Kyrgios continued to have the organisation's support. AFP

PM, Cabinet to raise objections
The Supreme Court was yesterday informed by counsel representing Cabinet of Ministers including the Prime Minister that they were intending to file limited objections over the Courts jurisdiction to hear a Fundamental Rights petition that had been filed challenging the constitutionality of the present government formed after August 17 General Election.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with K. Kanageswaran PC appearing for the Cabinet of Ministers including the Prime Minister informed the Supreme Court that the formation of the National Government was an act of the Eecutive Presidency and thereby they were intending to file limited objections over the Courts jurisdiction to hear this petition.
The Fundamental Rights petition filed by former MP Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara and Prof. Wimaladharma Abeywickreme had sought a declaration that the present government formed after the August 17 General Election is not a National Government within the meaning of Article 46(5) of the
Constitution.
When the petition came up before the Supreme Court three-judge Bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Upali Abeyratne and Justice Anil Goonaratne, the respondents were directed to file their limited objections within two weeks.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva with senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana and H.M. Tillekeratne appeared for the petitioners.
The petitioners had cited 242 parties including the cabinet of Ministers, members of parliamentarians in the parliament, recognized political parties as respondents.
The petitioners stated that Article 46(1), (5) and (5) of the Constitution provide as follows.
46. (1) The total number of-
(a) Ministers of the cabinet of Ministers shall not exceed thirty; and
(b) Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers shall not, in the aggregate, exceed forty.
(5) National government means, a Government means, a government formed by the recognized political party or the independent group which obtains the highest number of seats in Parliament together with the other recognized political parties or the independent groups.
The petitioners said the government was formed upon a purported agreement between the UNP and the SLFP (which is not a political party represented in Parliament) they said all the parties in parliament did not join to form the government. The UNP which obtained the highest number of seats in parliament did not form the government together with the other recognised political parties or independent groups represented in parliament.
They further sought a declaration that the Cabinet of Ministers have no power, authority or jurisdiction to function as the cabinet of Ministers of the republic of Sri Lanka. They said the approval made by parliament on September 3, 2015 has no force or effect in law in determining the number of Ministers of the cabinet of Ministers, Ministers not members of the Cabinet/State Ministers and Deputy Ministers consequent to the General Election held on August 17, in as much as the condition precedent to the existence of the National Government is absent.
They also sought a declaration that the appointment of cabinet of Ministers is null and void and has no force or effect in law.
The petitioners maintained that continuing to function as members of the Cabinet of Ministers is inconsistent with the Constitution and continuously violate the Fundamental Rights of the petitioners as enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Parliamentary Group to meet on June 6 to discuss NCM against Ravi
The Parliamentary Group will meet on June 6 at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to come to a final decision on the No Confidence Motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Vocational Training and Development Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said. Addressing the media at the Government Information Department Auditorium, Colombo yesterday he said that his personal view on the matter is that no minister should vote for it because if the ministers are in the Government they have a collective responsibility not to let down a fellow minister.
According to Minister Samarasinghe, if we raise our hand against a fellow minister, we have to resign from the Government. If we accept the fact that the Finance Minister had done something wrong, we cannot stay in the Government any longer. We have a collective responsibility.
I will express my personal view during the June 6 meeting. The final and correct decision will be made there. There are only 30 or 40 MPs in the Joint Opposition who think politically, he dded.
