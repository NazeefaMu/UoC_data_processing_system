Iowa caucuses: Ted Cruz wins; Clinton, Sanders tied
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has won the Iowa Republican caucuses, a huge victory for him and a bitter defeat for Donald Trump in the country's first presidential contest.

Democrats, meanwhile, are in a nail-biter fight with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders less than a percentage point apart.

The victory for Cruz is the first time that the conventional laws of politics have applied to Trump, a billionaire businessman who has built his campaign around the perception that he's a winner who can bring his unique skills to the White House.

But Trump's big personality, social media presence and large rallies failed to overcome Cruz's more traditional approach to Iowa's retail politics. Cruz spent months touring the state and reaching out to evangelical voters. The win sets him up as a formidable contender in the delegate-rich, Southern states that crowd the GOP calendar in the coming weeks and offers movement conservatives hope that one of their own can become the nominee for the first time since Ronald Reagan.

As he claimed victory, Cruz fired immediate shots at both Trump and the party elites who disdain him.

"Iowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next President of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment," Cruz said.

With about 99% of the GOP vote in, Cruz was ahead of Trump 28% to 24%. Marco Rubio was at 23%.

Trump delivered a short but gracious speech, saying he loved Iowa and vowed to go on next week to win the New Hampshire primary.

"We will go on to get the Republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie," Trump told supporters. "We finished second, and I have to say I am just honored."

Rubio's strong showing could set him up as the best placed potential establishment candidate to take on "outsider" challengers Cruz and Trump.

"This is the moment they said would never happen. For months, they told us we had no chance," a jubilant Rubio said, as he became the first candidate to appear before the cameras to comment on the results.

"They told me that I needed to wait my turn, that I needed to wait in line. But tonight here in Iowa, the people of this great state have sent a very clear message  after seven years of Barack Obama, we are not waiting any longer to take our country back."

Cruz's win, meanwhile, suggests that the Texas senator's organization, built up over months, could prevail over Trump's more unorthodox campaign based on the power of his personality and celebrity.

Trump went into Monday night with polls suggesting that he stood on the verge of a potentially stunning victory that would shake that Republican Party establishment. But Cruz banked on a strong turnout from evangelical voters to build a classic Iowa winning coalition.

The caucuses resulted in two casualties -- one on each side. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, both dropped their candidacies after faring poorly.

Even before the caucuses began, Ben Carson's campaign said he wouldn't go directly to New Hampshire or South Carolina -- the site of the next primary contests. Instead, the retired neurosurgeon, who was briefly the Iowa front-runner last fall, will go to Florida to rest and see family.

Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum is also skipping New Hampshire but will go straight to South Carolina, which holds its Republican presidential primary on February 20.

Democrats
On the Democratic side, Clinton is holding the narrowest of leads over insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders. She was ahead 50.1% to 49.4% with 95% of the votes counted.

"It's rare that we have the opportunity we do now," she said in a speech that didn't explicitly claim victory. "To have a real contest of ideas. To really think hard about what the Democratic party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like."

She added that she was "excited" about debating Sanders and was breathing a "big sigh of relief" after the caucuses.

Sanders told a raucous crowd chanting "Bernie, Bernie" that his campaign had made stunning progress in a short period of time.

"Nine months ago, we came to this beautiful state, we had no political organization, we had no money, we had no name recognition and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America."

"And tonight," he said, "while the results are still not known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie." (CNN)

Joint Oppn to boycott state functions

Members of the joint opposition in Parliament will boycott all state functions in the future, its leader, Parliamentarian and former Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He said the government's political witch-hunt today has reached its zenith under the guise of the FCID which is an illegal and parallel outfit to the country's judiciary. Addressing a press conference at the Borella N.M. Perera Memorial Hall, Gunawardena said the attempts made by the UNP to usurp the democratic rights of the people an year ago had also come into the open under the government today.
"Some ministers in the present government too had been hauled before the FCID but they shamelessly hung on their ministerial posts for personal gain," he said.
"When we pointed out in Parliament that the FCID was an illegal outfit, the President too said it would never be given validity," Gunawardena said.

Prince Charles is king of the art world
UK: The Prince of Wales has become one of Britain's most successful living artists, selling prints of his paintings for millions of pounds.
An analysis of sales of limited edition lithographs conducted by Clarence House and released to The Telegraph, London, shows that the Prince has earned 2 million ($4 million) since 1997 from sales of copies of his watercolour paintings through the shop at his family residence, Highgrove House. All the money raised goes to the The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation, which awards grants to a wide range of good causes.
But the total sales are even larger. An art dealer who previously handled sales of the Prince's lithographs estimates they raised at least 4 million, bringing the total to more than 6 million
The lithographs on display in the Highgrove shop carry a price tag of 2500, but the Belgravia Gallery, which previously handled the sales, is currently offering limited edition prints for as much as 15,000.
Prince Charles earns approximately 200,000 annually from art sales.
The income places the Prince among an elite band of living artists. The most recent survey showed fine artists earn on average 10,000 ($20,105) a year. By contrast, the Prince has, when his earnings are averaged out, made in the region of 200,000 annually from art sales over the past 25 years.
According to Clarence House, the Prince paints "in the open air, often finishing a picture in one go".
His favourite locations include the Queen's estate at Balmoral and Sandringham House. "Sometimes the Prince paints during his skiing holidays, and during overseas tours when possible," said a spokesman.
The Prince sees his watercolours as part of his legacy. "We walk away and shuffle off our mortal coil, but these things live on," he said in a television documentary in 2013.
The Prince only paints with watercolours and never sells the originals. He began making money from his hobby when he was approached in 1989 by Anna Hunter, owner of the Belgravia Gallery in central London. "I saw his work as a water colourist in a Sunday newspaper magazine article in 1989," said Mrs Hunter.
"Until then I had no idea he was an artist. I wrote him a letter suggesting that if his works were made into signed lithographs, they could be sold to raise money for his charitable foundation.
"I didn't hear anything for ages and then just before Christmas 1989 his private secretary called me and said he was very interested and could we meet." Subsequently, and in conjunction with a print maker, Stanley Jones, Prince Charles released a series of limited edition lithographs with runs of either 295 or 100. They included views of Windsor Castle, Balmoral, and a scene of Hong Kong from the Royal Yacht Britannia. In all, the Prince produced 16 lithographs during the commercial tie-in with the Belgravia Gallery.
"We did a tot up about eight years ago and reckoned we had raised 4m then," said Mrs Hunter. "It was a really lovely project. The originals are mostly at Highgrove. I think these are really charming works of art in the English watercolour tradition and they are a really good reflection of the talent that lies within the Royal family for art."
The Prince's latest series of three lithographs, each with a run of 100, were released in 2014.
One has already sold out, raising in the region of 250,000. Not bad for an amateur who does a bit of painting on the side.

WHO mulls global health emergency declaration on Zika

SWITZERLAND: The World Health Organization's emergency committee will on Monday debate whether a Zika virus outbreak suspected of causing a surge in serious birth defects in South America should be considered a global health emergency.
The UN health agency warned last week that the mosquito-borne virus was "spreading explosively" in the Americas, with the region expected to see up to four million cases this year.
The WHO is under pressure to act quickly in the fight against Zika, after admitting it was slow to respond to the recent Ebola outbreak that ravaged parts of west Africa.
Although the mosquito-borne virus's symptoms are relatively mild, it is believed to be linked to a surge in cases of microcephaly, a devastating condition in which a baby is born with an abnormally small head and brain. While it has yet to be definitely proven that the microcephaly cases are caused in some way by the Zika virus, WHO chief Margaret Chan warned last week the causal relationship was "strongly suspected".
Zika is also suspected of links to a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Brazil, the hardest hit country, sounded the alarm in October, when a rash of microcephaly cases emerged in the northeast.
Since then, there have been 270 confirmed cases of microcephaly and 3,448 suspected cases, up from 147 in 2014.
Amid alarm over the surge in microcephaly cases, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Jamaica and Puerto Rico have even warned women to delay conceiving until the Zika outbreak is brought under control.
Jitters over Zika have spread far beyond the affected areas to Europe and North America, where dozens of cases have been identified among people returning from vacation or business abroad.
In a bid to clarify what the response to the outbreak should be, WHO chief Margaret Chan called for Monday's closed-door meeting of the organisation's emergency committee to determine if Zika should be considered a "public health emergency of international concern". Taking the form of a telephone conference between senior WHO officials, representatives of affected countries, and experts from around the globe, the meeting is not expected to make its decision public until Tuesday at the earliest.
But the scale of concern is underlined by the WHO emergency session itself -- such consultations are relatively rare.
The UN agency is likely to be eager to be seen taking resolute action on Zika, as it continues to try to live down the stinging criticism of its initially sluggish response to the devastating west Africa Ebola outbreak.
Ebola, which has taken more than 11,000 lives in west Africa since late 2013, was declared a global health emergency in August 2014 and continues to carry that label.
As for Zika, there is currently no treatment and the WHO has said it would likely take more than a year to develop a vaccine.
The virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which also spreads dengue fever and the chikungunya virus. It produces flu-like symptoms including a low-grade fever, headaches, joint pain and rashes.
