Microsoft working on password-free world: Nadella

With growing concerns over security of emails and mobile phones, technology giant Microsoft today said it is working on ways to rid tech users of their worries over passwords.
"One of the biggest security issues is passwords. One of the things that we are working on is a world where passwords are not going to be the ones that you know can get hacked but you really have other biometrics that really help us secure our computing interfaces," Microsoft Corporation Chief Executive Satya Nadella said here.
He was delivering keynote address at 'Future Unleashed: Accelerating India', Microsoft's largest ever customer conference here, celebrating 25 years of the Richmond-based company's in the country.
Hyderabad-born Nadella said the company has a sense of purpose that is about empowering every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more.
"We had a mission of putting a personal computer PC on every desk in every home, but in retrospect that was a goal... Our mission was to empower every individual and organisation. That's really what I look at as we go forward," said Nadella, who has completed 25 years at Microsoft.
Nadella, who runs an average of 5 km a day -- even today despite 16 hours of jetlag -- and reads 10 books on weekends, said that with changing world and technologies, the company has more ambitions to reinvent productivity and business processes.
"Our first ambition is about reinvention of productivity and business process. We want to make sure that work no longer is a place you go to. Work is about making things happen and getting things done wherever you are," he noted, adding that the purpose of Microsoft is to to build an intelligent cloud.
He unveiled the new cloud start-up initiative to empower the smart cities.
Nadella also spoke about the tools which he uses daily to make decision, to have discussion across his team and harness the information inside the company.
Talking about one of his personal phones, an iPhone, he said, "this is not my phone, but it is an iPhone. I like to somehow refer to this as iPhone Pro because it has got all the Microsoft software on it...there is Word, Excel, Power Point."
He also added that he uses his own phone - a high-end Lumia.

The Police should not exceed its limits: Kiriella
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella today said that he also agrees that the way Police handled the situation during the HNDA protest was wrong.
He was addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex.
The Police should not exceed its limits. Even the Opposition Leader pointed out the fact that the retreating students were attacked. Now an investigation is on over this incident. We have no power to give orders to the Police. The Police is now independent unlike the period of the previous regime he observed.
The Minister also rejected the claim that the officials of the Ministry were not available to meet the students who were protesting at Ward Place on October 29.
It was wrong to say like that. The Police officers who came in to the Ministry discussed with the Ministry officials and went out to call five students in for discussion. However they did not return with the students, and the baton of one Police officer is still inside the Ministry premises. We are ready to meet the students at any time. We are committed to address their grievances he noted.
The Minister added that the cabinet approval was given to grant degree equivalence the HNDA. This does not mean that they would be offered degrees, but their qualification is recognized on par with the degree as it had been the case since 1990 until 2014 he explained.
The minister also emphasized that the University system needs to be made independent in order to develop them, adding that the Vice Chancellors should be free to take independent decisions.
Over the past years, political interferences were abundant in the university education system. This could be seen even when appointing the Vice Chancellors. The Universities degraded to the level of colleges. A university must be a free place to organize various dialogues and present new ideas. We are trying to create a new culture. It cannot be achieved overnight. When the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was formed we wanted to include the UGC also as an independent commission, but the proposal had to be dropped as some parties were against it. When we are formulating a new Constitution we will present this proposal again he commented.
The minister further said the present Government led by the Prime Minister and the President has the will to operate the law properly and effectively in the country. 
We need to build a new country. A national government has been formed to find solutions to the key problems and create the policy framework required by the country. That framework will be a permanent one and it will be our gift to the future generation. The both parties which were ruling the country since the independence are responsible for the national question. We are striving to continue the national government at least for two years in order to achieve the stipulated goals he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist on the SAITM medical degree, the minister stated the matter is being discussed, adding that an amicable solution would be reached through negotiation and careful consideration of all facts. 
The issue of SAITM too was created by the former government. At that time, I inquired from Minister S B Dissanayake how a medical college be run without a teaching hospital. Since it has already started now, we have to think about the students who have enrolled in it too. This has been established under an Act approved in Parliament he pointed out.
The minister also queried whether it is fair to object to the private universities, when students pass the A-L exam and enter the Universities with the help of private tuitions.
Let us face the reality. Some of our medical students are studying at various foreign universities in which the standards are below the SAITM. Only about 15 percent of our students are admitted to state universities. What happens to the rest of 85 percent We have to think about their future too he commented.

Signed Lincoln Manuscript fetches USD 2.2 m
US: A text written and signed by former US President Abraham Lincoln for a 10-year-old boy, just weeks before his assassination, fetched a whopping USD 2.2 million, four times more than its minimum bid at an auction here.
In the manuscript dated March 1865, Lincoln signs his name and also writes the final passage of his second inaugural address for Linton Usher, son of his interior secretary John Usher.
It fetched USD 2,213,000 at the auction yesterday, selling for more than double its pre-auction estimate of USD 1,000,000 and more than four times the USD 500,000 minimum bid, Heritage Auctions said.
The collector who purchased it requested to remain anonymous.
"This is just one of five manuscripts of that particular speech so it's an understatement to call it rare," Director of Rare Manuscripts at Heritage Auctions Sandra Palomino said.
"Lincoln was not one to just scribble a quote for someone. It's likely that this was written on request."
Found on the second blank leaf of the book, the Lincoln autograph comprises 13 lines of text and signature.
Lincoln wrote the final passage of his second inaugural address, words now immortalised on the memorial dedicated to the 16th president, "With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan - to do all which may achieve, and cherish a just, and a lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations. - Abraham Lincoln."
Palomino said the Usher family has safeguarded this treasure since the Civil War.
Lincoln became the 16th US President in 1861. Considered by many as America's greatest president, he led the country through Civil War and in 1863 signed the Emancipation Proclamation to end slavery. He was assassinated in 1865 in Washington. - AFP

Sixty percent not paying taxes - Ravi
Sixty percent of the affluent class are not paying taxes, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said adding that he Budget 2016 will make life easy for all, especially the fixed wage earners.
The minister said the government has no intention to burden wage earners.
"In terms of taxation, the rich who evade will be compelled to pay taxes while those who are compliant will not be burdened. Sixty percent of the affluent do not pay taxes. Accordingly, the economy needs to be properly structured, reformed and strengthened," Karunanayake said adding that Budget 2016 would be one exercise.
The minister noted that 65 percent of the annual revenue is swallowed by the recurrent expenditure of the public sector salaries (Rs. 600 billion) and pension cost of Rs. 170 billion.
"If you analyse the budget cost in a different way, out of the annual revenue of Rs. 1,400 billion, Rs. 1,300 billion (93 percent) has to be incurred for debt servicing," Karunanayake said.
The minister also revealed that the government will link the subsidies with employment. Sri Lanka spends about Rs. 220 billion annually on subsidies alone.
"According to a survey those depending on subsidy have become lazy and the government intends to transform them in to a productive work force," he said.
