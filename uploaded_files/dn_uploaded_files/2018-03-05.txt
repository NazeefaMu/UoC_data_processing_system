A significant step
Sri Lanka went through a 30-year conflict that saw loss of life and destruction of property on a massive scale. In every country where conflicts have raged on for this long, it is not easy to come to terms with what happened during that period, depending on ones perspective. Although the conflict here ended in 2009, nine years later, we are still searching for answers  and lasting peace.
One major cause of this impasse was that the former Government engaged in triumphalism without bringing everyone together, while ignoring the human rights concerns expressed locally and internationally. Anyone who dared to raise this issue was branded an LTTE sympathizer. Much of the Western world became hostile towards Sri Lanka as a result of this belligerent attitude. Had that Government continued in power, Sri Lanka would certainly have faced the bleak prospect of economic sanctions.
Fortunately, the Government elected in 2015 adopted a far more rational attitude towards the Human Rights concerns raised by the international community. Having strengthened domestic justice, law and order and other institutions, the Government impressed upon the international community that a foreign mechanism was not needed to probe what is essentially an internal affair. It was thus able to successfully thwart any punitive action or interference against Sri Lanka globally.
The Government proposed four key steps that would form the basis of the domestic mechanism to probe wartime rights concerns. These are the Office of Missing Persons (OMP), an office to handle reparations, a truth commission and a judicial mechanism to address allegations of wartime abuses. In line with this commitment, President Maithripala Sirisena has confirmed the appointments of the seven members to the Office of the Missing Persons (OMP) established in September 2017.
The President appointed Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris as Chairman with six others were appointed as members. The members are: Jayatheepa Punniyamoorthy, Major General Mohanti Antonette Peiris, Dr. Sriyani Nimalka Fernando, Mirak Raheem, Sumanasiri Liyanage and Kanapathipillai Venthan. The members represent all ethnic and religious groups in the country and crucially, there is a retired senior Armed Forces officer as well.
The OMP was established through Act No.14 of 2016 and amended by Act No.9 of 2017 and came into effect on September 15. The Act stipulated that the OMP would, Provide for the establishment of the office on missing persons; to provide for the searching and tracing of missing persons; to provide assistance to relatives of missing persons; for the setting up of a database of missing persons; for setting out the procedures and guidelines applicable to the powers and functions assigned to the said office; and to provide for all matters which are connected with or incidental to, the implementation of the provisions of this act.
According to the Paranagama Commission appointed to investigate into missing persons, close to 19,000 persons have been confirmed to have gone missing during the three decade conflict. The UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has recorded 12,000 cases of enforced disappearances related to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) uprisings and during the armed conflict between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government Forces from 1980 to 2010.
It is in our interest to investigate these disappearances and find the truth. Those who shout from the rooftops that this is a witch-hunt against members of the Security Forces are very much mistaken. No one has implied that they are responsible for the disappearances and anyone who does so is not a true patriot at all. It is vital to protect the good name of our Security Forces and it is much better to confront any allegations head on in order to clear such concerns. Any bad eggs should not be allowed to tarnish the reputation of the Armed Forces. Moreover, many Security Forces members themselves have gone missing during the last 30 years. We wonder whether these false patriots are against probing those disappearances.
Several recent incidents point to an alarming trend  nine years after the war, most Sri Lankans still have a war mentality. It is important to remember that we were not at war with another country. When the war ended in 2009, we did not conquer another country. It was a conflict that pitted brother against brother and sister against sister. The combatants on both sides and the civilians who were caught in the middle (regardless of ethnicity) were all Sri Lankans. But many seem to have forgotten this fact, judging by the hate campaigns we see on Facebook.
It is time to move on. Hate will not take us anywhere. Misguided elements among the Sri Lankan Diaspora must realize that all Tamil parties in Sri Lanka are against the concept of a separate state. Likewise, those in the majority community who are against any concessions to the minorities must understand the reality that we have to get together to rebuild the country. We must come to terms with the past and find unity in diversity. Reconciliation is thus the only way forward.

SLs first specialist Shelf-Out O2O Agency Newton Lanka launched
Newton Lanka, Sri Lankas first specialist Shelf Out Shopper Marketing Agency has been launched in Colombo with an aim to help brands develop Offline-2-Online Campaigns.
Newton Lanka is an extension of its Malaysian counterpart, Newton TAC and offers Shelf-Out thinking & Shopper Marketing with a belief in doing things the unconventional way.
Speaking on the venture, Mahesh Neelakantan, Strategic Investor of Newton Lanka and CEO of Newton TAC Malaysia said, The decision to launch Newton in Sri Lanka stemmed from the belief that the local market was ready for a disruptive and entrepreneurial approach to creativity, helping brands thrive and stand out in todays highly contested environment. While brands have been doing Shopper Marketing in some form or the other for a while, it is currently being under-leveraged. There is an opportunity for NEWTON to partner brands and retailers and we believe the timing is right for us to be uniquely positioned to offer this specialized service in Sri Lanka.
While traditional ATL media will still play a role in building awareness and triggering subtle perception changes, Shopper Marketing has a more direct, effective and immediate impact on the consumers purchase decision.
Shopper Marketing is all about understanding how customers behave as shoppers, understanding their Purchase Decision Hierarchy and developing communication and ideas to engage them when they are in Shopper Mode. It is time to relook at Shopper Marketing as more than just BELOW-THE-LINE communication or sales promotion activity and instead explore the opportunities of Marketing to the Shopper in an Always On mode to help brands win at the Shelf.
The Newton Lanka team is currently made up of 14 young and enterprising idea-preneurs and is led by Director, Reshad Mohideen and Creative Director, Rushain Rodrigo.
Newton Lankas current list of core clients include Fonterra and Hemas with whom they are carrying out effective campaigns since inception.
We want to be an agency known for ideas and making them happen is our entrepreneurial spirit and start-up approach, hence the term idea-preneurs, said Neelakantan.

SL to establish professional status for electricians
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, is to establish an accepted professional status for electricians in the country through accrediting their qualifications and experience.
The proposed mechanism has been developed by PUCSL in collaboration with the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL), Tertiary, Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) and Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company (PVT) Limited (LECO).
Explaining the reasons behind the initiative taken, Public Utilities Commission Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said, Sri Lanka has reported 106 electrocutions in 2017. Fifty-five percent of the electrocutions have occurred due to issues of wiring, maintenance and non-standards. With the system is in place, the professional status of the electricians will be uplifted, as well as the safety and quality of the electrical installation will be assured.
PUCSL launched a public consultation on accrediting and licensing of electricians with a view of receiving the public, expertise and other stakeholder comments on the proposed mechanism. The comments will be accommodated to improve the proposed system.
Sri Lanka has about 21,000 electricians and data shows that only a few of them are qualified in National Vocational Qualification (NVQ). Most of the wiring and maintenance of the households and other premises are carried out by electricians who have no recognized qualifications but have experience through practice.
With the introduction of the mechanism, all the electricians will be issued a temporary licence to continue their work and that licence will only be valid for three years.
Those who are qualified with National Vocational Qualification 3 (NVQ 3) and above can obtain a permanent licence from CIDA within a day, after proving their knowledge at the evaluation facilitated by the Evaluation Panel.
Those who are not professionally qualified, but have hands-on experience, are given the opportunity to prove the competency and to qualify for NVQ levels through a process facilitated by CIDA, so that they can apply for the permanent licence.
With the permanent licence, electricians can design, wire, test, the installation of domestic wiring (30 amps signal phase) and issue a certificate to get the electrical connection which is accepted by CEB and LECO.
According to the proposed mechanism, it is a must to produce the certification of an electrician with the permanent licence, which states that the installation was designed, wired and tested to receive the electrical connection to a domestic (up to 30A, single phase).
Electricians with permanent licences can also carry out the wiring, testing and installation of the three phase 30 amps and 60 amps installation, subject to the design by a chartered engineer.
The proposed mechanism will also provide a career ladder for the electricians, according to their professional level and expertise, starting from apprentice, junior electrician, senior electrician, master electrician and utility electrician.
The utility electricians are recognized to install and maintain the distribution lines of 1,000 Volt to 33,000 Volt.
"With the mechanism in place, it is aimed to standardize the practice of the electricians to match with international standards and will encourage people who want to enter into this industry," Kumarasinghe said.
PUCSL invites stakeholders views, suggestions, recommendations, concerns and comments related to the following areas: categories/classes of licence to be issued and corresponding pre-requisite qualifications, eligibility requirements for licences and the responsibilities held, suggestions on structure of the licensing issuance framework and implementation, accountabilities held by key stakeholders and consortium, socio-economic impacts of the licencing issuance framework establishment.
The proposed mechanism in detail is now available at www.pucsl.gov.lk for reference. Those who are interested can submit their written comments to the Commission by post or e-mail ([emailprotected]) and online via www.pucsl.gov.lk on or before March 21.
The PUCSL also plans to hold an oral submission on the same.

Smart chalk
For many children who study in 65 schools across Sri Lanka, school life has become a digital adventure! Taxila Central College Horana and Dhammananda Maha Vidyalaya Moronthuduwa are using this technology and it has proved to be extremely successful. This vastly superior technology has revolutionized education in these schools and it is very likely that other schools in our island will follow suit.
Gone are the days of blackboards and chalk! They have been replaced by an interactive computer screen. Yes school life for them will never be the same again! It has become enjoyable, interesting and interactive. In fact, the future is already here in Sri Lanka. This is what is known as the Smart School Project.

A total of 97,500 students between Grades 6  13 currently benefit from the smart school project.
It is widely known that Commercial Bank has undertaken many CSR projects throughout Sri Lanka. Under its IT education program, Commercial Bank has donated computers, printers, furniture and other IT equipment to set up IT labs in 175 schools across Sri Lanka. These IT labs currently benefit more than 160,000 students, most of them from rural areas.
The smart schools project is its latest initiative. It is a collaboration of Headstart (Pvt) Ltd, Commercial Bank, Microsoft Sri Lanka and Dialog Axiata under the supervision of the Department of Education of the Western Province. The goal is to complete the transformation of 65 schools for digital learning.
Daily News was taken on a Media Tour by Commercial Bank and experienced firsthand how this education system is changing lives. The learning is taken place by teachers trained to use this technology.
Currently, there are 65 schools that are digital learning enabled. Each school has approximately 1500 students and employs teachers who are trained to digitally impart the curriculum and facilitate digital learning. Currently, there are 6,500 trained teachers spread across the 65 schools from the Western Province, with the ability to guide digitized learning.
Physics Teacher of Taxila Central College Horana, Deepika Karunarathna, said that from the 65 schools chosen from the Western Province, 25 were provided Learning Management Systems free of charge by Headstart.
This learning management system really is beneficial to the student, in the sense that it helps the child adapt to this new system of learning. The child is able to absorb and take in the information. It allows us to evaluate the progress of the child and the child also is able to gauge his or her standard. It really makes learning a lot easier for the child.
Another feature of this learning method is the child himself or herself is able to prepare presentations. This is because the child has been able to familiarize himself or herself with these technological advancements. With this, the child can be proud that he or she has been able to do so independently. In a way the child becomes more knowledgeable than the teacher, said Karunarathna. Karunarathna also mentioned that a select group of schools were taken to Malaysia on a tour for four days for the BETT Asia Summit.
At the conference, we were lectured, but there was nothing new for us to learn, as Headstart had already taught us everything there was to know. Because of our knowledge, I must say that we were envied, and all who came into contact with us were amazed by our knowledge. I must say that some of the representatives from other countries were not as knowledgeable as us. This is why we are indebted to Headstart for all the help they have given us. I must say that the students and teachers have been greatly benefited, as I myself did not know how to create a Gmail account when I first started using this technology, said Karunarathna.
Karunarathna also stated that with the advancements in the world, it is vital that rural schools keep up with the changing world and technology.
Principal A Y P Perera pointed out that what she sees as a plus point is the childs attitude towards this form of learning and their understanding of the importance of learning.
They really enjoy this form of learning and you can see that when you guide them. It is fun to learn and it is a pleasure to use such interactive technology. It is almost like watching television. Even I genuinely love it. However to get maximum use of this form of learning you need the facilities. Even I am amazed at how user-friendly it is. Even at their homes, these students do not possess computers, so it is only at school that they come into contact with this technology. So we are thankful to Commercial Bank and the other partners. We are a rural school and we are so fortunate that we have been gifted this technology, said Perera.
* Responsibilities of Smart school principals include guiding and supporting e-learning teacher ambassadors and learning communities through training, monitoring the progress of the school, motivating and enabling all parties involved to work with technology and to finally ensure the expected transformation occurs in the school.
* Responsibilities of ambassador teachers include distributing knowledge gained from training among other teachers and students, encouraging teachers to develop their own e-learning material and to be innovative with new education solutions.

Sneeze Into Your Elbow, Not Your Hand
Its good to cover up when you cough. But some ways are better than others.When you feel a sneeze or a cough coming on, covering your mouth prevents the spread of infectious germs. You probably knew that.
But the way you cover up also matters, and there are plenty of people who havent yet heard the consensus guidance of health officials: If no tissue is available, you should aim into your elbow, not your hand. Even if that means breaking a long-held habit.
If somebody sneezes into their hands, that creates an opportunity for those germs to be passed on to other people, or contaminate other objects
that people touch, said Dr. Vincent Hill, chief of the waterborne diseaseprevention branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Germs are most commonly spread by the respiratory droplets emitted from sneezing and coughing. When they land on your hands, theyre transmitted to things like door knobs, elevator buttons and other surfaces the people around you are likely to also touch.
This isnt just us nagging. Sneezing and coughing into your arm has become the standard suggestion of not just the C.D.C., but also organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association. Even the New York City subway system occasionally runs an announcement asking riders to cough or sneeze into the bend of your arm or use a tissue.

Sri Lankan passports rank well ahead of Asian neighbours
Sri Lanka has been ranked 92nd in the Henley Passport Index with a score of 42 out of 105 passports in the world, according to the Henley Passport Index, a ranking of all passports in the world which was released recently.
Sri Lanka has ranked above Pakistan, Burma, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Nepal in Asia.
The top scorers include Japan ranking number 1, with Germany, France, Portugal, Italy and Canada trailing behind. The biggest climbers this year include Ukraine which has come 16 places up in the rankings followed by Georgia and United Arab Emirates.
The Henley Passport Index is a ranking of passports of the world according to the number of countries their holders can travel to visa-free. The ranking is based on exclusive data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which maintains the worlds largest and most accurate database of travel information, and is enhanced by extensive in-house research.
Considered as one of the most reliable reference standard for global citizens, travellers and citizens alike can assess where they lie on the spectrum of global mobility and how they can maximize their travel freedom through citizenship-by-investment.
As the world economy has become increasingly globalized, the need for greater visa-free access has grown steadily. Across the economic spectrum, individuals want to transcend the constraints imposed on them by their country of origin and access business, financial, career, and lifestyle opportunities on a global scale, their statement reads.
Wealthy individuals in particular are more cosmopolitan and transnational today than ever before, with roots, networks, assets, properties, and even citizenship spanning multiple countries. In many ways, global connectivity has become an indispensable feature of wealth creation and wealth preservation, and its value will only grow as regional volatility and instability increase.

Sustainable  Supply Chain  in Tourism and  Travel Management
In todays world it is not able to occur to do business if they stand-alone. All the businesses need support from other businesses and for this reason they need to work together with harmony. To create bond among all the stakeholders of tourism there is no alternative for Supply Chain Management.
Supply chain comprises the suppliers of all the goods and services that go into the delivery of tourism products to consumers. The harmony among different parties largely affects the satisfaction of tourists regarding the tourism industry. If tourists become satisfy then they will come again and again and it will increase the revenue which will be distributed among the stakeholders. So, the prime concern of the tourism and supply chain management is to satisfy the guest and earn profit.
Here the main parties are Accommodation, Transport, Ground handlers, excursions and activities and Food and crafts. Tourism, like all other supply chains, operates through business to-business relationships, and supply chain management can be applied to deliver sustainability performance improvements alongside financial performance, by working to improve the business operations of each supplier in the supply chain. The main differences between tourism supply chains and those of other sectors are that tourists travel to the product, and the product that they buy has a particularly high service component - in other words, it involves a higher proportion of people in the immediate production of the holiday experience.
The recent phenomenon in the supply chain industry is to practice Sustainable Tourism Supply Chain Management (STSCM) which means act in a way so that destination can be sustainable, environment does not get destroyed, business continue for longer time and generation after generation can enjoy the same thing. But in our country context from different literature it is cleared that the parties of Supply Chain Management is not well aware about the practice of Sustainable Supply Chain Management though Sri Lanka is greatly focusing on Sustainable tourism, Ecotourism, Responsible tourism, green tourism. Without ensuring the practice of STSCM Sri Lankan could not attain the goal of sustainability in Tourism Industry. This is to find out the current scenario of STSCM in our country as well as how to develop STSCM for tourism industry in Sri Lanka.
Key elements of tourism
Tourism supply Chain has to do with the provision of the key elements of the tourism industry by the host governments or destinations. Such provision should extend to maintenance, promotion and management of the tourism facilities and resources.
Tourism resources that are necessary for tourism supply range from natural to man-made. Infrastructure required would include telecommunication, accommodation and transportation. Tourism reception services include travel agencies, tourist offices, hire companies and visitor managers.
The one underlying characteristic of tourism supply that distinguishes it from other services is the way in which the mobile population who visit destination areas consume a tourism product, service or experience. In contrast, the supply elements are often fixed geographically at certain places (e.g. hotels, restaurants or visitor attractions). This means that businesses are required to sink considerable capital costs into different forms of tourism services and centres of production on the basis of the expectation that the destination will appeal to visitors and assist in the promotion of their individual product and service.
The supply of tourism products basically involves how various components of the tourist product are placed at the disposal of tourists. Tourism suppliers can be classified under the following headings: Hospitality, Transport and Attractions/Products. As far as hospitality is concerned, this is where a tourist will look at the appropriate forms of accommodation, different types of food service provisioning, entertainment and leisure activities.
The suppliers of hospitality products, such as accommodation, service, entertainment or gaming must be well located in relation to other components of tourism product. The suppliers of accommodation vary from privately owned organizations to large hotel chain groups or consortiums. On the other hand, the food service industry, which includes drinking places, restaurants, coffee shops and other food outlets, is strongly linked to the accommodation sector. Ultimately, accommodation forms the core of the tourism supply chain where it occupies a more central position.
Tourism supply can also be explained through the distribution system in tourism analysis. The distribution system makes the supply of tourism available and accessible to the demand side.
Because tourism is an intangible product, information is the only thing on which potential tourists can base their decision to make their arrangements. There are four components in the tourism distribution, system namely, suppliers of tourism services, the distributors of information, travel intermediaries and consumers.
Transportation is a critical component of tourism supply, as without it tourists cannot reach their tourism destinations. Aero planes, trains, buses and other modes of transportation are part of this category.
Hospitality and cultural resources are integral to a tourism offering.
It is the people and the cultural wealth of an area that makes it possible for tourism to take place. Tourists are hosted where there is security and often comfort. The attitudes of residents to visitors need to be desirable. The friendliness, courtesy, sincere interest and willingness to serve and to be better acquainted with visitors are crucial factors in tourism supply chain.
Supply chain activities 
Some economic activities depend on tourism for their survival, e.g. tourist accommodation, travel agencies and long-distance passenger transport. Other activities such as restaurants and bars, car rental services, entertainment and attractions services also tend to rely strongly on tourism.
The dependency of certain activities or enterprises on tourism may also depend on their location. Thus, the supply of tourism activities comprises diverse economic activities, and, when presented as a sector, it is very heterogeneous, encompassing different activities, some of which are directly dependent on tourism and others only partly. A global approach to the analysis of tourism products deals not only with those that are direct results of economic activities, but also with any product, diversion, entertainment, commodity or service enjoyed or bought by visitors. The products supplied represent more than just tourism expenditure. Not every good or service has to be paid for by the consumer.
The use of assets, such as roads, historical areas, national parks, natural environment, in many cases is indirectly free, but in some instances visitors must pay for the facility offered as a service. In fact, most assets offer services to their users or to the people enjoying them, regardless of whether visitors have to pay for them or not. Nevertheless, free services such as nice weather, fresh air, beaches, mountains, landscapes and roads belong to the supply of tourism products. Free.
The visitor does not mean that the free service is also free for the supplier, a country. The country must spend money in order to maintain tourism assets such as fresh air, a neat environment, infrastructural facilities to mention but a few.
Because these types of products are hard to quantify, they are excluded from any form of analysis. To make the definition of the supply Chain of tourism products practical, only products that can be identified in a standard product classification listing are considered. In defining the supply Chain of tourism products, two considerations, representing two sides of the same coin, must be kept in mind.

In view of the importance of ecotourism and the role this sector plays in the industry, the sustainability of associated resources is paramount. New rules may promote the necessity of Environmental Impact Assessments for any new tourism development project.
It is believed that negative impacts from tourism on surrounding communities begin to be felt when over 1/3 of the receipts from local business originate from tourists
The capacity for any area to absorb tourists without negative effects on the host area varies according to a multiplicity of factors. Environmentally sensitive areas and wilderness areas have a lower carrying capacity than do urban areas. This, however, is a controversial concept and not necessarily one that is generally accepted.
The tourism industry has a range of effects on the environment. In order that the negative effects of tourism developments on the environment are kept to a minimum, Environmental Impact Assessments must be carried out on any large, new projects, and constant monitoring of environmental and other effects must be conducted.
The economic impacts of the tourism industry tend to be positive in the locations where development is taking place. However, the same cannot be said, overall, for socio-cultural impact with the one often occurring at the expense of the other.
Quality assurance and pricing
The accommodation sector can be broken down into two broad segments, the informal sector and the formal sector.
The informal sector comprises of B&B facilities and guesthouses and the formal sector comprises of hotels and lodges. Regarding the quality of accommodation, inspects the standards in the hospitality and accommodation industry.
This voluntary grading system, which was launched in the recent past, uses internationally recognized star insignia to rate accommodation establishments. Once graded, establishments are encouraged to use the star system for marketing and advertising purposes. Thus, the responsibility for marketing remains with the entrepreneur.
Due to excessively high lodging tariffs, informed tourists opt to stay with friends, if they have this option, as hotel prices are regarded as outrageous. Although the exchange rates are good, tourists refuse to spend so much money on a hotel room that is cheaper back home. They like to enjoy as much as we can without spending too much of their money on pricey accommodation.
Matching supply chain with demand
The definition of tourism supply Chain should result from the overall definition of tourism and can thus be defined as the supply of all assets, services and goods to be enjoyed or bought by visitors and occasioned by the journeys of visitors.
The general purpose of statistics on tourism supply is to assess the contribution of the tourism sector to a country's general socio-economic process and to identify the effects of tourism, distinguishing between direct effects and indirect or induced effects.
Most of the tourists arrive to appreciate the natural beauty of the country Sri Lanka beauty is found in its diversity, which includes a generally hot and sunny climate, varied scenery and unspoiled wilderness areas, accessible wildlife, diverse cultures, activities like bird-watching, hiking, hunting, river rafting and diving and other resources of an ethno-cultural, archaeological, geological and paleontological nature. These all add up to produce the supply Chain of tourism, which consists of an amalgamation, or mix of attractions.
Measurement of demand is calculated in several ways. The occupancy rates of the available beds increase within the ambit of the range of growth factors. Thus, the point at which the demand for beds exceeds their supply can be established. This is done according to the star rating of beds available so that the demand for a level of supply might be calculated even though the star rating system is not fully operational in most of the facilities.
An analysis of tourism demand is required to take the volatile nature of tourism into account, particularly as far as international tourism is concerned. International tourists are generally quick to abandon a formerly popular destination because of threats to health or security. Trends in tourism, including tourism destinations, take into account changing demands for the type of tourism product required.
As tourists become more sophisticated their requirements change, as can be noted by the increasing numbers of people involved in adventure tourism, which is becoming increasingly dominant in coastal area as an option serving the international tourism market. Demographic influences on the supply of the tourism product are also critical.
Sri Lanka has a notably high annual population growth rate of 1 to, 2% and this too is increasing the pressure on the tourism market of the country
International tourism growth strategy
International Tourism Growth strategy includes an analysis of core markets and their segments. Priority markets were identified in Europe, Asia and Africa.
The Country Growth Strategy was particularly aimed at achieving the desired goals.
Business market
The fastest growing segment of the tourist market is business tourism demand. Business people around the world travel to different venues for conferences and meetings. The expectations and needs of business tourists are different from those of general tourists, and seems to understand these needs and offers professional levels of service excellence, which corner a large section of the market.
In-route market
The concept of route tourism demand is considered in both global and more local idiom. Route tourism is not defined in an official or international sense. It is a relatively new concept in tourism and therefore has been borrowed and adapted to cover a broad spectrum of tourism product types.
The literature review revealed that, in a global context, well-known routes are most often, and most successfully, defined as point-to-point trips with a clear beginning and end.
The tourist can join the route in the middle or at either end, but it is a defined path with destinations to visit along the way. Each destination along the route complies with a consistent theme, and the destinations have developed somewhat organically over a long period.
The routes generally cover very large geographical spaces. This kind of route tourismchain is usually used as a mechanism to attract tourists to an area and to link several attractions that would independently not have the potential to entice visitors to spend time and money. Using a synergy effect promises to have greater pulling power and dispenses visitors money among a larger number of recipients
Niche market
By one definition, a niche is something perfectly suited to a person or thing. Despite varied interpretations in the tourism industry, niche tourism refers to tourism offerings that appeal to a particular special interest grouping, sometimes to the exclusion of their standing as a general tourism offering.
Niche tourism requires that the market be segmented into groupings or themes with which visitors identify themselves or their experience while on a trip. Increased access to travel information, as well as the increased sophistication of travelers, can, in part, be cited for the increase in niche tourism and niche product offerings.
Many tourism practitioners in the country incorrectly associate niche tourism with eco-tourism or cultural tourism in marginalized areas.
This has clearly stemmed from the supply-side approach to development, while ignoring the huge opportunities that niche markets offer throughout the world.
Conclusion
The tourism industry showed constant growth over the past few decades and has been resistant to economic and political changes. It is also now recognized as the worlds greatest generator of employment creating one new job for every tourist visiting Sri Lanka.
By the end of 2020, the total employment figure created by the entire travel and tourism industry in Sri Lankais expected to reach above the 3 million marks. However, Sri Lanka still needs to realize its full potential in terms of international tourism and especially the ecotourism sector.
By developing the tourism industry, the potential is there to achieve the objectives of the post any Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and subsequent national development strategies. Some of the benefits of tourism include additional employment opportunities, increased awareness of other cultures and concern about the environment. The internationally accepted Manila Declaration of 1980 states that the aim of tourism is to improve the quality of life and to create better living conditions for all people.
Since tourism is now the worlds largest industry, Sri Lanka has the potential to benefit greatly from the growing tourism market. All that is needed are individuals and organizations with vision, willing to look beyond the problems and to develop and market our destinations, and in so doing, create awareness, pride and unity.

Fifty one protesters from Thambuttegama who were arrested for behaving in an unruly manner in front of the Thambuttegama Police station were released on bail by the Thambuttegama Magistrate a short while ago.
The Police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse farmers who staged a protest against a drinking water supplying project on February 28.
The protestors states that the project would dry out the water supply to their agricultural fields.
The construction work on the project has been temporarily suspended as a result.

Thambuttegama-Rajangana Water Project issue to be resolved on March 7
The fate of the controversial Thambuttegama-Rajanganaya drinking water supply scheme will be decided on March 7 at the Anuradhapura District Coordination Committee Meeting.
President Maithripala Sirisena will chair the session and the WSDB Irrigation Department officials, Anuradhapura Government Agent and representatives of the Rajangana Farmer Organisation would submit their reports and recommendations at the meeting.
The water project was suspended by the Water Supply and Drainage Board, adhering to the instructions given by Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M.Wanninayake consequently to the chaotic situation created by Rajanganaya farmers opposing to the intake of water for the project from the Rajanganaya Reservoir.
NWSDB North Central Provincial Manager S.C. Lokubarana said the construction work of the scheme was about to commence by the contractors when the picketing was launched.
The Chinese Government has granted a Rs. 17,000 mn loan for the project.
The Rajanganaya Reservoir can hold 86,000 a.f. of water whereas the proposed drinking water project requires only 15 a.f. water from the tank amounting to 5400 a.f. annually. If this project materialised, over 30,000 families undergoing scarcity of water amidst fast spreading CKDu menace in the Rajanganaya, Thambuttegama, Nochchiyagama areas will get purified drinking water.
We are running a mini water supply project catering to only about 5,000 families with minor irrigation tank, Nallchchiya, Lokubarana said.
The District Agriculture Committee Session held on September 19 chaired by the Anuradhapura Government Agent discussed the issue of Thambuttegama-Rajanganaya Water Project and Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director M.W.P. De Silva has stated that the preliminary studies regarding the project were done and the intake of water for the project would affect agriculture. It has been agreed that this project would be executed if only additional Mahaweli water is available to Rajanganaya.

In thrall to lions kingdom
On the final section of a 24-kilometer trek in the Sinharaja rainforest, I saw a fresh leopard print in the mud. A tiny chill ran up my spine. The paw prints were big and dug deep into the sandy muck of the riverbank. I didnt remember seeing those prints on our way up the mountain.
Its ok, said the hiking guide, Lakmal. Leopards sleep during the day.
Even so, for the rest of the hike I kept looking over my shoulder.
The Sinharaja Rainforest covers a narrow strip of mountains and valleys in southwestern Sri Lanka, and its the last unbroken patch of lowland rainforest in the country.
More than 60 per cent of its trees are endemic  meaning native to Sri Lanka  and it is home to about half of the islands native mammals and butterflies. Because of its unique make-up, it was recognized by UNESCO World Heritage in 1978.
But that doesnt mean it is easy to get to. I left Colombo for Sinharaja at 2 pm on a Friday afternoon, on the only direct bus to Deniyaya. It took almost six hours to get there, navigating through grinding city traffic and winding mountain roads.
From Deniyaya, and after a quick stop for kotthu, its another 15 km up unpaved roads in a tuk-tuk to reach the edge of the park.
The next day, I opted to take an all-day trek up to the lion rock, a bare outcropping 1,000 meters above the forest canopy. It would be 12 km up the mountain, and 12 km back down. It is not recommended to go without a guide. The trails arent marked, and the leeches are ravenous.
I met my guide Lakmal at 6 am and we started walking the misty dirt road from the guest house to the edge of the jungle.
Soon, the surrounding tea fields gave way to thick forest, and the air filled with the sounds of calling birds and hooting monkeys. I watched a purple-faced Langur eat a breakfast of leaves on a nearby branch.
This is Sinharaja, said Lakmal as we walked. Sinha means lion, he said.
He paused, and contemplated my American-ness. I know that raja means king, but instead he told me: raja is like, president. It was a bad analogy. I dont like thinking about my president.
As the jungle got thicker leeches started crawling off the damp leaves of the forest floor and onto our boots. Lakmal pulled out a bag of table salt and covered our shoes with it. The salt kept the leeches at bay for a little bit, but they still found ways to attach themselves to our feet.
Because it was the dry season, crossing the many rivers that ran down from the mountain-tops was easy. They dryness was deceptive: over the course of the year, Sinharaja can get over 5,000 mm of rain.
But now many of the streams had slowed into small pools of crystal clear water, almost like small aquariums. Sitting on a rock, I watched schools of endemic comb tails, their fins flashing red, dart and play in the still water.
Even though Id brought a few litres of water, I was sweating faster than I could rehydrate. The air was hot and thick with humidity, and there was no way to cool off.
Soon the gently rolling trail began to climb. A serpent eagle crossed our path, navigating over tree roots, looking for its lunch in the crowded undergrowth. As the path got steeper I grabbed small trees and liana vines for balance, fearing everything I touched would turn out to be a python or pit viper.
Lakmal said that certain types of liana were used as medicine in his village: boiling the woody vines for about 30 minutes made a good headache cure.
Like a jungle paracetamol, he said.
After a final push straight uphill, we reached the lion rock. Standing on the bare outcrop, the view was of unbroken rainforest as far as the eye could see. I heard Langurs howling, their calls echoing off the mountain slopes. Lakmal said the day before he heard an elephant pushing over a tree in a valley somewhere on the Ratnapura side of the park.
I stopped to eat a lunch pack of rice and curry while looking out at the view. Lakmal smoked a cigarette. Lakmals wife does not know he smokes cigarettes when hes out guiding tours. He told me he chews leaves before going home to cover the smell. Otherwise, he said, the situation gets like that of the giant wood spiders we saw on the way up. Female wood spiders are known to eat their male mates. Out of respect for Lakmals domestic life, Im not using his real name.
The way down was almost as hard as the way up. If the hike up the mountain tore up my quads, the walk down destroyed my knees. Lakmal makes this hike often, and I struggled to keep up with him. When we spotted the leopard tracks in the mud, I sped up.
At the end of 24 km, my legs were like jelly and I was covered in sweat. We cut off the trail through a tea field, and then scrambled down a slope to the Kakuna Ella waterfall. It was the perfect place to strip down and swim. Finally, after a day full of heat and leeches, the water was cool and refreshing.
I bid Lakmal goodbye at the end of the trail. I was going to sleep early and take the bus back to Colombo at 4 a.m. the next morning. Colombo is its own kind of jungle. But Im happy to know that in this small patch of mountains a real jungle, a rainforest, still thrives.

Tobacco results highlight shift towards Next Generation Products - Fitch
Fitch Ratings says that recent tobacco company results highlight the shift towards Next Generation Products (NGPs).
This shift will help cushion the industry from weaker organic revenue growth from cigarettes, but will increase risk and uncertainty as cash flow generation becomes less predictable.
British American Tobacco plc. (BAT) said on Thursday that it expected NGP-generated revenue to double this year to GBP1 billion (almost 5% of 2017 BAT revenues), and to increase to more than GBP5 billion in 2022. BAT and Reynolds American, which it acquired in July, have invested approximately USD2.5 billion in NGPs since 2012, the company said. BAT and, more recently, Imperial Brands PLC (BBB/Stable) have both adjusted their strategies to complement tobacco products with various NGPs. BAT is focusing on both e-vapour and heat-not-burn technology.
Imperial is planning to launch several new products in 2018, leveraging on its blu e-vapour platform and testing heat-not-burn.
Philip Morris International, Inc. (PMI; A/Negative) benefits from first-mover advantage in heat-not-burn, which may enjoy high consumer acceptance as the NGP that most closely resembles cigarette smoking.
Its sales of HeatSticks and of IQOS devices grew to USD3.6 billion in 2017, of which Asia accounted for USD3.2 billion, up from USD0.7 billion in 2016, according to the companys most recent results. NGPs represented almost 13% of PMIs net revenues (excluding excise taxes) in 2017, up from 3% in 2016.
These are inevitable consequences of the growing need to invest in innovation in order to defend revenues as cigarette sales decline. How far other tobacco companies will see similar adverse impacts on profitability and cash flow will depend on their willingness to invest in the category and ability to
While tobacco companies generally exhibit solid credit metrics, against this backdrop, financial flexibility has a value over the long term. The suspension of PMIs share buyback since 2015, accompanied by slower dividend increases, indicates a willingness to protect the companys credit metrics and prioritise the allocation of cash flow towards growing the NGP business.
We expect that this approach will also be taken by the other tobacco players as they focus on NGPs, and we do not expect BAT or Imperial Brands to restart share buybacks this year, or to accelerate dividend growth.

Two policemen acquitted of bribery charges after 10 years
Two Police Constables who had been charged for soliciting a bribe of Rs.50,000 from an individual to facilitate a bail application for his sister were acquitted and released from the case by Colombo High Court.
After ten years from the date of commencement of the case, High Court Judge Nissanka Bandula Karunarathne acquitted both accused on all counts. Among the reasons delivered by the judge stated prosecution evidence were not collaborated by the witness.
The two accused, Peduruhewa Nalinda and D.M.Wimalasingha were indicted for soliciting a some of Rs.50,000 on or about 07/01/2006 from W.K.Susil Ranjith to facilitate bail application for W.K.Sumithra Padmakanthi (sister of complainant Susil Ranjith) who was suspected of three cheating cases where the said two accused who were investigating into the alleged cheating charges.
W.K.Sumithra Padmakanthi was arrested on 31/12/2005 by the two accused and produced before the Colombo Magistrate.
The said Susil Ranjith made a complaint to Bribery Commission Department on 08/01/2006 on the allegation of solicitation of Rupees 50,000 to grant bail to his sister Sumithra Padmakanthi in Court. But in his evidence, he mentioned in court that the first accused accepted Rupees 50,000 and bribery officers arrested him. But there was no charge in the indictment for acceptance of Rs.50,000.
Sumithra Padmakanthis evidence was totally different to her brother.
In her evidence she said these two accused officers did not ask for any bribe. But in her evidence on 13/06/2012 said, since there were cheating charges against her, she has requested her brother to bring Rupees 100,000 to pay as lawyers fee.
Therefore, she asked her brother to bring money to pay the lawyers fee. So it was clear in her evidence these two officers never solicited any money to grant her bail, as a bribe.
Senior counsel Lal Kularathna with Gayathri Wijesooriya and Thilina Kollure defended both accused.
Assistant Director General Asitha Anthony prosecuted for the Bribery Commission.

The undeterred journey for the missing
We are fortunate to witness this moment when the Government led by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has given life to an important promise made to the people of this nation. The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) Act was passed in August 2016, and on February 27, a seven-member commission was announced to lead its activities and investigations starting immediately.
My commitment to the struggle of the missing, goes back as long as my journey in politics. I recall a time in the 80s when cases of large-scale disappearances were at alarming rates. The decision to devote myself to politics was driven by my concern with these atrocities that occurred around my hometown, and a strong desire to bring justice to those families suffering as a result of this. It may be the greatest irony that during those times I was inspired by the words of many individuals who championed the cause, including our former president, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He spoke fervently about our responsibility to find these missing people and to prevent such outrages from occurring in the future. I was struck by his moving words and his dedication to the cause and so began our journey for justice. In 1990 it was Mr. Rajapaksa and I who were co-conveners of the Mothers Front movement. This was a movement against missing children of the South and had a significant impact in setting the discourse surrounding this sensitive topic. Today, I am dismayed by the sentiments that he vociferously articulates, to tear apart initiatives that seek to alleviate the pain of innocent mothers of this country.
No easy journey
The journey thus far has been long and by no means easy. A history of 30 years of violence is witness to the absolute necessity for the OMP today, perhaps even more crucial than it has been ever before. We have suffered through many conflicts from the time of the JVP insurrections in the 70s and 80s to the post-war violence just a few years ago. In these trying times, when the numbers of the missing have been steadily rising, few walked with us to see this journey to completion. The voices that spoke so passionately against these crimes suddenly started changing their tone. These same voices began switching camps so unexpectedly that lately many of the attacks on the OMP have been directed from Mr. Rajapaksa himself.
If the question of the missing still remains high on the agenda with the reported numbers of the missing rising each day, the question remains why it is no longer a cause worth fighting for. The answer is sad and simple. Self-serving policies and party politics have taken precedence over the suffering families of those gone missing over the past 30 years. For Mr. Rajapaksa in 1989, this cause was worth getting arrested for at the airport, while he carried documents with information regarding the missing to the UNHRC in Geneva, and today the same movement has been portrayed by this camp as an attack on our war heroes. The discourse has been distorted and manipulated for political gain, becoming a tool in the hands of power-hungry individuals. Misconceptions have been drawn out to confuse the public and the victims of this have been none other than the affected families who have had no means to redress their loss. But make no mistake, this journey will not be ended by the selfish actions of these self-serving individuals.
No ethnic or religious boundary
The OMP does not aim to benefit only one community and does not threaten another. It is merely a truth-seeking mechanism. It aims to investigate and find out the truth about those identified as missing or who have disappeared during conflict. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, over 16,000 individuals have gone missing during the civil war. Of them, 5,100 belonged to the armed forces. These are the very same individuals who fought against the terror that the LTTE created. We as a nation, have a responsibility to find the truth about where they are, and to bring an end to the agony faced by their families and loved ones.
The OMP mandate cuts across all ethnic and religious boundaries. It seeks to investigate persons missing in connection with the conflict of the North and East and its aftermath. This includes those of all ethnicities; including the armed forces and police who have been identified as missing in action. It will investigate into those gone missing during political unrest or civil disturbances in the South, as well as victims of enforced disappearances island-wide.
Mandate of the OMP
The mandate of the OMP ensures that it will carry out searching and tracing of missing persons, clarifying the circumstances in which such persons went missing and their fate, making recommendations to relevant authorities in order to reduce incidents of missing and disappeared persons, and identifying proper avenues of redress available to the families of the missing persons and informing them of the same.
Despite its role as an investigative body, the OMP is not a law-enforcement or judicial body such as a court of law, and the Act clearly states that the findings of the OMP shall not give rise to any criminal or civil liability. The myths that have been spread about the OMP claiming that it is a witch hunt to prosecute our war heroes is a lie. The OMP cannot prosecute perpetrators of violence. These rumors are political manipulations to deter the fair and just actions taken by the government towards peace and reconciliation.
It is merely an office set up to address grievances of the families and friends of those gone missing during conflicts and to ensure fair treatment for them in the future. The OMP gives the chance for renewed faith and hope for those who have lost their families and friends. It is not limited to an area or ethnicity, but promises dignity and prosperity for all. These steps will prevent isolating and radicalizing aggrieved communities and avoid new forms of terrorism that can shake the peace and stability of our nation.
In 2015, the coalition government vowed to develop a culture of consensual politics. The OMP took into strong consideration the recommendations made by the general public and civil society groups.
Families of the affected voiced their concerns and ideas on the best ways to improve the OMP bill.
Today their voices have been heard. Accordingly, the OMP is ready to engage with all groups, irrespective of their ethnicity, religion, or geographic location in order to get their valued input and information. The decision to do so was demanded by the people.
At the UNHRC in 2015, I stated that our political change was bringing an end to short-sighted policies and a triumphalist approach to the end of the war. The OMP is the primary example for this promise. This independent body is set to continue its investigations despite changing government interests. It is an autonomous, transparent commission acting independently to any political biases or affiliations.
This multiethnic island is one step away from lasting peace and prosperity. We as citizens of this great country must take this step together.
We have made it through the difficult times. We have endured adversity in all its forms and we are here today looking forward to a better future.

Wildlife wonders !
Saturday, March 3 was World Wildlife Day, which coincides with the adoption of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1973. CITES plays an important role in ensuring that international trade does not threaten the species survival.
We all extend courtesy and good manners and charity to our own species, but do we ever think about protecting wild plant and animal species and their habitats So you will come to realise that nature conservation is important. In fact, it is essential. But it is not because we need to save the planet. It is because we need to save us from ourselves.
The theme for World Wildlife Day 2018 is Big Cats. Using the expanded definition of big cats, the Day will raise awareness on the conservation of the lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar, as well as the cheetah, snow leopard, puma, clouded leopard and related species.
In both our neck of the woods and around the world, leopards are in trouble. The big spotted cats have been hunted to extinction in some areas, and their habitat is under pressure from growing human populations. Among other findings, researchers have confirmed that the Sri Lankan leopard is a genetically-distinct subspecies (Panthera pardus kotiya) that has its own unique habits. But studying wild leopards isnt easy, as they are expert at hiding themselves in the forests brush and shadows. And they are most active at night, further complicating surveys.
Leopard lovers in Sri Lanka and elsewhere are taking steps to protect these powerful creatures. But while parks and preserves have helped save leopard habitat, the cats striking pelt continues to make it an attractive target for poachers. While not as fashionable as they once were, a leopard fur can still fetch thousands of dollars on the black market.
In Sri Lanka, researchers believe poaching has helped reduce leopard populations by up to 75 percent over the last century. While firm numbers are scarce, biologists estimate that less than 500 of the big cats remain in the island nation.
Sri Lanka harbours a remarkable assortment of plant, animal, fish, frog, lizard and serpent species, ranging from majestic mammals such as elephants and leopards to rare medicinal plants and wildflowers. Unfortunately, many of our species have not fared well over the past few decades as a result of habitat loss and the spread of invasive species.
The day serves to remind us that endangered and threatened species of wildlife and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the world and its people. Everyone should be concerned by the disappearance of unique creatures and plant life.
It is crucial that governments ensure that we conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend. Although extinctions occur naturally, scientific evidence strongly indicates that the current rate of extinction is much higher than the natural or background rate of the past.
The main force driving this higher rate of loss is the destruction of habitat. Over-exploitation of wildlife for commercial purposes, environmental pollution, and the spread of diseases also pose serious threats to our worlds biological heritage. Perhaps the greatest threat to many species is poaching and the illegal trafficking of wildlife parts and products.
This crime involves hundreds of threatened and endangered species, from elephants, rhinos, leopards and tigers, to lesser known birds, reptiles, fish, and plants. Every day, rampant greed and corruption drive a soaring trade to feed growing markets, particularly across Africa and Asia. All too often, local people suffer in the process.
Conservationists warn that by 2025 as many as one fifth of all animal species may be lost, gone forever. In recent times, hundreds of species have become extinct as a result of human activities.
Habitat destruction by illegal logging, ever-encroaching human settlement, pollution of water, soil, and air and illegal hunting to supply the demand for skins, hides, traditional medicines, food, and tourist souvenirs all threaten species existence.
Global warming too has made the protection of endangered species increasingly challenging. Climate change not only affects our plants and animals directly, through changes in temperature, but can worsen the impact on endangered species of traditional threats, such as invasive species, wildfires and diseases.
Besides, over the last few decades it seems as if forestry has gone mad in our little island nation. Large-scale illegal logging and clearing operations have drastically reduced the countrys forest cover. As far back as 1980, conservationists had complained that the Upper Mahaweli watershed was being spiked at its source by the constant rape of its surrounding forests.
The situation had become so serious that it prompted the then government to establish a combined task force comprising police and army units to track down the timber pirates. Still, the decades of destruction of our beautiful tropical woodlands have taken their toll. Statistics have proved that the problem is and has been a grave one. In 1956, Sri Lankas forests covered about 7.2 million acres of the countrys total land area of approximately 16 million acres. Today, the forest cover stands around 3 million acres, reduced from 44 per cent to less than 16 per cent within the last 50 years.
Wildlife crime is a serious offence, not a distant problem in a faraway country. It has decidedly become a global challenge that spans continents and crosses oceans. It matters, and not just because we care about elephants, leopards, tigers, rhinos and other fascinating creatures. Local communities that depend on wildlife for tourism or sustenance are being robbed of their livelihoods.
One of the many tangible benefits of biological diversity has been its contributions to the field of medicine. Each living entity contains a unique reservoir of genetic material that has evolved over aeons. This material cannot be retrieved or duplicated if lost. So far, scientists have investigated only a small fraction of the worlds species and have just begun to unravel their chemical secrets to find possible human health benefits to mankind.
The worlds best loved species are being slaughtered by widespread and dangerous criminal networks. Driven by a voracious demand for illegal animal parts and products, the black market in wildlife rivals illegal arms and drugs trafficking. Increasingly, wildlife traffickers are the same kingpins involved in trafficking people and arms and narcotics. The majestic elephants are being decimated for their tusks, the magnificent leopards and big cats for their pelts and bones.
Extinction is forever. We must act now and have our voices heard. Time is running out.

Worker electrocuted on high-tension post
A worker of a company sub-contracted by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was electrocuted while attending to repair work on a high-tension electricity post at Sirikandurawatte in Rathgama, Galle, on Friday evening.
The worker was identified as Laddu Neil Shantha (39), of Thotagamuwa in Hikkaduwa.
Sirikandurawatte is a village where about 500 tsunami-affected families live. On March 1, the electricity supply was disconnected to the area for some maintenance work, which had been sub-contracted to a firm.
The workers had been working until late evening in order to restore electricity supply to the village before nightfall. Neil Shantha was working on a high-tension electric post on a last-minute defect in the supply, when the electricity supply was provided by the CEB, which was unaware that the repairs were in progress.
Neil Shantha died on the spot. It took about an hour for other workers to remove the body of the victim. Neil was an experienced worker with over 15 years service in the field. He had married just 10 months ago and his wife is expecting their first child.
People of the area were annoyed by the death of the worker and damaged a vehicle of the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Rathgama Police then arrived at the scene and the situation was brought under control. Rathgama Police also arrested four employees of the CEB in connection with the fatal accident. The postmortem into the death of worker was to be held at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital.

No drug in western medicine for sterilisation
Western medicine has not invented a drug for sterilisation as yet, the Director General of Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe issuing a special statement yesterday said.
Dr. Jasinghe pointed out that the only procedure used by western medicine for sterilisation is medical operation. He pointed out that the Ligation and Resection of Tubes (LRT) operation is used on women and Vasectomy operation used on men to sterilise. The western medicine does not use any medication in this regard.
The statement was issued in the wake of a tense situation at Ampara where a group of people attacked several Muslim owned shops alleging that they are using sterilising pills in the food they serve. Dr. Jasinghe stated that the Health Ministry has received several inquires demanding explanation on the alleged sterilising pills.

1,700 stillbirths, 1,550 infant deaths reported annually in Sri Lanka

Annually, 1,700 still births are reported and another 1,550 infants die within the first week of their birth in Sri Lanka,the Past President of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka and the Chairperson of the - Expert Committee on Ergonomics, Sri Lanka Medical Association,Consultant Community Physician Dr.KapilaJayaratne ( MBBS, MSc, MD (Com.Med) said.
According to Dr. Jayaratne, the majority of the deaths are reported from premature babies. The reason for over 35 percent of still births and the deaths of newborns are yet to be found out. Congenital diseases are one of the common reasons for many deaths of infants.
Many such deaths can be prevented through accurately identifying congenital diseases. It can be done only through performing a post-mortem examiniations and conducting a gene test. State hospitals perform post-mortem free of charge but both parents and health staffs do not render their cooperation since they do not have required knowledge on this issue, he said.
Postmortem examinations do not distort the dead body of the infant and only few cuts are made. The cuts are not visible to outside.
Furthermore there is no delay caused to release the body of the infant to the parents.
Parents' consent is required to perform the post-mortem examination. The gene test can be performed by obtaining just five millilitres of blood from the baby or the parents, he added.

Abbott bouncer fells batsman in chilling Hughes reminder
MELBOURNE, Sunday - Australian cricketer Sean Abbott, who bowled the bouncer that struck and killed Phillip Hughes, was involved in another chilling incident that felled a batsman in the domestic Sheffield Shield Sunday.
Fast bowler Abbott, playing for New South Wales, bowled a short ball that struck the helmet of Will Pucovski, forcing the Victorian batsman to retire at Melbournes Junction Oval.
It took Pucovski several minutes to get to his feet after treatment before he was helped off the ground by medical and physio staff, seemingly struggling to keep his balance, reports said.
It was a harrowing moment for Abbott, who bowled the bouncer that struck former Australia Test batsman Hughes on his neck at the Sydney Cricket Ground in November 2014, which tragically led to his death.
An emotional Abbott took time to regain his composure after the sickening incident before resuming his bowling spell.
Pucovski is regarded as one of Australias most promising young batsmen. At just 20 years old, has a history of concussion-related incidents.
In his first-class debut last season Pucovskis match ended early when he was struck in the head, forcing him to miss three months of cricket as a result of the blow.
The death of the popular Hughes at 25 stunned Australia and the world cricket community, sparking an outpouring of grief.
A coronial inquest in 2016 found that Hughes had made a minuscule misjudgement before he was fatally struck and no blame was attached to Abbott.
Cricket Australia has new rules in place for concussion subs in domestic games following recommendations from an independent investigation into the death of Hughes.

[APPRECIATIONS - (05-03-2018)]
Charles Henry de Soysa
Visionary ahead of his time
We the descendants of our ancestor late Charles Henry, whose memory lingers on through his unsurpassed largess to the nation, particularly in the fields of health, education and agriculture, paid homage to him at his statue at the de Soysa Circus. We were joined by past and present pupils of Prince and Princess Wales Colleges, Moratuwa, the principals and staff of the two schools and others from the hospitals he built.
Reading through the de Soysa saga, a historical perspective of the family history, I found that my father, late Professor C. C. de Silva, Charles Henrys grandson, had written the foreword. He first described Charles Henrys father, late Jeronis, as the Kohinoor (diamond) of his parents, whose example led Charles Henry to his achievements and success and made him share what he had with the underprivileged. Jeronis had begun life with a capital of Rs. 800, but died a millionaire. He too had been generous to the poor and underprivileged, and no-one who asked for his help was sent away empty-handed.
Charles Henry was one of the first pupils of S. Thomas College (STC), when it started in Mutwal in 1851. Bishop Chapman who was the founder of STC, was an admirer of Jeronis, and when the latter died, the Bishop spoke on the text, Know ye not that a prince has fallen this day in Israel. The first property Jeronis purchased was the Hanguranketa Estate. After an auction, several English planters and businessmen offered to buy it from Jeronis at double the price. His answer was, "I did not buy this land to make foreigners rich, but for my family and I to prosper; to enable us to help those in need."
Charles was in his early twenties when his father passed away. The crown of Charles benefactions to the nation in the field of health, was his donation of the land and the building for the De Soysa Hospital for Women, which has helped millions of mothers for well over two centuries. That was a time when not many mothers went to hospitals for delivery, and it displays his amazing foresight as a visionary ahead of his time.
His other benefaction of paramount importance was the vast acreage for the erection of buildings, playgrounds for Prince and Princess Wales Colleges in Moratuwa. He wanted the people of his hometown to be inferior to none other in education. The alumni of these two colleges have adorned the corridors of power, in the church, state, and university faculties, besides many learned professions. There are also many successful entrepreneurs who have been educated at these colleges, who like the benefactor of the schools, have left their footprints in the sands of time in our countrys history.
It has been said that for every rupee, Charles gave the state Rs. 100 in private unknown gifts to poor relatives, employees, the sick, blind, elderly in need, mentally-handicapped, and socially-underprivileged, to provide dowries for their daughters, and to churches and temples of all creeds. Although a Christian, he was generous to all religions and saw far beyond the narrow peripheries that divided all faiths.
During a visit to the UK in 1886, he donated large sums of money to hospitals there, and my father recalls seeing plaques in memory of these donations in two of the hospitals, in which he worked in London. They were The London Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street. He was also bestowed a signal honour by being elected an honourary member of the Atheneumthe oldest and most prestigious club in London, where it was almost impossible for an Asian at that stage of time to get membership. It is few that are remembered, wept for, sung and honoured for 100 years or more after their deaths.
It is good to realise that we remain a cultured nation in which the name Charles Henry de Soysa is still honoured and cherished as one of the greatest philanthropists in this country. There are several legends about our revered ancestor and his life. There are countless stories about the people he helped. He was a lover of animals and could not bear to see either a fellow human being or an animal in distress and reached out to them. Another famous story is his reception to HRH, the then Duke of Edinburgh. Special crockery and cutlery were used for the banquet all of pure gold studded with gems. The evenings programme included a banquet of monumental proportions, puppet and magic shows, dances and music by the Ceylon Rifles Band, all amidst a carnival atmosphere at Alfred House named so after the Royal visit, earlier known as Bagatalle Walauwa.
He also gifted a model farm which now is a model farm road, with several houses, including the Golf Club. He was the first Ceylonese banker and a well-known planter. He helped his alma mater, S. Thomas' College, with financial support whenever they needed it. He was sensitive to the needs of our people in all spheres, including education, health, agriculture and in their social, cultural and moral development. In spite of his vast fortune, he did not live in an ivory tower, away from others, but equated himself with the social and cultural life of the common man. His range of interests was so vast, that his influence impinged on the social, cultural and economic life of the people of the 19th century on many points, which was a notable contribution to the history of that period.
He sponsored the Moratuwa Carpenters' Society on co-operative lines long before the concept of co-operatives became a reality here. In 1884, he founded the Ceylon Agricultural Association, which later became the Low Country Products Association. The Moratuwa Mahajana Sabha, which emerged from the Moratuwa Association, was initiated by him. His numerous acts of charity were done with an amazing sense of liberality, which is why his name lives on.
I conclude with the same quotation my father used to describe his renowned ancestor, whose life reads like an incredibly fascinating fairy tale. They were these immortal words from Hamlet:
What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving how expert and admirable! In action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a God!

Lady Chrysobel Rajapakse
A pillar of hope
Ten years ago, ammie passed away at the age of 93. Her involvement with the All Ceylon Women's Buddhist Association (now the All Ceylon Women's Buddhist Congress), was all-consuming, and spanned about 50 years or more. She was a founder member, guided by benefactor/founder Juliet Jayawardene.
It is a fact that my mother was instrumental in getting almost a two-acre land on a lease from the government; a prestigious property in Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7, where our Headquarters are situated. I note with pride that the trustees at the time of its inception (one being my mother), requested the then Justice Minister L. A. Rajapakse (my late father) for approval, and was incorporated under the trust's ordinance.
The gazetted evidence as proof, is in a framed picture, and adorns one of the walls of the board room. I am currently the president of the All Ceylon Women's Buddhist Congress (ACWBC). Ammie worked together with other Buddhist ladies, following the founder's foresight, to start a home for blind women, home for young working girls, and a home for destitute elderly women. Back then, sources of income were from organising regular flag days and kantha melas for 2 to 3 days at large groundsan enjoyment even for children, as the atmosphere was that of a carnival!
Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Elina Jayawardene, Cissy Cooray, Eileen Amarasuriya, Daisy Seneviratne, Semitha Tennekone, Yasoma Punchihewa, Lucille Amarasuriya to name a few, including my mother, worked together with Lady Evadne de Silva and Lady Laura de Silva, as a team. These women served with dedication. They held honourary office, and I would like to mention here that Lady Evadne de Silva was its founder president, and my late mother, its founder secretary. Senior members still serving may remember these facts.
Ammie had a vision to start some years later, a hospice for destitute elders on the premises itself. The elders had no need to go back to their families when they were too old or needed special care. Sirimavo Bandaranaike opened the Suwa Sevanaa hospice with about 10 beds. The present residents are in good spirits and care, and need not worry about final religious rites, as expenses are borne by the congress. My mother's mother, H. M. Gunasekera, together with Lady Evadne de Silva, helped initiate Gamini Mathaa home for male elders, at Slave Island. Their pictures adorn the entrance of the home, usually decorated with a garland of flowers. Ammie's brother, U. N. Gunasekera, added a floor to the paying elders' home at the ACWBC at the request of my mother, and kept costs to a minimum.
Getting through Maths and English Literature at school was due to her diligence, tutoring me and my siblings. She always wore a sari for tennis, and won once or twice, the ladies' doubles tennis trophy at her club in Colombo. She continued to wear saris while playing tennis in Paris, when my late father had a diplomatic appointment in France. My French friends wondered if her religion was different to mine, as I wore western sports attire to play tennis.
Some of her domestics received gifts of houses or paddy fields for services their rendered, whilst still in service. I have admired my mother and remember her with affection.
May Ammie's journey in Samsara be short.

Nelson Fernando
A generous soul
I fail in my duty if I do not write a few words of appreciation and gratitude about the generosity of this remarkable, yet simple man. Wealth and generosity went hand-in-hand with him.
Freely you receive and freely you must give; the word of god exemplified in his life.
His heart was always open to the underprivileged, just as his gate remained open almost all throughout the day. Everyone who entered his premises for any need, did not leave empty-handed, be it relatives, friends, religious activists, social service personnel or strangers. His son and my cousin, Sanjany, continues to follow his father's footsteps.
Nelson uncle was well-prepared to face his death. I can remember his prompt answer to a query raised by a pastor more than 15 years ago. The pastor asked, "What else do yo wish for in life" Nelson uncle replied, "I want to enter the kingdom of heaven."
This should be the faith of every believer.
Believers of god do not die; they simply go before the presence of god for everlasting life. Nelson uncle is surely one of them.

Somapala Gunadheera
Remarkable record holder
Somapala Gunadheera was a unique person who established many records in his life. It was a shock to hear of his demise and the private funeral arranged according to his wishes. The announcement in the Daily News on February 13 confirmed the sad news.
Gunadheera ('Some' to his friends) won the fifth standard scholarship and entered Galahitiyawa Central College in 1944 as one of her first students. After a brilliant school career, he passed the Senior School Certificate (English) Examination with credits and distinctions in 1948. On the basis of that success, he obtained an exemption from the Matriculation Examination of the University of London.
As there was no Higher School Certificate (HSC) class at Galahitiyawa, he entered the Piliyandala Central College in 1949 for higher studies. While studying for his HSC, he passed the Intermediate Arts Examination of the London University and studied on his own for the degree examination, while serving as an assistant teacher in the Education Department. He passed a Bachelor of Arts (BA) Examination in 1955.
In 1956, he passed the Ceylon Civil Service Examination and became the first Central College student to enter the civil service. He was attached to the Jaffna District Secretariat during his cadetship. Thereafter, he held many senior posts in the administrative system of the country.
Gunadheera was blessed with a brilliant memory that helped in his studies. His thirst for knowledge helped him to pass his departmental examinations in quick time. After retirement, he studied law and practiced as an attorney. Later, he passed the Master in Law (LIM) Examination and helped other lawyers through his advisory services.
While working in the public service, he gave his unstinting support to the development of cultural activities of the country. He led some of the drama panels of the Arts Council and produced his own plays such as Umatusanwrusawa and Sri Gajaba. His first radio broadcast was in 1950 on the Didactic Literature of the Sinhalese. Later, he produced a teledrama series entitled Dharmadhikaranaya, based on our legal system.
After retiring from civil service, he functioned in many senior positions such as National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) Director-General, Steel Corporation Chariman and Southern Province Development Authority Chairman, before he began his legal practice.
He initiated the Central Colleges Past Pupils Association and was its first president. This Association has now expanded and developed itself with a large membership consisting of central college students serving in various positions in the public and private sectors, as well as those who have retired from service.
The national press and reputed journals carried a large number of scholarly articles written by him during the last few decades. Such articles on topics of national interest were popular and widely read.
His expertise in learning languages was remarkable. While serving in Jaffna, he studied Tamil and made his farewell speech in that language. He was equally proficient in English, Sinhalese, and French as well. His demise is a great loss to the country. We have lost a good friend and a helpful colleague.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Boy lays egg
In a bizarre incident that has left doctors baffled, a teenage boy named Akmal laid an egg in front of them after he was brought to the hospital writhing in pain. The 14-year-old Akmals family from Gowa, Indonesia, claimed that he has laid 20 eggs in the last two years, according to reports in Mirror.
However, the doctors are not ready to believe the familys claim and said it is impossible for poultry eggs to develop inside a human and suspect that eggs were possibly put inside the boys rectum. The family has refuted the allegations saying that the proof is Akmals X-ray which shows an egg inside his body.
The boys father Rusli was quoted as saying, In the last two years he laid 18 eggs and 2 today, so in total there have been 20. I cracked the first egg and its content was all yellow, no white. The father added, A month later I cracked another one, and its content was all white and no yellow.
Suggesting that the story is made up, a hospital spokesman said, Our suspicion is that the eggs were deliberately shoved into Akmals rectum. But we did not see it directly.
Akmal is in quarantine at the Syekh Yusuf Hospital in Gowa and doctors have placed him under observation. Express

China to take necessary measures if U.S. harms trade
CHINA: Beijing warned Sunday that it is ready to hit back at the United States if it harms Chinas economic interests, fuelling fears of a trade war after President Donald Trump unveiled steel and aluminium tariffs.
Trumps announcement on Thursday sparked a flurry of counter-threats from other nations but its main trade rival, China, had avoided any overt warnings of potential retaliation until now.
China doesnt want a trade war with the United States, Zhang Yesui, spokesman for the National Peoples Congress, told a news conference on Sunday, the eve of the Parliaments annual session.
But if the US takes actions that hurt Chinese interests, China will not sit idly by and will take necessary measures. Zhang warned that policies informed by misjudgement or wrong perceptions will hurt relations and bring consequences no side wants to see.
Trumps announcement came as President Xi Jinpings top economic aide, Liu He, met with US officials at the White House this week to discuss the fraught economic relationship. During his visit, according to the official Xinhua news agency, Liu and his hosts agreed that the two countries should settle their trade disputes by cooperation rather than confrontation.
Since announcing plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium, Trump has shrugged off threats from other nations, boasting on Friday that trade wars are good, and easy to win.
China has been the main target of Trumps ire over the US trade deficit since his presidential campaign, but its steel and aluminium exports to the United States are minimal.
While China is the worlds largest steel producer, it accounts for less than one percent of US imports and sells only 10 percent of its wrought aluminium abroad.
Steel producers in Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey rely far more heavily on the US market.
The American action to put sanctions on other countries reasonable steel and aluminium exports in the name of harming national security is groundless, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Saturday.
Some US allies, like Canada and Australia, had hoped to be spared the tariffs. A US official said Friday no countries will be exempt, but added that possible exemptions to the measures would be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Australia warned that a trade conflict could put the brakes on global economic growth.
Thats what concerns me, if we continue to see an escalation of rhetoric and, ultimately, action around tariffs applying for imports and exports across multiple economies... this will lead to a slow-down in growth, trade minister Steve Ciobo told Sky News Australia Sunday.
Trump ratched up the rhetoric on Saturday, threatening a tax on cars from the European Union if it enacts retaliatory measures. - AFP

## Title: Depression linked to brain inflammation

Depression linked to brain inflammation
Years of depression can cause brain inflammation that has been linked to degenerative diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons, a new study revealed.
About 1.5 percent of all American adults suffer from persistent depressive disorder, a long-lasting form of the mental condition.
Another 16.1 million face major depressive order, but the treatment approaches to the two are largely the same.
But an analysis of brain-changes among people whose depression lasted more than 10 years, done by the Canadian Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, suggested doctors may need to treat both depression itself and inflammation in these patients.
The average, untreated bout of depression typically lasts a few months, according to Harvard University. Everyones symptoms vary in type, severity, and duration. Depression may look like irritability or simply a low mood.
But the staying power of depression may make it even more difficult to diagnose, as years of the disorder come to be seen as normal for the person suffering the symptoms.
This may be why the average age of diagnosis for persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is relatively late, at 31 years old.
Most research on the physical consequences of depression - no matter how long its episodes are - has pointed primarily on its effects on the experience of pain and the likelihood of developing other mental illnesses.
The condition is also known to affect eating habits and experiences. Some tend to overeat when they are depressed, others lose their appetites, and still others will experience upset stomachs.
A high number of physical complaints may also be, in some cases, a warning sign that someone is depressed or in the throes of another mental health issue.
Depression typically involves a shortage of serotonin, a neurochemical that nerve cells use to communicate a command for blood vessels to constrict.
This is particularly important to the way that the digestive tract functions, as well as to the experience of pain. Depression is a physical illness that could be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, a Cambridge University professor stated in September 2017.
An overactive immune system may trigger the mental health condition by causing widespread inflammation that leads to feelings of hopelessness and unhappiness, the expert believes.
The immune system may fail to switch off after an illness or traumatic event, he adds.
Previous research has shown people who suffer severe emotional trauma have signs of inflammation, which suggests their immune system is constantly fired-up.
Professor Ed Bullmore, head of the department of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, said: In relation to mood, beyond reasonable doubt, there is a very robust association between inflammation and depressive symptoms.
In experimental medicine studies if you treat a healthy individual with an inflammatory drug, like interferon, a substantial percentage of those people will become depressed, The Telegraph reported.
Inflammation, too, is thought to destroy serotonin, leading some scientists to suggest that inflammation itself may be the cause of depression.
But whatever the answer to the chicken or egg question may be, researchers from the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) found evidence that longer bouts of depression increased brain inflammation. To determine whether or not the duration of depression made a difference for its inflammatory effects, the research team, led by senior study author Dr Jeff Meyer of CAMHs Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute recruited three groups of 25 people.
The first group had experienced more than a decade of depression, the second had experienced less than a decade, and the third had never experienced any depression, by their own reports.
The difference between the PDD sufferers and the other two groups was dramatic. Those who had been depressed for more than 10 years had 30 percent more of a protein marker of brain-inflammation than those who had experienced depression, but for shorter amounts of time.
Unsurprisingly, their inflammation levels were also higher than the control group that had never been depressed. This was the first study to show that depression has significantly different effects depending on how long it lasts, and the different effect was a worrisome one.
Greater inflammation in the brain is a common response with degenerative brain diseases as they progress, such as with Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease, and suggested that perhaps long-term depression should be treated with some of the same medications given to prevent these other serious diseases.

Derby miss out with defeat by in-form Fulham
LONDON, Saturday - Derby County failed to take advantage of the three teams above them in the Championship having their games postponed on Saturday, when they were beaten 2-1 at home to Fulham, who replaced them in fourth place.
Fulham, who were relegated from the Premier League in 2014, are on a fine run under Serbian manager Slavisa Jokanovic.
His countryman Aleksandar Mitrovic, on loan from Newcastle United, put them ahead and 17 year-old prospect Ryan Sessegnon scored a 14th goal of the season to double the lead by halftime.
Tom Huddlestone reduced the deficit but the London side held on to move two points above Derby and one behind third-placed Aston Villa.
Leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers, Cardiff City and Villa were all victims of the bad weather.
Bristol City were able to play at home to Sheffield Wednesday and beat them 4-0 with a hat trick by midfielder Bobby Reid to regain a playoff place.
Sunderland stayed bottom despite a 1-1 draw at Millwall.

Disturbing 'Cinderella weight challenge'
With their huge eyes, massive eyelashes, teeny-tiny waists and chirpy demeanours, many of aspired to be a Disney princess when we were younger.
Then reality - and age - taught us that, endearing though they may be, theyre just cartoon characters after all, and dont always translate into the real world. This fact hasnt stopped the latest diet challenge, however. At its focus is Cinderella!
While Cinderella may have taught us a dream is a wish your heart makes, her proportions could only belong in a fairytale.
Which makes the Cinderella weight challenge all the more dangerous. The challenge basically asks followers to reach a BMI of 18, which is officially classed as being underweight.
To calculate your Cinderella weight, you have to square your height in metres and then multiply that number by 18.
Thought to have started in Japan, the trend is quickly spreading.
Several people on Twitter have been sharing the worrying amount of weight theyd have to lose to complete the challenge.
The diet challenge has also been slammed for its use of Cinderella, which romanticises the idea of the extreme weight loss being encouraged.
While a persons normal weight may vary, a healthy BMI is 18.5 to 24.9. Mirror

Ending energy poverty
The Government has sought to add 220 megawatts of clean power to the countrys energy grid by 2020 which is 10 percent of the countrys current daily electricity demand. By 2025, the country hopes to boost its solar power output to 1,000 megawatts to meet fast-growing power needs according to President Sirisena. Solar power has the potential to meet 32 percent of Sri Lankas annual power demand of around 10,500 gigawatts  but so far just 0.01 percent of that potential has been developed, according to the Sri Lanka energy sector development plan for 2015-2025.
Today about 3 percent of Sri Lankas energy demand is met by renewables such as wind and solar. Hydropower provides about half of the countrys electricity during the wet season but during the dry season, between August and October, 81 percent of the islands power needs are met by fossil fuels, over half of that from coal.
Issue of subsidies
For the smallest-scale users, of 1 to 30 units of electricity a month, electricity costs Rs. 7.85 a unit, while large household consumers  those above 180 units - pay Rs. 45 per unit. Under the current effort to promote household solar installation, the government has offered to buy electricity generated by household solar panels at about Rs. 22 per unit. The scheme also offers households low-interest bank loans to buy the equipment, with a repayment period of seven years.
A new electricity system is emerging to bring light to the worlds poorest
According to the UN, 220 m people gained electricity between 2010 and 2012. But most of them were in urban areas, particularly in India. In sub-Saharan Africa, a region that, excluding South Africa, uses less electricity than New York state, electrification barely kept pace with population growth. Some 600 million of its people are without electricity; demography means that by 2030 the number could be even higher. What would it take to bring all these people into the modern world
Beyond the pylons
Governments and utilities in poor countries are often too cash-strapped to extend their grids. Part of the problem is widespread reluctance among users to pay for electricity. Across the world efforts are under way to change such attitudes, using technology and attempts to tweak social norms. In parts of Delhi, a utility has encouraged women to persuade neighbours to pay their bills in order to secure better service for all. Mr. Greenstone is part of a project, funded by the International Growth Centre, a global research network with headquarters in London, that is looking for ways to encourage people to pay for electricity in Bihar, where 64 m people are without powerthe highest share, at 64%, of any Indian state.
Bihar has plenty of generating capacity, Mr. Greenstone says, but gets paid for little more than half the power it provides. The rest is pilfered, unmetred or unbilled. The state power company has promised to provide electricity to feeder areas of 2,000-3,000 households that pay at least 60% of their bills. In a few randomly selected areas, it will increase the supply of electricity in proportion to the share of bills that are paid. The aim is to make people more aware of the value of their electricity supply and to encourage payment.
Mr. Greenstone thinks that the results of the trial, due later this year, will underscore the need for pre-paid electricity metres for households. These are similar to coin-fed metres in low-income housing in the developed world, but can be topped up by mobile phone, rather than cash. Uganda, where only 15% of the population is connected to the grid, is an early adopter. Selestino Babungi, the head of Umeme, the sole grid operator, says that half of its 800,000 customers use pre-paid metres. Before 2005, when it won the distribution contract, theft was ubiquitous. About 38% of electricity was lost because of illegal hook-ups or non-payment; some big businesses went as far as flying in Indian engineers to rig their metres. By making payments easier for clients and installing an automated system that detects when a metre is tampered with, the firm has brought that share down to 18.5%.
Higher revenues will help the company reach its goal of tripling the size of its distribution network to absorb additional power soon to be generated in Uganda. Most will go to industry and agribusiness, says Mr. Babungi, creating jobs that bring more people to the income level where they can afford to connect to the grid and buy household appliances that consume more power. Customers in such areas are likely to be better payers.
The power of progress
Though Ugandas government promises that eventually electricity will be rolled out to everyone, starting with regions where jobs are likely to be created is an idea with a good pedigree. Vietnam launched its post-war electrification in the rice-growing regions of the Red river and Mekong river deltas, helping the country to become one of Asias biggest rice exporters. Then it moved on to less immediately profitable areas. Access, which was under 50% in the late 1980s, is now almost universal.
Thailand and Costa Rica, which also quickly electrified rural regions, both prioritised areas where the potential for commercial development was higher.
Such rapid electrification, often using fossil fuels, may look like the cheapest way to bring power to everyone. And replacing fires and wood stoves improves air quality. But overall the environmental damage is severe, in terms both of adding smog to cities and accelerating climate change. Even the poorest countries are increasingly aware of the risks of pollution, says Anita Marangoly George of the World Bank. Why lock them into choices that will turn Lagos and Nairobi into Delhi and Beijing, she asks.
Hence donors prefer to fund power projects that are green as well as profitable. Some worry that this could saddle poor countries with pricey, intermittent energy. For instance a $24 m utility-scale solar-energy project in Rwanda generates electricity at 24 cents per kilowatt hour. Industry executives say they could produce it at half the cost using natural gas.
Others fret that solar energy is still not reliable enough to power economic development. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, published an open letter with his wife, Melinda, drawing attention to poor peoples lack of energy around the world, and poor womens lack of time (in part because they lack powered labour-saving devices).
He says that with current technology, solar power and batteries are insufficient to satisfy Africas energy needs. The good news, he adds, is that Africa has several other possible sources of fairly clean and reliable energy: geothermal in east Africa, hydro in Ethiopia and central Africa, and natural gas in several countries, including Mozambique and Tanzania. Unlike wind and solar power, these can be used for baseload power that operates constantly. If you want to attract manufacturing jobs you cant have intermittent energy, says Mr. Gates. If you want energy at less than 10 cents per kilowatt hour thats not some battery connected up to intermittent forces.
Potentially the most promising approach to bringing light to the 1.1 billion divides the task between traditional utilities and smaller, more entrepreneurial firms. The former focus on cities and businesses, and the latter supply off-grid power to poorer households in rural areas, individually or via neighbourhood mini-grids.
M-KOPA, which operates in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, and Off-Grid Electric, in Tanzania and Rwanda, offer packages of appliances, such as a few LED lights, a mobile-phone charger and a radio, all powered by a solar panel and a battery. Payments are made via mobile phone. An upfront cost of $150-500 would be prohibitive to most of their customers. So the firms charge in instalments, which are spread out enough to bring the monthly cost below that of buying kerosene for lamps. Default rates are negligible; if payments stop, the service is disconnected remotely by disabling the box that links the panel to the appliances.
Once the loan is paid off, there are no further payments, until a customer invests in a bigger system with more appliances, such as a flat-screen TV. M-KOPA says it is introducing new customers to electricity at the rate of 500 a day.

Fitch rates Sampath Banks Basel III Sub Debt Final A(lka)
Fitch Ratings has assigned Sampath Bank PLCs (A+(lka)/Negative) proposed Basel III compliant subordinated debentures a National Long-Term Rating of A(lka).
The notes will total Rs 7.5 billion, mature in five years and carry fixed coupons. The notes include a non-viability clause and will qualify as regulatory Tier II capital for the bank. The bank plans to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier II capital base and support its loan book expansion.
The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on 11 January 2018, and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received.
Fitch rates the proposed Tier II instrument one notch below the banks National Long-Term Rating of A+(lka) to reflect the notes subordinated status and higher loss-severity risks relative to senior unsecured instruments. The notes would convert to equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event, as determined by the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.
Sampaths National Long-Term Rating is used as the anchor rating because the rating reflects the banks standalone financial strength. Fitch believes that the banks standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of becoming non-viable.
Fitch has not applied additional notching to the notes for non-performance risk, as they have no going-concern loss-absorption features, in line with Fitchs criteria.
Sampaths National Long-Term Rating was affirmed on December 21,2017, factoring in Fitchs expectation that the bank is in the process of shoring up capitalisation to meet the tighter requirements of 10.0% Tier 1 and 14.0% total capital ratios by 1 January 2019.
In December 2017, Sampath raised Rs 7.6 billion and Rs 6 billion via a rights issue and Basel III compliant subordinated debenture issuance, respectively.

ZURICH, Saturday: Footballs lawmakers on Saturday approved video assistant referee technology (VAR) for this summers World Cup, in one of the biggest changes to the sport in years.
The International Football Association Board (IFAB), meeting in Zurich, rubber-stamped a move already backed by FIFAs top brass, including president Gianni Infantino.
We came to the conclusion that VAR is good for football, Infantino told reporters shortly after IFAB announced the decision.
He added that the final decision to use the technology at the World Cup in Russia will be made when the FIFA Council -- world footballs top decision-making body -- meets in Colombia on March 15 and 16.
We will hope and encourage the council to take a favourable decision, Infantino said, voicing confidence that VAR will secure final approval.
IFAB said in a press release that the decision represents a new era for football with video assistance for referees helping to increase fairness in the game.
Separately, the IFAB meeting also approved a fourth substitute in the case of extra time.
VAR can only be used when there is doubt surrounding any of four key game-changing situations: goals, penalty decisions, straight red cards or mistaken identity of a sanctioned player.
It has already been implemented in top European leagues including the German Bundesliga and Italys Serie A.
Spains La Liga on Friday began training officials ahead of the technologys expected introduction next season.
But opinion is still divided.
Players and managers have complained of referees being too eager to defer to technology, while fans in stadiums have been left in the dark as to why decisions are being made.
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this week that European footballs governing body would not introduce VAR in next seasons Champions League due to ongoing confusion surrounding its use.
Infantino conceded that he too was once a sceptic.
I was pretty much against it a couple of years ago and I changed my mind because I studied it, he said.
He pointed to IFAB research from 1,000 matches showing that referee accuracy without VAR -- which stood at 93 percent -- rose to 99 percent with video assistance.
With VAR, referee decision-making was almost perfect, Infantino said.
Others have voiced concern about video assistance slowing down the game, possibly breaking a teams momentum or diminishing fan experience by forcing people to abruptly halt a celebration while a goal is reviewed.
Infantino said that rather than ruining celebrations, VAR will create an additional moment of tension.
The Football Associations chief executive Martin Glenn, seated next to Infantino, conceded that improvements were needed.
That includes better communication with fans while reviews were ongoing and a better definition of what constitutes a clear and obvious error that justifies a VAR review, Glenn said.
Asked about reported hostility towards video review with the Premier League, Glenn said he believed English clubs understood the benefits of VAR conceptually and that its implementation was likely only a matter of time.
Some sceptics also have reservations about introducing such a significant change at the June 14 to July 15 World Cup, before all the kinks have been resolved at lower-profile competition.
I can guarantee the referees that will be at the World Cup will be ready, Infantino pledged.
Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of FIFAs referee committee, noted that the governing body had been preparing for more than a year to use VAR at the 2018 World Cup even though the decision has not been made.
FIFA is not going to start tomorrow, he told reporters. We already started in December 2016.
For Infantino, the overriding objective was to ensure that referees are able to make the right calls, especially in an era when many fans have access to a full range of replays on their smartphones.
At the end of the day what is... important for us is that we can help the referee to take the right decision, he said.

Fractured but whole, separated but together
In 2015, while on a Fulbright research fellowship in the Philippines, I went on a walking tour of Intramuros, the famed walled city in Manila. Erected from the ruins of a Malay settlement, Miguel Lpez de Legazpi, a Spanish conquistador, proclaimed Intramuros as the capital in 1571, becoming the center of political, military, and religious life for four hundred years. During World War II the Americans bombed the site into smithereens, with only San Agustin Church left standing.
The guided tour was rambunctious, politicized, and entertaining, more of a performance art, really. We stood erect with our right hands on our hearts for the Philippine national anthem. We repeated singsong-y lines fed to us by the flamboyant tour guide: Little bamboo houses.
There was even a race of sorts among the participants where we rode various modes of public transport, including bicycles, tricycles, and kalesa, or horse-drawn carriages. The spectacle ended with the group eating halo-halo, the popular Philippine dessert made of shaved ice, evaporated milk, sweet beans, jellies, and candied fruits. The tour guide concludedalbeit simplisticallythat Philippine culture was like halo-halo, the Tagalog name loosely translated as mix-mix, in that Filipinos were a swirling mixture or amalgam of multiple influences and sensibilities.
Temperament metaphor
Yes, indeed, to be Filipino is to be multifaceted: to be Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, Malay, Muslim, Catholic, tribal, indigenous, mestizo.
The country itself is an archipelago, consisting of over seven thousand islands, the number, some say, depending on the fluctuation of the tides.
These are metaphors for the temperament and psyche of the Philippines. Filipinos are passionate, hospitable, scattered, adaptable, fun-loving, mischievous, friendly, brutal.
Then, lets throw in a hyphen and American to the mixFilipino-Americanand complicate matters further. Simply put: the relationship between the Philippines and the United States is fraught.
America, our conqueror and liberator, colonizer and icon, English is now our lingua franca. The Philippines remains its little brown brother and its strategic military base in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Im situated as part of the 1.5 generation with one foot on each hemisphere, albeit the spread has grown increasingly distant with the years.
I was born and raised in Manila, immigrating with my family to Los Angeles in the throes of the summer Olympics in 1984, when I was twelve. I have retained much of my Tagalog and my memories. The move, a seismic shift, created the landscape for me to become a writer, a poet.
In America I developed my consciousness quickly. I was alerted to my otherness, my foreign self in a foreign land. In college, I visited a convalescent home in Delano in the California heartland, where I met the manongs, elder bachelor Filipino migrant workers, binding me to Philippine-American history. It was the subject matter of the first poem Id ever published:
Collective story
Each told the story of the collective,
the many eyes of a single pineapple:
I came to America at sixteen, at fourteen,
at twelve aboard a dysenteried ship . . .
Because of American influence and education in the Philippines at the turn of the century, after the Spanish-American War and Philippine-American War, this second wave of immigrants did not see themselves as aliens, but upon arrival the harsh realities set in.
These are metaphors for the temperament and psyche of the Philippines. Filipinos are passionate, hospitable, scattered, adaptable, fun-loving, mischievous, friendly, brutal.
In curating this special portfolio, I was ambitious in procuring works by Filipino writers as well as Filipino-Americans. My hope far exceeded my reach. But thankfully the submitted pieces that emerged observe, explore, articulate, and question the Filipino-American experience. The connection to the motherland is strong, bridging the chasm between those US-born and Filipinos.
There is an immense sense of longing, an almost umbilical thread, for the Philippines. There are also interpretations as to how to be a Filipino in America. What does it mean to live in the diaspora For myself and the writers collected here, much of our identity is marked by a country on the other side of the planet, thirteen or more hours away. When we sleep, they polish through their workday.
When they slumber, bone-tired, we dream. How to reach this gap of time and space, which sounds like science fiction Interplanetary, but as with such genres we try to find our common humanity, this seemingly interspecies love affair.
A touchstone of Filipino kinship is dispersal: the ability to feel intimacy between the thousands of scattered islands. Filipinos are also the workers and caretakers of the world, sending more than two million laborers overseas. How we nourish ourselves and others by being away, since our motherland cannot take care of us.
Underground river
For Filipino-Americans there is a longing for home that never quite leaves you. How rooted we are even if we have not set foot there. The Philippines looms. It seeps deep into our consciousness like an underground river.
In Jason Bayanis expansive poem, Tesseractsections excerpted herehe conjures up the creation myth of Malakas and Maganda, Strength and Beauty, split and sprung from bamboo, the ubiquitous grass plant traditionally used to build homes.
He first writes of the separation of sea and sky, and the earth thats soon to take shape: not a spot of land and only the flying animals / living in between. The marriage of sky and sea produces rain, the go-between, nurturer, as with the bodies of water that separate and connect the archipelago:
. . . then the sea and the sky became all their wants awakening. How even the sky candeliver water, even the water can bear the fire, and this is what makes the land, this is how the gods love. And when the land woke they whispered to it, the rain, and it had never stopped falling. - World Literature Today

FTA with Spore to impart biz openings to Lanka - Iswaran
Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA is a clear demonstration of Sri Lankas commitment to re-integrate into the global economy and bring more economic opportunities for its businesses and the people of Sri Lanka, said Minister for Trade and Industry of Singapore S. Iswaran.
Speaking at the Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forum in Singapore last Friday he said that for Singapore, this agreement marks another step-forward in their commitment to free and open markets, and to deepening their bilateral ties with Sri Lanka, and through Sri Lanka into the South Asian region.
We are already starting to see the benefits of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement; the positive news surrounding the agreement has led to an uptick in interest from Singapore companies to partner Sri Lankan companies to invest in opportunities both within Sri Lanka and to use Sri Lanka as a hub to expand into the broader South Asian region.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe making the keynote address at the event stated that Sri Lanka is on the path of becoming an attractive place for business in South Asia, one of the fastest growing regions in the world and said, This also means that for you in Singapore, Sri Lanka becomes a very advantageous hub to do business, to live, to invest in, to use as a springboard to South Asia and the Indian Ocean region, and as a link between South East Asia and South Asia.
The Prime Minister emphasized on the commitments made by the Sri Lankan government towards economic reforms and improving the ease of doing business in Sri Lanka.
We are very focused on fiscal consolidation, and the results are already visible, the tax to GDP ratio has improved, and ratings agencies are providing favourable outlooks. Next month, a new Inland Revenue Act will come into effect, providing a progressive, modern, and transparent income tax policy.
The Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA is part of a broader strategy of looking East to renew our trade relationships. While we focus on growing and sustaining our traditional markets of the US and Europe, we have begun to diversify our markets towards Asia and focus on plugging into Asian supply chains. This FTA is our first agreement with a South East Asian country , and we envisage this as a first step towards closer integration with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.
We know we can leverage on our strategic location to expand market access. Therefore we are expanding our trade and investment relationships with a diverse set of countries, such as the US, EU, India, China, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.

How to read poetry
You probably found your way here after a fight with a poem. You gave it a valiant effort, but at the end, you found yourself buried under clauses and metaphors, lost without the light of meaning. You shrugged and closed the book. The poem didnt want you to understand. That is the point of poetry, isnt it Well, not exactly. Learning how to read poetry is like learning a new language. You need new tools and strategies, different than what you may already be using to read novels. Once you have the right tools, reading poetry will become easier and more fun, and my hope is that youll start reading poetry for pleasure instead of just when its assigned.
Now before I really dig too far into this, know that this is just a guide for the basics.
Im going to include the kind of stuff I wanted my high school honors American literature students to know. That means there is a huge world of poetry beyond this.
This guide is just for when youre starting out with poetry interpretation. I dont want you to look at this and think, Oh my gosh, Im going to have to do 'all that' for every poem I read for the rest of my life! No. Honestly, cross my heart, you wont. Once you start practicing, reading poetry will gradually come more naturally, I swear! It just takes a little time.
What you will need:
a paper version of your poem, a book you can write in, or a digital version that allows for annotation; the internet; a buddy or teacher.
Choose a poem. It may be a poem that has been assigned to you, or maybe your friend has shared it, and you want to figure the poem out.
What kind of poem is it The type of poem it is will give you huge clues to what its doing. For example, sonnets often talk about love. Haiku meditate on an aspect of nature. You get the idea. Next, scan the poem for words that arent familiar. Circle these words and look them up. Write their meanings off to the side. Now when youre reading, you wont get tripped up by new words. Note: meanings of words sometimes vary based on context clues. If the definition you wrote down doesnt make sense in the context of the poem, you might need to choose a different one.
Give the poem another skim, this time for punctuation. Find all the periods first. This will show you where the sentences stop. The number one thing that trips readers up when they first encounter Shakespeare isnt the language. Its that the guy uses hella long sentences. Though most of his sonnets are the traditional length (14 lines), many of them are only one or two sentences long! Knowing where the sentences stop and start will help you figure out the poems units of meaning. Most current poetry uses the sentence or the line as its unit of meaning (in other words, thats the size of bite you need to take to understand each part of the poem), but Shakespeare and his contemporaries often use the clause as their unit of meaning. Seeing a poem made of a few long sentences should tell you to slow down. Taking smaller nibbles of those poems will make them easier to understand.
Read the poem. Sometimes reading aloud to yourself can help make it more understandable. Write down what you think the poem means as a whole. If youre feeling ambitious, or if youre dealing with a longer poem, write down what you think it means by stanza or by chunk.
Now Im going to tell you to do something that you might make your English teacher cringe. Google the poem. For high schoollevel reference, Im a fan of Shmoop. Theyre funny, and theyre actually correct most of the time. I cant say the same for SparkNotes. Thug Notes are also pretty dope, but sometimes not school appropriate (a selling point, imo).
Once you find a good interpretation of your poem, compare it with your own. Was your interpretation different or the same If it was the same, gold star. If it wasnt, look back at the poem. Try to pick out words and phrases that tell you yours was right. (Heres a secret: sometimes theres more than one correct interpretation for a poem. If you can back up your interpretation with evidence from the poem, you too deserve a gold star.) If, on the other hand, you cant find evidence in the poem that supports your interpretation, you need to
Grab a buddy or ask your teacher. Sometimes you need to see the poem with a new set of eyes. So talking to someone about it will help. If youre more of an introvert, there are tons of people on the internet who would love to do with with you (hi).
Now that you have a better understanding of the poem, read it over again. Does it make more sense now If it doesnt, dont worry. Mastering poetry is a journey youll take in a lot of small steps. Even professors continue learning poetrys intricacies well into their careers. Just keep trying, keep talking about poetry, and most importantly: keep reading.
Bonus step: Literary devices! Okay, so Im a nerd for literary devices. They are the lovely spices that make poetry delicious.
There are hundreds of them. Now that you understand the surface meaning of the poem, go back (preferably with a pen or even a highlighter), and find a few in your poem. Label them. Figure out how they add to the deeper meaning of the poem. In the best poems, the literary devices add a layer that points back to the poets overall message for the piece.

HSC Blues savours sweet revenge beating Colombo BC
Hambantota Sports Club (HSC) Blues took sweet revenge for their defeat in last years final when they beat arch rivals Colombo Basketball Club (Colombo BC) 74-57 after leading 26-22 midway in the Colombo Super League Mens A Division Basketball Championship final played at the Sugathadasa Stadium yesterday.
HSC Blues were steady from the beginning and posted a five-point lead in the low-scoring first quarter (9-4). The second quarter saw a point-to-point battle as Colombo BC made inroads into Blues half. Even though HSC Blues were four points ahead at half time (26-22), Colombo scored 18 points while restricting Blues to 17 in the second quarter.
Colombo BC bounced back strongly in the beginning of the third quarter, thanks to some bad passes and poor teamwork from their rivals and snatched the lead with Charith Madhushanka sinking a three-pointer from left to equal the scores at 28-all. Even though Colombo lads maintained a slight lead for some time HSC Blues regained their control towards the latter part of the penultimate quarter scoring 52-44.
The defending champions could not counter attack strongly as HSC Blues widened the lead comfortably to seal victory scoring 22 points while restricting their opponents to 13 points in the final quarter. The same two teams fought out in last years mens Div. A final and Colombo won the title.
HSC Blues point hunt was heavily banked on Clinton Stalon who scored 23 points and he bagged the Most Valuable Player award. Captain Mithila Abeysekara too contributed with 11 points. Sudesh Ahamed (17 points) and Isuru Perera (10 points) were the top scorers for Colombo BC.
HSC Blues defeated SL Air Force 87-74 and Colombo BC beat HSC Blacks 64-57 in the semis.
The womens A Division saw defending champions Trackmasters BC retain the crown thrashing SL Army 63-32 after leading 31-13 at the short whistle.

Kumarin Silva of Trackmasters BC was adjudged the Most Valuable Player. She added 13 points to the winning total in the final. Trackmasters beat Contenders 67-37 after leading 35-17 at the breather in the semis and SL Army downed SL Air Force 60-51 in the other semi final after leading 31-19 midway.
The mens B Division title was won by Moratuwa A team beating Colombo BC B team 71-57. Moratuwa A had a five-point lead at half time (32-27). Gayan Meedeniya who was awarded the Most Valuable Player Award made the highest contribution of 23 points for the winners in the final while Shaun Ramanayaka scored 19 points for Moratuwa A. Chanuka Fernando (21 points) and Dasun Mendis (15 points) scored best for Colombo BC B. Moratuwa A entered the final beating Royal BC with a thrilling 68-67 win after trailing 27-31 at half time in the semi final.

Invincible War Hero
A retired War Hero who had lost his hands and one leg in action against terrorists launched a fast joined by his family members opposite the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy on March 3, protesting against the failure of relevant authorities to provide pipe-borne water to his residence in Ankelipitiya, Thalathuoya.
The War Hero, Thejan Saman Kumara, said that even though his house is situated a mere 200 metres away from the main pipe-borne water supply line, authorities had failed to heed repeated requests made to provide a water connection to his house for the last eight years. Saman Kumara, who joined the 11th Brigade of the Sri Lanka Gemunu Regiment in 2007, had received serious injuries in battle during an operation conducted in Janakapura, Welioya on June 6, 2008 as part of the Armys humanitarian operation.
Saman Kumara said he returned home after treatment in hospital in 2010. Ever since he had requested authorities to provide a water connection to his house and all his requests had fallen on deaf ears.
He had been deceived by officers many a time promising to give a pipeline but the pledge had never been kept. Saman Kumara, a father of one, said he had to travel nearly five kilometres to fetch water. His wife was pregnant and in a delicate state of health and she could not come for his assistance either.
Finally, the 11th Brigade of the Sri Lanka Gemunu Regiment intervened in the matter and sent Maj. M.W.P. Abeysekara to meet Saman Kumara on behalf of their Commander and Maj. Abeysekara gave an assurance in writing that they would intervene to fulfil his request after informing the Army Headquarters about the matter.
Thereafter, Saman Kumara gave up his fast and returned home with his family anticipating that his request would bear fruit at last.

In its carder are some women who have honed their talents and abilities to become inspirational examples. Overcoming obstacles, they are proud to be a part of the working women of Sri Lanka and role models to many. This is what some of them had to say for International Womens day
"The role of the modern woman is more and more challenging. We are bread winners of our households and have proven our capabilities in the same capacity as men in many fields."
 Renuka Kumari- Security Division
"The hospitality sector in Sri Lanka needs more women. It is an industry that is growing fast along with plenty of opportunities to learn and grow."
- Chandramali Kumarasinghe  Food and Beverage Division
"The opportunity to learn new things every day is what I love the most about this my work. While the work is challenging, rising up to it day in day out has led to my character development."
 Malka Peiris  Kitchen Division
"Women are coming to the forefront in many industries in Sri Lanka. The mindsets are changing and stereotypes are breaking as more women are rising to senior positions and inspiring more to do so. This needs to continue for gender parity to be achieved."

Liverpool go second, West Brom sinking fast
LONDON, Saturday: Liverpool moved into second place in the Premier League as Egyptian international Mohamed Salah continued his remarkable scoring run in a 2-0 victory at home to Newcastle United on Saturday.
Salah scored for the seventh match running, taking his Liverpool total for the season to 32, when he put the home side ahead after 40 minutes.
Sadio Manes goal in the second half ensured there was no joy for Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez, whose Liverpool team won the Champions League in 2005.
Manchester United will start next Saturdays game at home to the Merseysiders back in second place if they win at Crystal Palace on Monday.
I thought the boys did brilliantly, said manager Juergen Klopp.
Two wonderful goals and a few more possible. Im happy.
Tottenham Hotspur, apparently affected early in the season by playing home games at Wembley, achieved a sixth straight win there by beating Huddersfield Town 2-0 with a double by Son Heung-min.
It was their 17th game unbeaten in all competitions and briefly moved them ahead of Liverpool.
We feel comfortable at Wembley, we enjoy playing here, Son said after scoring four times this week at the national stadium where Tottenham are playing while they build a new home ground.
Spurs, who did not win in their first three league games there, are fourth, a point behind United and five ahead of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit runaway leaders Manchester City on Sunday.
Defeat pushed Huddersfield right back into the relegation mix, only three points above the bottom three, after winning their two previous games.
Swansea City were the big winners at the bottom, moving above five teams to 13th, including West Ham United who they beat 4-1.
Ki Sung-yeung scored the first after nine minutes and the unmarked Mike van der Hoorn added a second in the 32nd.
Andy Kings goal and Jordan Ayews penalty ensured victory before a consolation by Michail Antonio.
West Ham manager David Moyes, whose team travelled seven hours by coach to reach Swansea from London on Friday after their flight was cancelled, was bitterly disappointed with the performance, one of their worst since he took over in November.
Im embarrassed, he told reporters.We played so bad. I couldnt assess it, it was that poor. The fans travelled through the snow to get here and we let them down badly. That was the poorest performance since I came here.
Victory continued Swanseas improved form under Portuguese manager Carlos Carvalhal.
Since he joined the club at the end of December with Swansea bottom, they have won five league games and lost only two.
PARDEW DESPAIR
In contrast, West Bromwich Albions change of manager in the same month has not paid off.
Alan Pardews job appears to be under greater threat than ever after a 1-0 defeat at Watford.
Albion have now won one of 15 league games since Pardew took over at the start of December and are seven points adrift at the bottom of the table.
Watford captain Troy Deeney was sent clear by Will Hughes to score the only goal.
The players gave me everything today and I cannot ask for more than that, Pardew said.
It is tough but it isnt about me, its about West Brom and it is tough for the fans and the players.
Stoke City stayed second-bottom but earned a valuable point in a 0-0 draw at Southampton.
Burnley supporters must have despaired when their team went a goal down at home to Everton. Sean Dyches team have never won a Premier League game after falling behind.
This time they did, however, celebrating Dyches 250th game as manager by winning 2-1 with goals from Ashley Barnes and substitute Chris Wood.
Everton captain Ashley Williams was sent off four minutes from the end for a wild swipe at Barnes.
In Sundays other match, Arsene Wengers struggling sixth-placed Arsenal visit mid-table Brighton & Hove Albion.- Agencies

Total turnover value amounted to LKR7.04Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR4.33Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR1.76Bn (+103.42% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.87Bn.

Liquidity (in value terms)
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 73.43% (or LKR 5.17Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by Nations Trust, Sampath, LOLC, HNB, Janashakthi Insurance, Commercial Bank & CDB which accounted for 93.79% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 15.92% (or LKR 1.12Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by JKH &Melstacorp which accounted for 77.68% of the sector turnover.
The Power & Energy Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 2.89% (or LKR 0.20Bn) to the market.

In terms of volume Softlogic Holdings & Dialog led foreign purchases while KelaniTyres& HNB led foreign sales.
In terms of value Softlogic Holdings & Central Finance led foreign purchases while HNB & JHK led foreign sales.
Point of view
Local Institutional and HNI investors returned strongly to markets after a one-month hiatus, helping push turnover levels on the Colombo Bourse to a new high since Sep17. Average daily turnover levels for the week consequently amounted to Rs. 1.76Bn to not only the highest level this year but also the highest level since mid-Sept17 when average daily turnover rose to Rs. 2.95Bn amid Hayleys acquisition of Singer BVs stake in Singer Sri Lanka.
Local Institutional and HNI participation which ranged at a high 60% (of total market turnover) during Jan18, dropped notably in the run up to the LG elections to average a paltry 24% over February (participation levels of Local HNI and Institutional investors typically average ~40%). Local HNI and Institutional interest this week remained focused largely on Banks, with crossings in banking counters accounting for ~65% of the weeks total crossings.
Mid-tier banks NTB and Sampath accounted for the largest proportion of the crossings (54%) while top-tier banks COMB and HNB accounted for 12% of the weeks total crossings.
Despite the surge in turnover levels, the benchmark price Index fell ~18 points this week amid daily declines on the Index.
Nevertheless, appetite for Sri Lankan equities has remained relatively steady so far this year and despite political uncertainty clouding market sentiment and a slight risk reversal in global appetite for EM/FM assets in Feb18, YTD returns on the ASPI have totaled 2.3%, with the benchmark Index remaining staunchly above the 6400-mark throughout the year.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue consolidating at the current 6500-levels.
Global financial assets faced challenging February
February remained a challenging month for global financial markets, with most asset classes recording losses for the 1st time in months. Global equities lost money for the 1st time since Oct16 while worldwide bond markets were on track for its worst monthly performance since Nov161.
For the 1st time since Nov16, global investors appeared to reject EM/FM assets as net foreign portfolio flows to emerging markets fell $4.5Bn in February, ending a 14-month streak of net inflows.
Although the turn in risk appetite remains concerning as it may represent investor perception that EM/FM markets are facing stronger headwinds, the decline in short-term capital flows is more likely representative of a correction from the significant $49Bn that was pumped into financial assets in developing economies in January.
The IIF notes that while it remains cautious in its outlook for EM net capital flows due to the turbulence in February, it still estimates net flows to the 17 key markets it tracks topping $107Bn 2018, up from $62Bn in 2017.
According to the institute, most of Februarys outflows were concentrated in Asia, particularly China with countries such as Turkey, India, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico by contrast recording net inflows, ranging between $3.7-$15Bn.
Net foreign flows to Sri Lankan Equity and Debt markets also tracked the general trend in global markets, with net foreign flows to equites in Feb falling to Rs.2.0Bn (down from net inflows of Rs.4.0Bn in Jan) while net foreign holdings of G-Secsfell 3% M-o-M to total Rs321Bn in Feb. cf. Rs.330Bn in Jan.

Love at first sight
A couple who met as babies more than 30 years ago are set to tie the knot.
31-year-old Laura Nice from Surrey was just weeks old when she first saw Andy Ducrow, 33. The pair have recently welcomed a child of their own.
The couples dads Gary Nice and Dave Ducrow were school friends in Birmingham in 1963.
While pattern designer Laura and lorry driver Andy lost touch in their late teens, they reconnected in their twenties and fell in love.
Speaking about it to The Sun, Laura said, Its a real generational love story. I cant remember a time when Andy wasnt in my life, while our dads fight over our son, Chase, like they might have scrapped in the playground when they met 55 years ago.
Gary moved to Cambridge with his parents a few years after meeting Dave, but they stayed in touch and, over the years, became best mates.
After Gary married Lauras mum Jane, in 1984, and Dave married Andys mum Jackie, they often hung out together as couples.
Still best friends, the granddads now cannot wait to become official father-in-laws when Laura and Andy tie-the-knot.
Andy was born in June, 1984 and was nearly two when Laura was born at Hinchinbrook Hospital in August 1986.
I think I was a matter of weeks old when I met him for the first time, Laura said.
The pair then spent every summer holiday and Christmas together throughout their childhood. But as they got older and started secondary school, they drifted apart  although their parents were still best friends.
Andy left school at 16 to become a lorry driver, while Laura stayed on, doing her A-levels. Laura heard through her parents that Andy, by then in his late teens, had married.
Then, when she was around 22 and he was 24, she received a message from him on Facebook. Still living in Birmingham, Andy  who broke up with his wife after a few months, long before he reunited with Laura  offered to drop in on her in Cambridge, en route to London. After catching up on childhood memories, they realised their friendship had blossomed into something more. Visiting each other more regularly over the coming months, they fell in love.
Last December the couple moved in together in Epsom, and in November 2015, Andy proposed and, four months ago on October 17, 2017, at Epsom General Hospital, Chase was born weighing 8lb 6oz. The couple weds next year. The Sun

Markram fights but Australia close to win
DURBAN, Sunday: Aiden Markram led a stirring South African fightback but could not prevent Australia from closing in on victory on the fourth day of the first Test at Kingsmead on Sunday.
Opening batsman Markram made 143 but South Africa were hanging on at 293 for nine, still 124 runs short of a target of 417, when bad light stopped play.
South Africa were in desperate trouble at 49 for four but Markram shared stands of 87 with Theunis de Bruyn (36) and 147 with Quinton de Kock (81 not out) which gave South Africa hope that they could pull off a miracle victory.
His dismissal, though, opened the door for Australia to rip through the tail. Mitchell Starc took three wickets in five balls to have South Africa nine down. -AFP

Millennium Falcon bedroom
Some kids just wont sleep in their own bed-they much prefer the coziness of their parents bunk. Grownups who want some privacy have to get creative to ensure that their offspring will spend the night in their room.
Redditor Dericrw and his wife certainly sweetened the deal with their version of a Star Wars bedroom. Together, they built a sleeping pod modeled after the Millennium Falcon. Inside, it holds a twin-sized bed, television, and of course, NERF guns and lightsabers to fend off any bad dreams.
Dericrw, who also works under the name Oklahoma Kid Designs, is relatively mum on how they constructed the bedroom furniture. He does, however, reveal that the pod is suspended five feet off the floor and the interior space is four feet tall, 10 feet long, and approximately five feet wide. The interior is outfitted with color-changing lights and a fan for air circulation, making it a cozy space to sleep or just relax.
The Star Wars-themed bedroom has another clever touch. Because itd be nearly impossible to recreate the entire Millenium Falcon in a room that size, Dericrw and his wife opted to build just one part of the ship. They bolted it to the ceiling joists and lined it up with a vinyl mural of the ship that covers the entire wall. The result looks like the whole ship is about to emerge from the wall and fly into hyperspace. Ufunk

## Title: The oddness of Isaac Newton

The oddness of Isaac Newton
There is a well-attested saying of the Prophet Muhammad to the effect that every century or so a renewer (mujaddid) will be sent by God to restore Islam to its proper form. The truth requires regular and forcible upkeep. From the jurist ash-Shafii and the philosopher-theologians al-Ashari and al-Ghazali to Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandfather of modern Salafism, the putative mujaddidun were thinkers who recognized that what has been revealed cannot simply be allowed to bed down into custom and ritual  it must be made new for each generation.
One of the shocks of reading Rob Iliffes study of Isaac Newton is that its subject fancied himself as something very much like a mujaddid. Another is that he lived in a world whose chief preoccupations would be more familiar to al-Ashari (and possibly even to Ibn Taymiyyah) than they would to a modern scientist. A third is that he seems to have spent more time mentally in the fourth century than in the seventeenth.
Natural philosophy
Priest of Nature is certainly not the first book to acknowledge that Newton was a deeply religious man. It is, though, one of the first to argue seriously that Newtons faith was as important to him as his natural philosophy  if not more so. Over the past fifteen years or so a series of private papers have emerged that reveal he invested enormous industry and rigour of thought in studying Christian origins. Iliffes salutary achievement is to show that the writings emerging from his investigation reveal a different Newton to the man we are familiar with from histories of science. Equal parts litigator, millenarian, numerologist, moralist and paranoid conspiracy theorist, Newton probed the foundations of orthodoxy and found them wanting.
If [these texts] had been unveiled to the Republic of Letters when he wrote them, and his authorship revealed, Iliffe remarks in his splendid introduction, he would now be part of an elite pantheon of original thinkers who are lauded as part of a Radical Reformation or Radical Enlightenment. However, like William Whiston, his successor in the Lucasian chair [of mathematics at Cambridge University], he would have been immediately expelled from the college. He would never have had the chance to write the Principia or Opticks, and much, if not all, of his pioneering work on the calculus might have been lost.
There is no hyperbole here. This biography makes at least three important contributions to the understanding of Newtons mind and the birth of science as it is practised today. The first is its portrait of academic life in the Restoration years, when Cambridge colleges still had more in common with their medieval antecedents than with their twenty-first-century descendants. The second is its very credible contention that Newton thought of his work as the rediscovery of the original wisdom handed down by God to prehistoric man, the prisca sapientia of the Egyptians, the Pythagoreans and the builders of Stonehenge, which had been deplorably corrupted and distorted by the early Christians.
Independent-mindedness
The third is the all-consuming vitality and venom of Newtons anti-Trinitarianism. His clandestine, lifelong and almost entirely fruitless obsession with the subordinate status of Christ involved at least as much independent-mindedness and inference from first principles as anything he did in the sciences. In many ways it was a sort of secret prototype for Enlightenment thought: for the dogged pursuit of a train of enquiry, heedless of other peoples assumptions. Newton had, Iliffe suggests, simply read himself into heresy.
In many ways it is still hard to know quite what to make of Newton. He was so chary of his privacy that in spite of keeping a paper trail voluminous enough to assert his priority in using differential calculus nearly half a century after the event, he left only a few sparse scraps of introspection for future scholars to pick through. One suspects he would have preferred to be known to posterity through his achievements alone.
There is a sense of a life whose constituent parts have never quite been melded cogently together. Newton tends to come across in popular biographies as a prickly and profoundly ornery recluse whose mind was more at home in the heavens than in conversation with his fellow men, let alone women. Some of this is not exactly wrong. Newton prickled all right. Even as a child, growing up at Woolsthorpe Manor in rural Lincolnshire during the English Civil War and the early years of the Commonwealth, he threatened to set his mother and stepfather on fire and burn the house over them.
Modern mechanics
He was not what you would call a science communicator. The Principia Mathematica, for all its importance as the foundational text of modern mechanics, is written in a fabulously dense and sprawling thicket of Latin that makes the Greek of Euclids Elements look positively vulgar.

One kilo at a time
What are overweight and obesity
Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as a persons weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).
Adults
For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:
 overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and
 obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.
BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. However, it should be considered a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals.
For children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity.
Children under 5 years of age
For children under 5 years of age:
 overweight is weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards median; and
 obesity is weight-for-height greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards median.
Children aged between 519 years
Overweight and obesity are defined as follows for children aged between 519 years:
 overweight is BMI-for-age greater than 1 standard deviation above the WHO Growth Reference median; and
 obesity is greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median.
What causes obesity and overweight
The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Globally, there has been:an increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat; and an increase in physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.
Changes in dietary and physical activity patterns are often the result of environmental and societal changes associated with development and lack of supportive policies in sectors such as health, agriculture, transport, urban planning, environment, food processing, distribution, marketing, and education.
What are common health consequences of overweight and obesity
Raised BMI is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases such as:
 cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke), which were the leading cause of death in 2012;
 diabetes;
 musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis  a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints);
 some cancers (including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).
The risk for these non-communicable diseases increases, with increases in BMI.
Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death and disability in adulthood. But in addition to increased future risks, obese children experience breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, early markers of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and psychological effects.
Facing a double burden of disease
Many low- and middle-income countries are now facing a double burden of disease.
While these countries continue to deal with the problems of infectious diseases and under nutrition, they are also experiencing a rapid upsurge in non-communicable disease risk factors such as obesity and overweight, particularly in urban settings.
It is not uncommon to find under nutrition and obesity co-existing within the same country, the same community and the same household.
Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate pre-natal, infant, and young child nutrition. At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with lower levels of physical activity, result in sharp increases in childhood obesity while under nutrition issues remain unsolved.
How can overweight and obesity be reduced
Overweight and obesity, as well as their related non-communicable diseases, are largely preventable. Supportive environments and communities are fundamental in shaping peoples choices, by making the choice of healthier foods and regular physical activity the easiest choice (the choice that is the most accessible, available and affordable), and therefore preventing overweight and obesity.
At the individual level, people can: limit energy intake from total fats and sugars; increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts; and engage in regular physical activity (60 minutes a day for children and 150 minutes spread through the week for adults).
Individual responsibility can only have its full effect where people have access to a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, at the societal level it is important to support individuals in following the recommendations above, through sustained implementation of evidence based and population based policies that make regular physical activity and healthier dietary choices available, affordable and easily accessible to everyone, particularly to the poorest individuals. An example of such a policy is a tax on sugar sweetened beverages.
The food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by:
 reducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods;
 ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers;
 restricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at children and teenagers; and
 ensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activity practice in the workplace.
WHO response
Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2004, the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health describes the actions needed to support healthy diets and regular physical activity. The Strategy calls upon all stakeholders to take action at global, regional and local levels to improve diets and physical activity patterns at the population level.
The Political Declaration of the High Level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases of September 2011, recognizes the critical importance of reducing unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. The political declaration commits to advancing the implementation of the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, including, where appropriate, through the introduction of policies and actions aimed at promoting healthy diets and increasing physical activity in the entire population.
WHO has also developed the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 2013-2020 which aims to achieve the commitments of the UN Political Declaration on Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which was endorsed by Heads of State and Government in September 2011.
The Global Action Plan will contribute to progress on 9 global NCD targets to be attained by 2025, including a 25% relative reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 and a halt in the rise of global obesity to match the rates of 2010.
The World Health Assembly welcomed the report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity (2016) and its 6 recommendations to address the obesogenic environment and critical periods in the life course to tackle childhood obesity. The implementation plan to guide countries in taking action to implement the recommendations of the Commission was welcomed by the World Health Assembly in 2017.

Key facts
 Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975.
 In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese.
 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and 13% were obese.
 Most of the worlds population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.
 41 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2016.
 Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016.
 Obesity is preventable.

Ontario Cricket Academy to tour Sri Lanka
The Ontario Cricket Academy (OCA) of Canada will be touring Sri Lanka to play with local schools from 10th to 20th March. This is the fourth tour to the island and 13th international tour undertaken by OCA since 2003. OCA's
Director, Derek Perera a former National Canadian cricketer is very excited to have the Canadian youngsters play with some high class schools such as St. Benedict's Colege, DS & St. Joseph's College, I believe that as part of our ongoing cricket development efforts in this part of the world, that experiences such as these in Sri Lanka are so important to raise our local standards.
The team is captained by Harkaran Mann and deputised by Akhil Kumar, both who have been in the Academy for many years and with great experience.
Former South African first class and IPL player Davy Jacobs and former Benedictine skipper and Mercantile player Vishan Fernando are the two coaches in the much awaited tour.
Fernando is optimistic about the team's chances, yet realistic in his expectations, we have some highly talented players who can compete internationally, however for some of the players, it will be a huge learning curve, especially coming out of a Canadian winter. The Canadian youngsters will be playing matches in Colombo, Galle and Negombo with 7 matches played among local schools.
The team is also scheduled to witness the Nidahas Trophy finals on the 18th to get a glimpse of International T20 Cricket.
The touring team will also have a chance of meeting some local Cricket Legends in the tour which will give them a handful to carry back to Canada.

Paddy production in Yala 2017 down 40 percent
An extensive decline in the total paddy production yielded for Yala season 2017 is shown in comparison to the same production in the previous Yala season, Department of Census and Statistics Director General Dr. A.J. Satharasinghe said in a press release.
The estimated value of total paddy production in Sri Lanka during Yala 2017 was 909,321 metric tons. The highest paddy production of 186,647 metric tons is reported from the Ampara district (21 percent of total paddy production). Polonnaruwa district reports a paddy production of 173,595 metric tons (19 percent) and Hambantota district 97,050 metric tons (11 percent).
However, when compared to paddy production in the prvious Yala season, the total paddy production in Yala season 2017 shows a substantial downward trend by 608,071 metric tons (40 percent). Drought is the possible reason for lower paddy production, which also led to paddy cultivation on a limited extent, lower average paddy yield than expected, and harvest losses in some districts.
Total extent of paddy cultivation for Yala season 2017 in Sri Lanka is estimated at 249,123 hectares, out of which 176,965 hectares (71 percent) was reported under major schemes, 42,537 hectares (17 percent) under minor schemes and 29,621 hectares under rain-fed schemes. The largest extent of paddy cultivated for this season is reported in the Ampara district (46,302 hectares), which is 19 percent of the total extent of paddy cultivation in the country.
Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa districts reported paddy cultivation of 40,882 hectares and 24,211 hectares respectively which is 16 percent and 10 percent of the total sown extent in Sri Lanka during this season. The gross extent harvested during Yala season 2017 in Sri Lanka is 236,479 hectares, which is 95 percent of the sown extent. Nuwara Eliya district, Udawalawa agricultural zone and Mannar district were identified as the districts which had harvested nearly the gross extent sown. These districts do not report any harvest losses. The minimum extent harvested from the gross extent sown is reported from the Puttalam district (40 percent).
The drought accounted for relatively high amount of harvest loss. The average paddy yield reported for Yala season 2017 is 4,291 kg per hectare and the highest average yield is reported from Udawalawa agricultural zone (5,770 kg per hectare).

Peace and reconciliation high on Govt's agenda
In a hard hitting statement Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said that the work of the Office of Missing Persons has been distorted and manipulated for political gain. The Minister criticising former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said: A cause that was once close to his heart is today a tool of power hungry politicians, including the likes of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was ironically a founder of the Mothers Front Movement. If the question of the missing still remains high on the agenda with the reported numbers of the missing rising each day, the question remains why it is no longer a cause worth fighting for, he asks.
The answer is sad and simple. Self-serving policies and party politics have taken precedence over the suffering families of those gone missing over the past 30 years.
For Mr. Rajapaksa in 1989, this cause was worth getting arrested for at the airport, while he carried documents with information regarding the missing to the UNHRC in Geneva, and today, the same movement has been portrayed by this camp as an attack on our War Heroes.
The Minister dismayed by the discourse states candidly that the voice that once spoke so passionately against these crimes suddenly started changing their tone. These same voices began switching camps so unexpectedly that lately many of the attacks on the OMP have been directed from the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself.
Clarifying the work of the OMP, Minister Samaraweera states that it is not a law-enforcement or judicial body.
Citing the Act, he states that the findings of the OMP shall not give rise to any criminal or civil liability.
He also refers to the myths surrounding the OMP stating that claims of it being a witch-hunt to prosecute the War Heroes is a blatant lie and that the OMP cannot prosecute perpetrators of violence.
These rumours are political manipulations to deter the fair and just actions taken by the government towards peace and reconciliation. The OMP gives the chance for renewed faith and hope for those who have lost their families and friends. It is not limited to an area or ethnicity but promises dignity and prosperity for all.
He cites stats by the international of the Red Cross which states that over 16,000 individuals have gone missing during the civil war. Of them, 5100 belonged to the armed forces.
These are the very same individuals who fought against the terror that the LTTE created. We as a nation, have a responsibility to find the Committee truth about where they are, and to bring an end to the agony faced by their families and loved ones.
He also emphasises that the OMPs work cuts across all ethnic and religious boundaries. That it seeks to investigate persons missing in connection with the conflict of the North and East and its aftermath. This includes those of all ethnicities; including the Armed Forces and police who have been identified as missing in action.
It will investigate into those gone missing during political unrest or civil disturbances in the south as well as victims of enforced disappearances island wide. The mandate of the OMP ensures that it will carry out searching and tracing of missing persons, clarifying the circumstances in which such persons went missing and their fate, making recommendations to relevant authorities in order to reduce incidents of missing and disappeared persons, and identifying proper avenues of redress available to the families of the missing persons and informing them of the same.

Police officers arrested for Valampuri racket
Three police officers, a Sub Inspector and two constables attached to the Hikkaduwa Police were arrested by Galle police led by ASP Sathis Gamage for allegedly possessing a Valampuri supposedly reportedly valued at billions of rupees belonging to four civilians, Galle police said.
As investigations in this regard has revealed that the Police Officers, having come to know of the conch belonging to four persons of Dompe and Akmeemana, had told them that they (Police Officers) were ready to buy the conch for Rs. 200 million and asked them to come to Hikkaduwa.
On the request, the owners of the conch had come to Hikkaduwa. Then the Police Officers had assaulted them and seized the Valampuri at Seenigama. The civilians had informed the police about the incident via 119 emergency number.
Galle ASP Sathis Gamage, who subsequently was informed about the incident, had called the duty Sub Inspector of Hikkaduwa police who had brought to the notice of the ASP about the Valampuri. ASP Gamage, who did not divulge him about the complaint against the Police Officers, had directed the SI and the two constables to come to Galle police with the conch convincing them that he would support their deal. Upon their arrival, ASP Gamage arrested the Sub Inspector and the other two police officers for their alleged attempt to own the conch misleading the owners on their arrival to the Galle police station.
Investigations are continuing.

## Title: Politically irrational
## Supertitle:

Politically irrational
Most of the leading politicians of all parties are obsessed with power. Such obsessions are due to different reasons. Such obsessions lead level heads necessary for sound judgement getting distorted towards irrational thinking. Because of their distorted and biased thinking, important decisions are taken in a manner that adversely affects the well-being of this countrys ordinary people far from the corridors of power. Most politicians on the national stage are those who have not had a wholesome education and even some of those who have neglected the growth and development of their own character. They have become narcissistic, vain and self-absorbed. So their mindset is one dimensional. That is why even in the present situation of the country, they prioritize the victory of their party at the next election rather than prioritize matters that relate to the lasting development of all people of the country. It is a national misfortune that such characters occupy niches in politics.
Peoples right to differ
Appointments to highly important positions in government such as to various ministries, the judiciary, law enforcement agencies, representation in foreign countries, public administration and home affairs, banking, investments, publicity and trade need to be made with circumspection and insight.
The quality of the education that many representative politicians elected to power is evidently so low that they seem to be congenitally incapable of making sound rational decisions dependent on proper judgements of matters relating to the decisions that need to be taken. Decisions at the highest levels of government have not only political and economic implications, there are also social and moral implications that also devolve on issues of reconciliation and peace. They do not think of social and moral implications unless they are compelled to do so by others. The Katunayake and Rathupaswela disasters, as well as the killing and disappearance of journalists such as Lasantha Wickrematunge and Ekneligoda and the assassination of the ruggerite Thajudeen, are results of this type of self-absorbed thinking. Then government wanted to assert its power rather than heeding the basic needs and rights of the people and the peoples right to differ from the governments point of view.
High office to qualified people
Public debates are going on some of the other matters of great interest to the people such as the trillions of rupees of debt incurred, the Mattala airport, Hambantota harbour, Uma Oya, buying of military aircrafts and warships, sitting of armouries, of the last government and the bond issue, interference with criminal investigations and even training and appointment of school principals and teachers.
There are many other issues in which the rights of the people and the common good are blatantly disregarded by powerful politicians who show themselves to be nothing but ministerial blockheads.
By being elected on a party ticket or by being appointed by a political power holder doesnt endow them with the necessary intelligence to make rational and just decisions on highly important matters. They are not only divided between the party and opportunistic ideological lines but also on racial, religious-cultural, caste and clannish prejudices that they have inherited and unthinkingly continue. Therefore, it is very important that only well attested and duly qualified people free from racial, religious and caste, ideological bias should be appointed to hold any of the most important positions of government and administration in any sector and to counsel those in positions of power.
Corruption leads to irrationality
When elected politicians take decisions, they should not go by their feelings and hunches which they often do; they should base their decisions on proper assessments and judgements. Proper judgements could be had only after consulting the most suitable persons qualified to make such good evaluation of the relevant data pertinent to the matter under consideration.
When politicians make judgements about complex financial and economic matters without availing themselves of the good counsel of experts in the field, politicians not only make a mess of things, they also create a mess for the country and the people. Thereafter they create a mess out of clearing the mess created by the former rulers because all of them together not only have dirtied their hands, they also have corrupt hearts and scheming and self-absorbed minds that distort their judgements and make their decisions irrational.
Political polarization and throwing shallow challenges, a product of superficial rather than objective and critical thinking on important matters seem to be the order of the day. Most leading politicians are playing to the gallery, making also foolish promises, just for the sake of garnering votes. At this task, they are often clever. They do not strive at the harder task of explaining serious issues the country is facing and educating the people to understand them and getting their support to solve them. Promoting oneself through a narrow party policy rather than promoting the good of the country and its entire people is at the base of the thinking of most politicians.
Politicians, reform yourselves!
The parties in power wish to save the people promising to provide what is necessary for a good life. An economic crisis is looming ahead as a result of a massive debt which has to be settled. The debt incurred as a result of prioritizing projects that have turned out to be white elephants and through the corruption of their kith and kin and theirs phoning off commissions and banking them in hidden secret accounts abroad. The party aspiring to power has no clue either as to how they are going to settle the debts. Their rationality is at the lowest possible ebb. Their appeal is to populism. They will be more than content to enjoy the plums of political power and luxuries of affluent life presently even while they incur more debts to settle the present debts and landing the country in a vicious debt circle darkening the lives of future generations.
These politicians do not like reforming their ways. They are envious even of those who successfully serve the country largely independent of politicians political patronage. Envy and suspicion always distort reasoning and lead to bad decisions. Ever since Independence, this is what has been happening due to the short-sightedness of scheming politicians, well set in their mould of a tunnel vision and indulging in irrational thinking.
What we are seeing today is a bunch of uneducated, crooked politicians disagreeing among themselves as to how to divide and eat the cake and still have it. They have together landed this country into this tragic situation. Corrupt as they are, they all want to blame someone else and wash their hands off while preserving their dirty character. The people are faced with a choice between two evils. They need to be wise enough to choose the lesser evil between the discarded corrupt rogues and there formable who should be amenable to the voice of the people and are able to discard the rogues among them.

Roma end Napolis 10-win streak to throw Serie A title race wide open
ROME, Saturday : Napolis 10-match winning streak in Serie A came to an end on Saturday when they slumped to a shock 4-2 home defeat to AS Roma as the leaders suffered just their second league loss this season.
The result kept Napoli on top of the table but their lead is now just one point after Juventus earlier defeated Lazio courtesy of an injury-time strike from Paulo Dybala.
Juventus, crucially, also have a game in hand -- at home against Atalanta in 10 days time.
There were a lot of positives in this game, insisted Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri whose only other league loss this season had been at home to Juventus in December.
We had 27 shots so we are just trying to figure out how Roma scored so easily. We are sorry for our great crowd but the tifosi know that we always give our maximum.
When Lorenzo Insigne gave Napoli the lead from close range after six minutes it seemed the evening would be straightforward.
But Turkeys Cengiz Under levelled just a minute later with a deflected shot.
That set the stage for Edin Dzeko to carve out a little bit of personal history.
He made it 2-1 in the 26th minute with a header from an Alessandro Florenzi cross before he curled in a terrific left-foot strike from the edge of the area in the 79th minute for 3-1.
That goal allowed the Bosnian striker to become the first player to score at least 50 goals in three of Europes major leagues -- Italys Serie A, the German Bundesliga and the Premier League in England.
Diego Perotti made it 4-1 ten minutes from time after pouncing on a lazy clearance from on-loan Roma left-back Mario Rui.
Dries Mertens pulled one back for Napoli in time added-on but the three points allowed Roma to move into third place in the table, albeit 16 points behind the pacesetters.
Argentina striker Dybala marked his comeback after a month on the sidelines by scoring a last-gasp winner in Juves 1-0 victory at Lazio in a perfect boost ahead of next weeks Champions League clash at Tottenham.
Dybala, left out of the Argentine squad this week, shrugged off his rustiness by pouncing in the third minute of injury time.
Lazio, now down in fourth spot in the table, a point back from Roma, had already defeated Juventus twice this season in the Italian Super Cup and Serie A.
They looked to be hanging on for a point until Dybala, out for a month with a thigh injury, scored a memorable goal when he held off a Marco Parolo challenge before driving the ball past Thomas Strakosha in the Lazio goal.
Juventus will now travel to London for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 clash after a 2-2 draw in Turin in February.
I didnt know if I was meant to play 90 minutes, as it was my first start and we have a big game on Wednesday, Dybala told Sky Sports Italia.  AFP

Rosy to make Colombo smart, efficient
The recently concluded Local Government Elections delivered a massive victory to the United National Party (UNP) in Colombo, and as a result UNP Mayor-elect Rosy Senanayake will become the first female Mayor of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC).
In an interview with the Daily News, Senanayake explained her comprehensive plans to turn Colombo into a smart and efficient city.
In the meantime Senanayake, speaking about the current political situation, urged the government, all political parties and citizens of Sri Lanka to recognize that the way forward was to work for the betterment of the country.
Following are the excerpts of the interview:
Q: How do you take the criticisms that are being levelled against the government
A: I was so engrossed with the elections. We began campaigning long before the nominations were given. It was a tedious and gruelling experience to arrange a campaign and contest at the election. Our attention was fully on winning the election. We succeeded in that and the UNP won comfortably in Colombo. It was massive victory, which we have never had in the last 17 years.
This time, when compared to the last local elections, the UNP has done brilliantly around the country. For, in 2011 we lost practically every institution except for the Colombo Municipality, which is our stronghold. The Colombo Municipal Council is undefeatable.
But we have done very well in other parts of the country and our percentage has gone up in most councils. And we will also be able to form most councils together with the SLFP and UPFA. I am glad that we have done better.
Q: What is your personal opinion about the current political situation
Pictures by Sarath Peiris
A: In spite of the UNP winning comfortably in most parts of the country and doing better than in the 2011 elections, some people are trying to spin their defeat on us. This was also the hype created by some media institutions. I felt that this was thoroughly unnecessary, because you should not compare national politics with local politics. Local politics gives you a good understanding of the prevailing situation and the mindset of the people.
It can also be a warning to up your game and fulfil your promises. But you do not take drastic measures and destabilize the government or make utterances that would destabilize the central government because of it. It was just a waste of two weeks.
It was a clear plan to spin it on the UNP and say that we have done badly in the past three years. The whole country was very upset and then there was a debate; people made remarks to destabilize the government for petty political or personal gain. I am saddened to see how certain people are making it an issue.
I am glad that everything is said and done and over. I would like to see the central government move forward to fulfil the promises that have been given to the people.
Q: So you take this whole change in the Cabinet and elsewhere in a positive manner
A: All this talk about instability in the government has gone away. These things are only for two weeks. I take it in a very positive way and the election results were a signal to say that the government could have done things better. Fulfilling the promises, thats where we failed.
I realized it very clearly when I went from house to house. Many people were trying to abstain from voting and finally agreed to vote because of me; it was a lot of hard work convincing them. This was because the government failed to fulfil the major promises it gave in 2015. That gave me the knowledge that people were unhappy about the progress we have made so far. There were also other issues like corruption. It had an impact.
It is not easy for a government to come in and deal with so many issues. So the Prime Minister had a tough task in sorting out all the problems and finding solutions. It takes time and people sometimes expect things to happen overnight. I must also say that fertilizer and cost of living also had a huge bearing. It was a good lesson for us to know the expectations of the public.
I am hoping there will be a positive change. One can live in hope that things will be better. I strongly believe in the President and the Prime Minister - that they will deliver.
Q: Do you not think that confusion in national politics would have an impact on the progress of local government bodies
A: I am not so sure if it has such an impact. If you take the Colombo Municipality, the council serves people on their day-to-day needs - from garbage disposal, street lighting, health issues and beautification of the city to environmental issues and hygiene.
Under the theme Ape Colombo, we have initiated a 10-year development plan for Colombo. Physical development with regard to sewage disposal - which would engage in an enormous amount of finance. And we need to do it together with the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development - in line with the ministries and agencies of the central government.
When talking about 50,000 houses for underserved settlements in Colombo, these projects will be undertaken either through public- private partnerships or with the central government.
So the central government needs to fulfil some of their commitments and they need the local governments support and the local government needs the support of central government to tap into major projects.
Q: There is a view that since the previous regime, all maintenance and development activities in Colombo have been stalled and not maintained properly. How do you see those allegations
A: It is not only about the maintenance and condition of the roads. Its all about beautification of the city. After Meethotamulla occurred and the municipality had no place to dump garbage. Thats when this came about.
If people are talking about how beautiful the city was under the former government, I would like to say that I am also for beautification. But you do not beautify a city at the cost of people having to lay their lives down for it. The then government did not understand that garbage was an important factor. They totally forgot that garbage has different functions that you can put to use.
Just to make Colombo beautiful, they went and dumped the garbage in Meethotamulla and used their power to do everything they wanted. Then we faced the major disaster. And the present government has to face the consequences.
There were absolutely no future plans for garbage and other projects. We have got the ball rolling. We educated the public on garbage segregation and everyone knows how it works now.
Our intention is not to superficially beautify Colombo, but to bring a lasting and sustainable solution to the issues which the previous government failed to do.
Q: What do you think of the significance of being appointed as the first female mayor
A: More than my being the first female mayor, I am very excited about the 25 percent quota for females. We have created history in bringing in 25 percent of women to the political arena even though it is at the local council level. So I am hoping to see this at the provincial and the national level. This is historic because there were more than 25 percent nominees in the list and now it is a matter of getting the 25 percent women into the councils. And I do not see any reason as to why this delay and debate on whether or not to implement the quota exists. Because the Act is very clear about 25 percent women.
I must say Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya acted in good faith when he called for nominations. But now I do not understand what the stumbling block in implementing it is. These women on the list worked at the grassroots to make those ward members win.
The Elections Commissioner has the right to instruct the party leaders to appoint women. The party is reluctant to agree with the quota and they want to bring in their defeated men into councils.
One thing we have to understand is, these 8,700 new people are going into councils and the 25 percent quota was placed to accommodate the women. The reason why there is 40 percent on the list is to accommodate 25 percent women. Otherwise the composition would have been different.
So are we going to fill those 25 percent with men No, that can never happen. I am totally against it and I have written to the Elections Commission as well. The women also should stand up for their rights. They should not just let this go.
Q: You won the Provincial Councils elections and then the Parliamentary elections and now the CMC. How do you feel about it
A: I am yet to go to the Council. It is not about where you are, as long as you are serving the people. I know for a fact that the CMC is not like being in Parliament. This is a huge responsibility. This is dealing with the financial capital of the country.
I will have to deal with 1.2 million people on a daily basis. It is like a mini government with a budget of Rs 15 billion. Keeping the city beautiful, safe, clean, efficient and smart is our goal.
We also plan to streamline all the apartments and give better facilities to residents; digitizing the functions and making the services easier and smart is our goal.
Q: What are your immediate initiatives as mayor of Colombo
A: We have taken a few steps. We have offered a 10-year development plan. Colombo has developed well, but it also needs to be maintained well. Condominiums and buildings have mushroomed everywhere. In the meantime, the population is also increasing. The water pipes and sewage are archaic and need to be changed.
There are major projects similar to that and it will be done with the central government. It will be done in different phases. Housing plans also have been made. In the past 25 years, since the demise of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, no proper housing projects were implemented in the country. People living under the Colombo Municipality have problems regarding sanitation, clean drinking water, housing and toilet facilities; we need to improve all of that. There are some projects that we can start straight away like community centres and digitizing services.

## Title: Rule of law, key to Democratic Governance

Rule of law, key to Democratic Governance
The expression the Rule of Law is often referred to when democratic liberties are discussed. The rule of law not merely requires that a government should act according to law, but also that the body of law in existence in a country should be in accordance with certain minimum standards of equity, justice and good conscience. For the citizen, the rule of law is both prescriptive  dictating the conduct required by law  and proactive of citizens  demanding that government acts according to law. The rule of law underlies the entire constitution and in one sense all constitutional law is concerned with the rule of law. The rule of law cannot be viewed in isolation from the political society.
As the notion of rule of law is dependent on upon the political foundations of a state, so too, it is dependent according to the approach adopted to the concept upon a nations economic resources.
The narrow interpretation of the rule of law insists simply on a citizens compliance with the rule of law. However, if the rule of law implies more than mere regulation by law and is elevated to a theory guaranteeing freedom from hunger and homelessness and entitlement to a basic decent standard of life, then economic conditions are of paramount importance to conformity with the rule of law. Such an approach is adopted by the International Commission of Jurists which in the New Delhi Declaration of 1959 included alongside traditional civil and political rights, the realization of social, economic, cultural and educational standards under which the individual could enjoy a fuller life within the ambit of the rule of law. A legal system is viewed as just and in conformity with the rule of law if it exhibits both these features and an absence of discretionary rules or practice.
The rule of law has its well known exposition in the work of the influential British Constitutional lawyer A.V. Dicey, who in 1885, published his Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution. His formulation of the rule of the law, thought not accepted without reservation today, is a useful starting point for a discussion of this concept. Dicey emphasized three aspects of the rule of law: (i) no one can be punished or made to suffer except for a breach of law proved in an ordinary court, (ii) no one is above the law and everyone is equal before the law regardless of social, economic or political status and (iii) the rule of law includes the results of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons. Despite narrow conception by Dicey impeding its growth in some cases, Indian cases stand as pioneering examples of what an imaginative court could do with this notion.
Judicial review
The rule of law has provided one of the main conceptual bases for administrative law in most Commonwealth countries. Judicial review is the means by which administrative authorities with rule making and administrative powers are confined by the courts within the powers granted to them by Parliament. It is for a court to determine whether the body in question has acted intra vires or ultra vires. (that is inside or outside its powers). Judicial review represents a means by which the sovereignty of Parliament is upheld and the rule of law applied.
In the United Kingdom Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for Civil Service, the House of Lords identified the categories of the decisions which could be immune from judicial review and the list is not exhaustive: they are the making of treaties, the dissolution of Parliament the appointment of Ministers, declarations of war and peace and matters relating to granting of honours. What unites these categories is the fact that each involves matters of high policy which is most appropriately determined in the eyes of the judiciary not by the courts but by the executive. Where this applies it may be said that the rule of law is undermined by respect for the doctrine of separation of powers: an ironic consequence. The doctrine of judicial review nevertheless represents a bedrock for the application of the rule of law, keeping those with law making and discretionary powers within the law.
Legal process
For the rule of law to be respected and applied the legal process  civil and criminal - must exhibit certain features. These features may be categorized as accessibility and procedural fairness. In terms of accessibility the law must be accessible to all if rights are to be enforced. Accordingly, there must not only exist a system of courts available locally but the cost of having recourse to the courts must be such that there is real access to the courts. For the law to be attainable, adequate legal advice and assistance must be provided at a cost affordable by all. With regard to procedural fairness, justice and the rule of law demand that in the conduct of legal proceedings, procedural fairness be observed. Subsumed within this requirement are many subsidiary conditions.
Rule of law in international dimension
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations adopted in 1948 declares that: It is essential if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression that human rights should be protected by the rule of law. The European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1950) also recognizes the concept of the rule of law. On an international level the rule of law is also advanced by the International Commission of Jurists which strives to uphold and improve the rule of law within the legal systems of its members. The Declaration of Delhi 1959 recognized that: the rule of law is a dynamic concept for the expansion and fulfillment of which jurists are primarily responsible and which should be employed not only to safeguard and advance the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society, but also to establish social, economic, educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspiration and dignity may be realized.
Rule of law and India
In S. P. Guptha v Union of India (1982) nine Judges of the Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of a public interest suit filed by certain lawyers as a writ petition. In this judgment, Bhagawathi J., stated: If there is one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Indian Constitution, it is the principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it is the judiciary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the law and thereby making the rule of law meaningful and effective. It is to aid the judiciary in this task that the power of judicial review has been conferred upon the judiciary.
Rule of law and United States
An important aspect of the rule of law in its application to the United States is the concept of due process. The fifth Amendment (1791) provides that no person shall be deprived in any criminal case of life, liberty or property without due process of law and the 14th Amendment (1868), that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The due process clause of the 5th Amendment was thought to have been descended from the Latin phrase per legem terrae (according to the law of the land), in Clause 39 of Magna Carta. (1215). Around due process has turned the discussion of many of the basic liberties of the American citizen, and many of the protections which in England would be derived from the general concept of the rule of law are in the United States direct results of the interpretation of due process. Fair trial, freedom from search and seizure, freedom from self-incrimination and coerced confessions, right to counsel, equal treatment before the law  all these and many more facets of the rule of law reach American citizens through the due process clauses.

During the span of more than six and a half decades both schools have established records from time to time. It is a very rare incident that father and two sons playing n a big match series.
Julian Mendis, Gerald Mendis and Duleep Mendis of St. Sebastian's became the first father and two sons to represent their alma mater. Duleep captained his school in 1968 and went on to lead Sri Lanka in Tests and one day Internationals. Then another Sebastanite Hector Silva and two of his sons Vivil Silva and Theresius Silva played in the big matches.
These two records were broken by three Cambrians this year. Nishantha Peiris was the vice captain to Vikum Halwatura in the 1985 Big Match while his eldest son Nuwantha Peiris captained the school in the Big Match in 2010 and this year the youngest son fourth year coloursman and an allrounder Savindu Peiris is captaining Prince of Wales College.
It will go to the records of Big Match series of Cambrians and Sebastanites that the first trio, the father being the vice captain and two sons captaining their college.
The limited over matches commenced between these two colleges in 1981. Julian, Gerald and Duleep and Hector did not play but Vivil and Theresius played.
In this instance it will be another record that Nishantha, Nuwantha and Savindu having played for their college and Nuwantha and Savindu leading their school.

SC dismisses FR petition filed by HIV diagnosed person
A Fundamental Rights petition filed by a person who wishes to keep his HIV status undisclosed to the public, was dismissed by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court held that the petitioner failed to prove the allegation that SriLankan Airlines did not offer him employment on the basis that he was a HIV positive person.
Attorney Kamani Madhya Jinadasa on behalf of the victim (X) filed this petition seeking an order directing Sri Lankan Airlines to re-instate him as a cabin crew member at the Airlines since his employment was terminated after the company found he was HIV-positive.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Nalin Perera dismissed the petition and held that SriLankan Airlines cannot be found fault with when it withdrew the victims contract of employment on the basis that the victim petitioner had provided false information.
The petitioner cited Sri Lankan Airlines Group Medical Officer Dr. Anoma Jayasinghe, Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary Nihal Somaweera, National STD/AIDS Control Programme Director Dr. Sisira Liyanage and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The Supreme Court observed that the petitioner in his petition admits that he became aware that he is a HIV positive person in 2013. Therefore, when he declared on October 10, 2016 in the medical form to Sri Lankan Airlines, that he did not have any sexual transmitted disease, his declaration was false.
Citizen X in 2013 knew that he was a HIV positive person but did not disclose it in 2016 at least in a confidential manner that he is a HIV first positive person. But when the first respondent after medical test discovered that Citizen X is a HIV positive person, he wanted protection provided in National Policy of HIV and AIDS in the World of Work in Sri Lanka. When I consider the above matters, I feel that Citizen X is blowing hot and cold. Such a person is not entitled to get relief from court, Justice Abrew observed.
The petitioner stated that in 2010 he made an application to Mihin Lanka and joined the in-flight cabin staff as a steward and continued to serve in the said airline, receiving appreciations for his services and as at August 2016, he was a confirmed employee of Mihin Lanka.
During his employment with Mihin Lanka he was diagnosed as being HIV positive at a voluntary testing done in 2013.
The petitioner stated that since Mihin Lanka did not require disclosure of HIV status and since he was under no obligation to disclose his HIV status to Mihin Lanka, his HIV status was not disclosed.
He said that in June 2016, it was announced by the government that Mihin Lanka would cease operations and would be amalgamated with SriLankan Airlines.
He stated that the staff of Mihin Lanka were advised that operations of Mihin Lanka would be wound up by December 30 2016, and were advised to seek alternative employment including in the SriLankan Airlines.
He stated that to the best of his knowledge, the entire staff of Mihin Lanka were given the opportunity to apply for employment with Sri Lankan Airlines.
He stated that on September 27 2016, he was called for an interview for the post of cabin crew member with SriLankan Airlines. He stated that he faced the said interview and was selected and thereafter was required report to the medical centre of Sri Lankan Airlines for basic assessment including height, weight, and eyesight.
The petitioner stated that during the said basic medical assessment he was required to fill a standard from which required him to disclose inter alia whether the applicat is the carrier of any sexually transmitted infection (STI).
The petitioner stated that he was well aware that the National Policy on HIV and AIDS in the World of Work in Sri Lanka contained policies which inter alia declared that HIV screening is not required for purposes of employment and confidentiality of his HIV status made it non-obligatory to disclose his HIV status in the said health form.

'The Shape of Water' wins, as Oscars tackle the serious without losing the fun

"The Shape of Water" floated to the top as best picture at the 90th annualAcademy Awards, bringing a suspenseful close to an awards season punctuated by the sexual-harassment scandals that have roiled Hollywood.
The Oscars are a big, unwieldy beast, which invariably try to serve too many masters. Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year's awards, host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded.
Aside from best picture, the awards both spread the wealth among a number of films and mostly followed the anticipated script, with few major surprises among the highest-profile categories. The show also managed to deal with serious issues -- from Time's Up to diversity and inclusion -- without sacrificing a sense of fun and irreverence.
Last year, the two-month awards process was dominated by the collective response to the newly minted Trump administration. While politics played a significant part in Sunday's telecast, there was also the matter of the #MeToo movement, as the entertainment industry still seeks to get its own house in order.
Kimmel addressed the #MeToo movement and Time's Up campaign head-on in his opening monologue, which mocked various targets -- including, inevitably, the Trump White House -- with a light, clever touch.
Indeed, while Kimmel might have become a more polarizing figure with his entry into the healthcare and gun-control debates, he again brought a genial persona to the emcee role, one that somewhat leavened the seriousness and bouts of pretentiousness that can drip into the ceremony.
Toward that end, Kimmel not only joked about the show's length but offered a jet ski as an incentive to whoever gave the shortest speech. (This being the Oscars -- a career milestone for honorees -- the sentiment is admirable, but they might need a bigger boat.)
The host also again enlisted ordinary people into the act -- this time taking a group of stars to surprise the audience in a nearby theater. As with last year's similar stunt, the idea was better than the execution, but it did give the show a welcome and refreshing jolt of energy.
In terms of politics, Kimmel extended an endorsement to the planned march for gun control being organized by students impacted by the Parkland school shooting. When the documentary "Icarus," about a Russian whistleblower, won, he deadpanned, "Now we know at least [Vladimir] Putin didn't rig this competition."
The audience also loudly cheered acknowledgment of the Dreamers, those youths brought to America without legal documentation; "Coco," the animated feature, whose producers gave thanks to Mexico, where the story takes place; and Common's passionate rap, which took President Trump to task on multiple fronts. Director Guillermo del Toro also spoke of the power of film to tear down walls, not erect them.
The issue of sexual harassment was given powerful voice by several actresses who have publicly spoken out about disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, allegations that, because of his outsized role, cast a shadow over awards season. Ashley Judd cited "a mighty chorus that is finally saying Time's Up." Frances McDormand also used her speech to deliver a message of female empowerment, having all the women nominees stand -- a symbolic gesture if there ever was one.
For an event like the Oscars, avoiding major snafus is always part of the challenge, especially after last year's envelope mix-up. Bringing back Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as presenters nicely added closure to that farcical finale.
There were, admittedly, an over-abundance of clip packages, although given the 90th-anniversary milestone, that was hardly a surprise.
The producers also provided the requisite mix of old and new, featuring the stars of superhero fare like "Black Panther" and "Wonder Woman" while giving nostalgic nods to Eva Marie Saint, Rita Moreno and Jane Fonda. Throw in screenplay winner James Ivory, 89, and for an industry that prize's youth, it was an inordinately good night for octogenarians.
While the best-picture balloting kept Oscar watchers guessing, the acting nominations went according to form, including lead actors McDormand and Gary Oldman, and supporting honors for Sam Rockwell and Allison Janney.
The Oscars are still absorbing the impact of the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, the hash tag created a few years ago in response to the absence of people of color among nominees. Since then, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has expanded its membership by roughly 20% and inducted more women and people of color, new blood that might have had an impact on the awards, producer more openness to genres that have usually been overlooked in the past.
Notably, sexual-harassment claims also bled into the pre-show coverage, with the E! network featuring Ryan Seacrest emceeing its red-carpet arrivals despiteallegations against himby a former wardrobe stylist, which the host has denied.
