Lest We Forget
War Pilgrimage: Gallery of Memorials
The painterly blue of the infamous Elephant Pass sky, emboldened with the raffish whites of the flagellating mushroom clouds, augur a fragile truce with the larger than life war monument below, penetrating the aerosphere. It is a muddy bronze country, the shape of Sri Lanka, a teardrop cloaked in the idiom of conquest and ideology atop a three tiered green atoll. The first tier being occupied by the four mute lions doing their solitary penance in dogmatic poise while the second tier has the sombre embrace of the open petals of four lotuses harking back to the country's great kings and the third tier with hands upholding this structure of pride.
Multifarious war memorials
Adding to the monotonous prosody of pathos is another monument further along with its splintered wall shattered by the golden bullet piercing its grey epidermis and the lively vigil of the two soldiers hovering about on one side.
The elephant has truly come to pass. These are just glimpses of the multifarious war memorials stretching across the blitzed entirety of Elephant Pass only a short drive from the hustle and bustle of Jaffna town and yet a life time away from the civilised world.
From wall sculptures showing members of the army, full of brazen machismo in jubilation with all their accumulated braggadocio on display, to wall etchings with darker overtones and undertones, like the one of prancing and stealthily skulking soldiers with their guns pointed like bayonets and muskets at a bloated hag and a burling hulk of a woman, her skull dressed with a magistrate's wig, holding a soldier's hand and a mother clutching her child tightly to her breast while a wounded man is being carried on a stretcher to his grave.
Proceed to the spikey, barbed wire riddled war machines, lying sloth like in permanent hibernation, sitting next to weather-beaten camouflage jeeps, which are alleged to have carried senior high ranking terrorist officials, but now a heap of rusting bicycle wheels with spokes and the odd flower pot signifying the white romance that is war, at least for some.
There are several tributes to fallen heroes whose legendary bad luck is immortalised on billboards and hoardings while dame victory chooses its victors out of the usual suspects, conveniently forgetting history, something made very evident by the plaque that piques with its omission of certain general names - an honest mistake one supposes.
"The Road to Elephant Pass is indeed a place that incurs in the viewer a series of visitations in the form of futile philosophical questions all revolving around that much maligned three-letter word - war, Asia's longest one at three decades."
If one does indeed think of wandering off the beaten path let it be a reminder that a humanitarian demining project is still underway in Elephant Pass and all along the roads that until 2009 were the scene of horrific fighting.
The signs, eerily symbolized by the familiar skull and cross bones set against blood red, prove that the war's roots run deep and peace is certainly not to be found in this topsoil.
After all when does a landmine know a war is over And with the heavy rains moving them from one place to the next it is a never-ending job for the demining crews and the danger for farmers or people returning to their land is not to be underestimated.
Resort of negation
A cantankerous plateau once filled with the epochal dead lying in civility sharing their mass graves - now a site of war tourism filled with happy chatty peacetime tourists whose only war is fashion. War is indeed a fashion - a resort of negation.
Like the concentration camps in Germany, the Cuchi tunnels in Vietnam, it is clear that Elephant Pass, Mullaitivu and Killinochichi will join the ranks of war tourist attractions that bring millions of people to places where crimes against humanity are never really brought to trial.
Here, war artists have made their mark in bronze on the landscape and soldiers recount the terrifying last days against a drum roll and the Sri Lankan flag is raised on arrival. Amzar my youngest asked "why are they shooting at a mother and child"
And it is this and many other questions that will be asked as the people of the area rebuild their homes and tourists turn up by the bus load to explore this extraordinary lunar like landscape, with its gallery of memorials scattered across an area, where elephants once roamed, until they too were obliterated in their thousands, and where life was once rich in every sense of the word.
How to find them: Great place to base yourself and do trips to see Elephant Pass and the war memorials call Expo Pavillon Margota on 0217390490 or 077 2348888 or email: [emailprotected].

Local govt polls most probably in March
Local government elections will most probably be held as scheduled next March as there is no reason to postpone the polls, Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He said the delimitation report was handed over to the President by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The minister said since there are some suggestions, he appointed a committee to look into these suggestions.
"The committee consisting of five members will decide whether there should be a new delimitation. If there will be such a delimitation, a new gazette notification will be issued to make the public aware. The five committee members will represent all parties in Parliament. However, the Local Government election will probably be held in March as scheduled," Musthapha said.

Microorganisms, Food poisoning and You
The current food trend of most of the people is to buy pre-prepared ready-to eat convenience foods and dine out in restaurants and cafes and there is a growing demand for foods of animal origin. Though it gives many new choices to busy life styles, now it has possibly create a greater risk of food poisoning.
Food Poisoning is a general term used to describe illness caused by all types of food-borne microorganisms. Food poisoning and food infection are different, although the symptoms are similar. Food Infection is caused by eating foods containing certain type of live bacteria. Once the contaminated food is consumed, the bacteria themselves continue to grow, usually in the intestine and illness can result.
To prevent such illnesses, understanding about the bacteria that cause food poisoning is essential.
Food poisoning is of two types. Food intoxication is caused by eating food that contains a toxin or poison due to bacterial growth in the food. The bacteria that produced and excreted the toxic waste products to the food may be killed, but the toxin that they produced remains on the food causing the illness or digestive upset to occur. Toxin-mediated infection is caused by consuming food contaminated by organisms that produce toxins only after they have been ingested into the body.
There are lot of microorganisms associated with food poisoning. Staphylococcus aureus produces a heat stable toxin which grow for several hours in foods such as chicken pot pie or cream filling. The growth of Clostridium botulinum and production of its toxin is effected by the Ph of the canned food. All fruits, vegetables and meats carry this microorganism, but because of their acidic nature, fruits will not permit its growth. Meats and most vegetables are not acid foods and will support its growth. Clostridium perfringens grows in warm food like beef and produces toxins. It also causes a food infection by continuing to grow and producing toxins in the intestinal track. Camphylobacter jejuni is a bacteria causes Campylobacteriosis is commonly found in the intestinal tracts of healthy animals (especially chickens) and in untreated surface water. Bacteria called Salmonella causes food infection Salmonellosis when foods containing bacteria are consumed. Though Escherichia coli live peacefully in the gut, helping keep the growth of more harmful microorganisms, one of its strain causes a distinctive and sometimes deadly diseases.
Food poisoning microorganisms are often present naturally in food but usually only in small numbers. However, if the appropriate conditions are given, their numbers can be increased very rapidly. This is where the food poisoning becomes a problem. In order for an outbreak of food borne disease to occur certain conditions must exist.
The microorganisms or its toxin must be present in the food and it should suitable for the organisms growth. The conditions of warmth, moisture and pH must be suitable for the orgnaisms growth. Sufficient time must be given for the organism to grow and multiply. There must be enough of the microorganisms or their toxin present to cause illness. Food must be consumed. So it is vitally important that we do not given these bacteria the right living environment where they can grow and multiply quickly. Then only the food poisoning can be avoided.
Bacteria grow on and in some types of food such as meat, dairy products including milk, cheese, yoghurt and prepared salads, cooked pasta and cut fruit salads more easily than others. Other than that any food type which provides a suitable habitat for microorganisms can easily get effected.
If a person eats food contaminated by pathogenic bacteria, it may lead to extreme illness (possibly even death), acute vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, and stomach cramps. Different levels of sickness may be caused by pathognic bacteria depending upon the type and number of pathogenic bacteria present and the risk type of person (high-risk people include the unwell, young, old and pregnant mothers).
Food may be contaminated due to poor handling, storage and poor personal hygiene by those preparing and serving food. As food poisoning bacteria are everywhere in the soil, in water, on animals and people and on the things people touch and use, it is possible for many foods to contain or be contaminated with these bacteria from the start. Even if food is free of these bacteria, it can still be contaminated during food storage and food preparation. So that good peronal hygiene practices, proper handling and storage of food before and after preparation and keeping foods at temperatures that inhibits the growth of bacteria can also be effective.

Paranagama report more serious than UN Report - Rajitha
If the Paranagama Report was released before passing the Geneva Resolution, the resolution could have been much more negative than the current one. The Paranagama report is much more serious than the UN Report, Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing at the Government Information Department Auditorium, Colombo yesterday, he said the Paranagama report states that the judiciary system of Sri Lanka is very weak and this factor can be accepted as a reason to obtain the support of foreign experts.
It as the former President who appointed three foreign experts to the Paranagama Commission, Dr. Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the Paranagama Report clearly states incidents such as White Flags, Channel 4, Isipriya murder, Charles murder etc should be investigated.
"But the Geneva Resolution has not named anything specific. The 20th section of the Resolution very clearly says everything will be done with the consent of the Sri Lankan government and only with the agreement of the Sri Lankan Government. Therefore there is no reason to worry. If Sri Lanka does not agree, nothing can be done."
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the resolution totally accepts the sovereignty and unitary status of Sri Lanka.
The Geneva Resolution has mentioned nothing about land and police powers in the 13th Amendment. It only requests the government to assist Provincial Councils to operate actively under the 13th Amendment. It is Sri Lanka which decides what to do and how to do it. The UN has expressed its satisfaction about the progress made by Sri Lanka on January 8, August 17 and thereafter, he said.

[Parliament]-23.10.2015
The domestic mechanism to probe human rights violations will subject to Parliament approval, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment debate, the minister observed only the hardliners of both sides reject the UNHRC Resolution adopted at the recently concluded sessions.
He urged the MPs not to seek political mileage by using the Resolution as a political slogan, adding that the country is at a critical juncture at the moment. He noted the decisions taken today would affect the future of the country and the national unity.
"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi and the Tamil Net website have rejected the Resolution stating it is advantageous for the Sri Lankan government. They have rejected the Resolution. Some sections in this House too ask to reject the Resolution. It is seen all of them are on the same page with regard to the Resolution," he observed.
"The Resolutions which followed that in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were consequences of not implementing the promises made in 2009. However, we have got another chance now and we must make use of it. Sri Lanka is a Multi-ethnic and multi-religious country. The rights of all groups must be protected to prosper reconciliation. The President is undertaking this task with the consultation of all political parties. Therefore there is nothing to agitate about this process," he noted.
He also pointed out that the Presidential Commission reports must be presented in Parliament to make the reports content available for the public.
Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said political consensus is essential to move towards long lasting peace and reconciliation.
He further said the duty of crafting a domestic mechanism is upon Parliament, adding that any such mechanism should give priority for truth seeking. He observed the special court must come under the judicial system of the country. Ranawaka said the confidence on the judicial system has collapsed and observed independent judiciary must be rebuilt.
The minister reiterated the healed wounds of the past should not be examined as it would impact negatively on the existing peace and reconciliation. JVP MP Vijitha Herath taking part in the debate criticised the government for agreeing to co-sponsor the US backed resolution stating it affects negatively to the country's sovereignty. "What the US has is a strategic motive and it has no genuine concern for the national unity of Sri Lanka. The US need not intervene in the constitutional matters of our country. However, the resolution has referred to the 13th Amendment and devolution of power.
The government should make sure that the real victims of war are meted out justice by the steps initiated," he said.
Ranawaka said the joint statement signed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and UN Secretary General Ban ki Moon in 2009 marked the beginning of the problem and added some politically bankrupt elements are trying to use the UNHRC resolution for their survival.
"Prof. G. L. Peiris was a key figure behind the devolution package in 2000 which risked the country's security. He was also referred a 'Package Pappa'.
"Now he is talking of protecting the motherland by assuming positions in the new Movements. He played a role in signing various international agreements containing harmful clauses to Sri Lanka.
He should be responsible to the existing problem," he said.
The minister said former government led by Mahinda Rajapaksa obtained the support of international representatives to the Paranagama and Udalagama Commissions.
"British National, Desmond Silva is still paid 55,000 pounds per month. However, the reports compiled with their consultation were not made public by the then government," he said.
Kuragala historic site predates Vijaya's arrival - PM
The Kuragala historic sacred site has evidence to prove that Sri Lanka's civilization goes back to pre-historic times, as far back as more than 8,000 years. Hence, the excavations would be done without giving rise to any kind of ethnic tensions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana, for oral answers.
The Prime Minister said there were problems with the Buddhist sites in Kuragala, but there is an excavation site near an Islam religious place and discussions will be held to conduct the excavations without any issue.
He stated that the research on history and excavations would be conducted on the instructions of Prof. Deraniyagala and added that they will be commenced in March next year.
The Premier said the civilization runs far back than the Prince Vijaya's arrival.
At this stage Buddhika Pathirana thanked the Prime Minister for his directions. Meanwhile, JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti requested the Prime Minister to take measures to renovate the Bellana Road which leads to Balangoda where the "Balangoda Man" lived in the pre-historic ages.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in response stated he would take special interest on this issue. He added that the same road was of great importance as it is believed the same road has been used by those people of prehistoric ages to go to Horton Plains to find food.
Opposition MP Sarath Amunugama said that it was commendable if the Kuragala excavations were done without creating reasons for an ethnic conflict.
At this stage opposition Mahajana Iksath Peramuna Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the Sripada Sacred Site has been subjected to grave injustice due to the demarcation and delimitation of provinces.
He requested the Premier to take corrective measures as Siripada is one of the most sacred places for Buddhists. At this stage the PM said he would also attend to the matter.
TNA fully support govt in implementing UNHRC Resolution - Sumanthiran
The TNA extends fullest support to the government to implement the UNHRC Resolution in full, TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment debate, he observed that the TNA welcomes the passage of the resolution despite certain clauses in it had been weakened following negotiations.
"This is your resolution. You co-sponsored it. However, we are more keen than you for its full implementation. Now the UNP and SLFP have agreed to implement it even without the international participation.
You cannot be selective when it comes to the implementation. The Foreign Minister has accepted the promises given by many successive governments had not been kept. People must see action to have faith on the government. Let the people really feel it.
Then we can stand collectively in the international arena. No doubt these are difficult issues. We are willing to go that difficult journey with you.
The resolution has not only highlighted the crimes committed by the Sri Lankan forces, it has many revelations on the LTTE atrocities. Yet we welcomed the entire report, we are ready to lead our people in the painful process of introspection. If we are to move forward, we must be prepared to do it," he said.
Sumanthiran criticized the statements of several MPs that they would create a Sinhala State, adding that these remarks invite further divisions.
"No doubt Sinhala community has a glorious past and dignified heritage, but I do not belong to that community.
"I have my own cultural heritage which have an equal glorious past. When you say you want a Sinhala State, then we are pushed to seek our own. You are the separatists, not us. However, I am glad that MPs who hold such views are few in number. Many spoke about sovereignty. Sovereignty is the right of people to rule themselves. That does not mean it can be exercised by some people. This has been the problem of this country. A particular group superior in number cannot have the sole authority of exercising powers. Every citizen has equal rights. The issue initially arisen because we were excluded when formulating the 1972 Constitution. The issue of discrimination came later," he observed.
He stressed whatever the mechanism the government is going to follow it must earn the confidence of the victims as a just mechanism.
Referring to the Paranagama Commission, Sumanthiran said its mandate should be terminated forthwith, stating it has no credibility. "However, even such a bad commission could not escape in saying Channel 4 video did not seem to be fake. Therefore it has proposed to conduct an independent inquiry. Let's deal with the investigations justly, honestly and transparently without sweeping them under the carpet.
That will elevate our national image in the world. Do not give in to the extreme views of both sides," he added.
Lankan Judiciary capable to hear cases against security forces
The Judiciary in Sri Lanka is capable enough to hear cases within Sri Lanka against the security forces. There is no need of international intervention or support, Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said in Parliament yesterday.
He also stated that Sri Lanka has enough experiences in doing so. Weerawansa pointed out that Sri Lankan judiciary had heard on Premavathi Manamperi murder, Chemmuni murder, Krishanthi Kumaraswami murder etc. The MP said that if the government thinks it needs to strengthen the judiciary, it could do so and hear those cases.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved on the government co-sponsored resolution at Geneva in Parliament.
Weerawansa said that the government side members attempted to point out that it was only during Mahinda Rajapaksa regime a resolution was moved against Sri Lanka before the United Nations.
He stated that the after the 1983 Black July, a resolution was moved against Sri Lanka at Geneva. The parliamentarian said that this resolution attempts to say that our security forces have committed war-crimes.
He questioned as to why the Prevention of Terrorism Act needed to be removed and added that it was to release terrorist suspects held in prisons.
Weerawansa said that this is not an achievement but an act of betrayal.
Govt to revise Penal Code
The government will revise the Penal Code to criminalize hate speech, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan yesterday said in Parliament.
Participating in the debate on Geneva based UNHRC report and alleged human rights violations during the last phase of the war, the minister said: "During the period 2014-15, 112 incidents of hate speech against Muslim community had been reported. There were 22 such incidents since January this year. Christian groups reported 126 incidents targeting Christians and their religious sites, 57 since this January."
"There had been no prosecutions in relations to attacks by the Buddhist group, Bodu Bala Sena on the Muslim community in Aluthgama in June 2014 where four people were killed and around 80 injured," he said. The minister said that the government yet to embark on any comprehensive process of demilitarisation. Local civil society sources recorded 26 cases of harassment and intimidation by military and intelligence services in the North and the East during January to August this year.
This figure highlights the reality that the structures and institutional cultures that had been created by the repressive environment of the past remain in place and will require much more fundamental security sector reform.
"Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which has long provided a legal context for arbitrary detention, unfair trials and torture remain in force. According to the civil society sources from January to August, 19 persons were arrested and 12 still remain in custody. Although the government has engaged in a dialogue with Tamil Diaspora groups, it has not yet taken any step to delist the numerous Tamil Diaspora organisations and individuals from a list of terrorist organisations.
"The security forces and intelligence services have enjoyed near total impunity and have not undergone any significant downsizing or reform since the armed conflict. The military retains an oppressive presence in the war-affected areas of the North and the East by occupying private land and maintaining a culture of surveillance and harassment of the local population and civil society," the minister said.
Previous govt. whipped up Communalism
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament yesterday that the previous government whipped up Communalism after the war victory.
Organizations such as BBS which acted with state patronage created problems for the Muslims during the previous regime.
The MP speaking in the debate on Geneva based UNHRC report, said the government should not allow anyone to create racial tension in the name of religion.
Although MP Wimal Weerawansa says the Prevention of Terrorism Act should remain, we see no need for the PTA in a country that has no conflict. Some people who are in the political wilderness are depending on Communalism for their survival.
Exclusive Sinhala state will create Tamil state - Senadhiraja
If there are demands for a separate Sinhala State, there will naturally be a demand for a separate Tamil state as well, TNA Leader Mavai Senadhiraja said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that setting up of an exclusive Sinhala State would automatically help lay foundation for a Tamil state. Then there will be an international assistance for this.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa addressing a political meeting held in Colombo recently has called for the setting up of an exclusive Sinhala Buddhist community. If there is a need and urge to create such a Sinhala State it would be inevitable to see the creation of a Tamil state too.
We would seek the assistance of the international community and create a separate Tamil nation.
The country has not recovered from a war and the Tamils are still at the receiving end, the MP said that there was no other solution except the Hybrid Court mechanism proposed by the UNHRC to move forward. Tamils would get a fair deal only through transitional justice.
It is our belief and the standing point.
TNA MP Shivashakthi Ananda said due to deficiency in the domestic judiciary mechanism, we do not have any faith in a domestic mechanism.
There should be a fair investigation on the alleged human rights violations during the last stage of the conflict.
SLFP now pursuing consensual politics - Dilan
A few in the UPFA dragged the SLFP to an extreme racist line during the past few years, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment motion, the minister said the SLFP had never trodden a racist line, but certain people in the UPFA, dragged the SLFP into that line. He said the present stand of the SLFP is that it would never give into communalism again.
"The SLFP is now pursuing consensual politics. It is because we want to find a lasting solution to the national question. Now we saw both Wimal Weerawansa and Mavai Senathirajah criticized the resolution. It signals that they are on the same path with regard to it. The domestic mechanism will be pursued under the laws of the country. Isn't it what we have wanted Why shout against it During the Rajapaksa government, friendly Muslim countries gradually detached from us. I was the very first to raise my voice against the BBS. The BBS criticized me harshly in return," he observed.
Referring to the 13th Amendment, the minister stated it is also a part of the Constitution adding that all are bound to implement it.
"The SLFP always had favourable views with regard to the 13th Amendment. The instruction to implement it needs not come from Geneva. Let us accept the reality that the Geneva Resolution is actually watered down. It had not accessed anybody in person. We have to put an end to the practice of always criticizing the moves of rival party. We have suffered a lot due to this. Let us make a collective effort to solve this problem," he added.
Former regime kept commission reports under wraps
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told parliament yesterday that the previous government kept the report of the commission headed by retired Justice Nissanka Udalagama under wraps for nine years since 2006 breaking the promises given to the international community.
Due to promises made to UN Secretary General Ban ki Moon, the former government appointed Maxwell Paranagama Commission and retired Justice Nissanka Udalagama Commission to probe alleged human rights violations and disappearances in the post war period.
But none of these reports was released which increased the suspicious of the international community.
But we released both these reports to prove our transparency and good governance to the world, instead of whipping up communal tensions. If we implemented the recommendations of these reports in the past, the country would have progressed much further.
Minister Rajapakshe speaking during the debate on UNHRC resolution, said the former government stirred racism and also "sold" the electric chair to get cheap advantage at previous elections.
However, the people of this country could not be deceived all the time and they gave a fitting reply on January 8 and on August 17. Many foreign leaders have told us that they thought such a transformation would not have happened at least for another 20 years. We have been able to achieve a great victory at the UNHRC sessions as the international community appreciated steps taken by the government to address human rights concerns. The government was also succeeded in averting the electric chair, an international investigation and a hybrid special court in the resolution passed there.
We have been able to save the country from the international black list of war crimes.
The world was divided on this issue, but last month, we all came together to resolve the issue for the betterment of Sri Lanka.
If someone is trying to sabotage the ushering of peace to this country, future generation will curse such people.
It was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who initially invited foreign representatives to come to Sri Lanka for an investigations. In 2003 Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe refused to sign the Rome Convention. But due to the joint statement signed by former President with UN Secretary General Ban ki Moon, our country was subjected to international probes.
Former President signed this without even informing Parliament and his own cabinet.
So, the best person to answer all these questions, is former President.
We hope he would attend the House today or tomorrow, and answer all these issues.
Eventhough former regime appointed LLRC committee, they did not implement the recommendations of the committee as promised.
There was also no real freedom in the country eventhough the war ended. The UNHRC third resolution was not on the alleged war crimes itself, it was based on the Rathupaswala shooting and the killing of prisoners.
The UNHRC was about to take stern action against us due to these reasons. Now the world has accepted our efforts of reconciliation and that is why it was possible to bring this collective proposals.
'Last regime responsible for HR issue going global'
Provincial Council and Local Government Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavitharana said in Parliament yesterday that the previous regime should be held responsible for taking the human rights issue to the international forum.
The former government thought that there would be no international investigations and they also did not go ahead with the domestic investigations. They also thought if a vote was taken at the UNHRC, Russia and China would have come forward to assist us. But these countries did not help any other country facing human right allegations. We should rectify our shortcomings and go ahead as a civilised society. International community went against us because of the alleged human rights violations. We must rectify our mistakes. This government should not bow down to those raising communal tensions.
The Deputy Minister said so participating in the debate on Geneva UNHRC report.

[Action Desk] Tug o' war between road maintenance authorities
Public in a ditch
No authority was willing to take responsibility of the death traps in the form of uncovered drains in two of the most densely populated cities, Colombo and Kandy.
Last week, a school girl was killed when she fell into an unprotected drain on her way home from an afternoon class. Walking home, a seemingly uneventful and safe activity, became fatal for the 17-year-old from Nittawela, Kandy on the particular rainy day, owing to the negligence of authorities.
She was not the first one to die this way. In 2007, another young life was lost in a similar manner, when she stepped on an unprotected drain in Colombo 7. But authorities seem to have learnt little over the years. Although road users have raised the issue numerous times, little seemed to be done to prevent further fatal accidents. Complains to authorities fall on deaf ears. They are passing the buck from the RDA to Municipal Councils and to the Water Board.
Many side drains along the main road and by-roads that have not been covered, create a serious threat to the safety of the people.
No authority seemed eager to take action to make amends and prevent further tragedy.
A pit that had been dug at Norris Canal Road, a road with heavy traffic being an access road to both a private hospital and the National Hospital, remains unprotected.
"The hole had been dug for the past four months and we see no improvement," claims a three wheeler driver K. Lakshman.
"We were informed that the construction work had been given to contractors but they work less than two hours per day."
The threat such a situation poses, is high. Apart from the two hospitals, there are three schools in the area as well.
"Vehicles have to move carefully as they might end up falling into the drain," Lakshman said.
He added that there is a huge traffic jam in the morning and evening due to construction work. Apart from vehicles, the road is frequented by a large number of schoolchildren and patients as well as their families. It is terrifying to watch when one of the parties try to give space for the other on the road.
The authorities have been informed, said D. L. Dhasanayake, a van driver providing transport to schoolchildren.
"The All Island School Children Transport Association informed the CMC that the delay in completing the construction work is a threat to people's lives," he said.
But authorities are oblivious to the situation. No action had been taken despite the gravity of the issue.
"It seems that they do not care about the well-being of the public," claims Dhasanayake.
"There is no point in giving reasons for the delay. It is their duty to complete it as soon as possible. It is pathetic to see the irresponsible attitude of authorities towards preventing tragedy. They have used polythene covers around the drain. That will not save a person from falling in to the drain," he said.
The situation is similar at Kinsey Road where another pit had been dug.
"It was dug a few months ago and there is no progress in the construction work," claims F. M. Fahad, a shopkeeper referring to the pit filled with water.
He said residents in the area complained to the CMC but there was no response. There is a double danger for the residents in the area. Even if you avoid falling into the ditch, you face grave danger of being stung by a dengue mosquito bred in the pit. When the police noticed that there is danger of dengue mosquitoes breeding in stagnant water in the pit, they mixed some chemicals into the water, Fahad claims.
"There are three schools in the vicinity and the school service vehicles are parked along this road. Schoolchildren roam around the road and there is fear that they might fall into the pit," he said.
The Drainage Division of Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) was contacted and they claimed that the National Water and Drainage Board (NWDB) is responsible.
"The water board has to complete the shifting of water supply pipeline for them to continue the construction work," CMC Drainage Division M. Saleem Director claimed.However, he assured that the construction of drains in which the depth range from two to three feet - is not very dangerous. "It is rarely that deep drains are constructed such as the one in Kandy," he added.
The Daily News tried to contact the Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council V.K Anura several times but failed.

The tragic death of a young school girl after falling into a drainage in Kandy, highlighted the gravity of the problem with the blame resting on the RDA for neglecting their duties.
Even after the tragedy, remedies are slow to come.
"Three days after the demise of my daughter, some officers have covered the drain using polythene sheets and hanged a board on it. In a few days, the polythene and the board will be blown away due rain and wind, claimed M. Shahabdeen, the father of the girl who faced the tragic death by falling into the unprotected drain.
The victim, Azra Shahabdeen, was a resident of Mosque Road in Katugastota.
"Why cannot they find a long term solution" he asks. A question falling on deaf ears.
He blames the RDA for the death of his daughter.
"Many people suggested that I go before the law but knowing that I can never bring back my daughter, I have no hope. No child should face a traumatic death similar to my daughter in the future."
The police said the the girl, who was accompanied by four of her friends, had fallen into the drain while on her way home. Her body was found 800 metres away, near the elephant bathing spot at Katugastota. This is not an issue confined to Kandy. People from all parts of the country face the same situation, claims Mahendra Wijepala, Kandy District Engineer, Road Development Authority.
He admits that there are a number of drains which still remain uncovered. However, it is not possible to construct them immediately, he said.
"The development project of the RDA to widen the Katugastota Road was given to a private company a month ago. It is also their responsibility to maintain the road," Wijepala added.
Contrary to this attitude, Director, RDA regional office Ahamed Azar, was quick to accept the blame.
"We as the Road Development Authority have to take the responsibility of the accident. Under the development project to widen the Katugastota Road, the construction work of the particular drain has not started yet. The condition of that is the same for the past several years. The total blame cannot be put on the contract company as they have not commenced the construction work," he said.
However, he emphasized that maintaining the drains is the responsibility of the CMC. "There is no need of passing the ball to others. The MC cannot neglect it. Several duties are assigned to them as well.
However, the Kandy Municipal Council is not ready to take the responsibility either. According to them, clearing and maintaining drains is the responsibility of the RDA.
Commissioner, Kandy Municipal Council, Chandana Tennakoon said: "The Municipal Council is not accountable for the repairs of the drains. The CMC is only responsible for clearing the drains. Tennakoon noted that after the death of the young girl, the RDA had been informed to ensure that similar unprotected drains are covered immediately. One week later, this is yet to happen.
The Daily News observed several unprotected drains which pose a danger to trap to pedestrians in Kandy. We would like to bring the Kandy- Katugastota main road, William Gopallawa Mawatha (from Kandy to Peradeniya), Sirimavo Bandaranaike Mawatha and the by-road from Girls' High School to Good Shed to the attention of the authorities to take immediate action to prevent similar tragedies.

Racists against hybrid court concept - Rajitha
The Tamil as well as Sinhala racists stand against the hybrid court concept proposed by the Geneva based UNHRC, Health and Indigenous Minister Rajitha Senaratne said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the adjournment motion debate on Geneva based UNHRC report and alleged human rights violations during the last phase of the war.
He said the Spokesman for the Global Tamil Forum, Suren Suranthiran, Wimal Weerawansa, Gunadasa Amaraskera, Karunanidhi, Jayalalithaa and Anandi Sasitharan despite their differences have a common slogan today in rejecting the hybrid court mechanism.
He said that the country has experienced a war that killed children, youth and leaders. He questioned as to why the country needs to see reawakening setting aside that dark past. The minister commended the JVP stating that it has evolved to a new position shedding its racist lines and slogans and added that it is genuinely involved in the process of seeking reconciliation.
Senaratne also stated that except for the JVP and few others, many who spoke at the debate have not studied what the reports by the UNHRC, Paranagama Commission and the Udalagama Commission said. Geneva report proposes ensuring the people of this country and to implement only the favourable recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.
Minister Senaratne questioned as to who appointed the LLRC, the Paranagama Commission and the Udalagama Commission. He also questioned as to who is talking against them and who are talking of implementing their recommendations. He said the LTTE would not have been able to cause so much of damage to this country had President Premadasa and Minister Lalith Athulathmudali been alive as they were not racists. That is why the LTTE had killed them. The LTTE never killed Sinhala racists or a JVP leader because they knew their stance would help them survive their racist ideology and added that the JVP has come to the right place by now.
The minister said the country would have been put in labyrinth of chaos if the recommendations of Commissions appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were implemented whereas the co-sponsored resolution has a minimal effect on the country.
Senaratne said that the report prepared by friends of former President Rajapaksa have adverse recommendations than those in the latest US resolution at Geneva although some of the opposition members attempted to project it to be a devil.
Minister Senarathne said that the resolution has accepted that the inquiry should be held under a united and unified situation and under the existing judicial system. He added that the Paranagama Commission also has recommended to inquire into the killing fields of Channel 4 footage as well as White Flag incident. He added that it also recommended to inquire into the death of Prabhakaran's 12-year-old son.
The minister further said that we could have been able to bring the inquiry into this favourable level due to the steps take by the new government.

South Asia's Grand Dame opens its doors
Some of the most elegant and historic cultural icons of our times - vintage hotels - have withstood the ravages of time to emerge as icons, imbued with a regal charm that is unparalleled. These are some of the heritage hotels around the world, which enjoy an exalted status as the ultimate vintage luxury destinations of all time. These architectural gems were discovered around the time the Suez Canal was opened for transatlantic steamers in 1869, thereby shortening the journey from the West to the East and promoting the early version of tourism as we know it today. The Galle Face Hotel is privileged to be counted amongst one of these elite properties. The hotel stands proud as one of the oldest hotels east of the Suez in this exclusive group.
Founded in 1864, the Galle Face Hotel is one of the landmarks in Asia with a rich colonial history and is arguably one of the best heritage hotels in the world. The Galle Face Hotel was originally built by four British entrepreneurs and is among the few remaining colonial hotels in operation today in Asia. In 2012 it became the first hotel in the country to be featured on a postage stamp. No visit to Sri Lanka is complete without staying at the elegant historic award winning hotel, which reflects the grandeur of a bygone era yet offering modern comfort for today's traveler. Despite many renovations over the years, the period detail of the Galle Face Hotel has been preserved in its architecture and faade.
Over the years, the hotel has housed royalty and celebrity and has played host to many well-known figures, world leaders and celebrities who have resided here, including royalty and heads of state, such as Emperor Hirohito of Japan, US President Richard Nixon, Alfonso XIII King of Spain, Pope John Paul II, HRH Prince Phillip Duke of Edinburgh and Indian Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and many more eminent personalities.
Galle Face Hotel has also played host to famous sporting personalities of yore such as Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Len Hutton and Mike Brearley. Many reputed performers, artists and thespians have graced its portals, such as Somerset Maugham, Duke Ellington, Sir Carol Reed, Robert Rauschenberg, Steven Spielberg, Actors - Gregory Peck, Bo Derek, Harrison Ford, Roger Moore, Sir Alec Guinness, Vivien Leigh, Peter Finch, William Holden and Carrie Fisher.
The iconic Galle Face Hotel which opens its doors again following its grand restoration over the last two years to its former glory now positioning the hotel as 'The Bespoke' property in Colombo, is now geared to open its doors to a global market of refined and leisure travelers, business professionals as well as celebrities, expatriates and locals alike seeking to enjoy the luxuries of life while reminiscing on an era of Ceylon gone by. The grand debut of the restored Galle Face Hotel will be one of the signature hotel openings that Sri Lanka's hospitality industry has ever witnessed which will see popular international acts perform along with the participation of local VIPs and international celebrities.
"It upholds the importance of ensuring that the prestigious identity of the hotel is retained so as to celebrate its rich history. Together with my team we intend to follow the mantra of 'Personable Service' to each individual guest that walks into Galle Face Hotel to enjoy its timeless grandeur. To ensure this every team member of the hotel will be trained with international standards of luxury hospitality. To make this a reality, I have team that diligently provides individual training to each team member on many areas such as customizing a menu, teaching the importance of the balance of ingredients, inspecting and identifying each touch point of the property to provide clear entry to the property and to further expand the hotel's service offerings to its clientele", Galle Face Hotel General Manager Antony Paton stated.
As a part of the restoration, the hotel has revamped Colombo's most exquisite restaurant and Wine cellar '1864', which takes each visitor through a journey of indulgence. The restaurant currently offers an  la carte menu that exalts modern contemporary cuisine serving drinks at the lounge followed by dinner at the restaurant with tableside service to further fulfill the lavish experience with its quiet ambiance. Paton emphasized that the restaurant plays Jazz music to suit the visitors tastes until 10pm and thereafter transforms the night to a different experience with upbeat music and a lively atmosphere that keep guests entertained till 2am.
Highlighting the Verandah which offers all day dining with an exquisite pan-Asian cuisine, reminiscent of the regional flavours imported by colonial routes, are enjoyed in refined and distinctive colonial settings. Mr Paton says the fully Sri Lankan menu features a variety of mouth-watering cuisines that are inspired by the Malay, Kandiyans, Burger and many other ethnicities from across all corners of the island.
The popular Sea Spray restaurant with twice the floor space will continue to offer interactive dining with live cooking stations, to serve customized kitchen stations for BBQ's, grills and sauces. Mr Paton says the team will play a significant role in ensuring the comfort and enjoyment of its visitors in delivering scrumptious cuisines and excellent wine serving that meet the international standards of luxury hospitality.
The Travellers' Bar which is the latest addition to the hotel's offering, has the most unique beverage menu that could be found anywhere in Colombo. The Traveller's Bar stores the most premium spirits and has a list of experimental cocktails along with a variety of the most favorite highly crafted cocktails or drinks of iconic celebrities that have stayed at the Galle Face Hotel over the past century.
The Galle Face Hotel is famously known as the only location any traveler will either stopover for lodging or drop for a casual visit as guests are always drawn to its elegant charm and quality hospitality. A visit to Galle Face Hotel is a unique experience as it is a museum of hospitality and an embodiment of rich history as it reflects the transformation of Sri Lanka from the period of British colonial rule up until the modern day period where comfort and luxury merge together as one.
"Each trip is approached as an opportunity to experience atypical destination, to discover somewhere new with singular charm, distinct traditions and stories", Paton further added.

Homesters replied with 192 runs and in the Palians second essay Peterites bounced back and showed their prowess and skittled out the visitors for a paltry 111 runs and Himasha cracked a fluent 66 runs with eight fours and three towering sixes to bring his tally to 235 runs in the same game and some of his shots were spraying like bullets and the fielders looked on helplessly.

Technology allows cows' weights to be monitored from space
AUSTRALIA:Australian farmers managing cattle stations as large as some European nations will soon be able to monitor their cows and pastures from space as part of "groundbreaking" technology, scientists say.
The technology, developed with government and private funding, taps into a satellite passing overhead to record the weights of herds daily while monitoring pasture conditions -- a task traditionally impossible due to the stations' vast sizes and harsh, remote locations. Some stations, such as Newcastle Waters in the Northern Territory, span 10,000 square kilometres (3,861 square miles) -- an area larger than Cyprus -- and home to 55,000 cattle.
Australia is one of the world's largest beef exporters.
"There's just a huge labour component and time that goes into collecting that data (of weight and pastoral conditions), which is essentially why producers don't do it on a more regular basis," Sally Leigo from the Northern Territory's primary industry department, the project's research leader, told AFP Thursday.
On average, cattle are only weighed 1.5 times a year and only two percent of pasture is regularly viewed, the Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation, the private-public funded organisation that developed the tool, estimates. -AFP

The Tourism Development Authority puts the new scheme into action initially in Galle, Unawatuna and Hikkaduwa.
The Tourism Development Authority will take steps to guarantee quality eating places for tourists. The authority will be on constant alert over the upkeep of eating places in a tourist friendly manner.The authority will award certificates in recognition and appreciation of the services of eating places. With the implementation of the new project, restaurants and hotels should be registered with the authority. No one will be allowed to run eating houses without registration, Minister Amaratunge said.
The minister said the tourism industry can contribute towards the economic progress of the country.

We have to stop adverse practices. We will take action on those who are responsible for corruption and wrongdoings, Minister Amaratunga said.

Trudeau's hair: a political plus in Canada
CANADA: It was his hair that seemed to do their heads in. Ever since Justin Trudeau, the 44-year-old who has just led Canada's centre-left Liberal Party to an overwhelming victory, appeared as leader, conservatives sniped at his hair.
One Tory attack ad aired during the northern summer showed everyday people inspecting Trudeau's resume and finding it wanting. "Nice hair though," one of them says at the end.
It is true, Trudeau has a wonderful head of hair, but the conservative leader Stephen Harper - something of a northern Tony Abbott - was getting at something more when he brought up the hair.
Harper hoped he could make Trudeau's hair emblematic of his opponent's youth, inexperience and even his dynastic privilege. "He's just not ready," was another slogan the Conservatives deployed. Trudeau brushed it all aside, saying in one effective social media response that Harper was focused on him, while he was focused on the Canadian people.
Trudeau was born in 1971, when his father Pierre Trudeau was still in office, a charismatic, pluralistic Liberal Party prime minister who dominated the Liberal Party and Canadian politics well into the 1980s.
By 2006 the Liberal Party of Canada was lost in the wilderness when Justin Trudeau, by then a teacher with a degree in literature, was invited to chair a task force on attracting young voters. Two years later he won a seat in parliament
Like his father Trudeau quickly proved to be a charismatic force in Canadian politics, so much so that within two and a half years he was offered - and rejected - his party's leadership.
It did not take long though before he was lobbying for the job, which he secured easily in 2013.
By then Stephen Harper had been in office for over six years, and given the three-way nature of Canadian politics, cracks in the Conservative Party's hold on power were beginning to show.
Harper responded by moving toward the populist right. His party rejected climate change and demanded ever more belligerently that the Obama administration approve the controversial Keystone pipeline through the US for the export of Canadian tar sands oil via the Gulf of Mexico.
Harper also turned to the culture wars in an effort to maintain support, passing Patriot Act style laws to protect the homeland, cracking down on immigration, blocking abortion funding in developing countries, joining the fight against ISIS and in the end focusing the party's attention on an effort to ban the niqab during citizenship ceremonies, a fringe issue that seemed designed to appeal more to his own party's hardliners rather than the average Canadian voter.
All the while Trudeau stayed his course. Appearing with Julia Gillard and the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright on a think tank panel in Washington, DC, in 2013, he outlined his vision.
He said that it was easy for the fringe elements of on both sides of politics to attract votes by declaring what they were against. Progressives, he said, had the more difficult task of selling complex solutions to complicated problems.
To this end he supported some of new anti-terrorism laws, and even sought to support both the construction of Keystone and serious action on climate change.

UNP, SLFP on same wave length over Geneva resolution
Sri Lanka Freedom Party Spokesman Minister Dilan Perera said both the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party taking a common stance on the human rights topic are of the view that the Geneva recommendations are more favourable to Sri Lanka.
He added that although several people make a hue and cry about a hybrid court and mediation of foreign judges, the Geneva recommendation do not suggest establishing hybrid courts or appointing foreign judges to look into human right allegations.
"It was during the time of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, that certain Ministers expressed their concern about establishing hybrid courts and appointing foreign judges to look into human rights violations. 'Darusman', who presented a report on human right violations, was not a Sri Lankan. He came to the country during Rajapaksa's rule " he noted. The Minister said so addressing the media yesterday at the SriLanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Headquarters participating in the SLFP weekly media briefing.
In accordance with the Constitution of the country only lawyers, who have passed the Law College final examination can be a judge. Therefore, no international judge can be a judge in the country unless after becoming a lawyer on passing the Law College Examination even though there is room for such international judges to assist local investigations into the human right violations. Moreover, such international judges can be observers or provide technical assistance to the process. He added that President Sirisena had multiparty and multi ethnic discussions yesterday (22) evening aimed at reaching a common stance on the Geneva recommendations. "All the views of participants including politicians, intellectuals,media personnel, religious leaders etc. were considered aiming to have a proper and most suitable common stance" he noted.
Minister Perera while appreciating the stance of the JVP on the Geneva proposals, said the JVP should not arouse communism like in the past. However the leftist parties including Prof. Tissa Vitarana, DEW Gunasekara aretaking a communal line in regard to the Geneva proposals. "This is the last bus. It is the duty of we all to make use of this opportunity," he added.

US Senate considers controversial Cyber Security Bill
US: The US Senate on Tuesday began debating a long-delayed bill that would make it easier for corporations to share information about cyber attacks with each other or the government without concern about lawsuits.
Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate could pass the bill within days. "We intend to pass the cyber security bill," he told reporters, "hopefully by early next week."
The House of Representatives passed its version of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) in April with strong support from Republicans and Democrats. Dozens of industry and business groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, back the legislation, saying it will help encourage companies and the government to share information that might help thwart high-profile cyber attacks like those on Sony Pictures Entertainment, Target and Anthem.
But a few lawmakers - including Republican Senator Rand Paul and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden - have come out against it. Several big tech companies also oppose it, arguing that it fails to protect users' privacy and does too little to prevent cyber attacks. The Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group representing Facebook, Google and other major tech firms, said last week it opposed CISA as it is currently written. Twitter said on Tuesday it could not support CISA in its current form.
Apple Inc also said on Tuesday it opposed the current proposal, according to the Washington Post, which quoted a company statement as saying: "The trust of our customers means everything to us and we don't believe security should come at the expense of their privacy." - AFP

361 Degrees unveils "Tribal Challenge 2015"
361 Degrees, the leading Human Activations company in Sri Lanka, has organized the Tribal Challenge 2015, a unique competition featuring a tribal-themed outdoor experiential learning programme.
The competition celebrates the company's momentous milestone of completing 1,000 training programmes since its inception back in 2001 as Wild Drift. Additionally, this competition serves as one of several initiatives the company has mapped out to announce that Wild Drift, 361 Edge and 361 Interactive are now collectively known as "361 Degrees".
Through this competition, the 10 winning teams of 4 members each will be provided the opportunity to take part in an all-expense-paid training programme at an exotic location out of Colombo. The winning teams will be selected via radio and Facebook competitions that are currently being carried out while the 'Tribal Challenge 2015' experiential learning programme is to be held on October 31 and November 1. During the programme, the 10 teams will have to face a host of different experiences, such as the Totem Blessing, Tribal War Dance, Diyabariya Challenge, Ball in the Blind Alley, Keep It Straight, Aim Game & Conquer the World.
Rukmal De Silva - Chief Visionary Officer of 361 Degrees
"For the past 14 years, Wild Drift has been leading the way in providing innovative experiential learning solutions tailor-made to meet the needs of a wide variety of clients. We provide participants with a robust, all-round experience which helps provide holistic solutions to a variety of HR-related issues companies face. The Tribal Challenge 2015 serves two purposes - firstly, it was conceptualized to celebrate the 1,000th training programme of the company, and secondly, it is part of a series of activities that we're carrying out to announce that Wild Drift will now be known as 361 Degrees", 361 Degrees Chief Visionary Officer Rukmal De Silva stated. He added that the change was necessary in order to give clients a more integrated and comprehensive training plan that better-catered to individual needs rather than being centred on the particular approach that was taken towards training previously.
"Making employees happy and productive involves 3 crucial areas - competency, passion and congruence. Firstly, you get the issue of competency because if people do not have capabilities, they cannot fulfill their role and neither they nor their bosses will be happy. Then, there are instances where people who have the capabilities and competencies don't fulfill their tasks because they are not passionate about what they do, the company, their role or the culture. The third aspect is that if both competency and passion are present, it has to align with the different aspects of the organization such as culture, processes, strategies, systems and policies. At 361 Degrees, we design and execute holistic solutions which cover all 3 areas", Rukmal stressed.
The year 2014 was another successful year for 361 Degrees as they completed an impressive 180 programmes for over 60 clients. Among the many noteworthy initiatives was a training session for over 500 people with South African cricketing great Gary Kirsten, a two-day programme for 6,000 people and a programme that used theatre as a learning platform for leadership training.

All you need is the Eye & Tongue
Chef Kithsiri de Silva is a man who has been so around the world learning all that needs to be known in the culinary world. Nothing is more exciting that to sit down and listen to someone who has travelled so much like that and being in the culinary industry for 30+ years. And one of the best things you can experience when you are a foodie is actually see the chef in action and showing how quick and easy it is to turn one simple prawn with very few ingredients to something that could go on the cover of a gourmet magazine. And of course explores with a fusion of flavours in one bite (if you watched Ratouille - you will know what I mean). Read on and get to know this chef better.
Bit about yourself: I am from Panadura. Now I live in Nugegoda. I've been out of Sri Lanka for 27 years and came back two years ago for the opening of Kingsbury Hotel as Executive Chef. I have been in the culinary industry for 32 good years since 1985. My first job was at the Claremont Hotel School for 6 months doing my basic cookery. Then I had an opportunity to go to Bahrain Inter-Continental where I worked for 3 and half years. I came back and worked at Colombo Hilton Gables in 1989 for 1 and half years. Then it was from Dubai Hilton to Al Ain Intercontinental to Bahrain Diplomat to Bahrain Intercontinental to Kuwait Intercontinental back to Bahrain Gulf Hotel to Kuwait Safir International. I flew to UK from and went off to Paris where I worked for two years before coming back again to Bahrain. After that I went to Turkey and finally came back to Sri Lanka two years ago.
Q: Of all the places you worked at, what are your greatest memories of them
The most memorable would be working at Kuwait International. That place has 24 outlets and I was managing all of them and this is what actually led me to open restaurants and it was my fourth 5 Star opening as a chef. I opened almost 24 outlets and was there for 10 years. That is where I really became someone.
Q: Why are you a chef
Actually in the beginning, I never wanted to be a chef. I wanted to be a Room Boy. But then I don't know for what reason I started to love cooking. It was never easy for me to become a chef and it took me a good 25 years to become a chef. It was really hard and such things are never easy. Advantage of it was I got to travel around the world which actually helped me to climb up.
Q: What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen
Well like I say always where the cooking is concerned, I won't follow recipes. You use your Eye and Tongue - this is what I believe in. Recipes are just a base. Cooking is not the bible so I really follow that and this is why I say I don't plan things. When I see the guests coming I know what they want and I cook accordingly. I have succeeded in it and so far I really do know what people want when it comes to food.
Q: Who is your biggest critic
As a chef I hate complaining (breaks into laughter). You can comment but you can't complain. There's a big a difference between commenting and complaining.
Q: How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen
In my experience it's very rare. But if it does happen I take it positively. Recently we had a food tasting here and a dessert which came from the kitchen was not liked by a guest. So I went to the pastry section and I saw whatever was there and in 10 minutes had something ready and it was loved by the guest.
Q: When at home do you cook or do you let your partner take control
Well my wife is a better cook than me. I am actually not that good in making Sri Lankan cuisine but I have my own way of making it too which is loved by my family. I do a lot of fusion in my Sri Lankan cuisine. I strongly believe that people in this industry don't want to see the same thing every single day. We need to keep on changing and we don't run short of ideas when you do things right.
Q: When you are not cooking...what do you do
I shout...(just kidding). I actually paint and it's my hobby. I love to paint figures and portraits. It's something I've been doing since the time I was small.
I have around 70 pieces...I believe. Being an artist I much enjoy giving away one of my pieces for free to a person who really does enjoy the beauty of art than sell it. Because those paintings are like my children and if I am selling them it will be like selling a child. And surprisingly, since I came to Sri Lanka I have not got a chance to paint. Sri Lanka is a busy country and I only get two days off. And I like to take my own time to paint.

Choosing a path towards a safer Sri Lanka
Being a tropical island nation with a population close to 23 million, Sri Lanka is exposed to a range of natural hazards which, combined with poor land use practices and the effect of climate change puts the country's hard earned development gains at risk, threatening economic growth and poverty elevation efforts.
Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) aims to reduce the risk of damage that can be caused by natural hazards through a system of preventive processes and actions.
The severity of these disasters depend on the choices we make, in relation to government policies, how we grow our food, where and how and where we build our homes, town and cities. Each decision either makes us more vulnerable to disasters or more resilient and so DRR is all about choices.
In spite of strengthened disaster management institutions and nation-wide early warning capabilities, the impact of disasters and climate change is creating new challenges for Sri Lanka. Even though the number of lives lost due to disasters has decreased over the years, there has been a significant increase in economic losses and damages to property. In the recent past the severity of landslides has increased in the central highlands, while emerging hazards such as lightning and high winds have also shown an increasing trend in the country.
Minimizing the impact of disasters has been a national priority for the past decade, since the December 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.
UNDP, supporting national DRR initiatives
In the past, the Ministry of Disaster Management, together with other institutions under its purview and other stakeholder agencies have implemented a number of programmes in order to achieve DRR priorities in line with the Hyogo Framework for Action. UNDP, making a conscious decision to support the Government's initiatives, has been serving as the main development and technical partner in Disaster Management in Sri Lanka since its establishment with the support from other partners such as Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, USAID and the Governments of France, Japan and Korea.
As the development arm of the United Nations, UNDP's support has also extended to develop the 'Road Map towards a Safer Sri Lanka', the country's previous long term disaster management plan. Furthermore, the establishment of a dedicated Ministry for Disaster Management, the Disaster Management Act, the Disaster Management Policy and a landslide early warning systems and the hazard profiles, integrated strategic environmental assessment, guidelines for disaster resilient building construction, training materials for schoolchildren and a 30 year disaster event database (Deslnventar) are a few of the remarkable achievements by the country, financially and technically supported by UNDP.
What is SLCDMP
More recently in 2012, UNDP supported the Ministry of Disaster Management to develop the 'Sri Lanka Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme' (SLCDMP) 2014-2018, a programme which ensures the 'safety of Sri Lanka' by reducing potential disaster risks and impacts on the people, property and the economy. The programme was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in July 2014 and subsequently by the Department of National Planning.
SLCDMP is designed as a multi-hazard, multi-sector, multi-agency and multi-stakeholder programme using the implementation experience of 'Road Map Towards safer Sri Lanka (2005)'. While the Ministry of Disaster Management implements the SLCDMP, UNDP provides the overall coordinating facilitating and technical assistance for the SLCDMP through a Programme Management Unit established in the Ministry the National Disaster Management.
Innovation in DRR
SLCDMP has not missed innovations. Earlier this year, UNDP together with key partner agencies began prototyping an Unmanned Aerial (UAV) to be used in emergencies to collect information for improved emergency response and assess disaster damages in disaster situations. In addition, UNDP is also supporting the National Building Research Organization to develop a landslide sensor to detect land movements to improve early warning during landslides.
DRR at the heart of sustainability
The SLCDMP will also be the key instrument of the Government to achieve the new Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), which was endorsed by 189 countries, including Sri Lanka, in March 2015. UNDP is now working in collaboration with the Ministry of Disaster Management to align the SLCDMP with the SFDRR within the development framework in Sri Lanka.
Efforts to reduce the threat posed by natural and man-made hazards also received a fresh boost last month when world leaders adopted the Global Goals, a new global sustainable development agenda that aims to eradicate extreme poverty and people's well-being, while protecting the environment. Six of these goals relate directly to DRR, recognizing that reducing exposure and vulnerability of the poor to disasters is essential for sustainable poverty eradication, and underlining the importance of resilient infrastructure, improved urban planning and climate adaption and ecosystem protection. Hence, 2015 is a landmark year for climate resilience, DRR and disaster management. It is a year when Governments adopted the SFDRR and the Sustainable Development Goals and this will be followed by COP21, a global climate accord, in Paris this December.
Celebrating International Day for Natural DRR
The focus of this year's International Day for Disaster Reduction is on the traditional, indigenous and local knowledge which complement modern science and add to individual's and societies' resilience. For example, knowledge of early warning singles in nature can be vital to ensuring early action is taken to mitigate the impact of both slow and fast onset disasters such as droughts, heatwaves, storms and floods. Combined with scientific knowledge such as reports generated by meteorologists, local knowledge is vital for preparedness and can be passed on from generation to generation.
UNDP, working in Sri Lanka for close to five decades, stands committed to partner and work closely with Government and Non-Government, civil society and private sector stakeholders to share knowledge, best practices and science to strengthen the implementation of SLCDMP to build a more resilient Sri Lanka for both people and the planet. 2015 is indeed a global time for action, marking of the International day for Natural Disaster Risk Reduction is a good reminder for all Sri Lankans to rethink their choices and role in the environment and on DRR because Disaster Risk Reduction is all about choices!

Thajudeen murder
CID questions 31 persons
The CID yesterday informed Court that 31 persons have been questioned and their statements recorded in connection with the murder of former Havelocks rugby captain Wasim Thajudeen and apprised Court that the suspects responsible for the murder would be arrested and produced in Court in the future.
Meanwhile, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris ordered the CID to expedite the investigations into the incident to ensure justice.
The Additional Magistrate further observed that both private and government institutions have equal responsibility in ensuring justice and urged the Dialog Company to be continue its commitment to accelerate on going investigations.
Meanwhile, the CID submitted to court that they were yet to receive the telephone conversations which are believed to have been made by Thajudeen prior to his death.
Counsel who appeared for the Dialog Company informed that it has assisted court in every possible aspect and pledged its continuous support regarding the investigations.
The CID further informed Court that the rib and tooth sample collected from the deceased's body have been sent to the ENETECH for a DNA report to ascertain whether the exhumed body at the Dehiwala mosque was of Wasim Thajudeen nor not.
The CID detectives further stated that in order to perform this DNA test, a blood sample was also obtained from the mother of deceased.
Further magisterial inquiry fixed for December 10.
On July 27, the CID submitted to Court that the death of Sri Lankan ruggerite, Wasim Thajudeen was not an accident but murder.
The CID had informed court that the investigations conducted so far had revealed that Mr. Thajudeen's teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death. The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of broken class.
Former Havelocks SC captain Wasim Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo in May 2012.
Earlier, the police had maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.

Corals may beat climate change with a boost from science
US: Keyhole Reef is one of dozens of small reefs rising abruptly from the depths of Kaneohe Bay, one of Hawaii's most scenic places. The water around it is sapphire blue, and bright schools of tang and triggerfish flit over its surface. But the reef is showing troubling signs of stress these days because of climate change.
Here and there along the steep face of the reef, clumps of coral have turned stark white. This bleaching means the coral has begun to eject the micro-algae that normally live within its tissues and provide up to 90 percent of the nutrients that coral needs to live. And that has scientists worried, because similar things are happening in tropical waters around the world. Coral reefs are one of the planet's keystone habitats, as rich in species as the rain forest. But they're even more vulnerable to climate change and the warm, acidic ocean conditions it is creating.
Yet scientists may be coming up with a way to protect the fragile reefs for the warmer world of the future
Ruth Gates, director of the Hawaii Institute for Marine Biology, calls the process human-assisted evolution. Last spring, she and Madeleine van Oppen of the Australian Institute for Marine Sciences received a $4 million grant from the family foundation of Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen for a plan to develop strains of coral that will be able to withstand changing ocean conditions.
Gates emphasizes that now is the time for scientists to act, while there is still enough diversity on the reef. "As a biologist who's been looking at reefs for 30 years," she says, "I'm spectacularly realistic about what I see, and it's not pretty - and if we don't do anything about it, it's going to intensify."
Like their close relatives, sea anemones and jellyfish, corals begin their life as free-swimming larvae. Eventually, though, they settle permanently on a rock or a patch of dead coral and transform into polyps, the basic units of coral. Almost immediately, the polyps begin to secrete the hard exoskeleton that we think of as coral reef. Collectively, corals are nature's most prodigious architects. The Great Barrier Reef, where van Oppen does her research, is large enough to be seen from space.
In a sense, each coral polyp is an individual, with a mouth and tentacles and its own community of symbionts. But the concept of individuality in coral is a complex one. Although larvae are the result of sexual reproduction, corals also reproduce clonally. Polyps will divide over and over again so that all the polyps in a colony, or a head of coral, may be genetically identical. Each may feed and spawn independently, but they're also all connected by tissue and by a kind of nervous system called a nerve net. If you touch one end of a colony, the tentacles on the other end will retract.
Then there's the relationship between coral and its symbiotic microorganisms. Because their lives are so intertwined, scientists generally think of all these organisms as a single entity they call a holobiont. If human-assisted evolution is going save coral, it will have to work on the entire holobiont.
Despite the provocative label, human-assisted evolution relies largely upon old-fashioned selective breeding. Gates points out that, even during a dramatic warming event, like last summer's in Hawaii, when mean sea temperatures in Kaneohe Bay were several degrees above normal, not all the coral on a reef bleaches. Some individuals are clearly more tolerant of these kinds of stresses.

'Debris' spotted on sonar images could be from Malaysian Airlines MH370: US experts
AUSTRALIA: Australian authorities searching for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 may have missed the wreckage as they canvassed search sites off the coast of Western Australia, American deep-sea investigators have claimed.
US firm Williamson & Associates said sonar images captured in two previously searched sections of the Indian Ocean appear to show "probable aircraft debris fields" that should be investigated more closely using an unmanned deep sea vessel.
The $90 million official underwater search operation spearheaded by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau - the most expensive in aviation history - has found no trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which went missing with 239 passengers and crew during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014.
But Williamson & Associates said the images of the southern Indian Ocean floor released by the ATSB in October bore a striking similarity to the underwater debris field Air France Flight 447 left on the Atlantic Ocean floor when it crashed in 2009, killing all 228 passengers and crew. Williamson & Associates was one of the rejected bidders for the contract to search for MH370.
The firm "believes the target [sonar images] bears the hallmarks of a classic high-impact debris trail similar to other wrecks it has located", according to a research paper released Tuesday.
"These targets have the characteristics of man-made metal parts with circular surfaces and with greater hardness than scattered rocks," it claimed.
"It's an anomaly that needs to be investigated further - to us it has all of the hallmarks of being a debris field," Williamson and Associates special projects manager Rob McCallum told SBS News.
The ATSB provided the images of the two sites as part of an update in which it also said a re-scan of the areas indicated they were not related to MH370.
The debris field was 700m by 250m, slightly larger than the 600m by 250m debris field of the Air France wreckage in the South Atlantic in June 2009, WIlliamson and Associates said. Experts involved in past deep-water searches have said the hunt could easily miss the plane because the Dutch company operating the search ship Furgo Discovery was using inappropriate technology and inexperienced personnel for the highly specialised task.
Other experts said the ATSB could have instead used an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to resurvey the sites. An AUV provides the most accurate search readings but cannot be deployed in rough winter weather.
The ATSB rubbished the claims, labelling Williamson & Associates' conduct "unprofessional" and distressing for family members of people who were aboard the plane.
An ATSB spokesman said the objects had been discounted by a series of specialists due to their similarity to geological formations in the broader search area.
"Based on analysis of all of the data, there are no indications that there is anything possessing the characteristics of an aircraft debris field," ATSB said in a statement.

Dinesh runs away with Mace
Parliament sittings were suspended for 10 minutes at 12.55 pm yesterday after Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena took away the Mace alleging that the Chair had been biased towards the government in allocating time for them to speak.
When the name of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hind Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan was called by the Chair to address the House during the adjournment debate moved by the government on the Geneva based UNHRC resolution, NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa rising a point of order said that the Chair had been partial in giving time to government members.
MP Wimal Weerawansa said that the time of the floor had been continuously to government members, neglecting the speakers from the opposition listed to speak.
Presiding Member Mujibur Rahman said that he was calling the names in the order of a list given to him. He said that Wimal Weerawansa's name was at the bottom of the list.
At this stage MP Dinesh Gunawardena stated that it was not fair to give opportunity to government members. He added that Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe spoke from the government side.
The next opportunity should be given to the opposition. At this stage, Minister Mangala Samaraweera stated that when the Chair gave the opportunity to a member same cannot be questioned. At this stage Dinesh Gunawardena stated that it was the duty of the Chair to protect the rights of the MPs.
At this stage the presiding member said that Minister Samarasinghe was given the opportunity from the time allocated for the UPFA.
By this time a tense situation had been created due to members from government and opposition sides were shouting at each other.
All of a sudden MP Dinesh Gunawardena came to the Well and marched towards the Chair. Deputy Sejeant-at-arms Narendra Fernando at the same time got up from his seat and ran towards MP Gunawardena who were followed by opposition MPs. When Gunawardena attempted
to take away the Mace Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms attempted to prevent it.
MP Gunawardena surrounded by MPs Jayantha Samaraweera, Piyal Nishantha, Udaya Gammanpila, Sriyani Wijewickrama, CB Ratnayake, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Sisira Jayakody and Indika Anuruddha led the mace to the middle of the Well while the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms got hold to it.
At this stage the presiding member announced that sittings would be suspended for 10 minutes.
Presiding member Rahuman suspended sittings and hurried to the Well. He was seen arguing with Opposition MPs that he did nothing wrong but was following the order in list given to him.
Ministers Eran Wickremaratne and Mangala Samaraweera were seen trying to calm the situation down calling on the opposition MPs and MP Rahuman to ease up.
Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms Fernando took the Mace from MP Gunawardena and others and replaced it in its position .
When sittings resumed at 1.05 pm, MP Gunwardena got up and said that he was not aware of the order of the list given to MP Rahuman and expressed his regret and requested to grant the opportunity for Weerawansa to speak.
The proceeding continued and MP Weerawansa was permitted to speak and Minister Sawminathan's name was shifted two places down.

Ravi tells private sector
Expect a revolutionary budget
Sectors of the economy will be opened enabling the private sector as well to play an equal role with the government, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday.
He said for the first time in history, a separate department will be created at the Finance Ministry for private sector development from January 1, 2016.
The Finance Minister was the chief guest at an interactive forum with the key private sector establishments.
"Many sectors in the economy will be opened. The financial sector will need a radical change where we expect the banks to take the risk and move forward for the betterment of the economy under a new era where both the President and the Prime Minister have a clear mandate and vision for it," Karunanayake said.
The minister reminded the private sector that when they forward a challenge to the government they should be ready to meet that challenge. He told them not to live on the dead past as the government has rooted out corruption and the lethargic attitude that existed in the past.
The minister allaying the fears of red tape and lethargic attitude said to be apart of the public sector invited the private sector chambers entrepreneurs to bring any such issues to the immediate attention of the Finance Ministry without making generalised allegations. "If the government is corrupt, don't make mere allegations, tell us where it is then we will change it."
Help us to help you was the call by the minister to the private sector chambers.
The minister said the country will see a revolutionary budget on November 20, where the monopolistic approach of the government will be reduced with competitive element emerging with a level playing opportunity given to all stake holders.

[Cross Currents]
Flight of conscience
During the general election in August the JVP campaigned on the basis of a document they called "The Consent of Conscience". They wanted to awaken the conscience of the people. In particular they did so to make them reject corrupt politicians and ensure a clean Parliament. However, the election results demonstrated that there were few who heeded the advice of the JVP. It looked as if many have lost not only their conscience but also their hearts and thoughts too.
Several developments since then also show that the ilk of the latter creed is not so rare. It would not surprise us if one arrives at such a conclusion in view of the brutal killing of Seya Sadewmi and the tragic end of schoolgirl Vindya as well as the daily recurrence of such abominable crimes both reported and not reported.
As a group many politicians also belong to the same group whose conscience has fled from their souls. Let us look at a few news recent items: 1) Members of Parliament and Ministers of the former regime have not yet returned 167 official vehicles and living quarters given to them when they held office.
Some politicians behave like infants or toddlers. MPs and Ministers should have known that they are obliged to return the vehicles and residential quarters once they lost their positions in office. It is almost four months since the dissolution of last Parliament and two months since the resignation of the former Cabinet of Ministers. Yet they continue to enjoy benefits to which they are not entitled. Where is their conscience The same goes for the man who played havoc at BMICH. As for the nave statements of the former President they are hardly worth comment. Should we need to say anything about his media freedom than to point towards the brutal murder of Lasantha Wickrematunga, Editor of Sunday Leader
Presidential election
These and other politicians of the same ilk are saints, if one goes by their talk. However, if one takes into consideration their deeds they turn out to be villains. One has to judge them not by their words but by their deeds.
Politicians are not alone among those who have lost or sold their conscience. There is another lot happily enjoying unearned wealth and positions. They come from among the bureaucracy, especially from its top rungs. Few news items would again illuminate this point. See for example, the following: 1) Top Customs officials nabbed while taking millions in bribes. 2) A top Police Official is in custody for aiding treasure hunters. 3) Prison officials have taken millions as bribes from the noted drug dealer Wele Suda.
In this situation people are helpless. They are perplexed as to what should be done when they see the comedies and tragedies played on the political stage by politicians. They are at a loss whether to cry or laugh.
Just take one example. The ITN television channel has lost several million rupees due to the non-payment of advertising costs of candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Presidential election and non-acceptance of advertisements from his rival Maithripala Sirisena. At the inquiry into this incident both the former President and the UPFA Secretary at the time denied responsibility and behaved like babies who did not know anything. Probably they may have lost both their memories along with their conscience. It looks as if none of them but the people are to blame.
Legal remedies
Very often legal remedies are not resorted to even when laws are violated openly and blatantly by politicians. During the last Presidential election the President in office then distributed various gift items to induce the voters to vote him into power again. There were also instances when such distribution was spotted and goods confiscated. Yet no legal action has been taken so far against any offenders. One cannot conclude that the former President did not know the law. He or anyone of his agents must have ordered the production and distribution of such goods including those that carried the picture of him. This is a deliberate act of violating the election law. This violation was ignored.
Similarly MPs and Ministers were aware that use of State vehicles for election purposes of candidates was wrong. Yet the practice continues.
A Presidential candidate distributed various gift items among the voters in an effort to promote himself. It was a deliberate act that violated the law. When the law is violated at such high level voters become victims.
Even in the single case of the distribution of white cloth in temples among the faithful as a campaign tool, which came before the Courts there are certain developments that create anxiety among the public as to the role of the prosecution. All these developments show that the Sri Lankan judicial system has been so far unable to recover fully from the trauma experienced during the last regime.
The breakdown of Law and Order creates anarchy in society. It harms discipline. Many talk about the loss of discipline but it is only one aspect of a bigger social problem. That is the breakdown of discipline throughout society in all its spheres. Lack of discipline among teachers and students is also a part of the bigger problem. When discipline breaks down efficiency suffers in all spheres of human activity including the vital sphere of the economy. Hence development too is endangered. It creates a situation in which corruption and misuse of public property prevails. Criminal activities become daily occurrences and stablishes new norms of conduct.
Another point is that certain groups tend to take the law into their own hands. A classic example is the action of enraged mobs following a fatal road accident. However, there the action is spontaneous and not pre-planned. Though it cannot be condoned worse still is re-meditated taking over of the Law into one's own hands by groups vested with certain powers, be they economic or political. Thus many MPS and Ministers have become goons in their own right by virtue of the position they hold in society. Even their henchmen oppress the innocent and power-less citizens.
Bribery and misuse of public property
Good governance is said to be the remedy for this situation. It implies the establishment of the Rule of Law and thereby end corruption, bribery and misuse of public property, the guaranteeing of the independence of the judiciary and the public service.
It is no mean task to establish good governance. It requires time as well as arduous struggle. A beginning in this direction has been already made with the establishment of independent commissions envisaged by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. However, problems still remain. For example, there are instances of nepotism in the new administration which runs contrary to the pledges given to the people in public. Let us hope that they will remain exceptions and not become the norm once again.
Hence, vigilance of the people is required to ensure the progress of good governance. It is up to the civil society and its leaders to make the people aware of the need for mass action to win a better life for themselves and their children. It is not a simple task that could be entrusted to those that have the privilege of being members of the House by the Diyawanna for a substantial number of such persons have no conscience as shown at the beginning of this essay.

President Sirisena emphasised that although it had been suggested through the media by some parties that the proposals in question had to be fully rejected, the government must face them. "It can be arranged and I shall hold a series of further all-party representatives meetings to gather your opinion regarding the proposals and how Sri Lanka should go about them as a sovereign democratic nation that respect human rights, truth and justice," he said.
"There current resolution is quite different in terms of its content in comparison to those resolutions that came intermittently on March 22, 2012 , March 21, 2013 and March 27, 2014," the President said. "It will be important to draw your attention to the proposals' main points," he said.
President Sirisena requested that they may submit their opinions regarding steps to be taken in view of the resolution concerned and the results of their deliberations in writing to the Presidential Secretariat within a two weeks after each meeting.

JVP MP Sunil Handunetti yesterday handed over a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya urging him to appoint a special committee to look into the possibility of granting voting rights to Sri Lankans abroad.
The MP through this letter signed by 22 parliamentarians representing the UNP and SLFP has urged the Speaker to appoint this committee to look into the possibility of granting voting rights to the Sri Lankans aboroad and make necessary recommendations to the House in this regard.
Every Sri Lankan has been ensured the voting right but the Sri Lankans expatriate community has not yet been ensured this right, the letter said.
The letter said that the Sri Lankan expatriate community is contributing enormously towards the economy of the country and it is the right of every government to prepare the ground for them to live with dignity.
The Parliamentarians requested the Speaker to appoint a committee to look into the possibility of granting them voting rights.

India should stop treating Sri Lanka as a friendly country
The DMK yesterday demanded that India should stop treating Sri Lanka as a "friendly country" and take steps for a credible international enquiry into allegations of war crimes against the Lankan army during the conflict with LTTE.
Citing the report by retired judge Maxwell Paranagama, tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, DMK chief M Karunanidhi stated that while backing a recent UN Human Rights Council report, the Paranagama panel had recommended that international judges should have a role to ensure the credibility of any investigation into war crimes.
"India should not treat Sri Lanka anymore as a friendly country and take efforts for holding credible and independent international probe about war crimes committed by the Sri Lankan army (besides) human rights violations and genocide," he said.
This probe should be held outside of Sri Lanka at a "common location" as that alone would ensure that "true culprits" will be found to ensure action could be taken against them, he said in a statement.
The DMK President referred to Paranagama, saying that there was evidence to suggest that footage obtained by the Channel 4 documentary 'No Fire Zone' showing Sri Lankan soldiers executing Tamil prisoners was genuine even as surrendering LTTE leaders were also allegedly killed. In the report dated August 2015, retired Judge Maxwell Paranagama had said that "There are credible allegations, which, if proved to the required standard, may show that some members of the armed forces committed acts during the final phase of the war that amounted to war crimes giving rise to individual criminal responsibility."
The probe panel commissioned by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, during whose tenure hostilities between the Army and the LTTE peaked, resulting in large civilian casualties, had said that to the list for investigation must be added cases of all those who were 'hors de combat' (out of action due to injury or damage) and allegedly perished while in custody of the Sri Lankan army. - PTI
