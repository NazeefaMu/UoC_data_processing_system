Back to  good  old days
These are the only two schools in Sri Lanka which are together divided by a thin wall, but one playground, motto and tie (gold, purple and maroon). They study together as children of twin mothers.
The past Pupils of the Prince and Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa held its Back To School programme recently at the grounds. They entered their own childhood classes under their old teachers.
This was organized by the members of the two Past Pupils Associations of the two schools under the purview of the two Principals Malini Samarakoon and Kusala Fernando.
The Chief Guests were their own past pupils: Ushan Wijewardhana representing the boys and his wife Sudeshi representing the girls.
It was a memorable and a jubilant event with much glamour added by school bands. Though they were in their 40s  60s, these elderly students have not forgotten the notes as yet.

Cabinet nod for National Trade Policy
A National Trade Policy (NTP) which aims to be more liberal, simple, transparent, and have a predictable trade regime promoting trade-led growth was approved by Cabinet this week.
The main measures envisaged under the NTP are to create; competitiveness through domestic policy reforms, market access and trade facilitation, macroeconomic balance, policy and institutional coherence and the adjustment of firms and people.
The NTP also identified the major problems of the Sri Lankan trade regime to be the promotion of production for domestic market through a high and complex import tariff regime, lack of attention to trade facilitation, low level of regional connectivity and ineffective trade agreements and the lack of supply side capacity for exports.
The new policy thus would seek to: Design and implement a comprehensive trade reform programme with timing and sequencing to re-focus the current distorted and opaque trade regime by rationalizing tariffs, para-tariffs and NTBs, minimizing the use of specific tariffs and consolidating tariff lines into three bands; conduct a comprehensive review of trade and investment related legal and regulatory structures and undertake necessary reforms in the areas including immigration in parallel to the envisaged expansion of trade agreement to safeguard domestic services and industries and protect consumer interests, negotiate deep and comprehensive trade agreements with all major trading partners, beginning with India, China and Singapore; establish a more liberal regime of trade in services, aiming to attract FDIs; develop a national single window for facilitation of trade, implement the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation, widen and deepen the tax net to reduce the budget deficit and compensate for the loss of revenue from trade taxes and from that of tariff and para-tariff reductions, if any; allow the increase of the exchange rate flexibility to reduce bias against exports and will develop Trade-cost Adjustment programmes to mitigate the adverse effects of trade liberalization on firms and people and to give time for adjustment.

Charge sheet filed against Padeniya: Court calls for written submissions
The Court of Appeal directed both complainant and respondent parties to file their written submissions on September 8 regarding the preliminary objections raised by Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya regarding a charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements, yesterday.
At a previous occasion, a charge sheet was, in open Court, served on GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya by the Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
However, Dr. Padeniya through his lawyer, had informed the Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the Court stenographer.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana appearing for the respondent, raised preliminary objections against the charge sheet.
However, Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya appearing for the petitioners, moved the Court to proceed with the charge sheet since the Court has already turned down the preliminary objections.
Two-judge-bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya directed the both parties to file their objections on September 8.
On a previous occasion, the Court had issued an Interim Order(IO) preventing GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this contempt of court action.
Two civil society activists; Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement, had filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by the Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment, demanding the annulment or setting aside of the said judgment.
The petitioners further stated, in this backdrop the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following Court decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
They stated that around April 7, the GMOA had organised an
island-wide trade union action against SAITM, halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners stated, the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice, especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under topic of 'Abolish SAITM' on April 4.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka.
They are further seeking an
Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge to impose sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

SCHOOL DROPOUTS IN plantation sector
The school dropout rate is high especially in plantation sector schools. The average primary school dropout rate in Sri Lanka is about 1.4 percent.
Around 10 to 25 percent students dropout in plantation sector. Government and social organisations should look into this problem and take early corrective action.
Only about 7 percent of students in plantation sector who pass their Ordinary Level exam continue to the GCE A/LEVEL and less than one percent of them complete their GCE A/LEVEL and enter university.
In Estate Sector, there are 830 schools with about 199,200 students.
Following are the reasons for the low educational achievements in the plantation sector schools:
Lack of transport facilities.
Unsafe school buildings.
Poor condition of classrooms.
Lack of desks, chairs, blackboards and textbooks.
Lack of drinking water and sanitation.
Main reasons for high dropout rate in schools is poverty, and lack of parent support. Very often the mother is working in Middle East as a housemaid. Many social ills such as alcoholism, fatalism, low self-value and low awareness of rights are some of the reasons.
We are spending our time, money and other resources to fight against SAITM and other private educational institutions. This is all nonsense.
We must spend our time and other resources to look into the problem of school dropouts and other problems related to extreme poverty.

Creative talent - key to success
The staff of an organisation is its most valuable asset thus managing, nurturing and keeping staff engaged and motivated is a key to an organisations ability to provide high-quality product and service. This requires the development of a creative talent management strategy which must be related to the organisations vision, mission, strategic goals, and objectives and to be implemented in daily processes throughout the organisation as a whole.
One of the most important goals of any organisation is to promote efficiency and effectiveness that could lead to organisational success. In this competitive and dynamic business era, learning and development has become a backbone of success thus without continuous learning gaining and maintain performance may become impossible. Talent is the primary driver of any successful organisation.
Successful organisations which practice effective learning and development begin with their employees. Organisations with first class learning and development initiatives are excellent in listening on employee improvement needs and are able to express those needs back to the employee in clear and enlightening terms.
The talent management strategy is at the centre of attention in many modern organisations. The effective implementation of a talent management strategy requires continuity and regularity because decisions in this area involve significant resources and their effects are only noticeable in the longer term.
Strategic objectives
A talent management process is part of strategic workforce planning, and an exercise that helps determine the future talent requirements an organisation will need to meet its strategic objectives. Talent identification and development, which is known as talent management, refers to the process by which an organisation identifies employees who are capable to play leadership role in future. Developing and implementing talent management requires the commitment of senior management as well as HR department and all the members of the organisation.
Modern enterprises face deficit of talented workers and find it difficult to retain human resources of a quality sufficient to ensure a competitive edge. The supply of highly qualified, commitment and incentivized personnel is at stake. Personnel of these calibres will generate a sustainable competitive edge. Attracting, retaining and developing talented workers are become crucial.
When staff hiring, organisations traditionally focus on competencies, knowledge, skills, work experience and qualifications as these are generally easier to articulate, identify and measure. However, values, traits, behaviours and motivational drivers are equally and sometimes more important. While the competencies and knowledge provide valuable information and insight about an individuals readiness for a particular role, traits and drivers help to reveal a persons potential for leadership.
As businesses continually apply new technologies, new business growth models, and new marketing strategies, the workforces up-skilling becomes constant and continuous. Understanding strategies to talent retention and development will be able to help to be successful in operating in the market place hence lead to good organisational performance.
Talent management
Many organisations understand the idea of a high potential pool or a group of people who receive more development attention. But unfortunately, most of the organisations too often fail to engage in the activities that bolster their talent pipelines, equip individuals with business critical knowledge and skills, and properly deploy those individuals in positions that serve to develop and engage them. Organisations that have a strategic talent management programme in place generate more than twice the revenue per employee that those without programmes, have a low employee turnover rate, and have a higher level of employee engagement.
There are number of reasons why certain business leaders undervalue talent management. Some business leaders believe their organisations survive without top talent. Other business leaders may acknowledge that talent management is important, but not as important as other business functions like finance or technology. Still other business leaders simply fail to see the link between talent and their organisations business strategy because their backgrounds are not in HR and talent management.
Taking a leader from potential to readiness is an equally long process.
A recipe for five-star talent management includes a potent blend of content, expertise and technology. It takes best-in-class content to drive the assessment and development of people and a system constructed by knowledgeable experts who have seen a range of implementations. Software should support the process, but it cant stand alone.
Smart organisations need to offer staff stretch opportunities within the business which allow motivated individuals to work a set number of days per week or month in a completely different discipline or department. This process enables them to explore their transferable skills, their intellectual flexibility and offers the opportunity to develop their leadership potentials. Many organisations equate the concept of talent management with senior leadership succession management. While succession planning is obviously important, talent management must encompasses a far broader portion of the employee population. Value creation does not come from senior leadership alone. The ability of an organisation to compete depends upon the performance of all its key talent and its ability to develop and promote that talent.
Talent management practices can create the most permanent competitive advantages. New technologies and innovations can be easily be replicated by competitors and generates only temporary competitive advantages. Sustained competitive advantage comes from talent management practices in other words, how the organisation attracts, develops, retains, motivates, manages and rewards its talent.
Like a machine, a business will fail to operate successfully if key elements such as processes, systems and structure are misaligned or hindered by friction between those elements and like a machine, a business must be designed, operated and maintained. These functions are performed by the human capital employed by the enterprise indeed, talent typically is the single biggest lever for driving improvements to business performance thus an organisations talent inject capabilities that are very difficult for competitors to benchmark and replicate.
Competitive environment
More than any other asset, talent provides the potential for long-term competitive advantage. The talent pool is a group of employees with special traits and is source of future senior executives and these sources of talented employees can be internal or external. The best way to create a talent pool is the internal sources since the employees have already the knowledge of how business process work and can be incorporated directly into the new position and morale of workforce uplifted. However, if the organisation wants to introduce radical changes or to renew the culture, external sources are the best.
Most of the organisations today have an adequate supply of talent. However gaps exist at the top of the organisation, in the first to middle level leadership ranks, and the front lines. Talent is an increasingly scarce resource so it must be managed to the fullest effect. Along with the understanding of the need to hire, develop and retain talented people, organisations are aware that they must manage talent as a critical resource to achieve the best possible results.
In the current competitive environment, talented people are important in every field. Successful organisations know their talent management needs because they have designed and implemented a viable talent management strategy. In todays organisation, talent management needs to transform from a support activity to a competitive activity.

Earthen pots to control dengue spread
The earthen pot system introduced by Eheliyagoda Base Hospital Medical Superintendent J. A. S. P. Abeywickrama last year to reduce the spread of dengue has brought about successful results.
It was adopted by residents of Eheliyagoda town and several Grama Niladhari Divisions.
Dr. Abeywickrama said according to medical reports, dengue cases and the death rate has reduced in the areas where the method was applied.
Under this system, over 10,000 earthen pots were distributed among families by the Ehelamal Movement that consisted of Eheliyagoda Base Hospital, Pradeshiya Sabha, Divisional Secretariat and several volunteer organizations.
The residents were instructed to fill the earthen pots partially with pure water and keep around their home gardens. The water should be emptied on a heap of sand every four days to destroy the mosquito larvae systematically.
Dr. Abeywickrama said he hopes to re-introduce the system soon.

Eliminating the dengue epidemic
The first possible solution came two weeks ago, in the announcement by Australias Minister ofForeign Affairs Julie Bishop during her visit here that Australia would aid Sri Lanka in its efforts to fight dengue. In the immediate, Bishop said, Australia would provide $500,000 through the World Health Organization, which would support theimplementation of a comprehensive DenguePrevention and Control Plan to enhance hospital triage and case management, cleaning, public awareness and surveillance systems
The deadliest creature on earth is not a great white shark nor a mountain lion; its a mosquito. Causing over 725,000 human deaths each year, the mosquito is responsible for the transmission of diseases including malaria, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and dengue, among others.
In Sri Lanka, the transmission of the dengue virus by mosquitoes has been particularly bad this year. Since January 1, the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health has reported over 110,000 cases of dengue fever and nearly 300 deaths. This is a rate over four times higher than the average number of cases for the same time period between 2010 and 2016.
But now, in the midst of a dengue outbreak so bad, its being considered an epidemic, there might finally be some light at the end of the tunnel.
Australia Commits To Helping
The first possible solution came two weeks ago, in the announcement by Australias Minister of Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop during her visit here that Australia would aid Sri Lanka in its efforts to fight dengue.
In the immediate, Bishop said, Australia would provide $500,000 through the World Health Organization, which would support the implementation of a comprehensive Dengue Prevention and Control Plan to enhance hospital triage and case management, cleaning, public awareness and surveillance systems.
Flanked on the stage by Professor Scott ONeill from Australias Monash University, Bishop then explained a second, longer term aid project: the introduction of the Eliminate Dengue Programme to Sri Lanka. Founded by ONeill as a subset of the Universitys Institute of Vector-Borne Diseases, the Eliminate Dengue Programme works by injecting Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes with the Wolbachia bacteria, found naturally in 60 percent of insects, including fruit flies. The Wolbachia bacteria, in turn, prevents the infected Aedes Aegypti from developing and transmitting dengue. Released into the wild, these Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes then mate with other mosquitoes who may have the capacity to transmit dengue and pass on the Wolbachia bacteria, preventing the transmission of dengue from that mosquito population.
Asked about the Eliminate Dengue Programme coming to Sri Lanka, ONeill said, Its great to see our project starting there. However, he stressed that unfortunately, this was not going to solve the current dengue outbreak.
Its not an immediate response to the current outbreak. It takes quite a long time to put in place. And its really more of a long-term preventative measure for the country rather than immediate outbreak response. As he explained, the programme takes time to set up, and will allow for the Wolbachia bacteria to be injected into mosquitoes in Sri Lanka to eventually be released here.
Weve just announced the launch of the programme, but the first steps of the program will be us actually designing it with the Ministry of Health. So we dont have a lot of specifics that we can give people right now about where it will arrive first, because that is still being determined by the Ministry of Health. So the first couple of months are us designing and putting in place the programme design, and then well be in a preparatory phase for 6 to 9 months after that before we are actively looking at communities.
Still, he said, Wed expect the program to run over the next eighteen months.
Already, the programme is up and running in multiple countries outside of Australia, including Vietnam, Indonesia, India (in Pondicherry), Colombia, and Brazil. Asked if there were any countries currently implementing the Eliminate Dengue Programme which bared some resemblance to the current situation in Sri Lanka, ONeill replied in the affirmative.
In some aspects, I think probably Indonesia is closest to what well do in Sri Lanka, based on the ecology that Ive seen so far. And the programme we have working in Jakarta, Indonesia is going very well, and I hope that we would have similar results in Sri Lanka.
Local Solutions
Yet in addition to importing solutions to dengue from outside of the country, there are also solutions to the problem being advanced right here at home. Take, for example, a new biological agent developed by Sri Lankas own Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), a form of the Bacillus Thuringiensis Israelensis (Bti) bacteria.
Using local sources of Bti isolated from Sri Lankan soil and water samples, ITI has developed a liquid formulation of the bacteria.
This liquida larvicidecan be sprayed on standing pools of mosquito larvae and paralyze them, eventually killing them and preventing them from developing dengue and spreading it.
This dengue season, the Bti liquid formulation has been sold to Bio Power Lanka Pvt Ltd., who have produced it on a wholesale level and distributed it to agencies like the Ministry of Health and various municipal councils, said ITI Research and Development Additional Director General Dr. Radhika Samarasekera.
Crucial to the way Bti works is that the bacteria is a biological agentas opposed to other insecticides, which are more often than not synthetic.
Whereas mosquitoes and their larvae can develop resistance to synthetic killing agents, and whereas these synthetic agents have to be sprayed over and over again to be effective, biological agents like Bti, which are by their definition alive, are harder to develop resistance against, and reproduce on their own naturally. In this regard, biological agents like BTI continue to be effective long after when theyve been sprayed.
Unfortunately, ITIs strand of Bti can only be used to kill mosquitoes in their larval phasenot once theyve matured into adults. As such, until the Eliminate Dengue Programme arrives in Sri Lanka, other methods will be required to try and reduce the rate of dengue.
Such solutions can be drawn upon from other countries who are also attempting to manage outbreaks. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, LED street lamps with an artificial human scent have been used to lure and then kill mosquitoes.
Developed by researchers at the University of Malaya, these lamps are powered by solar and wind and produce a low level of carbon dioxide that is difficult for mosquitos to resist. Sucked into a decoy capture net with a suction fan, the mosquitoes are then unable to escape and die.
Prevention still the best cure
Still, as most experts agree, until dengue is completely eliminated from Sri Lanka, the basic steps to take that are aimed at prevention must also be followed, such as avoiding the outdoors during certain hours, spraying repellent, and wearing clothing with coverage. Dr. ONeill from the Eliminate Dengue Programme said, Unfortunately, as we know, in all countries, current approaches arent working very well. As a result, their recommended procedures are not stopping dengue transmission at the moment in Sri Lanka. But without them, the situation could be a lot worse.
So its important that they continue their work Still, he emphasized, there is much room and much necessity for new innovations in our approach to eradicate dengue.
Whats clear from the experience not just in Sri Lanka, but in most tropical countries in the world at the moment is that the dengue situation is getting worse and we need new approaches.
And were quite hopeful that the approaches that we want to bring to Sri Lanka have the potential to have a significant impact, and in the future, to help prevent such large outbreaks from occurring.

Experts urge need for research, innovation
Sri Lanka needs to reactivate plans to make Trace Expert City a space for IT research and innovation and similar facilities should be promoted and enabled in Jaffna, Matara, Kandy and Kurunegala, said Rohan Samarajiva, founding Chair of LIRNEasia, at the recent Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 held in colombo.
Moreover, measures should be taken to encourage angel and venture capital finance and promote incubators and accelerators, while providing incentives for Lankan companies to create space for innovation.
Meanwhile, Project Director of the Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation, Professor Ajith De Alwis said that Sri Lankas innovation eco-system is disconnected and disjointed, despite the fact the country has 66 institutions under 20 line ministries which are capable of R&D and being a part of the innovation process.
Of 66 institutions, 17 come under the public university system and Sri Lanka is not maximizing the existing resources to achieve greater economic prosperity.
Claiming that Sri Lankas expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP is way below than least developing countries, De Alwis revealed that Sri Lanka spends 0.1% of GDP on R&D as against the recommended level of 1%.
According to Prof. De Alwis, in terms of R&D, Sri Lanka has quite small inputs spread across in the public system under a large number of institutions which are operating in different compartments.
When we dont make use of our synergies, its an unfortunate situation.
It is also unfortunate that the public sector doesnt understand the private sector requirements and sometimes the private sector doesnt understand what the public sector does. The gap needs to be bridged by communication.
Prof. De Alwis also urged the need to maximize the available resources and execute a planned approach to increase the resource base.

Faiszer declines to comment on Ravi: Wait till the Commission concludes its inquiry

Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha today repeatedly declined to comment on allegations against Minister Ravi Karunanayake, maintaining that it is the responsibility of the UNP to react to them.
Minister Musthapha, responding to a myriad of questions by journalists at a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters, stated that the SLFP would articulate its stance on the findings of Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the bond issue once its proceedings are over.
The Commission is still sitting. I am a lawyer and Presidents Counsel by profession. It is not ethical for me to make any statement at this stage. Lets wait till the Commission concludes its inquiry, the Minister said.
Finding himself in a swirl of questions, Musthapha replied, In any Government there can be thieves. It has been the case with all succeeding Governments in our country.
Asked what would be the SLFP stance if a No Confidence Motion against Karunanayake was presented, Musthapha said it would be decided at that time.
The Minister however highlighted that it was the Presidents initiative to set up the PCoI which paved the way for latest revelations.

Further amendments to the new electoral system

The newly introduced mixed electoral system of the Local Government bodies will undergo another amendment soon.
Local Governments and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha said the government will amend the system by changing the First-Past-the-Post(FPP) representation to 60 percent and proportional representation to 40 percent.
He said that the amended Bill will be presented in Parliament next week.
The minor parties were insisting to increase the allocation for proportional representation. Accordingly, the Government has now decided to bring down the FPP representation from 70 to 60 percent and increase the proportional representation from 30 to 40 percent, the Minister said.
The Minister said the total number of LG Councillors would be 8,542 as the new amendment implies.
Out of that 1,400 will be female Councillors. The number of candidates elected from the FPP will be 5,092.
The Minister added that an Amendment Bill proposing to hold elections for all Provincial Councils on a single day will also be presented to Parliament shortly.
The amendment received Cabinet approval. The practice of holding Provincial Council elections separately paves the way for misuse of public property and abuse of ruling power, thus distorting the peoples mandate. The Election watchdog bodies are also in agreement with this position. This is not an attempt to delay the elections, he insisted.
He said as per the draft Amendment a specific date would be fixed for holding the elections for all Provincial Councils.
This date has to be decided collectively by Parliament. The resolution in this regard will be presented either by the Leader of the House or me on behalf of the Government, the Minister said.
The Minister, observing that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has already received a large number of applications to contest for the upcoming LG elections, said the party would give priority to educated and intelligent individuals with clean hands.
The new hybrid system sans preferential votes would help community leaders and individuals with clean hands to come to the fore. The peoples mandate was not properly reflected in the preferential vote system. Only the affluent could afford to enter the election fray. A change in electoral system is a timely need of the country, Musthapha said.
We need new faces in our political landscape. The SLFP accepts this challenge. Teachers, engineers, doctors and community leaders are among those who have sent us applications for LG nominations, the Minister said.
The Minister said increasing the quota for women is a progressive move by the Government, adding that the studies have revealed that corruption is lower and efficiency is high in administrative bodies women are in.

GMOA requests for NFTH ownership agreement copy from government
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) expressed its disapproval of the Government's failure to provide a copy of the agreement signed which saw the ownership of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) handed over to the Government, yesterday.
The GMOA sent a letter to the Health Ministry Secretary, asking him to issue a copy of the agreement under the Right to Information Act.
The GMOA also charged that the nationalization of the NFTH is only the fulfillment of the wishes of Dr. Neville Fernando and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and not the people of this country.
Addressing the media at the OPA yesterday, GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen de Zoysa said the nationalization of SAITM is not a people-friendly decision and it was a decision by Minister Rajitha Senaratne only for the betterment of Dr. Neville Fernando.
He predicted that Minister Dr. Senaratne and those who are involved in the SATIM financial fraud would be summoned by a special commission to obtain statements.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the Government had placed the lives of people in danger by allowing people to receive treatment at NFTH without recruiting trained doctors and nurses.
He said that SAITM needs 200 medical officers, 6 dental surgeons, 30 consultants and 350 nurses. The entire health sector of the country would be badly affected, if the government will take measures to transfer medical officers, consultants, nurses and others from government hospitals to the NFTH.
Addressing the occasion, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Chandana Dharmaratne said SAITM was not an issue of the medical fraternity, medical students or the university students; it is the public's issue.
"If this SAITM saga continues, it would have a detrimental effect on people's lives and free healthcare system in this country, as well as the free education system," he said.
"We doubt the hospital was actually taken over by the government. Because the Chairman is still the same person and the medical director says he is still the medical director, though a new director has been appointed by the health minister," he added.
He further said the health ministry is spending Rs. 240 million per year as operational expenditure. The loan amount is Rs. 3 billion. Neville Fernando has paid Rs. 1 billion up to now another Rs. 2 billion still remain. The loan amount will be paid by Nevil Fernando, Rs. 300 million per year and the government will spend Rs. 2.4 billion per year.
We ask the rationale behind the taking over of the NFTH, instead of nationalizing the entire SAITM institute. NFTH is not providing free treatment for the people of the country. If 150 students are enrolled to SAITM, Neville Fernando will collect Rs. 1.8 billion as fees, he added.
He further said the hospital was running at a loss, but SAITM has profits. So what is at a loss has been taken over by the Government and is being run with the peoples money for the benefit of an individual and his family. "The deans of all medical faculties have agreed that SAITM has to be abolished and the recruitment of students as well as degree awarding has to be stopped.
"As a democratically-elected government, listen to the voice of the people and nationalize SAITM; bring about a solution to this burning issue as soon as possible for the benefit of the people of the country," Dr Chandana added.

Have  Flawless Skin!
How to get a glowing skin How to have flawless skin These are the questions that most of us ask the skin specialists and dermatologist and which need a satisfying answer. Clear glowing skin is a dream for every person. No one likes pimples, zits, dark spots, baggy eyes or dark circles. There are different skin types and different problems associated with them. Dry skin can get itchy sometimes and needs to be hydrated often to keep it glowing. Oily skin is prone to pimples and has a greasy texture. Some people have normal skin, which is Gods gift, and then
there are people with combination skin who have to face the problems of both dry skin and oily skin. Perfect skin is not too oily or dry but needs to be taken care with regular toning and cleansing. There are various types of facial masks made with natural ingredients which can also help in providing natural glow to the skin.
Nutritious, Fiber Rich Diet:
Everything healthy starts from your diet. Digestive problems result in skin impurities; hence diet is really essential for healthy skin. Taking in the right amount of micro-nutrients and vitamins is great for clear skin. Food for glowing skin should be carefully selected natural protein foods like fish, nuts and white meat, grains like buckwheat, brown rice and quinoa, vegetables like broccoli, tomato and beets are very healthy and good for the skin.
Fiber rich foods
Try to avoid processed and man-made food. Omega3 fatty acids are great to reduce inflammation; this is found in walnuts, salmon and soybeans. Eat plenty of healthy food to keep your skin glowing. More intake of fruits and vegetables will leave you with spotless, clear skin.
Drink Water:
As we know there are many health benefits of drinking water and juices, one of the best is to help your skin to purify the impurities, and glowing skin tips are incomplete without the inclusion of this essential point. Water cleanses the body and eliminates the toxins and waste. It hydrates the body and removes excess oils and dirt. 15% of our skin is made up of water. Drinking at least 2 liters per day gives the skin a bright, noticeable change in less than a week. It rids your skin from dryness and wrinkles. It also boosts the immune system. The importance of juicing for healthy skin also needs no new emphasis.
Avoid the Sun:
The sun is a great source for vitamin D. The morning sun from 7am to 9am is good for the skin. However avoiding the sun after this time is very essential. The UV rays are quite strong and they not only damage the texture of the skin but over exposure to these rays can result in skin cancer. Avoid the sun especially from 10 am to 2 pm as the sun rays can get really harsh, and this is a must for even normal skin care.
Avoiding sun
Try to wear clothing that covers most of your skin and carry an umbrella if possible. Apply sunscreen with SPF above 45 while going outdoors. Soothing natural remedies are the best answer to the question of how to remove sunburn and skin tan.
Skin Hydration:
Hydrating the body from inside and outside is important. Cleanse your face twice every day, washing your face more than this can result in dryness. The natural oils produced by the skin are required to nourish it and provide flawless beauty and skin care. Use cold water to cleanse your face after washing it, as warm water opens the pores which allow bacteria and dirt to enter into them.
Get the Daily Dose of Vitamin C
One of the most important vitamins for healthy and flawless skin is vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid that helps in enhancing the complexion and preventing the appearance of the signs of skin aging. Regular intake of vitamin C improves collagen production, enhances skin brightness, keeps away age spots and pigmentation and enhances the skins ability to protect itself from the damage caused by the harsh UV rays of the sun. -Indiafit

The Hayleys Fabric production facility was forced to shut down in the last week of May due to the flooding of Kalu Ganga.The impact of floods rolled over to June as most of employee houses were under water for several days and this resulted in heavy absenteeism and a loss in production volumes by almost half during the first week in June. It is reported that this had been the worst flood in over 30 years in this area.
The month of April generally makes a loss due to the factory closure for 10 days for the Sri Lankan New Year and annual preventive maintenance. The order book was full and the Company was confident in turning around in the months of May and June after covering up losses in April. Unfortunately, The Companys own brand INNO has made the Company attract higher value products and the order book continues to be full and the Company is confident of recovering its losses during the second quarter.

India will then welcome New Zealand for three ODIs and three T20 matches, followed by Sri Lanka for a return series with three Tests, three ODIs and three T20s.
India are currently touring Sri Lanka. The two sides meet Thursday for the second of three Tests after the hosts were thrashed in the first, and they then play five ODIs and one T20. Sri Lanka had previously been expected to tour India next March. But the Board of Control for Cricket in India adjusted the schedule because the island is hosting the Independence Cup over that period. "Sri Lanka has always co-operated with India and therefore India will be making a reciprocal short visit only to play the Independence Cup," BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary told reporters on Tuesday.
"Another reason being there are six proposed exchange of tours between India and Pakistan which did not happen, so those spaces had to be adjusted."
India are slated to tour South Africa for a full series after completing their matches against Sri Lanka.

India returns to venue where it all began
India returns to the SSC grounds for the second Test against Sri Lanka with vivid memories of the match that saw them make the turnaround towards their current golden run in Test cricket where they find themselves ranked number one.
It was two years ago that Virat Kohli in his first series as captain won the third and final Test played here to clinch the three-match series 2-1. That win marked a remarkable run for India in Test cricket that has seen them reel off six consecutive series victories.
Kohli was all praise for the SSC pitch which he described as great.
I had a look at the wicket yesterday, I haven't seen it today (Wednesday) yet. Looked pretty nice and hard underneath with a good covering of grass, said Kohli.
The last time around as well, we thought it was a great wicket for Test cricket. Batsmen had to apply themselves to get runs; bowlers were in the game throughout. It is a wicket that you will get a result on for sure.
That excites us, it's something that we look forward to as a team and this is the kind of wicket that we always like to play on, where we have a chance to make an impact on the game throughout. I really enjoyed playing here last time, and I think it's a great wicket for Test cricket, he said.
Although Kohli didnt commit himself to naming the Indian squad he confirmed that Lokesh Rahul would return to the side to open the batting. Rahul was sidelined for the Galle Test by a viral fever and in his place Abhinav Mukund played opening the batting with Shikhar Dhawan.
Obviously KL has been our established opener. I feel one of the openers will have to make way for KL because, what he's done in the past two years for us has been very solid, and he deserves to come back and start fresh in Test cricket again, said Kohli.
Again, that's up to discussions. We have a team meeting later on, after practice. We'll be able to clarify that then, but yes, according to me KL will definitely come back into the eleven.
To make way for Rahul, one of the openers at Galle will have to stand down.
I feel in a situation like this, you need to sit down and think which player has had more impact on the game. Who has been able to sort of make that difference in the game straight away, said Kohli. It all depends on who has had a better game, to be honest. Its a pretty thin line, it is a very small margin but unfortunately, that is how the sport goes sometimes.
The lessons India learnt from the Galle Test victory are few and far between.
One thing we need to be aware of is when there is a partnership or something happening, then we need to have more composure and more discipline at times. But there always will be a few scratches here and there when you are playing Test cricket after March, said Kohli.
It is always nice to understand what are the things you lack in and build some momentum as the series progresses. Yesterdays (Tuesday) practice was really good, the guys were hitting their areas really well and I am pretty confident that those areas that we identified in the first game, we will be able to rectify and move ahead and actually improve on those things starting from this game.

Institution Heads urged to provide creche facility for breastfeeding mothers
The Heads of some state institutions do not understand that their breastfeeding employees need a creche facility. Some mothers give up breastfeeding on misinformation and feed their infants with milk powder, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing the media at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said some state institutions have provided creche centre facilities for their breastfeeding employees. Creche centre facilities are available in some private banks. Only the State sector offers 84 working days of maternity leave, he said.
According to Dr. Bandara, a request has been made by the Health Ministry from estate sector authorities to provide creche facilities for their breastfeeding employees.
"When a country moves forward, it needs to protect and develop human capital. This is why we need to ensure that every infant gets breast milk which prevents diseases and ensure immunity," Bandara said.

ISIS, Global Warming considered top security threats by most of the world

People around the world consider climate change to be a top security threatand in some casesthebiggest threat, according to a survey published Tuesday byPew Research Center.
The poll surveyed 42,000 adults in38 countries and asked them to prioritizeeighttypesof perceived threats, includingconcern about the economy,cybersecurity, climate change, andISIS.
Of course, views on all these issuesvariedwidely depending on region, age, and the political leanings of those who were surveyed.
In most cases, especially in most western European countries, climate changeranks insecond place when its not a top concern.Overall 13 countriessurveyedmost clustered in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africaranked global warming asthetop concern.
Eighteen nations picked ISIS.
Americans tend to considerISIS and cybersecurity to be greater threats than climate change,in comparison to Canada and most European countries.
Out of the eight issues polled, Americans rank climate changethird (56 percent),while 74 percent rankISIS as number one, and 71 percent see cyberattacks as a top threat.
Cybesecurity also comes in second in Germany and the UK, which were also recent victims of high-profile attacks.
Among those who do consider climate change a major security threat, the US is also uniquely polarized.
Eighty-sixpercent of liberals say climate change is a major concern, while only 31 percent of conservatives say the same. The right-left divideexists in other countries, but no country approachesthe 55-point gapin the US.
Though terrorism dominates the news when an attack occurs, in terms of sheer scale, the threat of climate change is far greater.
Obamawas criticizedfor saying as much as president, but national security experts have been making these connections for years,warningthat global warming is a catalyst for conflict, and growing cause for instability. 
Hundreds of thousands of peopledieeach year from heat waves, flooding, and other climate-related impacts, while millions more die from breathing bad air.In contrast, terrorism killed29,376globally in 2015 for the second-deadliest year on record, according to Institute for Economics and Peaces annual index.
Theres one other way US exceptionalism comes through in this survey: Pew also asked respondents about their concern over Russia, China, and US influence and power. Thanks to Trumps unpopular reputation abroad, concern about the US role is on the rise.

Jamaican sprinter says dopers must stop or athletics 'will die'
Usain Bolt says athletes who dope must "stop or the sport will die" as he prepares to race for the final time in his illustrious career.
Bolt, an eight-time Olympic champion and icon of world sport, will retire after this month's World Championships.
The Jamaican, 30, will run in the 100m and 4x100m at the Worlds, which begin in London on Friday.
"Hopefully athletes will see what's going on and what they need to do to help the sport move forward," he said.
Referring to the McLaren report, which uncovered evidence of a Russian state-sponsored doping programme, he added: "Personally I think we were at rock bottom. After the scandal on Russia I don't think it gets any worse than that.
"Over the years we're doing a better job, it's getting clean and we're catching up to a lot of athletes. There's an understanding that if you cheat you will get caught. Over time the sport will get better.
"I said a couple of years ago it had to get really bad, when there's nowhere else to go but up. Doping is always a bad thing and it's never pleasant because you put in the hard work and the sport starts going forward and then you have other guys bringing it back, it's hard.
"It's going in the right direction so hopefully it will continue in that direction."
'I'm still the fastest'
The men's World 100m final is on Saturday, 5 August, while the men's 4x100m relay race - which will mark the end of Bolt's career - is on the following Saturday.
Bolt has won 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold at the past three Olympic Games - Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016.
Listen to Bolt: 100 days that shook the world (19.30 BST, 1 August, BBC Radio 5 live and as a podcast shortly after broadcast)Watch: The Heroes of Super Saturday
Listen: 'Bolt changed funeral atmosphere before races'
However, his unprecedented 'triple triple' of nine gold medals was downgraded to eight after Jamaican team-mate Nesta Carter, who was part of the quartet that won the 4x100m in Beijing, tested positive for a banned substance. Carter has appealed against the decision.
Nevertheless, Bolt's exploits remain unprecedented and he also holds the world record in the 100m (9.58 seconds) and 200m (19.19).
Asked if he still believes he is the fastest in the world, the Jamaican replied: "Yeah, without a doubt.
"The last race I ran was a 9.95, so that shows I am going in the right direction. After the two rounds leading up to the 100m final, which always help me, it's all about who keeps their nerve. "I have been here many times. I know I am ready."Asked in an interview with BBC Sport whether he believes his world records will be broken, he replied: "I hope they're not. No athlete would ever wish for that - I want to brag to my kids when they're in their 20s: 'See, I'm still the best!
"There is no-one around now, in this era, who can do it. No. Maybe in a couple of years, 10 years, but my records are safe for now."
Athletics after Bolt
Bolt was also asked which of the current stars of track and field could potentially replace him as the pre-eminent force in the sport.
He named South African 25-year-old Wayde van Niekerk, who will be competing in the 400m and 200m in London.
"Wayde van Niekerk is proving he is a world star. He has broken the 400m world record, he ran the fastest 300m ever, and now he's doing the 200m also. For me, he's proving that he can step up to the plate," said Bolt.
"I'm watching him, we've had discussions and he's a cool person but I've told him to open up his personality a little bit because he's really laid back."
Bolt after athletics
Bolt says he will miss the "thrill" of being on the track but that it is time for him to slow down and enjoy himself.
"The energy when you first walk out on the track and the people go crazy, that's what I'll miss the most," he said.
He might manage to replace the buzz of competing with one of his hobbies, though.
"I ride quad bikes, that's an adrenaline rush," he said.
"But I think it's time for me to slow down a little, relax a little bit. Enjoy myself as much as possible."
He says he does not think he will re-consider his retirement as he has nothing left to prove - and of his legacy added that he wanted to be considered among the greatest sports figures of all time.
"I just want to be one of the greats," he said.
"Whenever there's a conversation about the greatest sports stars, I want to be part of that conversation. I want people to say: 'Yeah, Usain Bolt was one of the greatest'."
Asked if it was his mind or body saying 'enough', he replied: "It's the body, definitely.
"Over the years, I've got more niggling injuries than anything else, simple little things, but it's just because I'm getting older. The pounding means my body's just deteriorating now, so for me it's just time to go."

Kandy eagerly awaits the Indian cricketers
Kandy is waiting eagerly for the test and the two one day games between Sri Lanka and India. The Kandy Test will be played from August 12 to 16 which will be the Third Test and the 2nd one day on August 24 and 3rd one day on August 27 all at the Pallekelle Stadium.
Eight-four years have passed since All Ceylon toured Indian on their first official visit to India in 1932/33. Since playing its first Test against India in 1982/83.
Indias last tour of Sri Lanka was two years ago in August 2015 when they played a Test series which they won 2-1. India won its last ODI series 4-1 in 2012.
In the same year, India also won a T20 series 1-0 against Sri Lanka. Since 1985, India have played 22 Test matches in Sri Lanka, winning seven (last was on 29 July 2017), losing seven and drawing eight. Turning the pages of time one can go back to the 1985 Test match where Sri Lanka under the captaincy of Duleep Mendis beat India led by Kapil Devi in the 2nd test to win their maiden test series. In 1985 it was the first visit of the Indians to Sri Lanka almost four years after the hosts obtained Test status.
Sri Lanka, had not registered a Test victory and not many gave them a chance. In this series the first test was played at SSC and was drawn. However in the second Test at the P Sara Oval Sri Lanka recorded their maiden and historic first Test win.
Rumesh Ratnayake was the match winner with nine wickets and Amal Silva scored a hundred and held nine victims as wicketkeeper.
The final Test was played at the Trinity College Cricket stadium Asgiriya Kandy. India trailing 0-1 needed to respond in Kandy but it was the same story like in Colombo, the batsmen failed yet again. This time round Saliya Ahangama took a five-wicket haul. India elected to bat first and it was only Dilip Vengsarkar who was able to score a half-century as India folded for 249. Sri Lanka were bowled for 198.
Left-arm spinner Maninder Singh gave India hope with four wickets. In the second innings. Mohinder Amarnath made an unbeaten 116 and Ravi Shastri 81 which meant India set Sri Lanka a big target of 377 runs.
The Lankans knew they had to bat out the rest of the match to draw the final Test and win their maiden series. The Sri Lankans were given an early scare by Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma who reduced them to 34/3. That brought captain Duleep Mendis and Roy Dias to the middle and these two went on to score centuries and they shared a partnership in excess of 200 runs to put paid to Indias hopes of leveling the series.
Duleep Mendis made a classic 124 and Roy Dias 106 as the Sri Lankans managed to draw the test to register their maiden series win. In the Kandy test, BR Jurangpathy played his first test and the umpires were Nelson Gooneratne and Dooland Buultjens.

Minister urges journalists not to misuse media
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera urged media personnel not to misuse the media freedom.
The Sri Lanka Press Council (SLPC), which started in 1973, has been doing a yeoman service to the media sector while abiding by the principles on which the SLPC was formed, he said.
The minister made these observations at a certificate awarding ceremony of Diploma in Media Studies and Journalism of the Sri Lanka Press Council (SLPC) at the BMICH yesterday.
President Maithripala Sirisena was the Chief Guest. The SLPC stood for press freedom and fulfilled readers or viewers aspirations, the minister said.
The SLPC is working to arm journalists with knowledge, ability and media ethics. The SLPC is duty bound to protect media freedom. It is also important not to allow destructive elements to misuse the media freedom, he said.
"It is important to create self-disciplined journalists rather than control media by regulations and guidelines, he said.
Former governments imposed regulations, circulars and restrictions to control the media. Such practices hampered the media freedom of the country from time to time, he said.
Quoiting part of a book titled Lankawe Puwathpath Mella Kirima of late journalist Gunadasa Liyanage, the minister said media freedom is destroyed, when the media of a country is controlled or suppressed by the government. Media freedom will come to an end if media organisations fail to understand the gravity or the responsibility of the media, he said.
"After January 8, 2015, it is observed that there is media freedom. Journalists can perform their duty without any interference of the government," Minister Samaraweera said. About 13 journalists were killed during the previous regime. Journalist Pradeep Ekneligoda is still missing. About 84 journalists were assaulted. Several persons were jailed. Lanka e-news, Sirasa, Siyatha and a few other media institutions were attacked, while several other institutions were threatened. The then government not only attacked journalist, but also created a white van culture, the minister said.
Present President Maithripala Sirisena could end the dark era after becoming the President of the country, he said.
Minister Samaraweera said media censoring is no longer valid in the 21st century. Journalist are duty bound to report news without resorting to fabrications, he said.

Most Venerable Aggamaha Pandita Kotugoda Dhammavasa Maha Nayaka Thera: TIRELESS TEACHER
Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasa Maha Nayaka Thera is admired and appreciated bythe Buddhists as one of the most appealing preachers in the country. He had this potential from his younger days, and this he cultured taking it into great benefits, making him a much sought after preacher. For this he used his expertise Dhamma knowledge and blended it finally with his well trained and restrained discipline. He could keep the audiencespell-bound with his soft, lucid and ear-pleasing intoning of his speech
Sri Lanka has been, from the time of inception of Buddhism, a very fortunate country. One reason for this is that from time to time there appeared epoch-making religious leaders who succeeded in instilling hope in the minds of Buddhists and have been also able to inspire and direct the devotees to follow the right path. In Most Venerable Aggamaha Pandita Kotugoda Dhammavasa Maha Nayaka Thera, the newly appointed Supreme Maha Nayaka Thera of Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya, we see such a great religions dignitary who, with his impeccable and most exemplary conduct epitomizes the ideal of the fruit of monkhood. This great religious personality hails from a comparatively lesser known suburb of the Gampaha District, namely Kotugoda which has now shot into fame because of this famous Maha Nayaka Thera.
The family of Endavitharanage Haramanis Rodrigo and Selestina Rodrigo happened to be a pious well-to-do, respected, one with six children, consisting of four sons and two daughters. A new member, a boy, joined the family on January 21, 1933, bringing much joy to this family. The elated parents named this child as Endavitharanage Sirimevan Rodrigo. Being the youngest, he was the apple of the eye. In spite of being over-petted, Sirimevan turned out to be extremely obedient, showing a lot of restraint and maturity.
The parents, being ardent devoted Buddhists, had close contact with the village temple. Sirimevan studied under Venerable Kotugoda Pemananda Nayaka Thera, the chief prelate of the village temple. His formal primary education commenced with his admission to the Buddhist Mixed School in Kotugoda, run by the Buddhist Theosophical Society. This school is now well-known as Kotugoda Rahula Maha Vidyalaya. This marked a crucial period in his life as it was on August 17, 1948, that Sirimevan obtained admission to the Sangha Community as a novice. This happened as a result of the close friendship between Venerable Kotugoda Wimalaratana Thera and Sri Dharmapalamaya Chief Incumbent Unavatune Dhammapala Thera. Obtaining discipleship under Venerable Unavatune Dhammapala Thera, the new novice came to be called Kotugoda Dhammavasa and came to reside at Sri Dhamrapalaramaya, Mt. Lavinia.
Secondary Education
While staying in this Viharaya, he continued his religious studies at the Paramadhamma Cetiya Pirivena. Later he joined the Vidyodaya Pirivena, Maligakanda, where he continued his studies in Tripitaka and oriental languages such as Pali and Sanskrit. This gave him the opportunity of meeting and receiving instructions from most erudite scholar monks of the time such as Most Venerable Kalukondayawe Pannasekara, Welivitiye Sorata, Walane Satthissara and Parawahera Vajiranana Nayaka Theras. His association with Vajirarama temple and his great admiration for Most Venerable Narada Maha Thera and Venerable Piyadassi Thera made him get interested in Buddhist Missionary activities.
The young Theras higher ordination took place on July 10, 1954. On this occasion, Most Venerable Beruwala Sri Sumangala Siriniwasa Maha Nayaka Thera functioned as the Upajjhaya, while Most Venerable Ambalangoda Dhammakusala Maha Nayaka Thera, Most Venerable Moratuwa Sasanaratana Anunayaka Thera and Most Ven. Moratuwa Pemaratana Thera served as the Karmacarya.
Scholarly contribution
Following the higher ordination, Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera focused more on scholarship. He started writing articles on Buddhist subjects. These contributions, initially written to the press around the 1960s, were finally published in the book format to reach a wider audience. With the establishment of the Bauddhodaya Association at the Dhammapalaramaya temple in Dehiwala, he began publishing a Vesak annual to be distributed free of charge.
The Venerable Thera published quite a few booklets to develop faith among the ordinary followers. The well-known titles include Nivanata Maga, Ketumati Rajadhaniya, Kosala Raja Sihina and Dhammo Have Rakkhati Dhammacari. His writing made a great appeal to the common audience because of the serenity embedded. He used a lucid language and cited events and insights drawn from the revered Buddhist texts such as Tripitaka and the Jataka Book.
Missionary activities
Venerable Narada Nayaka Thera influenced Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera to be committed to missionary activities. The Thera visited countries such as India, Nepal, China, Japan, Germany, America, Pakistan, Thailand and Myanmar to propagate the Masters teachings. He was also instrumental in reviving the dilapidated temples in Myanmar and Nepal.
Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammavasa Maha Nayaka Thera is admired and appreciated by the Buddhists as one of the most appealing preachers in the country. He had this potential from his younger days, and this he cultivated to reap great benefits. He became a much sought after preacher. He blended his Dhamma expertise with the well-trained discipline. He could keep the audience spell-bound with his soft, lucid and ear-pleasing speech. He could communicate the most appropriate doctrinal points in a simple manner.
His diary was brimming with invitations to visit temples across the country. The listeners not only appreciated his preaching but generously made donations to establish temples out of respect for him.
He made use of the electronic media too for proper preaching.
Tireless serviceto foster the Sasana
With maturity in life, especially following the higher ordination, Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera began his tireless journey to every nook and corner of the island. As far back as the 1980s, Most Venerable Kosgoda Dhammavansa Maha Nayaka Thera, who noticed this commitment, invited Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera accept the position joint-secretary of the Sangha Council. The Thera accepted it humbly and discharged all duties expected of him to the best of his abilities. In appreciation of such blameless services, he was later appointed as the Secretary General.
Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera later became the President of the Sangha Council. Then he was made the Mahopadhyaya. As the Maha Nayaka position fell vacant following the demise of Most Venerable Davuldena Nanissara Thera, Venerable Aggamahapanditha Kotugoda Dhammavasa Maha Nayaka Thera was unanimously chosen to hold the office on May 26, 2017.
This long journey to success has been earmarked by various honorific ecclesiastical titles awarded to him. Among these honorific titles are Saddharmakirti Sri Tripitaka Visharada, Pravacana Kirti Sri Sasana Shobhana, Sri Sumangala Vidyavatansaka and Aggamaha Pandita.

New accident ward complex for Apura Teaching Hospital
The government will construct an accident ward complex at Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital which has been a long-felt need in the North Central Province.
The project is aimed at minimizing the number of deaths caused by traffic and other accidents, and to prevent people from becoming disabled, said Teaching Hospital Director Dr. Lionel Mohandiram.
The construction work of the building complex is scheduled to be commissioned by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The proposed four storeyed building complex will cost Rs. 370 million. The project and the estimates have been approved by the Cabinet.
Dr. Mohandiram said under the first phase, the first two storeys will be constructed. In the ground floor, there will be a short staying ward with 29 beds.
In the second floor for males and females, there will be two wards consisting of 58 beds. The building complex will consist of a well-equipped operation theatre, x-ray room and other essential medical facilities and appliances, Dr. Mohandiram said.
He added that during Vesak, Poson and Esala festivals and during other poojas, thousands of pilgrims visit Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. With this, the number of traffic accidents has also increased.
As such, the need of an emergency accident unit is vital. Construction work will complete by the end of 2018, Dr. Mohandiram said.

New paddy strains yielding good harvest in South
AT-07800 and AT-676 paddy strains introduced to farmers by the Ambalantota Paddy Research Centre were able to yield a good production, paddy cultivators said.
The AT- 07800 which is a white samba-nadu paddy strain and grains of rice of this variety are a little thin and long. The harvest can be reaped within a short period of three months since cultivation. Over 160 bushels of paddy can be harvested through this by cultivating in the dry zone.
In the case of wet zone, 120 to 130 bushels of paddy could easily be reaped. That is also highly resistant to pests, insect scourges and various other diseases, researchers added. AT- 676 is also a white nadu and samba paddy variety. The harvest can be yielded in three months since cultivation. Over 160 bushels of paddy can be harvested from this paddy strain too through the cultivation in the dry zone. In the wet zone cultivation, over 130 paddy bushels could easily be obtained from it.

Nil Balakaya king making arm of previous regime: Thalatha
The Nil Balakaya was formed with an intent of making a son of a politician a king of the country, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said yesterday.
Minister Athukorala was speaking at the distribution of a monthly grant of Rs. 7,500 as house rents for those who were displaced by the recent flood in the Elapatha Divisional Secretariat division.
The government will respect the peoples right to carry out protests. It will never use white vans or armed gangs to control protests," she said.
The government has ensured the peoples right to live peacefully. They can engage in protests against the government too," she said.
Minister Athukorala said those who were silent on SAITM and the Uma Oya project during the Rajapaksa era, have started organising protests demanding the government stop them.
Where were they when these projects were started in 2011, she asked. She said the government pays a compensation of Rs. 10,000 to every family affected by the recent floods.
Athukorala said the National Youth Services Council (NYSC) received step-motherly treatment during the previous regime.
The NYSC is heading towards a right direction under the supervision of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister Niroshan Perera, she said.
The minister said the government ended the era in which corruption reigned the country.
We ended an era in which government servants have undertaken road construction contracts," she said.

Offering historic Kasthana sword: Sri Lankans should thank Russia: Navinna
Sri Lankans should thank Russia and its President Vladimir Putin for their gesture to offer a historic Kasthana sword used by a Kandyan chieftain during the 19th century, Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S. B. Navinna said.
He made this observation yesterday dressing the handing over ceremony of the historic dagger (Kasthana sword) gifted to President Maithripala Sirisena by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his official visit to Russia, to the National Museum. The ceremony was held at the National Museum auditorium.
The Kasthana sword comprising Kandyan decorative art which was a prominent part of official attire of the Kandyan chieftain had been taken out of the country during the British administration to a destination in England. It had been displayed at an auction of antique items belonging to royal household and other dignitaries in 2006 and purchased by an anonymous Russian. However, Russian President Putin gifted the sword as a memento to President Sirisena.
Minister Navinna said Russian President Putin had a great respect to Sri Lanka and President Sirisena. He said Europe and other countries accept President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe due to the novel political tradition adopted by the country.

Opex Holdings invests Rs 550 mn in regions first liquid fertilizer plant
Opex Holdings (Pvt) Limited a pioneer company in the field of agriculture with over 40 years of experience has started manufacturing liquid fertilizer with an investment of Rs. 550 million. This first liquid fertilizer plant in South Asia will be inaugurated in Maradagamuna today.
This is a bid to slash the fertilizer import bill which is around Rs. 28 billion annually. All developed countries have moved away from the use of basic fertilizer which has reduced by 20% with the use of liquid fertilizer, said Onesh Subasinghe Managing Director said.
The objective of Opex is to commence the production of high quality liquid fertiliser with the use of advanced German technology. The company also intends to create a platform to sell high quality liquid fertilizer for a reasonably lower price. In the meantime the company is also looking for avenues to bring foreign exchange to the country by exporting the liquid fertiliser to foreign countries too.
Another major objective of Opex is to help the economy to reduce the Rs 28 billion that is spent on importing of fertilizer. Opex further expects the farmers to receive higher harvest. It is also environmental friendly and will cost lesser due to its distribution of liquid fertilizer expanding island wide.
He said that the liquid fertiliser that they manufactured using advance technology can reduce the water stress in a drought condition.
Around 40% of paddy fields have been abandoned due to drought and this liquid fertilizer can solve this issue too. This technology will produce higher harvest even in a drought condition.

Pakistan to resolve SL betel exports issue
Pakistan recently assured Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen that it will help resolve the growing crisis faced by 5,000 Lankan betel grower families.
We will give favourable consideration to the betel tax faced by Sri Lankan exporters, said Pakistan's Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmad Khan Sipra on July 31.
Minister Bathiudeen was meeting Dr Sipra on the import tax issue faced by Lankan betel leaf exporters to Pakistan.
On June 21, 2017, the Government of Pakistan imposed a Pakistani Rs 200 (SL Rs 291.00) per kg of new regulatory tax on betel leaf imports from Sri Lanka.
This was on top of the existing Pakistani Rs 343.00 (SL Rs 500) per Kg of Pakistani customs duty imposed on Lankan betel leaf as of June 21.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera has informed me of the plight faced by Sri Lankas betel leaf growers said Minister Bathiudeen. Pakistan has imposed a new regulatory tax on Sri Lankan betel imports. This has affected more than 5,000 farmers and their families in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Puttalam Districts. Pakistan is the only country where Sri Lankas betel leaves are exported to. Sri Lankan betel also the main betel leaf type imported from Pakistan. Lankan growers have informed us that there is a big yield in betel harvest this year but due to the new tax by Pakistan, they are unable to recover even their export duty costs. We need you to intervene and resolve this immediately. I am also talking about this with the Minister of Primary Industries Daya Gamage. This issue can impact on our bilateral trade volumes as well.
We will definitely give due and very favourable consideration to the issue of betel tax faced by Sri Lankan exporters, said Dr Sipra. The regulatory import tax imposed by Pakistan on betel leaves is not only for Sri Lankan betel leaves but for betel leaf imports from all countries as well, across the board. We want you to send a written official representation so that I can take it up with my government now and during our September Joint Economic Commission talks in Pakistan as well. There will be no immediate issue for Sri Lankan betel market in Pakistan since we believe the market will remain stable for the next five years.
Minister Bathiudeen also instructed the officials of the Department of Commerce to promptly follow up and submit necessary official requests through him.
Betel exporters present said that they are prepared to provide full details of their harvests and their export trends regarding the Pakistani market.
According to the Department of Commerce, Sri Lankan betel leaf exports to Pakistan saw a high of US$10.5 million in 2013. In 2014 it was at US$ 10.46 million then declined in 2015 to US$ 9.01 million and in 2016 to US$ 7.38 million.
However, this year the exports bounced back - in the first six months of 2017 alone totaling US$ 10 million.

Petition filed against animal cruelty
A public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court seeking an interim order, directing the Inspector General of Police and relevant authorities to take immediate measures to prevent the killing, murder, maiming, abusing or any other cruelty against dogs and cats.
Twenty nine individuals including 25 Buddhist monks filed this fundamental rights petition through Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena with counsel Charitha Rupasinghe and counsel Sandamali Chandrasekara.
The petitioners had cited the Inspector General of Police, Vice Chancellor of the Jayawardenapura University and 36 other parties as respondents.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Upaly Abeyratne and Justice Anil Gooneratne, the matter was fixed for support on September 12.
The petitioners stated that there has been an exponential, proliferation of the killing of dogs, within state institutions, public property, streets and other public places, under the control, supervision and over-arching administration of state and executive functionaries, which has reached alarming and chilling proportions, and which has resulted in a massive, concerted public outcry and public outburst against such unmitigated brutality, and inhumanenes.
The Petitioners stated that as Sri Lanka is a majority Buddhist country which includes a constitutional guarantee of Buddhism being given the foremost place, the term Ahimsa, the fundamental Sanskrit term meaning non harm, which is a simplified term encapsulating the aforesaid quote, is accepted as being one of the corner stone of Buddhism, and its significance is clearly demonstrated by the principle of refraining from killing expounded by the Buddha as the very first precept.
Ahimsa is a rule of conduct that prohibits the killing or injuring of all living beings. It is closely connected with the idea that all kinds of violence bring about negative karmic consequences and Buddhists have always condemned the killing of all living beings. Therefore, actions which result in the taking of life, directly or indirectly, contradicts this basic Buddhist precept, the petitioners added.
For instance, as recently as 15.07.2017, the petitioners are aware that the dogs and cats living within the premises of the Moratuwa University were poisoned (overdosed) and killed (by the illegal administration of Ketamine).
The Petitioners state that there is ample video evidence, depicting in the most graphic and disgusting and revolting manner, dogs bloated and suffering prior to dying. Furthermore, there is evidence that the dogs were brutally assaulted in the process.
The petitioners state that it is in these circumstances, especially in view of the horrendous series of killing of dogs that have been occurring recently, with frequency, notwithstanding the cabinet paper of the 5th respondent and the cabinet approval thereon, in violation that the Petitioners fear that seizure and killing dogs and/or pinioning and killing dogs and/or other cruel and inhumane practices, which cause the death and/or utterly unwarranted pain or suffering to dogs on a mass scale, urgent intervention in needed, given the authorities looking askance or even giving their indirect blessings to this despicable phenomenon.
The petitioners further an order directing the respondents to forthwith take all such measures to ensure that the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance.

Chithramala Ella also known as Hakurudola Ella or Wavul Ella situated near Marukanda close to Nedurana along Eheliyagoda - Idangoda Road is threatened by pollution.
Illicit gem mining along the upper stream and paddy fields of both sides of the stream pollutes water becoming a serious environmental problem.
This immaculate white cascading waterfall not only provides drinking water for a large number of people but also supplies water for hundreds of acres of paddy fields. It generates 350 kilo watts of electricity which feeds into the main power lines.
Chitramala Ella derives its name from a clever artist who drew frescoes on the walls of a vihara and drowned while bathing. As the scenery is breath-taking, this area can be developed as a tourist attraction, nature lovers said.

Priyanka Chopras dilemma about her 2 Bollywood productions

Priyanka Chopra has already produced two regional films, but is yet to venture into the Bollywood space. However, a source close to the heroine reveals, Priyanka has already read two Hindi scripts, which she has loved. She wants to produce them, and is currently finalising things.
The source also adds, One of them is a two-hero film. Thats more of a love triangle with just one actress being paired with two actors. Another one is a strong woman-centric film, where the protagonist will play a single mother.
Casting trouble
While PC has loved the two ideas and is ready to produce Hindi films now, she isnt finding the right cast. The khabri tells us, Priyanka wants to cast leading young, A-listers for the two-hero film, but no one is agreeing to play the second lead. Everyone wants to be the guy, who ends up with the girl. Priyanka, who has been part of several two-heroine films in the beginning of her career, is finding this reason hard to fathom.
As for the heroine-centric film, None of the actresses are game to playing a single mother. PC is looking at a certain age bracket and everyone feels this would stereotype them. In fact, since PC is not finding the right person for the project, she is contemplating doing it herself, reveals the insider.

Public park prohibited for public
The Akkaraipattu public park had been closed for some time and the public urge authorities to open it for public use immediately.
The park falls under the purview of the Akkaraipattu Municipal Council.
The park is without proper maintenance although the people are interested in visiting the park in the evenings. The open hall in the middle of the park is filled with bird faeces.
Therefore, people cannot enter the hall to rest. A part of the roof is hanging and is on the verge of collapse.
Officer-in-charge and other minor staffers of the Municipal Council are not seen in the vicinity. Some parts of the park are infested with weeds. The shady trees and ornamental plants are withered without care.
The park was ceremonially opened by former MP and Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister A. L. M. Athaullah having spent a large sum of money.

Pujara's 89 guides India to 238-3 in Sri Lanka Test

Cheteshwar Pujara hit an unbeaten 89 to steady India's innings after Sri Lanka jolted the visitors with two crucial strikes on the opening day of the second Test on Thursday.
India, who lead the three-match series 1-0, were well placed at 238 for three at tea after winning the toss and choosing to bat in Colombo. Pujara, playing his 50th Test, was batting alongside Ajinkya Rahane (41).
The pair put on an unbroken 105-run stand for the fourth wicket after the hosts lost opener Lokesh Rahul for 57 and skipper Virat Kohli for 13 early in the second session.
Rahul, who scored his eighth Test fifty on his return from a viral fever, was run out after a mix-up with Pujara.
Veteran spinner Rangana Herath sent Kohli trudging back to the pavilion with a tossed-up delivery that got the edge of the captain's bat to be caught at slip.
Pujara then ground out the runs to register his 16th fifty in his milestone Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground.
In the morning session, off-spinner Dilruwan Perera had Shikhar Dhawan trapped lbw for 35.
Debutant left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara was still searching for his first Test scalp. The hosts need at least a draw to stay alive in the series.

Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in 1947 and 2016.: At 96, Prince Philip begins his retirement at last
UK: After a lifetime of public service by the side of his wife Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip will finally retire on Wednesday at the age of 96.
The Duke of Edinburgh will attend a parade of Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace, the last of 22,219 solo public engagements since she ascended to the throne in 1952.
He has attended countless more events with the queen, now 91, but both have slowed their pace in recent years, handing over responsibilities to the younger royals.
Prince Philip is entitled to slow down a bit, the Daily Telegraph newspaper wrote in an editorial, adding: This is a man who has always put his country first. The former World War II naval officer has carried out 637 overseas visits on his own in the past 65 years, given almost 5,500 speeches, and was patron, president or a member of more than 780 organisations.
His final engagement on Wednesday will honour his military background, as he attends the end of a charity challenge in which Royal Marines ran 1,664 miles over 100 days to mark the founding of the commando force in 1664.
Philip has been captain general of the corps since 1953, taking over from the queen's father king George VI, who had died the year before.
The queen has described Philip, her husband of almost 70 years who is now the longest-serving consort in British history, as my strength and stay.
But after announcing his plans to retire in May, he joked he was the world's most experienced plaque-unveiler.
The prince's often politically incorrect sense of humour has got him into trouble in the past, although for many of the queen's subjects, it has also provided some welcome warmth into the institution of the monarchy.
Humour is important. The Duke's has brightened these decades, the Telegraph said.
Philip is still in good health for a man of his age, although he was hospitalised for two nights in June for the treatment of an undisclosed infection.
A spokeswoman said his individual programme of public engagements had come to an end, but he may choose to attend engagements alongside the queen from time to time.

RAVI under spotlight
Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday defended himself before the Bond Commission, insisting that he did not know of any of the transactions entered into by his wife and daughter and their connected companies with regard to the Penthouse Apartment at the Monarch residencies in which he currently resides.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday defended himself before the Bond Commission insisting that he did not know of any of the transactions entered into by his wife and daughter and their connected companies with regard to the Penthouse Apartment at the Monarch residencies in which he currently resides.
In a day filled with drama, suspense, outbursts and assertions, Karunanayake took the stand for close to six hours insisting throughout that he was not aware of the transactions or connections that were put to him by the Attorney Generals Department.
I was not aware and I only came to know after this hullabaloo (after Anika Wijesooriyas testimony) Karunanayake asserted.Immediately after, however, it was pointed out by the Attorney Generals Department who quoted the Hansard saying that the issue of his Monarch Penthouse apartment was brought to Karunanayakes notice in Parliament in July 2016.
An initially upbeat Karunanayake, said during the initial stages that the media was acting Judge, Jury and Executioner. He also said the counsel leading evidence, could do so only because the new government was in place. Thereafter, during a heated exchange, Karunanayake said  I am hurt (by the line of questioning) Is this the independence of the judiciary he asked pointing out the overly agrressive Counsel.
On nexus with Aloysius
The day commenced with ASG Dappula De Livera questioning Karunanayake on where Karunanayake currently lives. At the Monarch was the reply. What is the number of the apartment 5 PH2 replied Karunanayake. Then the questioning commenced on Karunanayakes relationship with Arjun Aloysius. An upbeat Karunanayake said that he knew the Aloysius family for years.
The questions kept continuing and Karunanayake told the commission that he had a normal relationship, like any politician would have with people.Our families happened to know each other for over 25 years and my daughters were classmates, he said.
After allowing Karunanayake to continue, in between after which De Livera and Karunanayake flared up over the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance regarding the statutory obligations of the Minister of Finance, Livera commenced probing. So will you say you had a personal relationship with Aloysisus, Livera asked.  No Karunanayake replied. An official one no Karunanayake replied. A business one Livera continued.  No Karunanayake replied. Have you met Aloysius  Yes, a few times at family gatherings.We know each others families Karunanayake beamed.
Next came the revelation. De Livera opened the file, which contained the data on Arjun Aloysius mobile phone, he used since late 2016.
He said that the investigators went through a digital forensic audit and were able to gain access to the material contained within.Aloysius earlier refused to give his password, and his phone used during the period in question, 2015, he said was destroyed. The file, De Livera said runs into 8600 pages, with sensitive information.
One by one, De Livera read out text messages in which Ravi Karunanayake was inferred to have been mentioned. The initials of Ravi Karunanayake were pointed out, RK, which was used in the messages. Karunanayake said he did not know if he was referred to as RK. Instead he said he is known as Karu or Ravi.
Originated from Neil de Silva to Arjun Aloysius, Dear Hon Min Ravi coming from the site. BOC Subani is going to inform the court. Is there a way for us to stop her from going to court. Commissioner, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena pointed out that the message was in reference to a parate execution regarding a property, inferring that the message may have been to use the Ministers influence to stop the BOC from going to court. Karunanayake said the Bank of Ceylon did not fall under his purview at the time.Commissioner Chithrasiri asked if it was under him at a given time and Karunanayake replied in the affirmative.
Karunanayake said he was not aware of what was discussed in the message, nor the person where it originated from.
Another message read thus. To Steve Samuel From Arjun Aloysius Remind me to ask Hon RK to get a copy of the Monetary Board Paper 28/Nov/2016. Samuel, is the Secretary of Aloysius.
Livera, pointed out that a Monetary Board meeting was held on November 28. He asked if Karunanayake knew of the content of the messages, Karunanayake said he did not.Thereafter Di Livera asked Karunanayake if he met Aloysius following the November 28, Karunanayake again remained steadfast. He said he did not.
From Steve Samuel to Arjun Aloysius on December 1, 2016 Good Morning Chairman. Hope you had a good meeting with RK. Remind the 1 pm haircut. The next message was read out. Karunanayake, again said he did not recognise the content of the messages. He said he did not meet Aloysius.
Some other messages read:
A calendar reminder
Meeting boss/RK on proposed auction for the week.
01 June 2017 ( Originator Unknown)
Dear Arjun, there is Kapila Prasanna in Swarnavahini. He was with previous regime from 2007-2015. He has robbed producing money from Swarnavahini. This guy has been the secretary to S.M. Chandrasena from 2015. He only has GCE O/Ls. What is he doing under you It is not good for you and PTL and Ravi K. These guys are very dangerous. They may send information
In between the reading of the messages, there was questioning on the Leader, referring to the Sunday Leader publication.Karunanayake said he had got nothing to do with the newspaper. Messages referring to the Minister originating from one Ruwan Gallage were then read out. Employees has stopped work Rs.3 million needed was one of them. Karunanayake said he was unaware of the contents or the inferences, or the references to him.
You must ask them he said.
Coinciding of flights
Thereafter Karunanayake was asked if he had met Aloysius in Singapore or Malaysia. At first, Karunanayake said he had not. Thereafter, De Livera read out flight details and dates.  !Thirteen times the flights of the two of you has coincided to Singapore or Malaysia he said. Singapore is a transit point Karunanayake replied. Following are excerpts.
Livera: You have been to Singapore in multiple occasions from 07 June 2015 to 09 April 2017. All these coincides with Arjun Aloysiuss Singapore visits as well.
RK: I am not aware.
Livera: Have you met with Aloysius in Singapore
RK:Once, at a Finance Asia Awards.
Livera: I have the flight details of the two of you with me. How many times have you met Aloysius of all these visits to Singapore
RK: Once. Maybe twice or thrice.
Livera: Where were you on last Christmas
RK:In Singapore with my family.
Livera: Aloysius flight details shows that he was flying to Singapore on several occasions from 06 June 2015 to 10 May 2017. Did you meet Aloysius last Christmas
RK:Yes, I think.
Livera: You were in Singapore from 21 December 2016 to 20 December 2016 where as Aloysius was there from 20 December 2016 to 26 December 2016.
RK: I cant remember the details.
Livera: Were you in the same flight with Aloysius on 04 April 2016, the flight No SQ 469
RK: I am not aware.
Livera: This shows that you were. Did you meet him on the flight
RK: I dont know.
Livera: Do you know there have been 13 occasions coincided when two of you have travelled to Singapore
RK: I dont know.
The Letter
The Commission adjourned at 12.42 PM and recommenced hearings at 1.20 PM. Karunanayake took the stand again. De Livera commenced questioning him on a letter which was sent by the Minister.The letter in question was undated and unreferenced. The letter signed by Karunanayake as the Finance Minister on a Ministry of Finance letter head said, the Government had decided to raise 75 Billion Rupees to fulfill government requirements.
Following are excerpts of the examination.
Livera: Is this your signature
RK: Yes
Livera: Did you issue this
RK: Yes at the request of Governor Central Bank Mahendran. He wanted this when the second COPE started investigations. He wanted to ensure that this letter issued.
There was a cabinet meeting on 25 February 2015. The President, Prime Minister and Cabinet of Ministers discussed on how to spend for the election and how to cut down expenditure as opposed to the limited revenue we have. On the 26 February 2015, Hon ministers Malik Samarawickreme, Kabir Hasheem and Governor, Deputy Governors, other Central Bank officials were present.
It was just about a month to election. We were concerned about the stories.We had an economy where there was no sufficient revenue to service the debts we had.We were on a 100 day program, salary increase. All these came to another additional Rs 160 biliion.
Dappula de Livera: When was the letter issued
Ravi Karunanayake: Somewhere in the range of May-June 2016
Livera: What exactly did Mahendran ask you
RK: He told that there was a lot of questioning going on. He wanted the letter to substantiate there was a meeting (the Breakfast meeting held on 26 February 2015) and refreshing that there was a government requirement. I wrote this letter in conjunction with Malik Samarawickreme and Kabir Hashim.
Livera: Why does it not have a date
RK: It was an oversight.
Livera: The Commission previously has observed that this letter was issued newly, it is a newly created document. This copy of the letter is crispy. It is as crispy as crispy it can be.I suggest to you that what you are saying is absolutely false.
RK: I deny that.
Chanaka de Silva ( Lawyer of Arjun Mahendran): When this document was given to me by my client (Arjun Mahendran), it was handed over in a brief case. It was very well preserved.
Justice Jayawardena: I wish he had taken care of other matters in the same manner.
Livera: Where did you prepare this letter Was it an official communication
RK: All I can say is that it was a letter sent on request by Governor Mahendran.
Livera: Why then is the name of the person who requested it not mentioned in the letter
RK: The letter says to whom it may concern
Livera: I put it to you that the normal procedure of issuing a letter was not followed at this instance.
RK: I completely deny it.
Livera: From where did you derive this information for the letter
RK: It was a reflection of the Breakfast meeting. (On 26th February)
Justice Jayawardena: Now that we have got this established why dont you move to a different subject We have more important questions to ask from the witness.
Livera: What I say is he has violated the government procedure, no file, no reference number, nothing.
Chairman K.T. Chitrasiri: We see all that. So please move on to another area.
ASG Dappula De Livera at Sea
During the course of the exchange, ASG Dappula de Livera completely lost his demeanour, making the fatal error of quarreling with the witness throughout the next segment. He first challenged the Commissioners asserting that Karunanayake was treated with privilege. The Commissioners pointed out that they were hear to find the truth. We must hear both sides of the story. We are here to find the truth and do justice by all, the Commissioners asserted.
De Livera did not relent, with the anger boiling into the next line of questioning, which the Commissioners identified was the most important issue- the apartment at the Monarch Residencies - De Livera, fluttered and faulted, losing his temper and in the process losing the gist of the examination. If there was a lack of clinical professionalism on display, this had to be it. The biggest case in recent history and the star witness before the Commission, it had to take a loose head to drop the ball right on the try line. De Livera took the days honours for it. The line of questioning was overly aggressive and therefore not yielding the required information by the Commission. Patience was wearing. Commissioner Justice Prasanna Jayawardena called ASG Yasantha Kodagoda to the bench and whispered to him. Following Kodagodas return and a murmur on De Liveras ears, De Livera relented and asked the Commissioner if he wanted to continue the questioning.
Apartment
As has been the case throughout the hearings, Commissioner Jayawardena the most thorough among those present, wore the hat of examining genius, with many present being reminisced of his days as one of the countrys leading lawyers. Mildly and calmly, he plodded the witness towards the information he required, never once raising his voice, nor losing his demeanour.
You are a very close family isnt it, he asked Karunanayake. Yes of course with Gods blessings, came the reply. And the following ensued.
Justice Jayawardena: We know you are a family man.
RK: Yes I am and I thank God for that.
Justice Jayawardena: We are very happy that you are.
Justice Jayawardena: Now you were aware that your family was looking for an apartment You said that you were aware of it and looking for a close by place because public citizens like you and me spending considerable amount of time in the traffic
RK: Correct.
Justice Jayawardena: Now lets look at the document of the apartment. It says there were two apartments amalgamated. It has 4000 square ft.
RK: I believe it cant be 4000 square feet. It should be around 2000 square.ft
Justice Jayawardena: Did you ask from whom your family is renting the apartment
RK: They told me that the owner of the house is Anika Wijesooriya. I was satisfied.
Justice Jayawardena: If you knew that this house was leased out by a man connected to areas under your purview, would you have not moved in to this apartment
RK: I definitely wouldnt have moved in if I knew that.
Justice Jayawardena: Are you telling us that for nine months, your family did not tell you that there was no lease agreement between your family company and Anika Wijesooriya
RK: They told me the house was of Wijesooriyas.
Justice Jayawardena: Your family knew there was no lease agreement signed with the owner of the house
RK: I do not know that. But we reimbursed the money, to an accountant of a company.
Justice Jayawardena: You said your family paid the rental to Walt and Rowes
RK: I dont know,they said it was to an accountant.
Justice Jayawardena: They had to know the lease agreement was with this company because it clearly says so in the agreement. Your wife and daughter are educated people so they must surely know there is a conflict of interest
RK: No. They are not in the political arena so I dont think they are aware.
Justice Jayawardena: So you are saying that they did not see anything wrong with their house rent being paid by a company which is connected to the stock market, the Primary market and the Excise Department
RK: No. I didnt know.
Justice Jayawardena: It is publicly known that Perpetual Treasuries Limited, Perpetual Capital Holdings and Walt and Rowes Associates are interconnected. So are you seriously telling us to believe you when you say you are unaware of these close associations which concern you
RK: Yes. I was not.
Justice Jayawardena: So this entire agreement you were not aware of
RK: No.My wife and three children are perfectly capable of running the company and this was purchased by the company. I did not know anything and completely absolve myself from having anything to do with it
Justice Jayawardena: From where did you get an odd Rs 10 million of money to pay for the apartment
RK: My wife and daughter were responsible for it.
Justice Jayawardena: If such payments were done bank statements will be available
RK: Not necessarily.
Justice Jayawardena: We are normal people we dont carry 12 million rupees in cash. So I just want to know how this was done.
RK: It was done through my company.
Justice Jayawardena: I looked for these payments in GLT ledgers and other records but nowhere information relevant to these payments appear.
RK: The Chairman of the GLT told us to buy the house and he will pay for it.
Justice Jayawardena: We have heard from the evidence that Chairman Lakshmikanthan brought 70 million in cash to the GLT. Do you know from where this money came
RK: No, I cannot say. All I know is that he is a leading financial analyst.
Justice Jayawardena: You should be aware of the money laundering and such, so it is important that this money should go on record.
RK:The money came from the Chairman. I had nothing to doubt.
Justice Jayawardena: Just because the money came from the Chairman, that does not mean the money is clean. Sakvithi was the Chairman of his company.
Justice Jayawardena: We have given you every opportunity to tell us what you want to say. What you are basically telling us is that I knew nothing.
RK: Yes, I knew nothing until the agreement was signed and until concerns were raised.
Thereafter, close to 3PM ASG De Livera attempted to question the witness again, but repeating the same questions to which answers were elicited by the Commissioner. The Commissioners drew a blank forcing De Livera to close the case for the prosecution. Cross examination ensued, by which time the Ministers I know of nothing was registered among all and sundry.

SL ranked first in 'World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative - 2016'
Sri Lanka became the first country in the world in World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative - 2016's policy and progress scores. It is good if all Sri Lankan mothers can be granted six months of full-paid maternity leave in order to create a healthy and productive future generation, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Dhammika Rowel said.
Addressing a Health Seminar on 'Sustaining Breastfeeding Together,' held at the Health Education Bureau Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, she said that according to the Labour Force Survey in Sri Lanka - 2016, it is revealed at 34.4 percent of the country's labour force is women. But at the moment, only female employes of the State sector enjoy 84 working days of full-paid maternity leave. It differs when it comes to the private sector. According to Dr. Rowel, under the Maternity Benefits Ordinance Number 32 of 1939, only State sector female employes are entitled to full-paid 84 working days of maternity leave, another half-paid 84 working days and 84 more working days without pay. They get one hour for feeding if they return to work early. But the current maternity leave for Sri Lankan breastfeeding mothers is not adequate.
Private companies can benefit by providing 'Creche Centres/facilities' for their female breastfeeding employees.
The companies and business ventures can lower their absenteeism rate, health care cost and turnover rates. Companies can expect employees to return to work earlier from maternity leave. It could also provide higher employee productivity and boost morale. Higher employer loyalty can be expected, while the company would gain public recognition as a 'family friendly' company/business, she added.

'Sri Lankans lead the way on Oracle Cloud'
Sri Lankan Organisations increase agility, unify experiences and transform businesses with innovations from Oracle Cloud
At a recent media showcase event, three of Sri Lanka's most prominent companies discussed how they are using Oracle Cloud Applications to transform their businesses and capitalise on digital opportunities by building a complete cloud strategy harnessing SaaS applications.
The event participants learned how Oracle Cloud Applications help organisations drive innovation and business transformation by increasing business agility, lowering costs, and reducing IT complexity by showcasing Oracle Cloud - the industry's broadest and most integrated public cloud. Offering best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), it also allows organisations to host Oracle Cloud in their own data center via Oracle's unique Cloud at Customer offering.
It is exciting to see companies in Sri Lanka at the forefront of using cloud to drive innovation and push boundaries, said Chandita Samaranayake, Regional Director Oracle SAGE. These organisations are using Oracle Cloud Applications to transform and modernise everything from customer experience to enterprise resource planning, human capital management and many more, making their business more personalised, connected, and secure.
Leading Sri Lankan organisations including Etisalat Sri Lanka, Virtusa, and MAS shared details of the business benefits they continue to realise as a result of the transformational power of Oracle Cloud Applications.
As we grow rapidly and in keeping in line with our vision of a world where people's reach is not limited by matter or distance, we were looking for a solution to simplify and modernise our business processes, providing a comprehensive view across the entire organisation with the ability to seamlessly integrate across multiple systems, said Perihane Elhamy, chief technology and information officer at Etisalat. With Oracle Cloud Applications, we will have the modern tools that will enable us to grow our business operations, simplify our existing business processes, and increase employee productivity through proper talent management.
Our people are the core of our business. To create an environment that enable us to deliver a truly world class experience for our global clients, it's essential that we provide our teams with a truly modern user experience that helps drive engagement, innovation and productivity, said Madu Ratnayake, Executive Vice President, CIO and General Manager at Virtusa.
This requires across-the-board business transformation. Gone are the days where finance's role was to just manage risk, execute transactions, and keep score, and HR was just about basic hiring and people management. Today, forward-thinking CFOs and CHROs are working together with their digital teams to create the modern digital business, and to provide best-in-class operations across all domains, so as to add value to the business and boost competitiveness.
Director - Group Human Resources, MAS Holdings, Shakthi Ranatunga said: We are pleased to partner with a highly acclaimed international service provider of the caliber of Oracle. We believe this partnership will strengthen the delivery of our HR strategy, especially as we continue our local and international expansions.
The event also gave participants an insight into Oracle's uniquely comprehensive SaaS portfolio in delivering complete and integrated business processes, particularly Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning suite (ERP) Cloud and Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) Cloud offering solutions. Mr. Samaranayake highlighted how Oracle ERP Cloud is the industry's most complete, modern, and proven financial platform delivered seamlessly through the Oracle Cloud. A modern user interface driven by the latest design innovations delivers embedded analytics, contextual social collaboration, and a device-independent mobile experience to make Oracle ERP Cloud simple and easy to use.

Strands  of hope
Compassion is infectious. One kind act inspires another. The more you give the more you receive. Such words held together a group of youth as they watched their lustrous locks go under the blades of a scissor and fall to the ground for a cause  cancer. For them, this one act, they felt, could inspire many to donate their tresses to make wigs for those who are undergoing chemotherapy that results in hair loss.
The Cancer Care Trust and Ramani Fernando Salons have come up with a project to aid cancer patients by providing them with a wig free of charge. The project which generated much enthusiasm was launched on July 20. Around 20 hair donors and volunteers from Cancer Care Trust stepping up to go for the chop for this worthy cause. The first wig of the campaign was offered to 13-year-old K Prashanthini from Pudalu Oya, Nuwara Eliya, who had undergone chemotherapy. She attended the event with her family.
This tale of locks and love is an offshoot of the Indiras Love project. The brainchild of Dr Lanka Dissanayake, the daughter of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Indiras Love was named in memory of her sister, Indira Jayasuriya, who has passed away from breast cancer in November 2016. She had suffered from hair loss during the latter stages of her life. A wig had been made for her but she did not get a chance to use it. The family had later donated the wig to a child who had been undergoing treatment at the Maharagama Cancer Hospital. Losing her air has added to the trauma she had to undergo. The wig has consoled her a great deal. This experience has inspired the hair donation campaign.
Our research showed that many cancer patients lose their hair due to the first dose of treatment. People, especially women, are concerned about their looks. It boosts their self confidence. We decided to donate wigs as a means of boosting their belief in themselves, Dr Dissanayake said.
Though this is the first time that a project of this nature has been introduced in Sri Lanka it is a popular movement in countries abroad. Since there are no such campaigns in local soil some Sri Lankans tend to cut off their locks and send them to countries like the USA or UK so that wigs can be made for cancer patients.
Wigs made of natural human hair are very costly. 500g of natural hair costs around Rs 70, 000. It takes around two lakhs to make a wig. However our wig maker, Lalith Dharmawardana, will be giving us the product at a concession rate of Rs 25, 000 each, she said.
Ramani Fernando Salons is engaged in the campaign free of charge. A donor can walk into any of the 14 branches and get a free hair cut and blow dry. The cut hair will be donated for the cause and the donor will receive a certificate of appreciation on the day of the donation.
The response for the campaign has been amazing. The campaign went viral a week before it was launched and ever since it took off we have had donors rushing into our salons vying to be a part of this worthy cause. We have cut 1225 heads of hair so far. Everyone from children to middle aged and the elderly and men with long locks have shown their enthusiasm towards project. The staff has been working tirelessly and with a lot of passion shampooing, conditioning and cutting off the hair and styling it to suit the donor. It is two hours of hard work but they have embraced the work with zeal, CEO and founder of Ramani Fernando Salons, Ramani Fernando said.
Speaking to Daily News TnC founder of Cancer Care Trust Dr Samadhi Rajapaksha noted that donors from the entire community sans religion or ethnicity have flocked together to take part in the campaign.
We have collected around 87 kilos of hair during the past two weeks. Those who do not have long hair to donate have inquired if they can help mandatorily.
The media too has been very responsive. The campaign made us realize that people who are willing to take part in a good cause are always present, he noted.
Lalith Dharmawardana is dubbed the only human hair wig manufacturer in Sri Lanka. He notes that being a part of this campaign is the highlight of his 42 years in the film industry as a hairdresser.
We used to purchase wigs made with natural hair for films. I would visit Chennai, India, and sit down witn the wig makers till they made the wig according to my requirements. I gained this knowledge by observing their work, Dharmawardana explained.
He adds that making a wig out of natural human hair is no walk in the park. One needs to match the cancer patients hair texture with that of the donors.
You can proceed after this. Most of the wigs found in Sri Lanka are syntactic. It takes around 14 days to make a wig. I already have 11 people working under me but the response is such that we need more people to manufacture the wigs. To combat this issue we decided to train house maids to make wigs so that they can engage in wig making leisurely at home. We are currently training six of them, he said adding that it usually takes around 300g to make a wig.
There is a certain amount of wastage which cannot be avoided. We do not use ammonia on the product in any manner since cancer patients are allergic to it. We had to make the first wig within two days for the launch of the campaign. We have donated several wigs so far and it is heartening to see the response from the patients. They blessed us for our kindness. I am grateful to Dr Lanka Dissanayake, Dr. Samadhi Rajapaksha and his wife, Nisansala, and Ramani Fernando for laying their trust in me and engaging me in this worthy deed, He added.
The hair donation campaign is ongoing. Anyone interested in donating hair, in sponsoring a wig or in need of a wig, can call the HopeLine-0112363211 of the Cancer Care Trust for further inquiries.
Pointers to keep in mind when donating your hair 
 u You must have at least 8 inches of hair. u There is no maximum length you can donate. u Before donation the hair has to be cleaned with no oil, hair spray, hair gel, mousse or any other material. So clean, shampoo and condition hair without any styling, hair spray or additional hair products one day prior to the cut. u The hair has to be dry before cutting for donation. u The hair has to be in a ponytail or braid. u Hair that is coloured or permed is acceptable. u Grey hair is acceptable. u Layered hair is acceptable if the shortest layer is eight inches. u Curly hair may be pulled straight to measure the minimum 8 inches.
 Prepare your hair for future donation
 u Use a conditioner after every wash to help keep hair moisturized and protected against damage. u Dont use a brush on wet hair when you step out of the shower. Once hair is washed and conditioned, use a comb with smooth, wide-set teeth to gently detangle hair, working from tip to root. u Do not blow-dry soaking wet hair immediately. To expedite your blow-out process and help prevent thermal damage, towel wrap your hair for 10-15 minutes and remove excess water before using a blow- dryer. u Do not over brush hair as this can lead to breakage. Regular, gentle brushing promotes hair health and natural oil distribution. u Oil your hair frequently.

Sword attack on Jaffna police officers  Four in custody, more to be arrested: SSP, Jaffna
There are more suspects to be arrested in the Mondays sword attack on two Police officers in Jaffna, SSP Jaffna Glaston Stanislaus told the Daily News yesterday.
Four suspects have been arrested in connection with the attack. The rest would be arrested and legal action taken against them as well, he said.
Asked if the suspects concerned belonged to a Jaffna-based criminal gang Aawa and if they are becoming a threat to maintain law and order in the Jaffna Police Division, SSP Stanislaus responded: It is the media that seemed to be giving undue recognition to these small time felons.
Incidents such as this, could happen anywhere, in any Police division, he said."They need to be stopped and will be stopped.
Why anyone would want to superimpose them as a group called Aawa. Who gave them that name he questioned.
On being pointed out that the group however appear to be responsible for causing similar sorts of incidents in Jaffna, SSP Stanislaus said, actually, there is no such big band of operatives so as to characterize them with a name in Jaffna, except a few men that needed arresting.
Meanwhile, law and order in Jaffna is being maintained as usual, he added.

Tackle those tresses!
Hair care is a part of grooming. It is just as important to put effort in maintaining your tresses as much as you would in maintaining your wardrobe. The kind of products you use should depend on the type of hair you have, and not on your whims and fancies. While there are no fixed rules as to which shampoo and conditioner you should use, there are certain parameters you should keep in mind, so as to make an informed decision.
Analyze your hair
Analyzing ones hair involves examining the hair to determine the amount of hair, size of each hair strand, and the overall health of the strand. To check the density (amount of hairs on head), look at a patch of hair on top of your head and observe how many hairs are growing out of this patch. If there are so many hairs so that you can barely see the scalp, this is an indication of thick density.
When the hairs are spaced out on the scalp - this is known as thin density.
Look at an individual hair strand to find out whether the strand is thick and wide, or if it is thin when you check the texture (thickness of individual strands).To determine your hair texture you could even compare it with another persons hair.
Find your hair strength
Thick hair is stronger than thin hair by nature, regardless of curl pattern. You need to follow two steps to find the strength (a combined result of porosity and density of hair overall) of the hair.
First, porosity is determined, then elasticity.
Porosity is the amount of water retained by the hair. Porous hair is generally more damaged, and has a tendency to absorb more liquid, but it will not retain as much moisture.
Hair with low porosity is considered healthy and resistant, and can withstand stronger chemicals and services than porous hair.
To determine the porosity, take a few hairs and slide your fingers up the hair shaft to check if the hair feels rough or smooth. If the hairs cuticles are raised and the hair feels rough, this indicates that the hair is porous. If the hair is non-porous, the cuticles should feel smooth.
Elasticity is the final step in the analysis and the part that makes your final determination of your hairs strength. Take a single hair from the crown of your head, and grab both ends and stretch the hair.
If it snaps right away, the hair lacks elasticity. If it takes longer, the hair has a lot of elasticity.
Over washing your hair
Theres no harm in washing your hair every day. In fact, if you do any of the following things, you should always wash your hair:
1) Any exercise that makes your scalp particularly sweaty.
2) Use of gels or waxes.
3) Use of hair sprays or any other cosmetics that contact your scalp.
Over washing is possible if you are not engaging in exercise that makes you sweaty, or using hair gels, waxes, sprays or other hair cosmetics, as skin sebum is your hairs natural conditioner. It can make your hair shiny and protects your hair. Washing your hair too frequently may make your hair dry, making it appear unhealthy, due to lack of sebum.
Shampoo for your hair type
Using the incorrect shampoo could cause the hair and scalp to dry out. Using products that are too moisturizing on an oily scalp could make the condition worse. Therefore, if you use the correct shampoo for your hair type, you will benefit from it.
Conditioning-shampoos vs separate shampoos and conditioners
A shampoo cleanses the hair while a conditioner provides shine and improves the handling of the hair. Conditioning-shampoos can be better than two separate bottles if you're showering every day or have curly or brittle hair. Since daily shampooing can strip hair of natural oils and dull color, Conditioning-shampoos are less harsh and damaging. However when using these conditioning shampoos you should be aware of the product build up. If you have thin or oily hair, a separate shampoo and conditioner is better with a lighter formula as it may be too heavy for oily hair types because it will weigh down the fine hair strands.
Changing shampoos on a regular basis
You should change your shampoo on a regular basis because your hair's natural chemical balance is altered by the shampoo and you'll begin to see a change in the results you get from it.
In the case of moisturizing and conditioning shampoos you can get an eventual build-up on the hair shaft, which may leave the hair flat and listless after repeated use. Conversely, deep-cleaning or build-up removing shampoos can strip away more than just the product build-up they're designed to remove when they are used over and over, leaving hair dry and more susceptible to damage.
The best recommendation is to select a couple of shampoo formulas that you like. If your regular shampoo is a moisturizing shampoo, then use a clarifying shampoo every third or fourth time you shampoo. If you normally use a build-up removing shampoo to get rid of the residue from daily styling products, be sure to switch to a moisture-rich formula to maintain the balance of moisture in your hair.
pH balancing shampoos
Human hair and scalp oil, sebum, has a pH balance of between 4.5 and 5.5 and is slightly acidic. This natural hair acidity prevents fungi and bacteria in the hair and scalp, and keeps the cuticle closed and healthy. Shampoos can be either acidic or alkaline. A shampoo that is pH balanced is slightly acidic. It ensures that the hair and skins natural moisture is maintained, helps to keep cuticles closed and keeps your hair healthy.
Shampoos for coloured hair
Shampoos for coloured hair claim to enhance or revitalize richness and depth and add shine. They make your hair shiny and moisturized, keeping it looking and feeling great. When hair is in good condition, you get the shine and an enhanced appearance. The hair looks better overall.
These shampoos will not protect your colour from fading or add any dye to your hair. However, lately some brands have come out with products that contain dyes that are supposed to stick to your hair, thus making your hair colour last longer.
But these dyes also do not work most of the time. They are simply added to make the product look nicer and give it a certain colour, but wont stick to your hair and provide any colour enhancing benefits for your hair.

Taj Mahal
Ever wonder why the Taj Mahal is so white The answer to that question is Makrana marble. The Taj Mahal has been constructed with the best quality of Makrana marble. Makrana is a place in the Indian state of Rajasthan which produces some of the finest stone in the world. The quality of the stone available at that time was exquisite, and the master artisans polished the stone to perfection. This has made the Taj Mahal look so brilliantly white over the centuries. However, the recent development of industries around the Taj Mahal has caused the marble to deteriorate. This has made the government set up a protective zone around the Taj to help preserve the glory of the Taj Mahal as a national monument.
Framed Views
The Taj Mahal is one of the most photographed locations in the world. Did you ever wonder why The answer is staring at us in the face. The architects of the Taj framed the views. Entrances, exits, and spaces were designed in a manner which framed the Taj Mahal as seen in the images above. Rather than it being a coincidence, it was deliberately designed that way, thus, adding to the aesthetics of the building even more.
Hierarchy of Spaces
A clear hierarchy of spaces has set in the design of the Taj Mahal. The spaces transition from public to semi-private to private. Thus, the visitor enters into the Taj Mahal enclosure via the main entrance way (from the public to semi-public), moves through the gardens to arrive at the plinth. A flight of stairs helps the visitor transition onto the plinth and into the interior of the building (semi-private). The original transition was to be into the main underground vault wherein the coffers of the emperor and empress are located (it is the most private space in the entire complex). Thus, it is quite evident that the Mughals built into the Taj Mahal complex to have aclear hierarchy of spaces.
Religious Carvings and Calligraphy
The Taj is also famous for its many carvings. The carvings and calligraphy have been sculpted on the entrance ways, interiors, dome, etc. Master craftsmen such as Amanat Khan perfected the art of calligraphy and inscribed beautiful sayings such as O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you. into the entranceways.
The exquisite and intricate calligraphy and carvings add to the flavor of the monument even more. The engravings are mostly Islamic (verses from the Holy Quran) and are meant to spread the message of the prophet.
Use of Passive Cooling Techniques
The Taj Mahal uses a number of passive cooling techniques to keep the interiors light and airy.
Some of the passive cooling techniques used are jaalis (perforated wall panels which help in cooling the interiors), walls with high thermal mass, cross ventilation, the use of green spaces around the built form, etc. All these features help the building become cooler especially in the summer months.
One has to keep in mind that though these features have been incorporated into the design of the building, an emphasis has not been laid to incorporate more passive cooling features due to its function as a mausoleum.
Use of a Double Dome
The Taj Mahal incorporates in its design a double dome (as seen in the image above). The double dome is supposed to make the interiors of the building more comfortable and proportionate.
Most people who have been to the Taj are perplexed by this rather common question of why does the dome look taller from outside and relatively shorter from the inside. The answer is due to the double dome.
Thus, it is safe to say that the Taj, Mahal is one of the greatest buildings to have ever been built. The monument is a testament to the architectural, engineering and artistic know-how and skill of the Mughals. The Taj Mahal, thus, justifies its status of being one of the seven wonders of the world and a bit more.

Trump approves new 'flawed' Russia sanctions

President Donald Trump has signed into a law a bill which imposes new sanctions on Russia for their alleged meddling in the 2016 election.
The bill, which was signed in private at the White House, also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
Trump accused Congress of overreach on the legislation, which "handcuffs" him from easing Russia penalties.
Moscow said the sanctions "put paid to hopes that our relations with the new American administration" would improve.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also said this move meant the US had declared a "full-scale trade war" on Russia.
Iran said the new sanctions violated the nuclear deal and it would respond in an "appropriate and proportional" manner, reports the semi-official Isna news agency.
The Kremlin has denied interfering in the US election, and Trump has rejected any allegations that his campaign staff colluded with Russia to help him win.
Hours after the US president signed the bill, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "This isn't news.
"The thing is, the bill was approved and was going to automatically become law with or without the president's signature."
Moscow had already retaliated last week to Congress passing the bill, by expelling 755 people from its US embassy and consulates.
Several European nations, including Germany, are fearful of the economic consequences and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has warned of "unintended unilateral effects that impact the EU's energy security interests".
In signing the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, Trump attached a statement calling the measure "deeply flawed".
He accused Congress, which last week overwhelmingly passed the bill and sent it to the White House, of overstepping its constitutional authority.
"As President, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress," he said.
Donald Trump has signed the bill but he's clearly not happy about it. Hardly surprising, as any President would probably object to congressional efforts to curtail executive power included in this legislation.
As is becoming routine, however, this administration didn't draw its battle lines in the expected way.
There were several "signing statements". The first reads like a standard legalistic description of a Presidential action with a bevy of "yes, but..." reservations.
Another statement is decidedly more Trumpian, complete with a shot at Congress for not passing healthcare reform and a closing boast about his business empire and negotiating prowess.
Releasing multiple signing statements with somewhat divergent tones is unusual, to say the least, and could be an indication that, despite the efforts of new chief of staff John Kelly, the administration is still not speaking with a unified voice.
The sanctions, which are also in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea, came months after President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats.
Republican Lindsey Graham praised the bill after it passed, pointing out that Trump's options were limited since there were enough votes to overcome a Presidential veto.
"President Putin did something that nobody in America could do. He united the Congress," the South Carolina senator told CNN.
Senior Russian parliamentarian Konstantin Kosachev said that Trump was "capitulating" by not standing up to Congress.
Trump and Putin met for the first time at the highly-scrutinised G20 summit last month in Germany.
Allegations by the US intelligence community that Russia interfered in the US election to aid Trump are currently being investigated by Congress and a special investigator.

United in confidence
The two major parties within the National Unity alliance were last week busy grappling with contrasting issues, even as the government went ahead with landmark events such as the signing of the Hambantota Port agreement with the Chinese government and the handover of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe to the state.
For the United National Party (UNP), there was both cause for concern and celebration. The last week of July saw the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the UNPs historic general election victory in 1977 under leadership of J. R. Jayewardene. To this day, that election has delivered the largest ever landslide to a single party in Sri Lankan elections, with the UNP winning 140 seats out of 168.
This coincided with the entry of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to parliamentary politics. Then a young man of 28, Wickremesinghe contested the Biyagama seat at the invitation of Jayewardene, his uncle, and was returned to Parliament. In the current Parliament, he is the only MP to serve uninterrupted for 40 years.
Though the UNP celebrated these events, commemorations were low key, in keeping with the wishes of the Prime Minister. Party seniors- and their surviving family members- were honoured by the UNP in a ceremony that marked the anniversary. Many party members who attended observed that the unity and camaraderie in the party appeared to be high and that all appear to have rallied behind Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
Central Bank bond sale
Among those so honoured were Joseph Michael Perera, Amara Piyaseeli Ratnayake, Neville Fernando, P. Dayaratne and Gamini Jayawickrema Perera. Hema Premadasa and Srima Dissanayake also received mementos, honouring the services rendered by their late spouses, Ranasinghe Premadasa and Gamini Dissanayake respectively.
Even if the UNP was in celebration mode, it did have cause for concern. That was because of the fallout from evidence led at the Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank Bond sale. Giving evidence, one witness, Anika Wijesuriya, daughter of business tycoon Nahil Wijesuriya, made a startling revelation.
Wijesuriya stated before the Commission that, when a penthouse owned by her was rented to Ravi Karunanayakes family, the rent was paid in person by Arjun Aloysius, who headed Perpetual Treasuries. Aloysius is the son-in-law of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran. The penthouse was later purchased outright for use by the Karunanayake family, Wijesuriya said.
At the time of writing, Karunanayake was due to appear before the Commission to give evidence and provide his version of events. He has refrained from making any public comments on the issue, as it is now under investigation and his evidence is pending.
However, there have been growing calls for Karunanayakes resignation. This is on the basis that, even if nothing irregular or illegal had occurred, there appeared to be a conflict of interest when the son-in-law of the Governor of the Central Bank was paying rent on behalf of the then Minister of Finance. That the Bond sale which occurred under the supervision of the Central Bank was controversial only adds to the speculation.
Karunanayake served as Minister of Finance until the recent Cabinet reshuffle when he swapped portfolios with then Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera. It will be recalled that President Sirisena was also instrumental in not renewing the tenure of Governor Mahendran when it expired in June last year. After what appeared to be a battle of wits with his UNP colleagues in government, President Sirisena was instrumental in appointing respected economist Indrajith Coomaraswamy as the new Governor of the Central Bank.
Karunanayakes resignation
Despite numerous calls for Karunanayake to step down from the Cabinet, the UNP leadership has not commented on the issue. At the time of writing, Karunanayake is yet to be heard on this matter. In any event, the Commission of Inquiry will be able to make its own observations with regard to the ministers conduct and comment on whether any impropriety had occurred.
As it is only to be expected, the Joint Opposition (JO) was quick to demand Karunanayakes resignation. Former Minister and JO stalwart Bandula Gunewardena was to declare that it would submit a motion of no confidence against the Minister. There have been similar calls by other opposition parties.
What raised eyebrows however was a comment by Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera. Jayasekera was to suggest that Karunanayake should resign forthwith, until the probe into the bond sale is concluded. If Ravi is a gentleman, he should step down until the probe is over or he is cleared from charges. This is a blow to the Yahapalanaya government. Therefore, if there is a no-faith motion against him, I will support it, Jayasekara said.
Jayasekera has himself been at the butt end of criticism recently for his public berating of the national cricket team. Cricketer Lasith Malinga launched a thinly veiled attack on the minister. The minister has also been lampooned for his incorrect pronunciation of the Royal College motto at a public function. Thus, Jayasekera is no stranger to controversy but his comments- openly asking a Cabinet colleague to resign- wouldnt have endeared him to many, even within the SLFP faction of the government.
Naturally, there were questions being asked as to whether Jayasekera was attempting to pave the way for a SLFP group to take control of the government. For some weeks now, there has been speculation about a group of eighteen SLFP MPs breaking away from the National Unity government and sitting in Parliament as an independent group, not aligning with the JO either.
There has also been discussion- at least with a section of the SLFP parliamentary group- about the prospect of forming a SLFP led government. This would require some leap of imagination because the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the SLFP led coalition commands only 95 seats in Parliament. To secure even a simple majority, it requires the support of eighteen other MPs.
As neither the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) nor the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is likely to support them because of ideological differences, it would then have to secure the support of no less than 18 members of the UNP to do so. Though stranger things have happened in politics, this is extremely unlikely at this time, given the current climate of amity within the UNP.
It appears that these concerns have not escaped President Maithripala Sirisena. Speaking at a public function at Hingurakgoda this week, President Sirisena noted that an opposition parliamentarian as well as a former minister had said that the power of the government and the Presidency will be over after winning the support of 113 members in Parliament. Under the Constitution, no one can form a new government without the Presidents blessing, the President noted.
JO camp
These comments were a pointed reminder to the JO camp that, while there may be significant differences of opinion with the National Unity government, it did not mean that the JO could simply muster the numbers and form a new government. The President is particularly piqued about some family members of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa having talks with SLFP parliamentarians towards this end.
As if to reiterate his position, a day later at another public function at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, President Sirisena declared that the next general elections would be held only in 2020 and that the present government would be in office until then. This statement would have allayed concerns in the UNP as well about recent political developments in the SLFP. Both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim also this week stressed that the party was keen to continue with the National Unity government, in keeping with its agenda of development, reconciliation and constitutional reform.
That will still be a challenging task. However, with the Constitution prohibiting a general election until 2020 and with both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe echoing the same sentiments, it might still be possible.

What audacity
Joint Opposition stalwart Bandula Gunawardena has called upon Minister Ravi Karunanayake to resign from his post without waiting until the proposed No-Confidence against him, over the bond affair, is tabled in parliament. What audacity. No doubt, while wrong doers in the Yahapalanaya government should be exposed and punished, the JO led by Mahinda Rajapaksa is the last entity which can take a stand in this regard. It is public knowledge that a good majority of JO MPs in the present parliament who have taken a holier than thou attitude vis-a-vis the current imbroglio in the Yahapalanaya government, stemming from the alleged bond scam, have all serious corruption cases lined up against them.
Those shouting the most about the alleged bond scam are the very ones who are the living examples of rags to riches tales. It is abundantly clear that these paragons of virtue are today attempting to draw a red herring, to detract from their own shenanigans, while in power, by targeting a beleaguered minister of the government. They are also being ably assisted in this campaign to paint themselves lily white, by targeting the government, by select media groups, which are going overboard in this exercise.
Karunanayake has been made the whipping boy for obvious reasons - to shift the public attention away from the mega swindles of these worthies when they were granted immunity to do as they please under Rajapaksa. Among the most vociferous in this band of JO MPs is a personage who started life as a two bit salesman but went onto purchase palatial homes in elite Colombo addresses. Another, who had an unaccounted Rs. 400 million in his possession and was summoned by the Bribery Commission to make a statement failed to make the trip on grounds that he was stung by a polanga (russel viper). There is another who is tearing his hair and gnashing his teeth over the bond issue, currently being investigated for swindling millions by forging a power of attorney signature.
In the melee surrounding Minister Karunanayake, what is being overlooked by the public is the fact that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the bond affair was appointed by the Yahapalanaya government, no less, to inquire into the allegations against a top flight minister of the same government. Minister Karunanayake is being made to face the full glare of the public spotlight as the case against him is played out in the open. What is more, he is to be grilled by state counsel of the Attorney General's department representing the government.
This, needless to say, is in contrast to the Rajapaksa era when all financial scandals were swept under the carpet and the AG's department made a cipher of the government. No investigation was conducted or a Commission of Inquiry appointed to probe the multi-billion dollar loss to the country by the notorious hedging deal which even drew strictures from the highest court of the land. Neither was there any probe into the Greek bond affair that drained the country of billions. The monumental rip-off associated with the construction of the Sooriyawewa Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium was nobody's business. The astronomical losses suffered by the national carrier, driving it into a bottomless pit of debt and financial ruin, due to the cavalier fashion it was run by the brother-in-law of a VVIP is not even talked of today despite the Weliamuna report detailing not only the financial profligacy but also other shenanigans of the individual at the helm.
The lukewarm response displayed by the government to these instances of mega corruption, the slow investigations process and the absence of follow up action has today emboldened the perpetrators of these deeds to such an extent they have succeeded in driving the government into corner. It is a case of the hunter becoming the hunted, due to the vacillation of the government in bringing to book the top leaders of the former regime, their associates and kith and kin who are today sitting pretty, and, what is more, challenging the government on the corruption front. No doubt, it is a betrayal of the mandate received by the Common Candidate to go after the mega crooks and recover the accumulated loot.
Even at this late stage the President should take steps to speed up investigations into the doings of the Rajapaksa era, if for nothing else, to wipe out the smirks on the faces of the rogues and plunderers who are today reveling in the difficulties the Yahapalanaya government has plunged itself into, while disporting themselves as paragons of virtue. The public are still waiting for the outcome of the investigations into the loot stashed away in the Dubai banks and other offshore destinations. Or the hotels said to have been purchased by members of the former first family. It is the lack of progress in these matters that have made these rogue elements take the moral high ground and are trying to turn the tables on the government.

Certain Embassy scuttled Htota port debate - Dayasiri
Co-cabinet spokesperson and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara alleged that a certain embassy had a hand in disrupting the Parliament debate on the Hambantota Port Agreement last week.
The Parliament debate on the Agreement was scheduled to be held on July 28, prior to its signing on July 29. The debate however could not be held as members of the Joint Opposition staged a protest over the agreement and prevented any debate from taking place.
There was no reason why such a problem should be created before the debate was to start. We allowed enough space for them to start the debate. But then they ran into the well and started to make trouble, it showed that they didnt want a debate and were showing support for the agreement, Jayasekara said addressing the cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
He added that the debate was an important event as the President had informed Cabinet that any important issues highlighted in it will need to be addressed in the agreement prior to its signing.
But I am sorry to say that this was planned by a certain foreign embassy which called an MP of the Joint Opposition prior to the debate and after that the whole debate just collapsed.We were ready that day and if they had pointed anything out, we could have looked into it,Jayasekera said.
President Maithripala Sirisena who promised the Ports Authority and CPC unions that their amendments will be looked into, has given his cabinet one week to get back to him on any further amendments needed.
We have included a clause in it which allows for any term to be amended on mutually agreed terms,co-cabinet spokesperson, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne.
Minister Jayasekera said the signed agreement was submitted to cabinet on Tuesday so that ministers could compare the signed agreement with what cabinet had agreed to, in order to clear any confusion among themselves and the public, Thus far I have not seen any differences, Jayasekara said.
He explained that the main concern SLFP ministers had was to not give any land outright and that was addressed in the agreement, We allowed SLFPers in the Joint Opposition too to have their say in Parliament but they missed out on that, added the Minister.
At present the China Merchant Port Holdings Company Ltd will hold a share of 69.55 percent and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) will have a share of 30.45 percent and together they will establish two joint ventures, namely the; Hambantota International Port Services Company and the Hambantota International Port Group to handle commercial and shipping operations in the port. Security will be handled by the SLPA.

Chinese help signifies long standing friendship with Lanka
Sri Lanka has become the number one recipient of Chinese financial assistance and grants which signifies a long standing friendship and historical ties between two countries, Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang said.
Ambassador Xianliang was addressing a ceremony to grant 18 post graduate scholarships to Sri Lanka students at the Chinese Embassy yesterday. Sixteen scholarships were granted for doctoral candidates and two scholarships for master's candidates in the fields of Science, Arts, Management, Medicine and Engineering, linguists and agriculture. Sri Lanka is the best country with a rich history, cultural heritage, friendly people and natural beauty. The country is also the top destination for Chinese investment because of strong friendship between the two countries.
He said Sri Lanka needs industrialisation. The country needs giant infrastructure projects with professionals to work in them.
The Chinese government supports economic and infrastructure boost of the country and supports education exchange, technology and scientific advancement. We will extend our support to produce professionals and strengthen our cooperation to to promote higher education."
He said people-to-people exchange between the two countries are important to promote friendship.
The Chinese higher education scholarship programme provides the best opportunity for students to study in Chinese universities. The scholarships are provided by the Chinese government. The students spend over four years in China. They will be qualified professionals when they come back to Sri Lanka, Xianliang said.
"There is a bid demand for professionals in Chinese projects in Sri Lanka. These students can find jobs in them after returning to the country, the Chinese Ambassador said.
Higher Education and Research Ministry Additional Secretary Madhawa Dewasurendra said China and Sri Lanka are traditional neighbors. Sri Lanka was in a strategic location on the ancient maritime silk route. China is the biggest supporter of Sri Lanka in developing infrastructure like ports, transport, airports, industry and technology as well as education, he said.

Medical faculties for Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa universities
Plans were afoot to establish medical faculties at the Universities of Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa said Prof. Mohan de Silva, Chairman University Grants Commission addressing the FCA Convocation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) recently.
Prof De Silva said there has been various constraints in the progression of the higher education sector in the country. He noted that the country has suffered in terms of rankings both in a global and regional context and continue to have a poor visibility as an international destination for quality higher education and student mobility, when compared to countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. But, he said, steps were now being taken to address these issues.
Business models that have lasted for decades have been revolutionized within a matter of just a few years, said Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha De Silva.
The Deputy Minister who was the Chief Guest at the FCA Convocation elaborated that the economic realities presented by these new business models mean that there was an increasing need to adapt.
Not only have we to learn to deal with change we need to learn how to grapple with this rapid change, he said.
He highlighted Uber, Facebook, Alibaba and Airbnb as four models that have completed revolutionized conventional business models creating a paradigm shift.
Sectors such as taxi cabs and tourism have been completely turned on their head by the internets disruptive nature, he said.
He called on chartered accountants to adapt, and grow and face head on the drastic changes the business world is witnessing.
As a policy maker or accountant, we must learn to adapt to these evolving economic conditions and business models.
He said that the access economy means more people were monetizing their personal assets, whether its their car, their spare bedroom or their skills. The rise of long term distribution means these suppliers are becoming a vital part of the nations economy.
These small businesses are changing the face of business. As accountants you must think about whether and how we should bring these people into our taxation system. It may be unpopular, but we have to do this. We have to create an entrepreneurial culture, and we have to create innovation, yet we have to also make sure that the taxes are collected, he added.

The exhibition is organised by the French Embassy and the Alliance Franaise de Kotte offering the opportunity to discover these incredible pictures at the Black Cat caf.
Cedric Gatillons pictures are not landscapes, nor portraits. They keep their distance from traditional codes and academic rules. Cedric Gatillon wanted to capture the magic moment when the eye catches in a fraction of second the improbable and ephemeral action of the daily routine. It is not pictures of "decisive moments", but of moments of the life of ordinary men and women of Sri Lanka, in their everyday work and leisure time. The photographs of Cedric Gatillon are of a great formal unity and they empathise with the daily life in the country. The specificity of its approach is to respect the reality, to transmit its own vision of the peculiarities of this country, outside any political or symbolic message.

Sri Lanka Construction Today mag launched
The inaugural issue of Sri Lanka Construction Today published by the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), was launched recently.
Sri Lanka Construction Today, a quarterly publication, includes an array of rich and vibrant articles written by experts in the field in an attempt to bridge the noticeable gap felt by many in the industry.
Prof. Samitha Manawadu of the University of Moratuwa, for instance, writing on his quest to resurrect the lost city of Mudunkondapola, located in the present Kurunegala District, describes the advantages of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) to survey its supposed capital, Nikasala Nuwara.
In an informative Q&A interview, industry stalwart Prof. Chitra Weddikkara speaks of the challenges that the construction boom in the country poses, such as safety, water and electricity supply, disposal of garbage and sewerage.
The magazine devotes a double-spread pictorial to the upcoming 240-metre residential and commercial Altair twin towers, which will change the Colombo skyline with its unique tilt design.
President of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects D.H. Wijewardena, in his article, asks if Sri Lanka has lost its identity in architecture.
He says the architect creates identity either by designing buildings to have a purpose, as for example, a school or temple, or for the uniqueness of its design, a prime example of which is the Parliament complex built in the middle of the Diyawanna. Then again, he says, architects design buildings which lend national identity, such as the Sydney Opera House.
Wijewardena says ancient Sri Lanka had a proud history of architecture, which was lost after colonization. He lauds the late Geoffrey Bawa whom he says understood the essence of Sri Lankan identity.
Wijewardena says sadly, such identity is not seen anymore. He cites the example of Nelum Pokuna, which one would have to fly over to figure out the shape of the pond. He therefore advocates for a Government Architect to ensure Sri Lankan identity.
Wijewardena is critical of the apartment complexes rapidly coming up in Colombo, which he says lack proper planning.
CIOB President and Chairman of the National Construction Association of Sri Lanka, Dr Rohan Karunaratne who is synonymous with green building and has been involved with Hotel Heritance Kandalama, Deer Park Hotel and Trans Asia, says the CIOB green strategy is to minimize use of energy from the environment and to reduce emissions to a minimum.
They found that the construction industry can help reduce carbon emissions by 40% and looked to Singapore for advice.
Prof. Manawadu again writes on the iconic Colombo Lotus Tower or Neum Kuluna, also pictorially detailing the complexities of this unique structure.
Much coverage is given in the magazine to smart cities, outlining the worlds top 10 smart cities and making a case for developing Colombo as a smart city.
University of Moratuwa Vice Chancellor, Professor Ananda Jayawardena says R&D in the local construction industry is negligible. He says there is local talent for the necessary research, but funds are lacking.
The magazine is edited by Chandrapala Liyanage, who is assisted by a Board of Advisors comprising leaders in the field and makes for interesting and informative reading on the gamut of subjects in the field of construction.

## Title: An all-around  architect

An all-around  architect
Wisdom and Knowledge are two attributes it takes to become a competent architect. This is what the Moratuwa University Department of Architecture inculcates in its students. ArchWorld speaks to Dr. Shaleeni Coorey about advice given to students and going beyond the books to create an all- around Architect.
A degree anyone can have, but honesty, integrity, sincerity - these qualities you cant achieve through a degree. It matters to be humane, and to be so you have to go beyond the books. I think it is very important to respect other professions. You cant think you know everything. You need to understand and be able to listen and respect the opinions of others. Whatever job one does, its a service to another and needs to be respected and appreciated. Honesty is very important. If you can couple these qualities with your qualifications then I think you have won the day, elucidated Dr. Coorey.
More than listening
Architecture is more than listening to the client and creating spaces they want.
The client is your first meeting point. Then there is the site and the brief and the design process evolves. Quite often you have to educate the client. That is the key word, because sometimes clients do not know what they really want and in your conversation with them you try and understand what their real requirements are and help them realize their needs and wants. It is a combination of clients requirements and the Architects interpretation of it through design. It is not that you merely get everything from the client and produce exactly what they want. That is not good architecture, said Dr. Coorey
Feasibility also matters, often clients have a cost estimate.
I think it is important to teach students to foresee the future of their projects. You cant just design for the now situation. You need to look at the future.
The building will last 20 years or more. If you take a house at the moment it would be a couple with kids.
Eventually kids move out. How will you manage a house then Can you separate it in such a way that you can rent out one portion That is where educating the client comes into play, to discuss with them how they see their future, and how to sustain them. The client should be happy not only with what you produce for them now, but also with how the house will grow and adapt with time, stated Dr. Coorey
Even in other typologies of buildings all of this definitely matters. But those are only some aspects.
Then there are the essence of space, spatial experience, spatial qualities, materials and textures and how the building and spaces will behave and respond to the environment, all that relates to the design aspect. Then comes the construction aspect and then it is not just the client and architect. There are so many stakeholders involved  contractors and engineers. The architect has to manage and synchronize the design and construction and all the stakeholders involved, which involves  creative, design, technical, social and managerial skills. That is the tough part. You are not looking at the design and building process from one angle but be able to see it from all directions. It is multi-faceted.
Required skills
Soft skills such as the ability to communicate and to be sensitive and be a good team player are important. The technical knowledge and skills are also important. Project management also plays a major role as cost, quality and time is crucial in the building industry. One also needs to understand and respond to the society and the environment that he is building in. The degree course looks into all these aspects of the design and the building construction process. Such skills are important and require one to go beyond the books in the learning and teaching of Architecture, explained Dr. Coorey.
Your ability to communicate is important whether it be in English or Sinhala.
Besides the language, communication itself is an important skill. I think you can separate communication and language and there is a fine line between the two. Proficiency in language will help you communicate better, but logical thinking and presentation and the ability to make sense to people, the ability to prioritize and the systematic flow of information when presenting your design is important.
All that is part of communication. Students go through this process every time they present their designs. It is the skill of justifying what they have done and the ability to know the reasoning behind their creations  the forces in their design thinking. You should be able to explain that. That is where the communication comes in, pointed out Dr. Cooray.
At University of Moratuwa the B.Arch Degree Course is conducted in English, so Lecturers must encourage students to speak in English and present their work in English. Obviously English is a plus point for their language and communication skills.
Faculty of Architecture offers several options for students such as integrated design department which offers fashion & lifestyle design, media and communication, product design , and Department of architecture offers Landscape Architecture and Architecture  which are all creative subjects for those students who are interested. Of course there are many more undergraduate, post graduate and short courses offered by the Department of Architecture, such as Building Economics and Town and Country Planning at the Faculty of Architecture. There are also other schools of Architecture in Sri Lanka. In the Architecture course creative, technical, professional and soft skills are all combined. In every batch we have had about 50 students and above, informed Dr. Coorey.
Theory and practice
When it comes to student intake there are many criteria and requirements.
There is of course the Z -Score a UGC eligibility criteria and then we have the aptitude test. That is where the creative skills and also their intellectual skills are tested. So they have to qualify in the aptitude test as well, added Dr. Coorey.
Along with the theory subjects there is also the studio work and industrial training that helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice.
The theory subjects and knowledge is the foundation for the practical skills and knowledge gained through studio and industrial training or internship. Learning is not just subject matter but a way of thinking and mastering the thinking process.
The subjects at the university are not only meant to equip them with knowledge, but also inspire in them and cultivate in them the interest to learn and search for new knowledge where the degree is only a beginning to their lifelong learning.
A student must make the best of this opportunity and thrive in this learning ground, but always remember as a student and then as a professional never to lose the human touch  honesty, integrity and respect for all other living beings and the environment, summed up Dr. Coorey.

The panel of the Attorney Generals Department assisting the Treasury Bond Commission is attempting to tarnish my political image, Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday.
They are looking to get promotions by doing this, Minister Karunanayake alleged. Karunanayake also said that we were constantly harassed when we were in the opposition and now also we are being harassed, even when we are in government.
Minister Karunanayake said he can accept the piercing of an arrow from an enemy but not a pin pricking from a friend, which is much more hurtful.
He also said an investigation on a government related matter was possible because of the good-governance policy carried out by the present government.
Had this happen in the previous regime, it would have been a case of white-vans he said.
He was briefing media after giving evidence at the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake was extensively questioned by the Attorney General at the Commission regarding a letter Karunanayake has issued to former Governor Mahendran and about a penthouse rented by Arjun Aloysius on behalf of him.
