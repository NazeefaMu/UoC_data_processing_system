'Addicts begin smoking even before 19 years'
Almost 90 percent of those in the tobacco smoking habit today have got used to smoking during their teens even before 19 years, said Dr. G. Ganeshan said.
He made these comments at a press conference at the Government Information Department on Wednesday.
The press conference was held to launch the results of a survey done based on 18 Tamil films screened recently. The Liquor and Drugs Information Centre had conducted the survey on the manner in which liquor, cigarettes and drug use had been promoted in Indian Tamil films screened from June to September this year.
Dr. Ganeshan said the survey revealed that 17 films subjected to this survey had devoted two hours and 20 minutes to promote the use of liquor and drugs.
This amounts to a total duration of a single film. This could be considered as similar to viewing an entire film promoting smoking and liqour, he said.
Dr. Ganeshan said the film Marie devoted 22 minutes for smoking promotion while the film Vasuvumasarawanaum used 25 minutes for the same.
"These films were very popular among the youth and they are likely to be included to imitate the scenes portrayed in them," he said.

[Appreciations]-03.10.2015
C. E. Anandarajan:
Legacy of a long, pointless war
A lot has happened since the early 1980's, when I first got to know C E Anandarajan. Nearly 35 years later, it seems a different world. A way of life has died between then and now. It is through these multiple layers of life and memories that I remember that evening.
It was nearly dusk when the news spread through Jaffna 'Principal Anandarajan shot dead' and then the other three words followed in a hushed tone, like a reluctant trailer, '.... by the boys'.
I first met Anandarajan when I was 14 years, a few weeks before I was to join St John's. Anandarajan was introduced to me at a family function, as my would be principal. The first thing I noticed about him was the total lack of aloofness. His response was 'I say, I was a classmate of your mother at St John's, and she was the only girl in the class whom I was sacred of (which my mother vehemently denied!).
In the years that followed I came to know Anandarajan more closely, first as a teacher, and then as a close family friend. In those days at St John's the first year Advanced Level classes occupied the open sheds opposite the Vice Principal's house, and everyday from my classroom I would see Anandarajan walk purposefully across the school grounds from his residence to the principal's office.
If it was a Monday, I would see him again a few minutes later, wearing a black academic-gown walking up the stage of Peto Hall to chair the assembly. I used to enjoy those Monday morning assemblies, as they provided a welcome reprieve from the stress of cramming for exams. Anandarajan would invite interesting speakers to address us, from Hindu mystics to those who spoke on more earthy topics such as pollution and war in the Middle East. Ironically for many of us in those days, war was something that happened only in distant places. If there were no outside speakers, Anandarajan would address the assembly himself.
It was on one such occasions that I learnt a value that I have cherished ever since then. It is in Anandarajan's own words: "Always defend yourself. Never let anyone accuse you falsely - not anyone - not even me. If you let that happen, part of the blame is yours".
In those days living as a teenager in Jaffna was not easy. Most of our time was spent running from one tuition class to another. It was as if one's inherent value depended solely on one's Advanced Level results. On many occasions I have heard Anandarajan speak worriedly about this disturbing tendency. He often advised us to view education more widely, as preparation for life, rather than as a preparation for exams.
In 1981 a public meeting was held at the Jaffna Open Air Theatre to talk about problems facing students in Jaffna and Anandarajan was one of the speakers. In his speech, he remarked somewhat humorously: "In the 20 odd years that I have been a teacher in Jaffna, I have only seen two things grow in number - Funeral Parlours and Private Tutories." Looking back, what he said seems almost prophetic, given the barrenness that would descend upon Jaffna in the next few years.
In his novel, When Memory Dies, author A Sivanandan speaks of two types of teachers. The first one imparts knowledge. They pull you through exams and help you get qualified, get good jobs and do well in life etc. The second type are ones who influence the kind of person you become. Many who went to St John's would testify that Anandarajan fell into the latter.
Soon after Anandarajan was murdered, a number of loose reasons were given to justify his killing. Some of them were laughably ridiculous. One of them was that he raised the boundary wall of the school to obstruct militants running away after attacking the army. It is true that high walls would have prevented the free moment of militants, but anyone who is familiar with densely built up Chundikuli would know that high walls are more the norm than the exception in the area around St John's. It was more likely that he raised the wall to protect the students in the school.
The more serious accusation was that Anandarajan took the St. John's cricket team to play a match against a Sri Lankan army team based in Jaffna. But many fail to realise that this was during a ceasefire, when the leaders of the LTTE themselves were engaged in talks with the Sri Lankan government. It is alleged that the Sri Lankan Army committed many crimes, both before and after this particular match. But playing a match with someone does not amount to absolving someone of their alleged crimes. It is perhaps just a gesture of reconciliation, in the hope that there would be peace as a result of the talks in Bhutan, a hope that many Tamils cherished at the time.
In the Orwellian drama of shifting alliances and enmities that played out during the following decades, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government would warm up in many more intimacies of a much closer kind, including LTTE leaders being entertained in five-star hotels in Colombo and being flown around in Air Force helicopters, probably piloted by the same pilots who flew them in strafing missions over Tamil areas.
During the time I knew Anandarajan, I had many disagreements with him on a number of issues. No two serious minded people can agree on everything, nor should they be forced to do so. Had our association been allowed to continue, we might have continued to debate these differences. But there is a world of difference between resolving differences through debate and seeking to resolve them through violence. I think that at some point in history, humanity crossed that chasm, but in Sri Lanka we have let ourselves slide back behind that line again. We need to recover from this position, if we are ever to become a modern nation.
The LTTE allegedly killed Anandarajan but the LTTE does not exist anymore. However, the lessons to be learnt from this does not apply only to the LTTE or the Tamils. Authoritarianism is too common everywhere in Sri Lanka. We saw it in the late 1980s in the south, we saw it throughout the war in the North and East, and we saw it rise in the post war years. The lesson to be learnt is that whenever we allow power to go unchecked, society declines. It is ultimately the responsibility of the people to make sure that those who represent us are held accountable. We cannot let go of this responsibility and expect to come out in one piece.
Finally allow me to end this with a personal note. It may appear strange to some that I write this appreciation, as two years after Anandarajan was killed, my father was also allegedly killed by the Sri Lankan Army. The tragedy of war struck deep into my own family. If any, my writing this reveals just one thing, which is that the saddest but also most poignant truth facing Sri Lanka today is that after three decades of war, in pursuit of something or the other, Sri Lanka is divided only along one line. It is the line between those who suffered and those who inflicted that suffering. Six years after the end of the war, this is the only dividing line that matters, and it is the only dividing line that we should permit to matter, if we are to pursue reconciliation with honesty.
On October 3 this year, 30 years after Anandarajan's death, the inaugural Anandarajan Memorial Lecture will be delivered at the Peto Memorial Hall at St John's College, Jaffna. It is a public lecture open to all and will be delivered by Dr Daya Somasundaram. The inauguration of this lecture is a sign that intellectual life and free discussion are slowly returning to Jaffna, after decades of war and totalitarianism. While celebrating this, it is also a good time to remember C E Anandarajan and what happened to him, as we should remember all those who died in the war and the suffering inflicted, the only legacies of a long and pointless war.

Beatrice Balaratnarajah:
My true comrade
Beatrice, fondly known as Beta was my close confidant and comrade, a much loved, unpretentious pal of the family as well. My close association with unassuming Beta grew fonder over the years as I began to cherish our invaluable bond of friendship: A friend who will indeed remain simply unforgettable.
Reminiscing the past, and penning a six month memorial after Beta's demise, I was stricken with sentiments of despondency, for Beta had assuredly left a vacuum in our friendship. Amidst her busy schedule, Beta was someone who always kept in touch and impacted everyone who came into her life.
Much admired for her great intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ, Beta truly portrayed a godly charisma which magnetized the broken - hearted. A pillar of strength to the weak and weary,Beta was essentially an adorable, vivacious, petite buddy who attracted people and left an indelible mark on their lives.
Possessing an inner beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit, Beta had divine competency to change even the most trying person and challenging situations in life. Opposition or rejection was no challenge to her. Her attitude astounded me many a time. I truly witnessed Beta's ability to overcome anything and everything with a smile and without much ado. She was an epitome of love and patience and truly virtuous indeed.
Absolutely amazing, witty and humorous, it was such fun to be in Beta's attendance especially when she chose to narrate her funny stories of yester-year, with a conspicuous impish smile she would hold her audience in fits of laughter. I recall her last visit to my home just three days before she went to be with the Lord. All Beta said was that all she wanted to to thank God for all He has been to her and her family.
After her passing away, I was more than convinced that Beta was going to meet her 'Maker' and Lord and Saviour soon for sure, for she was indeed a great woman of God, an excellent wife to her precious husband Bala and an extraordinary mum to her beautiful God-fearing daughters Sonali and Minoli.
A loss of an exceptional wife, and amazing mother and an incredible friend in Christ who fought a good fight, finished her race, kept the faith and won herself an imperishable crown which we here on earth should earnestly desire. I will always treasure Beta's friendship and remember for her unique qualities and she will truly be my comrade forever more.

Hamid Abdul Kareem:
Journalist with a cause and conviction
Two weeks ago when our dear friend Hamid Abdul Kareem came home in the night to tell me that he had decided to go on the Hajj pilgrimage together with his wife, I was pleased that he has planned to get closer to the Almighty Creator Allah.
However, neither Hamid nor I realized that Allah was waiting to take Hamid to Him from the most sacred soil for Muslims in this planet. Hamid died of heart failure on his way from Azeezia to Mina on September 26 and was buried in Makka on the following day-Sunday- after noon prayers.
Hamid was lucky as this is the death that every sincere Muslim longs for. It was a shock to his family, friends and the community who find it difficult to recover from the abrupt loss of one of the finest human beings committed to help others.
Hamid, a colourful person with a great sense of humour, was known for turning even the most serious atmosphere during discussions into a humorous one.
He spent his life helping others from his early days. It was this tendency that made him a founder of the Centre for Islamic Studies and his deep involvement in the Al Amal International School, to name a few.
He served as the joint secretary of the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestinian People. There, he was very passionate in defending the rights of Palestinians and highlighting the atrocities of Zionist Jews towards Palestinians and the Arabs in the region as well.
He was known for his in-depth knowledge in Palestinian-Israeli conflict. As a well-read person, he contributed a great deal with his writing to promote the true spirit of Islam and creating understanding between people of different faiths. As part of this program, Hamid, known for his unassuming and simple lifestyle, used do discuss Islam and Christianity with theologians and others of different faiths.
Despite all his scholarly background, Hamid, born into a well-known business family, remained a businessman till his last day. Once when I asked him how was a Memon like him from a business oriented community, so much involved in scholarly activities. His response in his own sarcastic manner was: "If you ask a Memon whether he likes to go to heaven or hell, his immediate response would be 'wherever I can make some money'.
Hamid was a journalist with a cause and conviction - a generation which is fast fading under the commercialized and criminalized global political - economic environment. He fearlessly used his pen to fight for justice. This earned him the respect of all alike. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka's Muslim community which, by and large, does not understand the power of the media, failed to make better use of him.
May Allah forgive his sins, accept his deeds and grant him Jannathul Firdouse. Inna Lillahi Wa inna Ilaihi Rajihoon!

Colombo Consensus 2.0
The new Sri Lankan government is re-balancing its foreign policy, drifting away from China's orbit toward a more equidistant engagement with India and the United States.
With the growing economic importance of the Indian Ocean, the geo-strategically located Sri Lanka is becoming crucial within the strategic trajectory of the key regional power players: the United States, India and China. The island nation has therefore sought to reap the benefits of the great power competition, and the three nations have had to adjust their engagement accordingly.
The leadership of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa favoured China, while the new President Maithripala Sirisena has opened the country up for re-engagement with India and the United States. After winning the parliamentary elections in August, the new government reaffirmed Sri Lanka's new foreign policy direction, returning to the traditional practice of parliamentary democracy and renewed better relations with India and the United States. Nonetheless, what might seem to play out as deteriorating China ties in favour of stronger relations with India and the United States is much more than that: it is the manifestation of a delicate, non-aligned foreign policy.
As India and China are becoming more reliant on energy imports, the two countries "share an interest" with the United States in safeguarding the commercial sea routes on the Indian Ocean, which host one-third of the planet's population as well as vast resource supplies, and through which an overwhelming proportion of the global container and oil traffic ships transit.
With this background and historical context, Sri Lanka has become central to the dynamics of the relationship between India, China, and the United States, as all of these countries have strategic interests connected to the island nation.
Colombo Consensus 1.0
Sri Lanka has been anything but helpless in these circumstances. The Rajapaksa regime's foreign policy engagement, dubbed the "Colombo Consensus", was deeply influenced by the brutal civil war fought between the government forces and the Tamil Tigers. The bloody victory of the Rajapaksa leadership ensured a wide range of internal support, but it limited the space for engagement with foreign powers.
First, U.S.-Sri Lankan ties were severed as the Rajapaksa government was subject to criticism of alleged war crimes, human rights abuses, corruption, and nepotism. With the backing of the United States, the UN Human Rights Council requested an investigation into wartime wrongdoings, provoking a negative response from Sri Lanka.
Second, the cultural bonds between the Tamil populations on both sides of the Palk Strait heavily influenced India's engagement with the island, as New Delhi needed to satisfy the politically influential parties of the Tamil Nadu state of India without endangering cordial relations with the Sri Lankan government.
The restricted engagement of the United States and India opened up the space for China's pragmatic approach, which was not hindered by grievances over wartime atrocity claims, human rights and corruption. As Beijing's strategic interest is to maintain the security of its economic lifeline in the Indian Ocean, it started to build an extensive network of maritime facilities in the region. This plan, known as the "String of Pearls" strategy, is seen by India as an effort to "concircle" New Delhi. As the Rajapaksa regime offered advantageous conditions for infrastructural development, Beijing's push for massive investment projects-including the controversial Hambantota Port-provided justification for an increased Chinese naval presence in the region.
More recently, Colombo is an important stopover for Beijing's 21st Century Maritime Silk Road-the sea-based pillar of the "One Belt-One Road" initiative-which shows a striking parallel to the String of Pearls. Sri Lanka, under the Sirisena administration, has been eager to support China's projects, which might give further basis for maintaining Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean region. Observers now regard last year's port visits of Chinese warships in Colombo as being inconsistent with Beijing's supposed "Peaceful Rise" strategy, making India and the United States increasingly worried.
Ultimately, the rule of the Rajapaksa regime, marked by allegations of oppression, nepotism and authoritarianism, benefited Beijing, which used its leverage to gain a strategic foothold in the Indian Ocean region.
Colombo Consensus 2.0
It seems that this foreign policy trajectory was significantly altered by a karmic self-correction for freedom. Motivated by decreasing popularity, Rajapaksa called for a snap election and was dethroned by his former ally Sirisena, who promised to tackle corruption and nepotism and create a more balanced foreign policy with parliamentary democracy under the shared power of the presidency. Furthermore, Rajapaksa's recent failure to become prime minister during the general elections gives the island nation a chance to maintain its new foreign policy direction.
These developments seem to be advantageous for New Delhi. Sirisena visited India on his first overseas trip and wrapped up a consequential meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, resulting in four agreements, including a civil nuclear collaboration pact. Later, as a part of India's push for a more comprehensive Indian Ocean policy, Modi visited Sri Lanka during his Indian Ocean tour. Partly motivated by military and resource security issues, during this visit, India pledged to assist Colombo in developing the Upper Tank Farm at China Bay and transform Trincomalee into a "regional petroleum hub". The adjacent Trincomalee's natural harbour is a regular refueling stop for U.S. naval vessels.
The recent leadership changes have been welcomed by the United States. The press labeled the development as "good news for democracy," and during Secretary of State John Kerry's visit, the United States pledged to provide assistance to Sri Lanka's reforms, anti-corruption initiatives, and investigation into undeclared and hidden foreign assets by Rajapaksa's family members and other officials. Moreover, bilateral relations seem to be continuing to improve further as Washington recently abandoned its former stance on the inquiry of alleged wartime atrocities, favouring Sri Lanka's domestic investigation over an international probe by the United Nations.
In the wake of the recent developments, it seems that understanding the internal dynamics of Sri Lanka and trying to shape them is more beneficial than an external, no-strings-attached approach of pouring money into the country. Chinese investments, including the $1.5 billion Colombo project, have become targets of scrutiny. Regarding the docking of Chinese submarines, the new leadership has clearly stated that it will avoid such episodes in the future. Moreover, Sirisena publicly downplayed the Maritime Silk Road during his speech given at China's Boao Forum in Hainan.
Democracy matters
It might be tempting to conclude that the recent changes have brought a 180-degree turn in Sri Lanka's international trajectory, but this would be premature. First of all, senior officials of the government were keen to articulate that the Sino-Lankan relations did not suffer a setback, nor did they lose their importance. Second, China's loans might have been suspended, but the new government does not intend to revoke them, and there are new negotiations involving China-funded initiatives. Furthermore, China appears to be devoted to maintaining cordial relations with the new leadership, as Beijing rewarded Sirisena with a $100 million specialized hospital for his home district to treat a mysterious kidney disease afflicting farmers. Finally, the Sirisena government has maintained strategic engagement with China, as the two sides successfully conducted a joint military exercise in July.
Given the growing importance of the maritime trade routes of the Indian Ocean and its strategic location next to them, Sri Lanka has to shape its foreign policy against the backdrop of strategic competition between China, India, and the United States. Emerging from a bloody civil war, the international reputation of the Rajapaksa regime provided narrow space for manoeuvre, drifting the island toward robust Chinese influence. Nevertheless, the unexpected presidential change and the general election results have shown that the country was far from sealing its own fate.
Sirisena has initiated a clear recalibration of foreign policy, shaping the former China-inclination toward a more equidistant engagement with India and the United States. However, even the modest results of the Sirisena regime to date might be in danger if the new government fails to pursue a more non-aligned but engaged foreign policy, while fulfilling its campaign promises to the Sri Lankan people. Otherwise, a new karmic cycle may decide once again the fate of the democratic island nation.

Corporate tax dodging is 'corruption': World Bank chief
US: The head of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, criticized companies dodging taxes Thursday, calling its corrupt behaviour that ultimately hurts the poor.
The World Bank president said that developing countries needed to build more equitable taxation that could bring in revenues that "could easily eclipse official development assistance" they receive.
"Some companies use elaborate strategies to not pay taxes in countries in which they work, a form of corruption that hurts the poor," Kim said in a speech ahead of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings next week in Lima, Peru.
According to a recent United Nations report, tax evasion is costing an estimated $100 billion in lost public revenues in poor countries.
The world's central bankers and finance ministers, at the Lima meetings next week, are expected to approve a broad action plan aimed at battling multinationals' strategies to reduce their tax burdens and shelter profits in tax havens.
In his speech, Kim argued that economic growth alone was not enough to help pull people out of poverty. "A focus on GDP growth is simplistic," he said. "We reject 'trickle-down' approaches that assume any undifferentiated growth permeates and fortifies the soil and everything starts to bloom even for the poor.
"We need to find an economic growth model that's inclusive, that lifts up the poorest citizens rather than maintains those at the top."
Anti-poverty nongovernmental organization Oxfam welcomed Kim's speech, and in particular his rejection of trickle-down economics.
"Jim Kim rightly points out that the very wealthiest are capturing an excessive share of the proceeds from growth and too often this enriches only those at the top," said Nicolas Mombrial, head of Oxfam's office in Washington.
He called on Kim to support at the upcoming World Bank-IMF meetings "a process that has all countries on an equal footing so an international corporate tax system is created that works in the interest of the majority -- not the vested interests of the few." The 188-nation World Bank, the leading development lender, has set targets of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting the shared prosperity for the bottom 40 percent of the population in developing countries. - AFP

Cricket Australia scrap Bangladesh tour on terror scare
Australia called off a two-Test tour of Bangladesh on Thursday, citing terrorism fears after official warnings militants may attack Western interests.
Cricket Australia said that advice from the country's security and intelligence organisation and department of foreign affairs about an increased risk for the team meant this month's matches could not proceed.
CA chief executive James Sutherland said an independent security assessment confirmed the "risk of terrorism in Bangladesh targeting Australian nationals".
"We have decided that, regrettably, we have no alternative but to postpone the tour," Sutherland said.
Australia had been scheduled to depart Sunday for the first Test starting October 9 in Chittagong.
Bangladesh had tried to keep the tour alive insisting that the players would be given the level of security usually reserved for visiting heads of state, with Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan saying the "highest security protocol" would be provided.
Nazmul Hassan, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president, expressed sadness at the decision, insisting that measures to tighten security should have satisfied any safety concerns.
"Many countries face this kind of terrorist threat but it never stops cricket," he told reporters in Dhaka.
"With the kind of blanket security that we had offered them, I can't see how they would have faced any problems."
However, the death of an Italian aid worker in Dhaka's diplomatic quarter -- shot three times on Monday night in a murder claimed by Islamic State group -- had escalated fears.
"We had hoped that the security concerns would fade, but unfortunately the advice we have received from government, our own security experts and independent security advisors has clearly indicated that there are now high risks to our people should they make the trip," Sutherland said.
"We have worked tirelessly to try to find a way for the tour to proceed, but in the end it was simply not possible," he said.
CA said it would work with the BCB to try to reschedule the tour which had been expected to be closely-fought after the hosts recently claimed a series of high-profile scalps on home soil.
"Bangladesh is clearly on the rise as a cricketing nation and our new-look Australian team was looking forward to the challenge of playing this series. The circumstances that led to the decision to cancel the tour are bigger than the game of cricket," Sutherland said.
"Where there are elements that are beyond our control - as there are in this case - the importance of player safety is brought sharply into focus, and this is absolutely paramount."
BCB president Hassan said: "Bangladesh cricket has been going through a very good period so this kind of development, coming at this time, is sad and unfortunate." AFP

CTU Specialist doctors' strike continue
The trade union action initiated by over 90 specialist doctors attached to the Cardio Thoracic Unit (CTU) of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital continued for the third consecutive day, Hospital sources said.
According to the sources, another strike has been initiated by the nurses of the unit as well. Government Nursing Officers' Association Treasurer E. A. Jayasinghe stated that the second strike was initiated in protest against a verbal assault on nurses by the specialist doctors.
The doctors who are involved in trade union action refrained from engaging in the channeling service, ward rounds, etc. Only a few doctors carried out essential services. The main reason behind trade union action is not granting the new surgeons to carry out operations in theaters on Wednesday, the sources said.
The doctors launched the strike on Wednesday (September 30), claiming that a few doctors were misusing the hospital's operating theatres. Discussions they held with a group of high officials from the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry on October 1, had failed, the sources added.

England and Australia are fighting over the scrum before they even go on the pitch for their decisive World Cup clash on Saturday.
The pressure will be on French referee Romain Poite during the game as much as the heavyweights on either side whose battle for supremacy could decide the game.
With the stakes so high -- England were upset 28-25 by Wales and will go out in shame in the qualifying round if they lose again -- there is a war of words over how the Pool A confrontation will be refereed at Twickenham.
England forwards coach Graham Rowntree hit back Friday after former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer accused the Red Rose brigade of deploying an illegal set-piece.
England have won their last two Tests against Australia through their dominant forwards.
But Dwyer, who guided Australia to victory over England in the 1991 World Cup final at Twickenham, has accused England loosehead prop Joe Marler of gaining an unfair advantage by angling in rather than scrummaging square." AFP

Failure to take action against Coca Cola Company
Environmental, civil society organisations complain to SLHRC
Several environmental and civil society organisations collectively made a complaint at the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) on Wednesday for not taking legal action against the Coca Cola Company, over polluting of the Kelani river.
The complaint was made by the Environmental Conservation Trust, Transparency International Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka National Federation of Fisheries Co-operative Society, Movement for National Land and Agricultural Reform and Government Nursing Officers' Association.
Environmental Conservation Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara said that they were of the opinion that the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Central Environmental Authority and Biyagama Police Station had not taken the appropriate legal action against the Coca Cola Company for polluting the Kelani River.
"They did not use the powers vested in them by the law.
Therefore, we requested the Commission to summon the officials of these three institutions and conduct a comprehensive investigation into it. We also requested the Commission to advise those institutions to act according to the powers vested in them from the relevant Acts," he said.
He pointed out the Coca Cola Company could not be proved guilty before the court due to the failure of those institutions to take legal actions.
"Not only that the CEA and NWS&DB were discussing with the Company to settle the matter after the payment of compensation. They were justifying the company's actions. The polluting of the Kelani river and the damage to the Ambatale Water Treatment Plant were matters of grave concern as it is the source of drinking water for over 80 percent of the population in Colombo and the adjacent areas," he added.

Equal nationality rights, an utmost need
People are mostly concerned about the degeneration of the society; the spread of heinous crimes and continuous corrupt practices. Attacks on little children, in particular small girls have created uncontrollable anger. Hide and seek method of investigation in relation to bribery and corruption, has made the leaders of mass organizations loyal to the democratic revolution, impatient. For example they ask, is Avant Guarde an operation illegal, illicit and corrupt or not Who gave permission for this private military institute At least did they pay for the resources of Lankan people that they used In the middle of these campaigns of people for democracy, pro fascistic movement is once again preparing to raise the battle on the Geneva based discussions, connected to the problem of war crimes in Lanka. Democratic leaders believe that there is an umbrella issue covering all, namely the problem of finding a solution to the Tamil national problem.
War crimes investigation
Some people believe that global powers including India are using the threat of war crimes investigations to promote a political solution to the national problem. It is an imperialist conspiracy but meant to serve the best interests of both Lanka and India!
Global powers were enthusiastic for an international war crimes investigation. However, now together with the Lankan Government, they favour purely domestic process. Clearly, the mass uprising in Lanka for democracy has opened the eyes of global powers. They had to admit, though they supported Mahinda regime there wasn't the slightest prospect of a political solution, whereas there is now at least a reasonable prospect for it. Still, one can argue that the threat of an international war crimes investigation was meant to propel the Lankan Government towards a political solution. That is to give much benevolence to global masters.
It is more likely that they have opted to accept the democratic revolution, in order to keep it within their folds. Their method of intervention now comes under the support given to arrive at a solution to the Tamil national problem! The Tamil leaders may be very happy but the history tells us that global capitalism intervenes to give less democracy to the oppressed. It is better to accept help with concern and suspicion.
People have to be twice concerned, because there has been a change in the Indian leadership in the recent times. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a much tougher Hinduthva character than Man Mohan Singh, a western educated rationalist gentleman.
Tamil organizations
During his visit to Lanka Prime Minister Modi outspokenly advocated federalism, to show his sympathy to Federal party leaders and their struggle. Furthermore, it is claimed, unlike the Congress leaders from the time of Nehru that respected Buddhism as the apex of Hindu religion, Modi as a devotee of the ideology of Hindutva, went out of the way to affirm the Hindu commonality of the Lankan Tamils and the Hindus of India. Of course it is natural, for people of same culture and ideology to come together and claim same identity.
Nobody could complain about Hindus in the Indian subcontinent getting together with a commonality; or about the common identity of Tamils in the sub continent. If such recognition of identity tends to upset other Lankans or Indians, then it is certainly a problem.
We must note that the TNA or any other Tamil leadership never insulted the Buddha or Buddhism and never hindered Buddhist in the sub continent getting together.
GTF the most prominent pro liberation Tamil organization in the diaspora has virtually become pro government. They have been admirably moderate in their statements in recent months; they are strongly supportive of the TNA.
Clearly, global powers do not want to challenge the Lankan democratic uprising as it is supported by the majority of Tamil organizations. Latter has been working with global powers and behaved within the limitations given by the west. Now it is not very difficult to believe that the US is acting with an understanding with India, in backing Lanka's proposal for a purely domestic process.
Does this mean that the liberal government of Maithri-Ranil is going to resolve the Tamil national problem in Lanka Outside of the government, trade unions, civil organizations and social democratic political groups are campaigning for a solution and they press the government to go forward.
Need of the hour is the backing of the mass organizations for a solution based on the right of self-determination, autonomy and equality to all nationalities in Lanka. We expect that will lead to a unity with power sharing.

FR against UPFA national list fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights violation petition filed by former Parliamentarian Somaweera Chandrasiri challenging the UPFA National List appointments to Parliament was yesterday fixed for support by the Supreme Court. The petition is to be taken up again on October 16.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Chandra Ekanayake, Priyantha Jayawardena and Upali Abeyratne, the counsel who appeared for a respondent in the petition moved for a date citing that his senior counsel was not present before Court.
The petitioner Somaweera Chandrasiri who is also functioning as Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Vice Chairman cited Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, UPFA General Secretary Prof. Vishwa Warnapala, its former General Secretary Susil Premajantha, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
The petitioner states that the UPFA is an alliance of five political parties (MEP, DVJP, SLMP, SLFP and EPDP) and that the very inception the said Alliance was functioning in a transparent and democratic manner and all the decisions were taken and all appointments were made with the consensus of all constituent parties.
The petitioner stated that Susil Premajayantha in his capacity as the Secretary of the said Alliance submitted a list of names including the petitioner's for the national list.
He alleged that Prof. Warnapala was subsequently appointed as the UPFA General Secretary by the incumbent President without consulting the other parties of the UPFA.
Chandrasiri said Prof. Warnapala later submitted another set of names for the National List with some persons who were defeated at the elections and thereby constitutionally rejected and refused by the people as unqualified to be Members of Parliament.
He is seeking for a declaration that he is entitled to be nominated as qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament submitted according to the first list.
He is also seeking the Court to cancel and or quash the declaration made by the Elections Commissioner to the effect that persons in the second list are qualified to be elected as Members of Parliament.

Govt trying to mislead public - Wimal
The investigative mechanism proposed by the resolution adopted by the UNHRC is a not a domestic mechanism, National Freedom Front leader Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said yesterday.
He said though the government claims that it is a domestic mechanism, it is better to describe it as a foreign mechanism as it is clearly mentioned about the participation of foreign investigators and judges.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, Weerawansa said the government was trying to mislead the public by hiding the truth about the UNHRC resolution.
He said the US sponsored resolution adapted by the UNHRC on October 30 was co-sponsored by the Sri Lankan government with 25 additional co-sponsors allowing a domestic mechanism of investigation with foreign support.
Weerawansa said the main purpose of bringing foreign experts is to question and punish the heads of the security forces who gave orders during the war.
He challenged the government to reveal to the public that the proposed investigative mechanism is a domestic one and there was no foreign intervention.

How Jonny Wilkinson inspired Ayumu Goromaru
Japan fullback Ayumu Goromaru has perhaps the most eye-catching kicking style in world rugby: with both feet planted, he calmly stares at the ball and raises his arms. After a flick of the right wrist, he moulds his fingers into the shape of an imaginary gun before finally releasing his "trigger", a ferocious right foot in a sudden explosive action.
It's mesmeric to watch. From the initial calmness in approach to the tightening of his finger gloves -- which are worn to prevent the ball from slipping -- every movement is calculated and precise, a wonderful piece of engineering that has taken years to perfect. Twelve years, to be exact.
"The big reason behind my current style is down to my first year at university -- that was the year after England won the World Cup [in 2003]," Goromaru told ESPN via a translator at the team's Warwickshire hotel.
"Jonny Wilkinson came to Waseda University, who I was playing for at the time, to give kick coaching as part of an Adidas promotion. He taught me his kicking style and that helped initiate my own style.
"He came to Japan after becoming the number one kicker in the world. He was there mainly for the promotion, but afterwards he gave a kicking session for one hour. It was then I saw how much passion and great work ethic he had towards kicking. I was very impressed and touched. I still remember how stimulating that was.
"It wasn't so much the advice he gave -- it was his execution. He was kicking 5 metres in from the touchline with a very sharp angle. That is very difficult for a kicker -- and it was very windy that day. But he had a 100% success rate. I remember being shocked to see just how good he was."
Goromaru's kicking style has served him incredibly well. Following his time at Waseda, he began his professional career at Yamaha Jubilo, where he still plays in Japan's Top League today. -ESPN

The 12th The Ladies' College - Musaeus College Regatta will be held at the Beira lake Colombo on October 10. The regatta is the brainchild of former principal of Ladies' College, Mrs. Nirmali Wikremesinghe, who had a vision to build friendships between two of the leading girls' schools in Colombo through a shared passion for the sport.
Ladies' College, the defending champions of the Marie Musaeus Higgins Trophy which is awarded at the regatta, is led by Tarea Karunaratne and the Musaeus Collegs crew is captained by Dilkie Wijesekera. Sharen Kannangara is the coach of the Ladies' College crew while Mark Morris coaches Musaeus College. The winners tally is weighted towards Ladies' College, having won 8 regattas to Musaeus' two wins with there being only one occasion where a tie was declared. The regatta is a much-anticipated event on the calendars of both schools and on the rowing circuit too as it is a display of both excellent talent and sportsmanship after months of tough training by the dedicated young women.

Mechanism for drivers to donate body organs
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne addressing the monthly progress review meeting held on Thursday at the Health Ministry, instructed officials to submit a report within a month on the possibility of creating a mechanism for drivers to make a declaration expressing their consent to donate organs such as kidneys, eyes, heats and livers in case of accidental deaths.
According to Dr. Senaratne, many Buddhists are willing to donate their body organs. It will help save many lives in the future. The body organs of the brain dead will also be transplanted in other patients. The programmes of similar nature are implemented in many foreign countries. The liver transplant programme which was disrupted in the past, will recommence shortly, the minister said.
Dr. Senaratne said OPDs of 23 state hospitals are supposed to open until 10.00 pm, but eight of them close at 8.00 pm due to transport difficulties. The issue will be solved with the assistance of the Transport Ministry. Sri Lanka imported drugs worth Rs. 40 billion and destroyed Rs. 300 million worth drugs at the end of every year in the past, but there was a drug shortage. The drug shortage ended with the assistance of a new software, he said.
Dr. Senaratne said all medical tests are available at state hospitals. Private blood collecting centres had earlier been mushrooming around the Colombo General Hospital and other state hospital. Blood tests of sixteen categories can be conducted in state hospitals with the assistance of new auto analyzers.

The National Food Production Plan 2016-2018 will be introduced to the country by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 5 from Iranamadu, Jaffna, said Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said the Agriculture Ministry has already taken measures to implement this programme through provincial and district level programmes.
He was addressing the Provincial Agriculture Minister's Meeting at Hotel Blue Waters, Wadduwa recently.
"We are already aware of the importance of preparing a National Agricultural Policy. Through an Agricultural Policy, the state and private sectors would be able to work together under a common plan to achieve future development goals," the minister said.
He also said the absence of a proper nation-wide crop planning programme has resulted in various issues relating to the price and the availability of agricultural products.
"Abundant food production is good for consumers. But yielding the same crop in the same season could bad affected the well-being of farmers, as they cannot get a good price for their produce. But, if we can work under a proper cultivation plan, we will be able to protect both farmers and consumers" the minister said. He further added that the main objective of introducing the National Food Production Plan is to strengthen national economic growth through national food production. The programme cannot be implemented within a day.
"We have to work under short term, long term and medium term plans to realize this goal.Each and every employer of the agriculture sector should be dedicated to supporting this national programme and enhance food production to save a large amount of money that is spent for food imports.

Obama voices anger over Oregon shooting, urges gun control
US: US President Barack Obama voiced his anger and sadness after the country's latest deadly shooting, this time at an Oregon community college, and made another impassioned plea for gun control legislation.
"There has been another mass shooting in America," a stony-faced Obama said in reaction to the shooting by a male gunman at Umpqua Community College in rural Roseburg, which left 10 people dead.
"Somehow this has become routine," said the president. "We become numb to this."
"The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine," said the president, making his 15th statement on a mass shooting since taking office in 2009.
"And what's become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common sense gun legislation."
President Barack Obama pauses at a press conference on October 1, in Washington, with regard to the Oregon shooting.
Obama reiterated his frustration at the failure of the Republican-controlled Congress to back new gun control measures, and threw down the gauntlet to lawmakers.
"Prayers are not enough," he said. "We can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws."
"This is a political choice we make," Obama said. "This is not something I can do myself. I have to have a Congress and state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this."
"It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun."

A total of 20,457 dengue cases had been reported from all parts of the country up to this month with 36 dengue deaths. The death rate has dropped to 0.81 percent from 0.25 percent as reported last year, National Dengue Control Unit Director Dr. Hasitha Thisera said.
Addressing the press at the Government Information Department Auditorium, Colombo, he said the highest number of dengue patients was reported in January. It is 6,342. He added that mosquito breeding places should decrease to one percent from the current three percent to achieve better results.
According to Dr. Thisera, the number of dengue patients had decreased by 11,000 this year compared to last year. Special attention needs to be paid to the North and East with regard to mosquito eradication programmes because districts such as Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee are in the high risk category.
Dr. Thisera said out of all mosquito breeding sites, religious places are reported to have 8.27 percent breeding sites while public places have 7.51 percent. The percentage of mosquito breeding sites located in constructions sites is 6.84. Factories have 6.40 percent of mosquito breeding sites.

Repercussions of Geneva Summit
Already the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva has adopted a resolution on Sri Lanka relating to the human rights situation during the fratricidal civil war that ranged over 30 years. Though the final resolution was not available at the time of writing this article, a wide debate has opened in the country over the draft resolution that was to be adopted with amendments. This is natural. Though the debate has ended in Geneva it is likely to have its repercussions here and abroad for a long time.
Already opinion is divided over the domestic mechanism that would investigate the human rights violations that were supposed to have taken place during the last phase of the war. Some see it as a trap to strangle the country. For some others it is an excuse to whitewash the whole issue. Still others consider it a necessity step to solve the problems confronting the country at present.
Though this matter relates to the last phase of the war it is necessary to go back in history to a period considerably earlier. War is nothing but the continuation of politics by other means. The war erupted since that politics could not be continued under normal peaceful conditions. Here the turning point was the Black July of 1983 when a mass pogrom against the Sri Lankan Tamil population took place with the connivance of the Government then in power.
Internationalization of National Question
Internationalization of the National Question in Sri Lanka was a direct consequence of Black July, following which there was a large exodus of Tamils to foreign lands, principally to India and Western countries. It created a huge Tamil Diaspora most of whom subsequently obtained citizenship of the West. As a result these countries began to be involved in domestic affairs of Sri Lanka, principally in inter-communal relations and the human rights situation here. It is plain that we ourselves are to blame for this internationalization of a problem which remained absolutely a domestic one beforehand.
No country could be isolated in today's globalized world. Also the world is more alert with regard to human rights violations anywhere in the world. Just as we are concerned about the human rights of Palestinians or Black Americans or Aboriginal communities elsewhere the world is concerned about the rights of the Sri Lankan population, especially of the Tamil population.
During the latter part of the Eelam War Sri Lanka became isolated in the world due to two factors. One was the rabid chauvinist policy vigorously pursued by the Government in the name of patriotism and the antagonistic policies it pursued against countries which had a considerable Tamil Diaspora of Sri Lankan origin. Incidentally this is the type of patriotism that Bertrand Russel spoke of when he said that patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.
Positive changes
The demand for an international inquiry to investigate alleged human rights violations during the concluding phase of the war was a political reaction to the immature and unenlightened domestic and foreign policies of the former Government. It should also be remembered that it also did not emerge overnight. They first demanded a credible domestic inquiry. In deed it was promised. But the promise was never kept. Though at last the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission was established its report was not implemented. In the meantime the former President agreed with the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to allow an international inquiry. One this is evident. We have promised an international inquiry. We have lost our credibility among the world community of nations since we reneged on that promise.
Another important factor is the change in the international community's attitude towards Sri Lanka following the Presidential election and the positive changes taken by the new government to create a climate more conducive for national reconciliation. They have also noted the remarkable change for the better in the human rights situation and steps taken towards good governance albeit against stiff opposition from reactionary forces. The result has been the ending of Sri Lanka's isolation in the world.
The retreat of the international community from an international inquiry to a hybrid and then domestic inquiry is a result of the political developments in Sri Lanka since January. This has somewhat reduced the threats to our sovereignty. It is only somewhat and not total for total elimination of the threat depends on our own conduct.
For example, our sovereignty would be certainly in danger if we reject outright the demand for a domestic inquiry. We have to admit that there human rights violations may have occurred during the war. When they are violated even in ordinary non-political confrontations how can we offhand deny that there were never any such violations
On the other hand, a refusal to investigate betrays a guilty consciousness on our part. Our politicians and officials have so far behaved in that way. Whatever inquiry that is held should be fair and independent. It should not be a trick to get out of an embarrassing situation. Such a course of action would have the same result as rejection of an inquiry.
Defects in judicial system
Though the request for an inquiry has come from the international community the inquiry is actually an imperative domestic need for it is a sine qua non for national reconciliation and sustainable peace. Its need is therefore more ours. Elated at the decision of the Human Rights Council to opt for a domestic inquiry some spokesmen of the Government has begun boasting that everything is OK as if there is nothing more to worry about. Everything will be OK only if inquiries are conducted properly and fairly, If not the international community may change its attitude again. We have to remember that lost credibility cannot be regained by words alone.
Since the defects in our judicial system are acknowledged it is essential that some form of international intervention may be needed for the domestic inquiry. The task will be to select the form of intervention that would not compromise State sovereignty. There may be persons in any social organism that violate ordinary norms of conduct. We find such persons among teachers, lawyers, doctors, politicians, priests etc. Then how could one say that Black Sheep are not found among members of the Security Forces If there are such persons investigating and punishing the guilty would certainly enhance the prestige of the Security Forces. The Tamil National Alliance in a statement on the draft resolution of the Human Rights Council has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Government. This is a welcome positive development. In its opinion the domestic inquiry is a constructive first step in a long journey towards national reconciliation.
However there are several obstacles to be cleared to effectively proceed towards national reconciliation. The first is the need to overcome the resistance of the chauvinist forces who are trying to use the HRC Resolution to regain power. Their strength should not be under-estimated. They thrive on the ignorance of the public and use pseudo-patriotic slogans to foster racial hatred. Also one should be mindful of opportunist forces within the ranks of the Government itself who may again desert it and join the opposition at critical times. A repetition of the serial drama enacted by the opposition during the January-August period may occur.
The best guarantee against such a possibility is to take the people into confidence and ensure transparency and openness in all government undertakings. The necessity of organising the masses in favour of a political solution to the National Question is an urgent necessity if Sri Lanka is to make good use of the new space available for national reconciliation and a just peace.

Tiger Woods acknowledges 'sun is setting' on his career
ger Woods, who is 'on the couch' recovering from his most recent back surgery as his U.S. compatriots prepare to take on the Internationals in next week's Presidents Cup, knows full well that the end of his Hall of Fame career is in sight.
With no timetable for when - or if - he'll be able to rebound from a second microdiscectomy, NBC/Golf Channel analyst Notah Begay III said on Wednesday that his close friend had no illusions about his future.
"I think he has a clear understanding of where he's at in regard to his career," Begay said of the former world No. 1 who has plummeted to 299th in the rankings. "The sun is setting."
Such a statement, which Begay made during a teleconference promoting the biennial competition that will take place in South Korea starting on October 8, should come as no surprise to anyone who has a passing knowledge of Woods' recent struggles on the course and in the OR. Still, to hear a Tiger intimate say such words out loud was jarring, even though we are all aware that the 14-time major winner will be 40-plus before he swings another club in competition.

UNOPS helps improve groundwater conditions in Mannar
The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), in partnership with the Mannar District Secretariat and the Mannar Urban council, held a series of community consultations in a bid to help communities improve groundwater conditions and increase their resilience to floods related threats.
The result of the consultations has led to joint development of solutions for the problems faced in the district. The residents of Mannar face regular threats of flooding at rainy seasons. The threat of flooding looms high with the high tide levels reaching 0.75 metres, and with the height in some areas of the island being less than 0.75 metres above mean sea level.
The activities are part of a wider effort to upgrade the drainage network and the inland pond systems to contribute to better flood control and increased groundwater recharge. The interventions are set to benefit more than 16,000 people in the Mannar Island. UNOPS is also working with the authorities to demarcate and identify boundary lines of the ponds as those are often unclear and no proper documentation from the past is available. These activities are carried out by UNOPS in collaboration with the local authorities, community based organisations and the local residents.
This participatory approach has allowed the team to help resolve some of the land use issues and reach settlements with most of those who have encroached on the pond areas. Work is in progress to renovate and restore some of the main ponds in the island which will improve the surface water management and groundwater recharge capacity.

Vatican cricket club to face Muslim XI
VATICAN CITY: The Vatican's increasingly high-profile cricket club has set the date for a highly symbolic first match against an all-Muslim team from Britain, organisers said Thursday.
In a series of matches this month, the St Peter's cricket club, made up of mostly South Asian Rome-based seminarians and priests, will also take on a team from Pope Francis's home town of Buenos Aires and get a chance of revenge against a Church of England XI.
But it is the meeting with Mount Cricket Club from Batley, Yorkshire, on October 17 that is likely to attract the most attention, with the Church hoping it will make a small contribution to global inter-faith understanding.
"It is going to be Muslims and Catholics playing together, a bridge being made in sport between believers," said Father Robert McCulloch, an Australian priest who was based in Pakistan for 34 years and helped organise the inter-faith clash with help from the governor of Sind province in Pakistan, Ishrat-ul-Ibad Khan.
Most of Mount's players are of Pakistani heritage. "This is a point that is going to be picked up in countries where cricket is played," McCulloch added.
"Pope Francis says walls are never solutions, bridges always are. What we are doing here is making a good bridge, a small counterbalance to a culture of violence throughout the world."
Established in 2013, the St Peter's club toured England last year where their matches included meetings with The Royal Household club based at Windsor Castle, an authors XI and a team of British army chaplains.
A tight match with the Anglican church's finest ended in the narrowest of victories for the Archbishop of Canterbury's XI.
Media attention surrounding the tour led to officials at the Mount CC getting in touch with the St Peter's team to propose a match.
During their visit to Rome they are to be invited to join members of the St Egidio religious community for prayers in one of the city's best known churches, the 12th Century Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere.

Video clip may have been an old one - NCPA
The National Child Protection Authority official yesterday, said that the controversial video clip that went viral on social media, may have been an old one as it had received information that the incident had taken place 18 months ago.
He said that they had received information of such an incident from the Kalutara Police Division. The NCPA officials and Police officials of the relevant police stations were informed to look for more information on this incident.
"If the girl who is being beaten by two males in the video clip is underaged, the NCPA will conduct a probe and legal action would be taken against the assailants," he said.
The video showed two apparently drunken males beating a girl severely, while another person recorded the incident.

Wales battle to Fiji win
Gareth Davies guided Wales to a nail-biting 23-13 victory over Fiji on Thursday to pile the pressure on Pool A rivals Australia and England.
Even though there was no bonus, the win was the third for Warren Gatland's Welsh team after having beaten Uruguay 54-9 and England 28-25. It left them on top of the "Pool of Death" on 13 points ahead of Australia (9) and England (6).
Wales will be virtually guaranteed one of the two qualifying spots for the quarter-finals along with Australia if the Wallabies beat England on Saturday.
But Fiji made it so hard for Wales at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, the home side failing to convert overwhelming first-half domination of territory and possession into points.
The Pacific islanders rallied impressively at scrum-time and in the loose, capitalising on very poor out-of-hand kicking by Wales.
But Wales captain Sam Warburton savoured the exhausting win.
"That was so tough," said Wales captain Sam Warburton. "The first half, I was knackered."
"But we have got three wins out of three. If someone had told us that at the start of the campaign we'd bite your hand off."
Wales scored two first-half tries through man of the match Davies and Scott Baldwin. Fly-half Dan Biggar kicked two conversions and three penalties.
Costly misses
Ben Volavola kicked two penalties for Fiji after Wales scrum infringements and despite losing influential scrum-half Nikola Matawalu to injury and giant goal-kicking winger Nemani Nadolo to a ban, crossed for one try through Vereniki Goneva.
There was an electric start to the game, the Welsh camping out in the Fijian 22 metre area and both sides playing harum-scarum rugby to the delight of the 71,000 crowd. AFP

Weird rugby rituals
Stevie Wonder penned the line "very superstitious" as a hit song and it seems the world's rugby players have been listening.
A number of current oval ball (and a heap of former) stars - and even coaches like Steve Hansen - are clearly obsessed with pre-match and during match rituals and superstitions.
One recent survey of top sportsmen and women found that 13 per cent of them thought that touching the tunnel ceiling in the entrance to the playing field was key to their performance. Others revealed they would deliberately vomit to settle their nerves. We scoured the files and found nine unusual examples of past and present Rugby World Cup players and the strange rituals used to help give them a psychological edge.
Dan Biggar (Wales)
It was England's 2003 Rugby World Cup hero Jonny Wilkinson who is largely credited with rewriting the book when it comes to the lead-up to his goalkicking attempts. The recently retired Wilkinson is famous for his meticulous pre-kicking routine which included grasping his hands together and raising them up to his chest. Wilkinson's sequence has been mimicked ever since but Welshman Dan Biggar has taken it to a new level. The match-winner against England when he nailed a penalty goal from halfway in Wales' 28-25 win last Sunday, Biggar's pre-kick routine was tagged as the "Biggarena" by London's Daily Telegraph. His idiosyncratic routine has proved an internet sensation.
Steve Hansen (New Zealand)
He won't reveal why he does it but next time the TV cameras focus on the All Blacks coach during a game, watch him rub his nose with his finger. It's a deliberate act but Hansen won't say if it's a superstition or a signal. Some have speculated the nose-rubbing is an in-joke with Sky TV's commentary team and a signal to let them know that Hansen believes the All Blacks have the match under control no matter what the scoreline might say. Whatever, keep it up Steve...it's working!
Mike Catt (England)
He's better known by New Zealanders as Jonah Lomu's doormat in the 1995 World Cup but Englishman Catt was a RWC 2003 winner and is currently in charge of coaching England's backs. He has a similar "tic" to Hansen in that he touches his ear during the singing of England's national anthem ahead of matches. It was originally intended as a way of sending a visual message to his family, watching from home. But the routine is now a ritual for Catt.
David Campese (Australia)
The unpredictable Aussie winger had one noticeable foible. He had to be the last player to run out on the pitch in any game he played. Leaving the dressing room last seemed to work well for 'Campo' but it did blow up in 1996 at Wellington's Athletic Park when he turned his back on the haka, kicking a ball to himself under the goalposts. The All Blacks were unimpressed, with Jonah Lomu running rampant as New Zealand racked up a 43-6 scoreline in the last test ever played at the famous ground in the capital.
Alan Whetton (All Blacks)
The World Cup-winning All Black loosie from the 1987 squad was surprisingly superstitious in his playing days. "I used to have a little ritual in the changing shed," Whetton said. "I would put the jersey on a peg by itself - it would command a lot of respect. So I would look at it. I used to have my togs, boots and mouthguard in a bag below - they didn't quite warrant being together with the shirt. Also, 40 minutes before a game at Eden Park, I would go round to each corner and would imagine myself dotting down in that corner. I used to pat the grass thinking: 'That could be AJ's spot.'"
John Smit (South Africa)
The World Cup-winning Springbok skipper of 2007 has a dark secret - and one loosely associated with the All Blacks. Throughout his entire illustrious career which included leading South Africa 82 times in a 110-test career, Smit only ever wore black underpants when he played. He believed wearing any other colour would jinx him and his team. -NZHERALD

Writ petition challenging FCID postponed
The writ petition filed by Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thero and Prof. Carlo Fonseka challenging legality of the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) was yesterday fixed for support on November 6 by the Court of Appeal.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal Justices Vijith K. Malalgoda and H.C.J. Madawala, the Attorney General sought a further date to file written submissions.
Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera and Prof. Fonseka had cited the Inspector General of Police as the respondent and sought Court intervention to quash the order published in the gazette notification bearing No.1901/20 dated February 13, 2015 by which the purported FCID allegedly set up which is ultra vires and illegal.
The petitioners stated that the FCID was purportedly established under section 55 of the Police Ordinance. Section 55 does not vest any power with the IGP to establish a separate functional division in the Police Department and it only empowers to make orders and regulations in respect of matters set out therein which are ordinarily called house rules.
They further maintained that the FCID is violative of the imperative of the provisions of the law and specifically ultra virus provisions of the Police Ordinance.
They stated that the Gazette notification published in terms of Section 55 is ultra vires of the Police Ordinance and therefore any investigation carried out under the FCID is of no force of law and therefore a nullity.
