Chathura paid for his wedding
There was no misuse of government property or public funds for MP Chatura Senaratnes wedding and MP Senaratne had already paid Rs. 2.1 million for hiring the hall adjoining Temple Trees, Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said yesterday.
If anyone needed this hall, an advance could be paid to book the hall, he added. The hall has earlier been hired for various functions even though this was the first wedding.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, the Deputy Minister said that Prime Minister is using Temple Trees only as his office and he spends his nights in his own home at Cambridge Terrace.
During the previous regime, Temple Trees had been a centre for thugs and there were many secret rooms. Many of those who shout for the JO now, including several union leaders, have been assaulted in the black rooms in Temple Trees during the former regime, he said.

Govt.to forge ahead  with renewed strength
The Unity Government should forge ahead with renewed strength as it was formed by a vast majority of the people placing their trust in President Maithripala Sirisena, Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He said the President is on his way towards fulfilling the aspirations of the people to develop this county. Therefore, nobody should try to sabotage and destabilise the country.
Minister Dissanayake said that anyone can enjoy the freedom gifted by the Good Governance government but, should not misuse it as that would result in creating unnecessary inconveniences to the public, including school children, patients, Security Forces and Police and officials.
Asked as to whether he would join the protest campaign organised by the Joint Opposition in Colombo today, he replied that the politicians should have concrete and stable policies which donot change for their benefit. The Minister also pointed out that the team of the 15 SLFP members, who quit the government recently after holding positions in the government, obtaining a salary from the government, used government vehicles and official residences, went on foreign trips. Therefore, it is not fair to criticise the government for their benefit.
The SLFP faced challenges even in the past. The party bravely overcame all these challenges. Therefore, we will make the right decisions at the right time for the countrys sake, he added.
The Minister also added that the government and his party is always open to constructive criticism and ias always prepared to correct their mistakes and shortcomings.

JO protest, a Bili Poojawa in Namals name
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said that todays JO protest is a Bili Poojawa (Sacrifice) in the name of MP Namal Rajapaksa to cover up their past wrongdoings.
This protest is aimed at influencing the judiciary and not forming a government, he said.
Addressing the media at the Finance Ministry yesterday, Minister Samaraweera said that Namal is attempting to sacrifice the lives of his fathers supporters in order to escape from the alleged fraud and corruption charges. If you are expecting that the government will fulfill your wish, Namal Baby you will be disappointed, the Minister said.
The Minister assured that the government will not interfere with todays protest and President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have already instructed not to obstruct this protest.
But, if it is a protest, it should definitely be a protest. If they attempt to destroy public property and inconvenience the public, the Government will strictly adhere to the law, Minister Samaraweera added.
Recalling to the Roshen Chanaka and Rathupaswala incidents, the Minister said that the government will not target people engaged in protests,unlike the previous regime, because we accept the peoples right to protest.
He further said that the main organiser of this protest, Namal Rajapksa is a suspect who has been released on bail.
That is why social media reported it as a Horunge Rasthiyaduwak, and not a public protest. Namal is alleged to have been involved in money laundering, though he pretends to be a hero. He cannot even go abroad without informing the court, the Minister said. Minister Samaraweera further added that MP Namal Rajapaksa was arrested and remanded for alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs. 45 million in two companies owned by the Rajapaksas and was released Rs.100,000 bail with four sureties of Rs 10 million each.
Responding to a question by a journalist regarding the cancellation of bookings of five public grounds in Colombo, the Minister said that according to Colombo Municipal Council sources, no such cancellation were made.
The Minister questioned as to why five grounds were booked if it is a public protest march.
After 2015, anybody has the freedom to oppose, criticise and blame the government. Sri Lanka is a country with seven star democracies. We do not need to be shy about that. This is a principle of a democratic country, he said.
There are accepted guidelines to follow if someone engages in a protest.
"They should inform the route and the place where they plan to convene, start and end the protest, to the police and other relevant authorities in order to ensure the smooth flow of traffic and ensure the security. But, nobody has informed the relevent authrotities regarding todays protest, the Minister said.

Lanka needs to embrace emerging technologies
Sri Lanka needs to embrace and adopt to emerging technological advancement in the shipping and logistics industry to make a big difference to the logistic scenario in South Asia, said State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardena.
He was speaking at the inaugural session of Asia Logistics Forum, held in Colombo yesterday.
The Minister said that Sri Lanka plays a vital role in terms of global security and global trade due to its geo strategic location in the Indian Ocean. Furthermore, it is situated strategically in the middle of the ancient Silk route of the ocean between East and West. According to the Minister, many stakeholders have come forward to assist Sri Lanka to maintain its neutrality and help Sri Lanka to effectively respond to disaster relief measures in the Bay of Bengal.
Furthermore, the minister said these stakeholders have expressed willingness to facilitate trade and shipping activities in the Indian Ocean, thereby providing new technical capabilities for Sri Lanka in terms of gantry management, tracking and delivering goods to global customers in an efficient manner. After decades of neglect, the Bay of Bengal is today reassuming strategic and economic salience. Nearly 1.4 billion people live along its coastline and almost a fourth of the worlds total population calls this region home.
The seven countries situated immediately on and around the bay of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have a combined GDP of approximately US$ 2.7 trillion and an impressive average rate of economic growth of around 5.5%, he said.
In addition to that, Sri Lanka maintains excellent relationships with Japan, China, Australia, USA and the EU by maintaining the neutrality of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.
The main challenge for Sri Lanka is to be an attractive logistic provider in the region for global shipping lines to make their base here and facilitate their operational requirements. I believe Sri Lanka as a country has the capability and required capacity to meet their requirements in a successful manner, he said.
The Minister said the total volume handled by the Colombo port in 2017 was 7 million TEUs while the total revenue of Colombo port was around US $ 240 million, which is low compared to other players in the region.
The present development of the Colombo South harbour was delayed by 10 years.
In the meantime, Indian ports have undergone massive changes and this has certainly affected the volume of the Colombo Port, he said. He said the government is also planning to develop Colombo ports East Container Terminal; which will provide berthing facilities for some of the large vessels once completed. In addition, plans are underway to develop Trincomalee harbour in the near future.
He said the government is keen to maintain its ransshipment shipping hub status and expanding its position to be the regional maritime hub.
To this end, Minister said its paramount to tap IT capabilities and hospitality industry activities to make a compound impact in the region as well as in the logistics industry.

## Title: Recycled aggregate, viable choice for river sand

Recycled aggregate, viable choice for river sand
Utilization of construction and demolition waste to produce recycled aggregates (sand) should be facilitated by relevant authorities, said Ranjith Gunatillake, President of Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI).
He was speaking at a seminar on Supply of Sand (Fine Aggregates) For Construction Work, organized by the Chamber of Construction Industry at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute last week.
The CCI President said that appropriate construction practices should be adopted to minimize the use of sand due to the scarcity of river sand in Sri Lanka.
Offshore and manufactured sand can be considered as two viable alternatives to meet the increasing demand for river sand. Production of manufactured sand as the main product should be encouraged. In addition, bottom ash (coarse, granular, incombustible by-product of coal combustion) can also be utilized as a light weight fine aggregates to masonry units and other products, he said.
He also pointed out that extraction of dune and pit sand can cause unrecoverable environmental damage and hence necessary actions should be taken to avoid further destruction.
The use of optional materials instead of river sand is available in Sri Lanka. Citing examples, he said washed soil sand could be used for building construction instead of using river sand.
Nevertheless, local structural engineers hold different opinions on the use of washed soil sand for building construction. I would like to request all the professionals particularly structural engineers to allow the use of washed soil sand for construction work if it is in correct order and meet the correct requirement rather than promoting same old materials for building construction, he said. Gunatillake said further that it is essential to improve workmanship as well as the use of standard size of bricks to reduce the demand for sand for building construction in Sri Lanka.
He said the price of sand per cube has not gone up very much over the years in comparison to other expenses of the general public in Sri Lanka. Making a comparison between the value of sand per cubic and the wages of engineers and labourers as per the exchange rate between Sri Lankan rupee and the US dollar during the 1980-2018 period, he said that in 1980, the salary of an engineer was US $ 67 per month and currently it stands at US $ 620 or close to Rs. 100,000 per month.
For sand, it was only US $ 26 per cubic in 1980 and today it is about US $ 100 which is equivalent to Rs. 16,000 per cubic. In 1980, salary of a laborer was around US $ 20; today it is around US $ 220 or close to Rs. 35, 000 per month. During the period 1980-2018, value of sand per cubic has gone up by 14 times where as engineers and labourers salaries have gone up by 100 times, he said.
CCI Secretary General and Chief Executive Officer, Nissanka Wijeratne speaking at the seminar said that sand is a special component in all construction related work, especially in brick, masonry and finishing works.Wijeratne estimated the total requirement of sand as to around 20 million cubic metres per annum in Sri Lanka.
However, due to the increased demand, our suppliers and miners have to over extract the river base. As a result, considerable damage has been done to the ecology and in certain areas, the damage is irreversible. Because of that the government was compelled to impose a number of restrictions on the mining of river beds for sand as well as transportation of river sand, he said.
As a result, price of river sand in Colombo has gone up to around Rs. 16,000 per cube. In addition to that, construction cost per unit in Sri Lanka is supposed to be the highest in the South Asian region as well as it is higher than Singapore and Dubai, he noted. Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka delivering the key note speech at the seminar said that construction activities in Sri Lanka have plunged during the last four months and the growth potential of the industry has been hampered to due to escalation of cost, depreciation of capital, shortage of skilled labour, scarcity of materials and etc.
Nevertheless, despite this scenario, the industry is doing well and there is so much potential to harness both home and abroad, he said.
We are not in a world where construction materials are used in a sustainable manner. We have to carefully look at this aspect and need to take a holistic approach to find better alternatives to address the scarcity of construction materials in the country, he said.
The Minister also stressed the importance of conducting more research and development activities with regard to mining natural resources in a sustainable manner in Sri Lanka.

35-foot skateboard
A Los Angeles man's massive skateboard, measuring 35 feet, seven inches long, has been certified by Guinness World Records as the largest in the world.
Joe Giaglia, director of California Skateparks, originally created the big board for MTV series Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory and is a 12.5 scale replica of Dyrdek's own board.
"The hardest part was not having any directions or blueprints," he told Guinness World Records.
"We just started and figured it out as we progressed. The process took us about 10 weeks, a lot of things were trial and error."
The skateboard, which measures eight feet, eight inches wide and three feet, 7.5 inches tall, appears in the 2019 Guinness Book of World Records, the record-keeping organization said.
Ciaglia said the board was designed to function in the same way as a much-smaller board, with the main differences being its size, a supporting steel frame and using race car tires.
He said the board is a major attention-grabber.
"One time in New York we were driving out of Time Square and a police officer pulled me over. I thought I had done something wrong and then he said 'can I get on your board' So he literally pulled me over to take a picture on the skateboard!" Ciaglia said. UPI

CA Sri Lankas 39th National Conference  to inspire Chartered Accountants
Sri Lankas biggest annual business summit, the National Conference of Chartered Accountants organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), is set to take the centre stage in inspiring Chartered Accountants to take that all important leap which will help them evolve and thrive despite the increasing business world complexities.
The 39th National Conference which will revolve around the theme Hyperleap will help Chartered Accountants understand the need to embrace challenges, whilst ensuring that they take a bold leap without being shackled by technological, demographic and economic changes.
The conference which will be held from October 8 to 10, 2018 at the BMICH, will focus upon the increasing technological disruption, future HR challenges and changes to the global economy, whilst emphasizing the important role accountants have played in the past in propelling businesses to the top and the important role they can continue to play if they continue to be relevant.
Speaking at a press conference held in Colombo to unveil this years conference theme, President of CA Sri Lanka Jagath Perera emphasized that the technological revolution has brought in monumental changes to the professional community including the accounting profession.
The challenges and complexities we face as a profession, has renewed the need for us as professionals to adapt to new trends, technologies and methodologies, if we are to remain relevant as a group of specialized professionals. This is why CA Sri Lanka has been spearheading various initiatives to ensure our members are not just qualified, but they are also given a platform to evolve and thrive in todays context, he said.
Last years national conference attracted over 1700 delegates including business leaders, c-suite executives and top professionals. This year too as in the past, the institute will offer the conference via webcast for the benefit of Chartered Accountants who are overseas. The three day conference, which also comprises of two days of technical sessions will bring together a cross section of local and foreign speakers and panelists who are well versed in taking bold initiatives and thriving despite the challenges they have faced in their professional lives.
Addressing the media, Chairman of the National Conference Committee, Dulitha Perera emphasized that Chartered Accountants have always played a pivotal role in the private and public sector in propelling economic development. They are equipped to contribute immensely in boardrooms with the ability to steer strategic decision making. This is why our Chartered Accountants have a far greater responsibility lying on their shoulders. We have to be in the forefront to ensure that our members change with time and embrace the challenges to ensure they continue to be relevant and will continuously add value to their company and their country, he said.
Speaking further, the National Conference Committee Chair also noted that with challenges and complexities being part and parcel of the business world, Chartered Accountants must progress to become visionary thinkers by having the foresight to see what the future holds and therefore adapt and evolve to take on new challenges boldly by acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge. The National Conference is therefore the perfect platform to enhance mind development, because it focuses on very pertinent areas relevant to Chartered Accountants which in turn help them acquire new knowledge, all while stimulating their thoughts and line of thinking, Dulitha Perera added.
Meanwhile, Chairman of the National Conference Technical Committee, Moiz Rehmanjee explaining the rationale behind this years theme emphasized that the committee decided to choose Hyperleap because it has become important to ensure that the members of the profession are not subdued from challenges they face, but instead are enabled to spin them into opportunities. As professionals, we must boldly go forward, and not be shackled by the ever changing technologies and demographics. We must all embrace challenges and spin them into opportunities and be ready to take that leap, boldly, he said. Rehmanjee also said that due to the disruptions of traditional business models and the advent of digitization, among other changes spanning HR and the economy, Chartered Accountants are well placed in organisations to equip themselves with skills and experience to move ahead into the future.

This was when a Mandamus petition filed by M. K. Anil Erwin Nanayakkara, the Managing Director of Lotus Flower International Company of Thalpitiya in Wadduwa came up for inquiry on September 3.
The Judge postponed further inquiry for September 27 calling for a report.
The Western Provincial Council, after perusing documents regarding a plot of state land at Ratnayaka Place, Thalpitiya South in Wadduwa, had made a decision to lease it to the petitioner of the Mandamus. However, the decision of the Western Provincial Council had been dishonoured by the Panadura Division Coordinating Committee as it had decided to lease it to the Daladawatte Welfare Society. The petitioner challenged the decision of the Panadura Division Coordinating Committee through a Writ of Mandamus and a Writ of Certiorari.
The Counsel for the petitioner Sisira Kodikara in his submission to court said the approval of the Panadura Division Coordinating Committee had been obtained by the Panadura Divisional Secretary in a letter with the forged signature.

The cautious seldom errs
Head Girl of Sanghamitta Balika Vidyalaya Galle, A D Medhavi has achieved a certain balance that makes her leadership effective. Perfect Prefects features Medhavi whose powers of observation and willingness to listen have yielded positive results.
Medhavis training began at a very young age partly due to the fact that she listened to her elders.
As a Head Prefect, I should set an example for everyone. I need to embody the proper spirit, conduct and ideals befitting a model citizen in this society we live in. Life is a learning experience and though no one is perfect, I feel a head prefect needs to work as hard as possible to address his/her shortcomings so he or she can expect the juniors to follow suit. From a very young age, a student needs to show proper respect to his/her parents. He/she must learn from a very young age itself how to develop a good and respectable character, said Medhavi.
Necessary steps
Medhavi is a patient and never hurries when the cautious calculation is required.
When facing an obstacle in life what I do is, I give it a lot of thought. I also seek the advice of my parents, teachers and elders and then I decide on the best plan of action. When I face a pressure situation I look at its root causes and then take the necessary steps to remedy it, stated Medhavi.
Earning the goodwill of others through promoting and maintaining good social relations is a good idea of Medhavis and one that will certainly help her in life. Having friends in many stations in life can be immensely useful to anyone.
One reason for my success is that I have earned the goodwill of others through my efforts in establishing good relationships. I have always been obedient to my parents and teachers and I have always applied myself diligently to my studies and formed a personality that is outstanding, added Medhavi.
Proper skills
Her school has moulded her character in such a way that Medhavi has been equipped with the proper skills in the field of sports, extracurricular activities and academics.
When you take Sanghamitta Balika Vidyalaya Galle, it is one of the best schools in the world. For me, my school has laid the foundation for my life and what I have received from it is beyond measure. It has improved my life beyond measure. In return for this, I am ready to serve my school whenever the opportunity presents itself. I attribute all my victories to my school even at the national level. I came Island 5th at the O/Ls 2016. I have played badminton for three years and I have been in the media unit in my school and have taken part in dance competitions, pointed out Medhavi.
Medhavis aim in life is to be a surgeon and she feels strongly about those who have no voice or means of alleviating their suffering.
I think when we take the society we live in today, we must all try and work towards creating a society where there is fairness and we need to work towards creating a society that upholds equality. We need to live in a just society where there is no discrimination and where all communities are treated fairly. A society where no one is marginalized. There needs to be equality before the law. I also feel that those in high positions need to be wise and educated. My goal in life is to be a surgeon and I want to do my part for society as a responsible and law-abiding citizen. I feel strongly about the injustices done to those who have no voice in society. Those who are powerless. The small people explained Medhavi.
Honourable life
We live in a society with various vices such as drug abuse and getting into the bad company is a problem in itself. The world is full of pitfalls. Knowing the trap is there is one way of avoiding it.
In todays society, there are so many distractions and temptations for the young to go astray. My advice is - try to lead a good, ethical, useful and honourable life, so you can say with pride that you have done the best that you can. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my parents and my family, my principal, my teachers, the school staff and my friends, said Medhavi.
Brainstorming with others is a requirement when you are a leader. You need to inspire them to provide them with the incentive to work. Motivation is the name of the game.
In a school when you are in a leadership position that automatically means that you have to work with others. Because people have different ideas with different approaches. So you have got everyone on the same page. So you need to get everyone involved in the planning process and work with unity and try and create team spirit. You also need to have insight into the working styles of your fellow team members. Then you know how best to get the work done. As Head a Girl I need to make important and crucial decisions and I need to listen to the views of others because it is all about decision making which is a challenge in itself, explained Medhavi.

September 5, V Day or D Day
It is reported that people will be gathering on September 5 to demonstrate against the elected government to resign. Whether it will achieve its objective is left to be seen. However, the bottom line truth of this show is to topple this government and bring in a government to squash or sweep under the carpet cases or set free those who are accused of murder, fraud, theft, waste etc. and convince the hoi polloi, all these accusation or allegations are to take revenge. If that is the hidden agenda, should masses support
Our people are politically immature and easily duped by those with a gift of the mouth to believe. So the rot will continue, the government which follows will accuse the present government of the same allegations, paying little or no attention to develop the country. So the merry-go-round will go on with the Papara Band.

Colombo to be developed on zonal basis
The Colombo city and suburbs will be developed on zonal basis. One of the main aspects of this will be the administrative city. Work on this which began in 1985 is due to be completed by 2025, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The minister was addressing the gathering at the Colombo Dialogue, recently.
Minister Ranawaka said nearly 113 government offices were situated in Colombo. Leaving out financial institutions, all other offices could be shifted to the proposed administrative city as the construction of the buildings was now underway.
The Sethsiripaya third stage was no more a dream as a 28-storey building is now under construction, he said.
The construction work on Sethsiripaya stage 4 will be launched this year. Some of the buildings under construction would be completed by 2020.
The other projects envisaged were Colombo city, Colombo Harbour, Port City, Beira Lake project, restoration of historic buildings and the Transport Centre in Colombo Fort and Maritime city encompassing Galle city.
Minister Ranawaka said already slum dwellers around the Beira Lake had been shifted to modern flats through persuasion and a part of the area around the lake would be developed as a line park accessible to people of all walks of life.
The balance section around the lake would be developed within the next one and a half years.
He said the 150-year-old water supply network was also being modernised by laying new pipe lines.

COME ENJOY FREEDOM, PM TELLS JO
Political opponents have got the space to organise protests in Colombo because of freedom and democracy prevailing in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier responding to a question by Joint Opposition (JO) Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said in Parliament yesterday that the JO is free to hold its Janabalaya Kolambata protest in a manner that did not disturb the day to day work of the people.
Tomorrow (5) is not a public holiday.
A large number of students and employees are coming to Colombo. Public transport should not be disrupted. That is the only concern that we have raised, he noted.
The Prime Minister also noted that the MPs must not be obstructed from attending Parliament, adding that it is a right of the MPs provided in the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act. Police can act if this law is violated.They need not wait for our instructions, he added.
Anybody can come to the city and go back.There is no prohibition.The bar and tavern owners have already kept hopes for a day full of business to earn a lump sum. Thanks to the social freedom that we have established the JO can hold its protest tomorrow.
Are you now trying to find excuses for a low turn up of people for the protest Dont try to put that blame on the Government and me, he told the JO.
He went on to say that he had received information that the JO has threatened private media organisations demanding prominent coverage for the protest. Derana has been told to give full coverage to the protest without limiting its coverage to former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he quipped.
Now there is media freedom and no journalist will suffer the fate of Pradeep Ekneligoda, Lasantha Wickrematunge, Keith Noyahr or Upali Tennakoon, but despite that, I am being criticised all the time. If you have any problem you can file a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court, he responded.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena raising a question under Standing Order 27 (2), asked as to why the private bookings of CTB and private buses have been cancelled for a week from September 1.
He also expressed his doubts that the Colombo Municipal Council was preparing to cancel the JOs reservations of the public grounds violating the fundamental right to assemble peacefully.
The PM said public transport is handled by ten Authorities and out of that, nine authorities belong to the Provincial Councils. We, in the Government, only have control of one Authority. The JO has to settle their issues with the provincial authorities, the PM replied.
MP Namal Rajapaksa at this point demanded a clear answer from the Prime Minister. The PM responding to MP Rajapaksa congratulated him for trying to convince that he is the leader of the JO.

Disbelief in belief
What is always, what is everywhere  what is by all people believed
St. Vincent of Lerins
Believed where we cannot prove -Alfred, Lord Tennyson
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy William Shakespeare: Hamlet
And here comes Gharasarpa the one who enters a human body and makes all misbehaviour. I can recall a North Indian Hindi film, Sanjay Leela Bansalis Juke Gaya Asman where the good hero suddenly meets with an accident, and after his death, his soul enters into bad and mischievous villain. Suddenly he becomes a disciplined person! The character portrayal is by the same actor, Rajendra Kumar. The song Oh Priya sung by Mohamed Rafi in the background, the music is composed to suit that situation It became a popular Sinhala film love song copying the same tune!
Jayantha Chandrasiri in his film uses all these social beliefs with pop and pageantry for the foundation of a serene love affair of a Tamil girl and a Sinhala boy in their blossoming youth.
After so many years the memory of their affair seems to be the same after some racial extremist elements tore their relationship apart. The girl has disappeared to an unknown destination and the boy in another path! The portrayal of the young lovers by the filmmaker may attract the audience with believe it or not happenings! Does the ghostly power exist still Is it still happening I have a different view of the socio-cultural and religious impact of his theme. It all depends; How will the audience respond
Chandrasiri proves his ability as a filmmaker in handling the actors and actresses. Especially in the crowd scenes, the actors are simply moulded into shapes and rhythms which the director aims! The audience is kept tight with curiosity.
There are Hollywood films in the same horror genre tried in various forms. Will it appeal to all sections of the Sri Lankan film audience
With all these ingredients Jayantha Chandrasiri has woven into a heartwarming love story to all young at heart. The Tamil girl and Sinhala boy vice versa there were so many films on racial harmony. The enmity exists between two ethnic groups like Montagues and Capulets in Romeo and Juliet. In Gharasarpa the lovers are surviving, but time has passed and made changes. They are so close but they are too far in a way! Is it because of the ill omen or not
Any film producer may take a risk to produce an out of the ordinary film, but Arjuna Kamalanath being an actor of popular films mostly - has come out as the producer of Gharasarpa. We wish him good luck and hope the audience will also patronize his effort!

## Section: Features

When a gentlemen politician and a venerated doctor clashed over a bill:
Dr. P. R. Anthonis and M. D. Banda in retrospect
The writer had the privilege of having a long chat with the eminent surgeon at his residence in Turret Road (Dharmapala Mawatha) in 1997 to discuss his acceptance of an invitation to be the Chief Guest at a Star Awards ceremony of the institution that he was working at the time. The 85-year-old world renowned surgeon wanted every little detail of the ceremony meticulously explained and also some literature on the organisation.
I say, I do not know why these fellows call me Anthonis, my name is Untho..nis, said the modest surgeon Deshamanya, Dr. P. R. Anthonis, who had performed more than 60,000 operations by then including the famous five and a half-hour surgery on Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike on September 25, 1959 when an assassin fired three shots at point blank range on him. Even at 85 he continued his profession. Dr. Anthonis was born on January 21, 1911 to a family of 16, as the second child who was named Romiel Anthonis.
Prime Minister Dudley Senanayakes devout follower Mohottalage Dingiri Banda was the Minister of Agriculture and Food from 1965 to 1970. Member of Parliament from 1940s and a Cabinet Minister later, M.D. Banda stands out as an example of a politician of unquestionable honour and integrity. He was born in a small village of Panaliya situated in the Sath Korale. Dingiri Banda attended Nalanda College and later St.Anthonys, where he passed the London Matriculation before entering University College to study law.
Elderly villagers addressed him Hamuduruvo and tried to worship him as did with other DROs of the colonial Ceylon, during his first appointment as a District Revenue Officer at 24 years, a position just below the GA. He would vehemently object to them by saying I am not a Sangha, please do not address me Hamuduruwo or bowdown. The usual tradition of bag loads of vegetables and kiri-peni from poor villages he also discouraged them by paying them a reasonable amount for the gift; by doing so developed a group of enemies in the public service. Disturbed by a scathing attack by a politico in the presence of his superior, the Government Agent who failed to defend him, he handed over his letter of resignation to the GA on the following morning. During this time a commission of inquiry found the sitting member for Nuwara-Eliya in State Council guilty of bribery and corruption which led to his resignation.
Banda, former DRO in State Council
People urged him to contest the bi-election. Mr. Banda agreed and contested and won with a significant majority. However, a subsequent polls case made him unseated. He could have retained the seat only if he listened and agreed to lie in courts, as islands leading lawyer at the time R. L. Pereira who defended him wanted him to do. Dingiri Banda was asked to refuse to identify a group of his supporters as not known to him who acted against election law in obstructing voters opposed to them from casting their ballot. They are my men, how can I tell a lie. The case was proved and Mr. Banda was unseated.
D. S. Senanayake had an extraordinary talent in recognizing young honest men, he sent for M. D. Banda requesting him to join his new party UNP and contest a seat in 1947. The natural choice was the newly created Maturata seat was a newly carved out seat which Banda selected at the election held in 1947 to score a resounding victory which he retained in his entire political career winning it at 1956 as well when the party was reduced to eight in parliament. In 1960 at the next delimitation of seats two new seats came up replacing Maturata, Hanguranketa and Walapane and at the 1960 March and July elections Banda won Hanguranketa.
In 1965 Mr. Banda decided to contest his birth place Polgahawela where he had donated valuable ancestral property for the expansion of schools in the electorate and won at the General Elections. These two great sons of Sri Lanka, the famous surgeon Dr. Anthonis and M. D. Banda the politician both belonged to an era when politicians were Mr cleans and doctors were not parasitic blood-suckers. Mr. Banda, who belonged to a rural background, is best considered as one of the closest of Prime Minister DS and son Dudley Senanayake from 1947 to 1970 in their governments. He became Minster of Agriculture in Dudley Senanayakes Cabinet.
They crossed each other
Can one believe this interesting saga, which I am about to relate where both these public figures crossed each other at a private nursing home in the city over a settlement of a bill.
Banda, though an Antonian sent all three of his sons to Ananda College who attended school from the schools hostel. The eldest of the three Gamini Bandara suffered an attack of Appendicitis in the latter part of 1968 while residing in hostel and the doctor summoned by warden being told it was ministers son he directed the patient to a private nursing home for urgent attention by the islands number one, the eminent surgeon, Deshamanya Dr. P. R. Anthonis who immediately carried out an operation to remove the infected Appendix.
The minister, who was out of the island attending an important forum on Agriculture, all by himself without a coterie of aids, retuned three days later. Mr. Banda being informed of sons illness lost no time in visiting him in the nursing home. Realizing that the boy had fully recovered, he inquired his son why he chose to go to a private nursing home, (why he was not contacted that he would have got the son flown to Singapore No he continued) instead of the government hospital, and he questioned, Who has the money to pay the bill Money making was not Minister Bandas priority. The surgeon deciding it was all right for the son to go home and relax, he was discharged. The bill ready for payment was handed over to the patient to be passed on to the father who found that Dr. Anthonis operation charges had been excluded in it. M. D. Banda met the surgeon at the hospital itself and inquired him about the charges for surgery. Dr. Anthonis regarded as the oldest active medical practitioner in South Asia smiled and declared,
Sir, you are doing a great service for my motherland, how can I take money from you Minister Banda did not want to obtain free services; he insisted that the doctor charged his professional fee: the argument ended in a stalemate; they complemented each other before leaving the hospital.

As was widely expected, former ICC president Ehsan Mani has been elected unopposed as PCB chairman for a term of three years. He was the only candidate to submit his nomination papers for the vacant post, and all members of Board of Governors (BoG) unanimously voted for him to head the PCB. He replaces Najam Sethi, who resigned last month. The special meeting of the board was headed by interim chairman and election commissioner Justice (retired) Afzal Haider. Mani assumes his executive powers as PCB chairman with immediate effect, and had a brief meeting with the BoG members after the election.
His election to the post of chairman was considered a mere formality after he was nominated for the position by Pakistans new prime minister and, thereby, patron of the PCB, Imran Khan.

Emerging market woes mount  as dollar hits the boosters
A rebound in Chinese shares and a rally in Italian bonds failed to keep Europes spirits up on Tuesday, as a renewed burst of dollar strength and news South Africa had slumped into recession ramped up the pressure on emerging markets again.
The sight of European shares at a two-month low , a 2.3 percent thumping for South Africas rand and fragile Facebook shares meant Wall Street was facing a choppy restart after a long holiday weekend.
Indias rupee and Indonesias rupiah had both slumped to new lows overnight in Asia too and the Turkish lira, Mexican peso and Russian rouble were all deep in the red again to complete a turbulent EM picture.
Major FX pairs such as the euro and yen were knocked back too.
The euro fell 0.5 percent to a 10-day low at US$1.1558 while the yen dropped to 111.30 per dollar having strengthened during Asian trading.
The general sentiment is that the dollar has not done too badly out of the trade war concerns, with concerns the U.S. might signal a fresh escalation in the trade conflict, said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London.
The public comment period on a U.S. proposal for new tariffs on Chinese goods is set to end on Thursday, after which U.S. President Donald Trump can follow through on plans to impose levies on US$200 billion more of Chinese imports, though it is unclear how quickly that will happen.

Enterprise Sri Lanka-Gamperaliya  exhibition, a grand success - Mangala
The first edition of the rapid rural infrastructure investment scheme, Enterprise Sri Lanka-Gamperaliya exhibition which was held under the theme, From patriotic rebellion to development struggle from August 29 -31 in the Moneragala district was a grand success, with the participation of over 60,000 visitors from all over the country, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was speaking at a press conference at the Finance Ministry Auditorium yesterday.
Minister Samaraweera further said that the second edition of the Enterprise Sri Lanka-Gamperaliya exhibition will be held in Kurunegala in mid December 2018, while the third and the fourth editions of the exhibition will take place in Anuradhapura in February, 2019 and Jaffna in May 2019 respectively.
Furthermore, the government will introduce a free Hot Line No. (2025) exclusively for the Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative by next week.
Accordingly, the public will have the opportunity of making suggestions, making inquiries with regard to the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan facilities etc..
Commenting on the engagement of the local banking sector with the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme, Minister Samaraweera expressed his dissatisfaction noting that some of the banks are willing to issue loans for their existing customers rather than issuing loans for new customers under this scheme.
The enthusiasm of some of the banks with regard to the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme is not that great, the Minister said.
According to Minister Samaraweera, around 5,175 aspiring entrepreneurs had registered with the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme at the recently concluded Moneragala exhibition.
The Minister said however banks that have already partnered with Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme will determine the eligibility criteria of the registered persons in the coming days.
Within the first year of the Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative, the government hopes to groom 100,000 entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, he said.
According to Minister Samaraweera, the government has allocated Rs.500 million to build toilet facilities for 25,000 families in the Moneragala district.
The government will also invest around Rs. 600 million over the next four months in three selected electorates in the Moneragala District to develop rural roads, rural markets and other public works. These measures will help improve economic activity and kick start broader consumption across the country in a sustainable manner, Minister Samaraweera said.
In addition, the government hopes to rehabilitate a number of rural tanks and lakes in the Moneragala District, which will have a major impact on agricultural productivity and agricultural incomes that have suffered during the previous droughts, he added.
Furthermore, the government intends to create Haritha Udyanaya or Green Parks which will bring the ancient Athenian concept of nourishing ones body, mind and soul to the village covering every Divisional Secretariat. The government has already laid the foundation stones for Green Parks in Wellawaya and Moneragala, the Minister said .
Haritha Udyanaya which would have Wi-Fi facilities will also be provided with a library, gymnasium and a roof-garden for meditation, yoga and other religious and spiritual activities.
Minister Samaraweera further said that the government has identified 10,000 families and 333 rural schools which require basic toilet facilities in the Hambantota district.

Fairfirst introduces Pet Insurance to Sri Lanka
Fairfirst Insurance recently launched Pet insurance scheme to the market.
Further expanding their innovative shelf of products and propositions, Fairfirst is taking the lead in churning out products that are capitalizing on the evolving needs of consumers.
Pet Insurance essentially acts as a safety net to assist in protecting you against unexpected costs associated with your beloved pet. Of course these costs could range from accidents, veterinary medical bills and third party liability that you could be incurred should your pet get into trouble with others, the company said in a press release.
Pet insurance has hugely grown in popularity over the last decade across regions like the US, Canada, Europe, Middle East and parts of Asia. However its still a novel concept here in Sri Lanka. Medical costs related to pets are not getting any cheaper and Sri Lanka is no exception to this. Leveraging on the underwriting capabilities of its parent group -Fairfax Canada, Fairfirst has decided to fill this gap in the market. Commenting on the addition of Pet Insurance to Fairfirst was Head of Non-Motor Underwriting Piyantha Perera, We are very excited to be introducing this new line of insurance to the market. The team have carefully evaluated what could work in Sri Lanka and we are very happy with the initial response weve had.
Commemorating the launch of the product Fairfirst recently held a pet adoption day together with Embark at their corporate office premises  Access Towers 2. Five puppies were taken up for adoption at this event and each pup was given a free pet insurance cover from Fairfirst.
Otara Gunawardene said, I thank Fairfirst for starting this initiative as we come across so many people who cannot afford to treat their pets due to the rising costs of vet clinics. I also thank Fairfirst for joining paws with Embark to do an adoption day and to support the beautiful street dogs of Sri Lanka. It is so important to promote adoption of our own dogs who dont have an opportunity of a home and receive the love and care they deserve to have.
There are only a few companies who understand this need to support our homeless animals and I am grateful that there are more joining the movement. I must also add that the event was planned and organized very well.
The Fairfirst Pet Insurance policy is available in 3 key plans  Silver, Gold and Platinum which comes with premiums of Rs. 2,800, Rs. 4,800 and Rs. 7,200 respectively.

Gamperaliya will infuse life  into rural economy - Mangala
The governments accelerated key development programmes, Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya will have a transformational impact on both rural and urban economies.
Enterprise Sri Lanka provides a range of targeted interest subsidies to stimulate economic activity through private investment and boosting small business.
Gamperaliya will infuse life into the rural economy through a rapid public investment programme for rural infrastructure, which will help the recovery from setbacks in two successive years of drought, Minister of Finance and Media, Mangala Samaraweera said recently.
He was speaking at the CEOs Forum 2018 on Development Landscape of Sri Lanka 2025, organised by the Postgraduate Institute of Management Alumni Association (PIMAA) at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo.
Despite creating a conducive economic environment; a country will never truly develop without investing in its people; hence the government has invested on education, skills and vocational training. These reached 2% of GDP in 2017 and will be 2.1% of GDP in 2018, he said. Such expenditure on social infrastructure may not be visible like a mega project but it has a meaningful impact on the well-being of people. We have pledged to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development goals by 2030, in order to realise the full potential of our entire population, he said. Explaining further he said, every citizen in this country will become a shareholder of the knowledge based, highly competitive social market economy under the Vision 2025 policy document. It is therefore clear that this government has not taken the easy short cuts towards populist economic interventions. We also no longer have the fiscal space to invest public funds in large infrastructure projects due to high debt repayment.
In 2017, government tax revenue was Rs. 1,670 billion, whilst total debt service payment in 2017 was Rs. 1,603 billion. In the 5 years between 2010 and 2014 the average annual debt service payment was Rs. 990 billion. Compared to 2014, the annual debt service payment in 2018 has doubled. This year records the highest debt repayment since independence which is Rs. 1.9 trillion  nearly 82% from the pre-2015 era. Therefore, it is clear that the government needs to undertake more difficult and challenging reforms in order to drive future economic growth and development.

GMOA threatens strike if suspects not arrested
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will re-launch their strike if the relevant authorities fail to arrest the rest of 17 suspects in the Galaha incident and implement the law against them in the next few days, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the GMOA received reliable information that one of the key Cabinet Ministers in the government who represents Kandy is behind the delay in arresting suspects and non-implementation of the law against the culprits.
This Cabinet Minister is a very strong pro-SAITM person. The police had identified 24 suspects and arrested only seven of them so far, because of the influence of this politician. Galaha Hospital has been closed down since this incident took place and no doctor will be sent to Galaha Hospital until the Health Ministry meets the demands of the GMOA, which include ensuring the safety of the hospital and the vicinity and providing basic facilities for the hospital, he said.
The ongoing strike in Polonnaruwa will be extended to the entire Polonnaruwa district and then to the North Central Province, if the official diaries of the doctors are not returned to them by the Provincial Council officers who confiscated them without authority to do so. Clearly a well-organised plan is in action with the leadership of the Polonnaruwa Acting Provincial Director of Health Services to tarnish the image of President Maithripala Sirisena, he said.
The doctors maintain an official diary and the Health Ministry has a mechanism to inspect them. The Provincial Council has nothing to do with it, he added.

Pros and cons of Asia Cup selection
Has line of thinking on  Malinga changed
Cricket selections in this country are becoming bizarre by the day. Not so long ago the chairman of selectors Graeme Labrooy had gone on record stating that fast bowler Lasith Malinga was not in his plans for the 2019 World Cup in England.
In the IPL this year Sri Lanka Cricket even issued him a NOC (No Objection Certificate) for him to play the role of bowling mentor to the Mumbai Indians team which in other words meant that his career as an international player was as good as over.
But one year down the road we see Malinga being drafted into the Sri Lanka squad of 16 for the upcoming Asia Cup fifty-over tournament in the UAE.
The question that needs to be asked is, has the line of thinking changed due to misguided form of opinion or are the impediments to selecting him have now been removed. It is clear as day that Malinga was sidelined not due to cricketing reasons but on the instructions of the former Sports Minister and former Sri Lanka Cricket president with whom he had verbal spats.
Malingas track record in the past one or 1 years may show that he has taken only very few wickets but if you take the number of catches that has been missed off his bowling it will count to around 15 wickets. You cannot penalise the poor bowler if the fielding is not upto standard.
In the first place Malinga should never have been dropped because in international cricket he is still the best fast bowler we have. In a 50-over game the second power play depends on the result of a game. Unless you have attacking wicket-taking bowlers with the ability to contain you are going to lose the plot. A player like Malinga does not have to prove his ability in local tournaments even if he has three wickets in a T20 tournament, for it proves nothing.
Then there is the question of why four off-spinners have been picked including two specialist off-spinners in the form of Akila Dananjaya and Dilruwan Perera when we also have Dhananjaya de Silva and Danushka Gunathilaka who also bowl off-spin. What is the compulsion to take four off spinners when we are playing possibly against teams that are best at playing spin  India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on very good batting tracks in Dubai and Abu Dhabi where they are not going to get any turn on the surface.
From nowhere Amila Aponso is brought back into the team two years after he had been identified as the potential replacement for Rangana Herath. The lack of a right-arm leg-spinner is really going to expose the bowling unit against right-handers. Unless you back youth in a one-day 50-over and shorter format T20 our fielding standards are going to drop and we are going to be giving at least 50 runs on the field which will affect our performances. The dropping of Niroshan Dickwella is a case in point. Angelo Mathews, Suranga Lakmal, Upul Tharanga and Malinga are all in their mid thirties. Are we going to be sharp on the field as the modern game expects you to be
Sri Lanka should take a clear example the approach South Africa took on their tour here recently narrowing down their side for the World Cup. They left their main strike bowlers Imran Thahir and Chris Morris  both IPL standard players at home and came to Sri Lanka. It was quite obvious that they were trying to see how capable their younger bowlers were. That is the way to develop the team. It is not going for short term and ad hoc shortsighted wins.
What is happening now is that the selectors are taking a piecemeal approach just to keep the public happy. There is a lot of resentment from the public and the cricket fans at large today where it has come to a level that people are not even watching cricket.
Without having a clear plan to identify our best 15 for the World Cup, we are gambling with decisions hoping that it will work out. You cant do that. You cant fiddle with the interest of a nation.

Irresistible Jean Arasanayagam
Jean Arasanayagam is irresistible. She continues to publish many volumes of her longish poems which carry her persona and literary embellishments. Right now, she dominates the Lankan poetic scene in English winning prizes one after the other, which is a positive thing indeed.
One of her books is- Introspection Poems published by Sarasavi Publishers in 2016 and is priced Rs 350/-It has 43 poems within its 138 pages. From some of her titles you would know what her fanciful themes are.
A few titles: Mindscapes, Dreams and Poetry, Metaphysical, The Voice Within, Embryonic thoughts, Invisible Mirrors, Introspection.
Lets take Introspection. What does it say A wanderer through the wilderness continues her journey and reach a mirage-filled horizon searching for through her harsh passage. Right. But what is the outcome
Look, how she concludes the journey in her last stanza:
 I am not blameless, I walked blindly into danger-zones, I did not baulk at trepidatious confrontation nor dodge my assailants but willingly allowed myself to be captive to forces that curbed my resistless powerless being until I found those secret bypaths that led me out of that crushing wilderness inhabited by the assassin and torturers, untangling those snarled- up routes, separating their diverse strands like wayward thoughts that wait to be unknotted, straightened out
So, it is fantasy experienced through travelling though tortuous routes.
What is significant in most of her poetry is her mastery of the vocabulary. Her unusual coinages are fascinating. Long winded lines may tire the reader, but read aloud, the lines are rhythmic and poetic.
To enjoy her poetry, one must read her poems in full.
Some lines I enjoyed reading aloud:
On Admired, Jeans opening line is as follows---Great Chasms divide us fissured by time and age.
I wish to give in full her poem titled Mindscapes for you to enjoy it yourself, even though the first stanza is only one amalgamated sentence.
My mind unwinds reel after reel of images, landscapes that are now embedded in each vast unending scape with its recurrent visions, unwind those reels in my dreams and waking hours, reflecting my passage through the convoluted passages of history, merging into the uptodate routs of the contemporary times I take, thronged with repetitiousness of everyday life, of birth, of death with familiar landmarks and signposts, the totems of ravaged civilizations, bombed churches, roofless abodes, mined wastelands, jagged crests of withering palm friends.
Villas, deserted, abandoned, inhabited by spectres that roam lost and desolate from room to room, tree roots growing into cracked walls fissured with windows gaping wide, gardens with empty bunkers into which reptiles coil and nestle in darkness, everything gone to seed, except for rampant weeds clinging to the parched earth, door less apertures, empty spaces, in uninhibited rooms, ruined homes to which there will never be a return.
My mind unwinds reel after reel
One more poem in full  Dreams and Poetry
A flash of insight, a piercing light illuminates the inner darkness that oppresses the sleeping spirit, rouses it to awakening creates transient images that ripple and quiver in the mind, summoning the hidden visions all expectant from their dormant slumber, to emerge,
Tantalize the imagination with unfolding panorama of representative lives, multiplying in gestation after gestation of phenomenal beings appearing from the closed in inner chambers with whom I engage in fleeting dialogues,
Beings, real or phantasy embodiments, encountered on my reincarnatory passages through aeons of rebirth, some of them still alive in memory but who no longer tread this earth,
We meet at crossroads or veer off, take different routes, I return alone, take a few, tentative steps in my halting gait wearied after so many ruminative journeys, often directionless, step back into a precarious reality, my visions growing diffuse, a fast vanishing world of dreams with their intimations of another lie, another hidden existence in those timeless spaces wit their glimpses of eternity.
Personally, I like to write simple sentences that are short but with appropriate right words, but the poets and writers in English are used to write long sentences maybe because they want all what they want to express in one breath.
However, I tried to understand what our poet wants to say in her poems, even when I did not readily understand some of the unfamiliar words.
Students of higher forms can learn a lot by reading such poets and writers in Lanka.

Jaffna to be a strategic city
Jaffna has been selected for development as a strategic city, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The government has made a large investment of funds to solve the water and other problems confronting its citizens, the Minister also said.
He was speaking at a meeting after laying the foundation stone for the proposed new public bus stand at Ginigathena recently.
Minister Ranawaka said once the proposed development projects were completed, they would stand as historic edifices of development in Jaffna for its people. However, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran could not show a single edifice of construction or development projects he had undertaken during his term of office. To overcome this shortcoming, Vigneswaran was trying to rouse and instigate the Tamil people to take them back to the pre-war mentality to garner their votes.
However, the government was not upset by Vigneswarans theatrics because the majority of intelligent Tamil people in the North supported the governments development programmes launched for their benefit, the Minister said.

JO accuses Govt.  over protest venue
The Joint Opposition(JO) yesterday pointed the finger at the Government over cancelling reservations for four grounds that the JO had booked for their protest rally Janabalaya Kolambata slated to be held in Colombo today.
Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena addressing the media at the N.M.Perera Memorial Center at Borella, alleged that the government through various parties have taken steps to cancel the JO reservations for four grounds in Colombo.
He said the JO expected such obstacles when planning the event and had a contingency plan and added that the government will be able to witness this today.
Gunewardene identified the Campbell Park,Borella grounds, Viharamahadevi Park Open Air Theatre,Lalith Athulathmudali grounds,Kirulapone and A.E.Gunasinghe grounds in Pettah as the places which the JO had reserved for the meeting.
Gunewardene charged that the Colombo Municipal Council authorities were behind the cancellation of reservations for the grounds.
The Parliamentarian said that whatever obstacles the government places, it cannot stop people in their thousands marching into Colombo today.
When questioned about the details about the protest, Dullas Alahapperuma, MP declined to name any location and said these will be revealed today.
Alahapperuma however said the protest march will begin around 3.00 pm and hinted this might start from several locations within Colombo.
JO members Udaya Gammanpila, Tissa Vitarana, Raja Kollure and Prasanna Ranatunge too were present.

It has been disclosed that the Joint Opposition (JO) is allegedly spending millions for their protest march which is scheduled to take place in Colombo today.
It is learnt that the Joint Opposition is spending a colossal amount of money for the provision of transport,liquor,foods, T-Shirts, water bottles and caps for the JO supporters who are expected to be brought from different parts of the country to Colombo today.
The main objective of this protest is to promote Hambantota District Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa above his uncles Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa at the whims and fancies of a handful of JO supporters, it is learnt
A group of JO supporters who are socially conscious have opined that this protest march has been organised to promote an individual without an iota of thought over the safety and security of the innocent people.

JO bent on creating chaos - Bandara
Law and Order and Public Administration and Management Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said the JO is planning to cause maximum inconvenience to the public today by not announcing the venue for its protest rally.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, the Deputy Minister said there is democratic space and freedom to protest, but if the JO is planning to inconvenience the public by creating chaos in Colombo, action will be taken against them.
They want to create violence and see bloodshed. No one died during protests held under our regime. That is why the JO is desperate to see such things happen in our tenure.We also urge them to remember Roshen Chanaka who was killed when the JO rally was marching to Colombo from Negombo. Protesters can offer flowers at the place where fisherman Anthony was murdered. Protesters can also offer a flower at the place where ruggerite Thajudeen was murdered in Narahenpita, he said.
How can they shout against the government during the rally in Colombo as they can see Shangri-La hotel which was built on land given outright to China by them, Bandara queried.
Former President Rajapaksa wants his son Namal to become the countrys leader some day and that is why he is leading the protest. They have misled the people that they would topple the government today. Most JO members have a fear that they will go to jail in the coming months and they are now engaging in attempts of covering up. The innocent public do not know their ulterior motives and are just coming for monetary and other gains.

## Title: Johann Pachelbel, the Nuremberg Vision

Johann Pachelbel, the Nuremberg Vision
He was inspired by liturgy and his passion lay between the portals of the church. He discovered the spirit of liturgical music in the silence and spirituality that mingled in the sacred aura of the church.
That was Johann Pachelbel, Germanys future vision.
Born in Nuremberg into a middle-class family, was baptized on September 1. And in 1678 rose to be the organist of Predigerkircho in Erfurt. There was no stopping him of his illustrious composing career from then.
Church music
Pachelbel was one of the late Baroque composers and had no considerable influence on these famous Baroque composers. However, he did influence the young Johann Sebastian Bach in the style of the northern German composers and played an important role in the development of Bachs talent. Pachelbel was also to a certain degree influenced the American church music of that era. Though he was the last iconic composer of the Nuremberg tradition, his influence was mostly limited to his pupils such as the young Bach. Musicologists and composers were struck by the quality of his composition apart from critics and iconic writer of his time, Johan Gottfried Walther declared he was simply beyond words to describe his compositions.
During the 18th century when Baroque style faded and the majority of pre-Baroque composers were virtually forgotten, the path was open to Pachelbel who was known as an outstanding organist to perform though occasionally. At the beginning of the 19th century, some of his organ works were published that made several musicologists consider him as an important composer. Researchers traced back his scores that had helped develop Baroque keyboard music. His works began to be studied extensively and Pachelbel was in great demand.
Only two volumes of his organ music were published and distributed during his lifetime manly Musikalische Steren-Gednacken (music thoughts on death 1683) which was is a set of chorale variations in memory of his wife and child.
Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer during his lifetime when he scored more than two hundred pieces for the instrument, both liturgical and secular while exploring most of the genres that existed at the time. He was also a prolific vocal music composer. While at Stuttgart, he composed over 40 large-scale works.
CANON IN D MAJOR
The composition that fired the imagination of all music lovers at his time was a piece of chamber music scored for three violins and basso continuo and originally paired in the same key surged the tremendous popularity into the 1790s. Canons chord progression became an overnight choice for all musical events. The score remains ahead of extraordinary works from Europe and Russia. Gets annual rating from among the greats and remain so. The Annual selection of the 100 top most favourite composers for their works conducted by the Classic FM listeners HALL OF FAME has CANON IN D MAJOR in 13th or 14th spot most of the years because of its spectacular score ahead of The Messiah, Requiem, The Four Seasons, St. Mathews Passion, Ave Verum Corpus, The Blue Danube etc., few that crossed my mind. He has even pushed Mozart to the 100th spot. Developed from sonata almost equal to cantatas that began in Italy around the 17th century, he fell in line with this heavenly score that lacked the technical brilliance of Bachs music. The extraordinary fact is that Pachelbel never left Germany to study or perform.
More importantly, he pioneered his musical symbolism by using such ways in his sacred music as repeated notes to denote:-
a) Steadfastness in minor keys for sorrow and moods.
b) Joy in major keys
c) Evil in a broken diminished seventh chord.
Keyboard Music
Apart from his harpsichord suites, Pachelbel was focused on liturgical organ music; especially the chorale preludes and he wrote them relatively simple for manual only with no pedal required at a time when the congregants sang the chorales was due to Lutheran practice. The quality of the organs as Germans used had only 15 to 25 stops on two manuals. Neither the Nuremberg nor the southern German organ tradition endorsed the extensive use of pedals seen in the works by composers of the Northern German School. Pachelbel rigorously followed this trend. Pachelbel used white notation when writing numerous compositions which were a notation system that uses hollow note heads and omits bar lines. This system was widely used since the 15th century but was gradually replaced in this period of modern notation to provide artistic integrity.
Chorale Preludes
These constitute half of Pachelbels surviving works in part because of his Erfurt job duties that required him to compose chorale preludes on a regular basis. The models he used most frequently were the three-part setting, the chorale fugue and most importantly a model he invented which combined the two types, to latter begins with a brief corale followed by a three-or-four part cantus setting.
He wrote more than a hundred fuges on the free theme in his final years at Nuremberg. Usually accompanied by the organist at Vospers the singing of the Magnificent provided examples of magnificent setting for organ based on themes from chant.
Pachelbels toccatas consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes and although the similar technique is employed in several brief pieces they all are characteristic by consistent use of pedal point.
Many of them explore a single melodic motif as compared to D major toccata in the typical Baroque style along with one late C major toccatas as found in Canon in D major.
Of the six fantasias composed, three of them are sectional compositions in 3/2 time and never connected thematically and the third is D Dorian pieces structure that reminiscent of Pacelebels magnificent fugues.
Less virtuosic than many of his contemporaries but all of them were overshadowed by the famous Canon in D major which belonged to the genre of chamber music which was originally scored for three violins and a basso continuo.

Joke is on Gotabhaya - Rajitha
It is a joke that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has invited people to take part in todays protest because he replied protestors with bullets during the previous regime, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said incidents such as the shooting at Rathupaswala protesters who agitated for drinking water, shooting at fishermen, and shooting at Free Trade Zone workers during the previous regime took place with the knowledge of the former Defence Secretary.
The Minister was speaking after an inspection tour of Kegalle General Hospital.
Minister Senaratne said the former Defence Secretary is shameless to invite people for the SLPP protest. Now murders and large-scale financial fraud that occurred during the previous regime are gradually being revealed and the law is being implemented perfectly. The persons who committed crimes are scared now. But the people have not forgotten the crimes committed by the previous regime.
The people are with this government which gave them freedom. The entire country is watching what will happen to the criminals next year, the Minister said.

Lambscapers
Manhattans Basilica of Old St. Patricks Cathedral has welcomed three new lambscapers that will spend the next six weeks tending to the churchyards grounds and bringing a rustic scene to the hustle and bustle of city living.
The newest members of the flock - named Houston, Prince and Spring, - according to the New York Post  are the fifth group of sheep to be brought to the church and will spend their visit grazing on the historic grounds.
Its a tradition at the church since 2014. Monsignor Donald Sakano has said previously that the idea started with a conversation he had with a groundskeeper who was planning to retire.
I joked, What do you expect me to do now, get sheep he said.
The second I said it I thought, That might be a good idea, even though I knew nothing about sheep-keeping here in New York City.
The church raised $5,561 to host the sheep this year, describing the initiative on a spotfund page as a way of providing a sustainable method of mowing the grass ... eliminating the need for loud, gasoline-powered mowers.
The Cormo sheep, an Australian breed, ordinarily take up residence at Buckwheat Bridge Farm in Elizaville, New York, but will be made to feel right at home while staying at the church, with a staff of five or six ensuring theyre always feeling lambtastic. Theyre the stars, parishioner Andrew Shermin told the New York Post. Its a really fun thing for the neighborhood. Theres nothing else like it in the city.

Lankan thrives in ham and  cheese business in Italy
A Sri Lankan entrepreneur in Italy, Sunil Shantha Chandrasiri who started a home grown business to make cheese and ham has now become one of the largest manufactures of cheese and ham in Italy.
Hailing from Piliyandala he had his education at St. Thomas Bandarawela and later at the Sri Jayewardenepura College in Kotte. Being a true patriot he joined the Sri Lanka Army as cadet officer in 1992 and also played rugger for the National Youth Service council. Taking an honorary discharge from Army after serving nearly four years he first stepped foot to Italy in 1995 through legal channels.
Having worked in several companies he gained knowledge of business and the languages and saw the areas of opportunities. I always knew that there was demand for quality food and decided to start up a cheese manufacturing business, he said connecting to Daily News Business via email.
I started with two employees and came out with the brand name, Ferrarni Cheese and started offering the produce to nearby shops.
The product was well received by the people in my home town Parma and then I extended my product range to super markets.
The acceptance of Ferrarni Cheese by Super markets was a great achievement for me as it was an endorsement of quality. This gave me confidence to expand and introduce new products as I knew that the market was there.
I must recall that I was egged on by my mother, M. Jayawardane who even provided financial assistance for me to expand. During this time I also obtained the ISO 9002 certification from the Italian government for Ferrarni Cheese and armed with this I started exports to the region.
I was looking for a product to go with cheese and then started to make ham under the same brand name and this too was well accepted and was also exported.
Due to growing demand I invested in two factories and today I have 250 multi ethnic staff. He said as a Sri Lankan he is patriot and is giving preference to Sri Lankans when it comes to providing employment and 180 are Sri Lankans.
I also pay them EPF and ETF and today my turnover is in excess of Euro 500 million and my exports have extended beyond Europe to USA, UK and also Asia.
I have also done a study on starting an operations in Sri Lanka and export to other countries. With the Singapore FTA in place I will re explore this proposal next year.
Together with his wife, Chamila Ruwani De Silva and three children he is also engaged in a series of CSR activities in Sri Lanka by providing assistance for families and children of differently abled Servicemen. These CSR includes even building houses and assisting their childrens education by way of providing regular financial grants.

September 5 - 89th Birth Anniversary:
MERVYN DE SILVA, JOURNALISM AND MOSCOW
Mervyn de Silva wrote a brief bio-data on the smaller-sized of the Lanka Guardian notepaper/ letterheads in the last years of his life. It was rearranged into a narrative and appeared on the back cover of Crisis Commentaries: Selected Political Writings of Mervyn de Silva published by the International Center for Ethnic studies, Colombo, 1999. It was Mervyns laconic look back at his life as he saw it in his late 60s. He never made it to 70. Here is his last CV just as he had typed it:
1949-53: Edited University Magazine. Founded newssheet.
1954: Joined Associated Newspapers, largest publishing company as part-time Parliament reporter while studying Law.
1960: Joined Associated Newspapers permanently.
1965: Appointed Deputy Editor, Evening Observer.
1970: Editor, Daily News, premier English daily.
1972: Editor-in-Chief of Associated Newspapers.
1973: Newspapers nationalized by leftwing Bandaranaike regime.
1976: Dismissed.
1976: Joined privately owned TIMES as editor-in-Chief.
1977: Times nationalized by rightwing UNP Jayewardene government.
1978: Dismissed. Founded Lanka Guardian.
Currently Colombo correspondent Financial Times, London, NEWSWEEK, and Times of India. Has worked for The Economist, London. Published in New York Times, Washington Post, Le Monde Diplomatique, International Herald Tribune, Christian Science Monitor and Far Eastern Economic Review.
Mervyn had so many dimensions and achievements he could have written a fuller CV. And yet his brief bio focused on his career as a print journalist. That was the axis and trajectory of his being. He wrote for publication in the print media, both mainstream newspapers and periodicals. He was a maestro of the printed word written for a general and regular reader.
He was more. He was a literary critic, a film reviewer, a commentator on international affairs, a radio broadcaster on subjects ranging from poetry to world affairs, and for a while a regular commentator on international affairs (interviewed by Eric Fernando) on TV.
What strikes one in his abbreviated CV is the strange symmetry of his dismissal by two (otherwise) contrasting Sri Lankan governments i.e. political Establishments.
Izeth Hussain, literary critic, intellectual and diplomat, pointed to this phenomenon:
perhaps it is not really surprising that he [Mervyn] was twice booted out of editorial positions. It is not surprising from a Sri Lankan perspective. It is more than surprising, stunning in fact, from an international perspective. For here was a journalist widely recognized as exceptionally brilliant, a world-class journalist as we say, arguably even Sri Lankas greatest journalist, and he of all people gets sacked not once but twice, on both occasions from state-owned newspapers.
Hussain, who was senior to Mervyn by two years at the university, understood the mans trajectory and existential choices:
He [Mervyn] would have rebelled against the constricted life-style expected in careers leading to one becoming a pillar of society. His brilliant performance at Law College showed that he could have become an outstanding lawyer, and minted money. Instead he chose journalism and, as his widow Lakshmi used to bemoan, he never made enough to buy his own house. It was his vocation. He was born for journalism.
By the time of his death he [Mervyn] had come to be recognized for several years as the doyen of Sri Lankan journalists.
A non-conformist, someone always on the side of the underdog, without illusions about men of power and their world, and incapable of identifying himself with any political party, perhaps it is not really surprising that he was twice booted out of editorial positions. It is not surprising from a Sri Lankan perspective. It is more than surprising, stunning in fact, from an international perspective.
For here was a journalist widely recognized as exceptionally brilliant, a world-class journalist as we say, arguably even Sri Lankas greatest journalist, and he of all people gets sacked not once but twice, on both occasions from state-owned newspapers. That says a great deal about the vicissitudes of Sri Lankan journalism in our time. Mervyn experienced those vicissitudes at first hand and for a longer period than perhaps any other prominent journalist...
The point is that Mervyn experienced it all at first hand and that is why he was the quintessential Sri Lankan journalist of our time...
(First published under the title The Two Mervyns in The Weekend Express, Colombo, July 10-11, 1999)
I started writing this as I am about to emplane for Moscow and am now reviewing it from my desk at the ambassadorial residence above the Embassy. I visited Moscow many times as a boy, starting in the mid-1960s, running through the 1970s, in the company of my parents. On those occasions my father Mervyn was either a guest of the Russian Foreign Ministry or of the APN (Novosti) news agency headed in the 1970s by the formidable Latin Americanist, Kachaturov (whom I was privileged to meet).
In the early 1970s my father was the first foreign journalist to meet the iconic foreign affairs expert and leading Russian Americanist, the head of Moscows USA and Canada Institute, Georgi Arbatov, when he returned from the last round of talks in Helsinki before the signing of the SALT 1 agreement. I was with him and my mother in Moscow at the time.
As a young undergraduate I was fortunate to meet the finest Russian foreign policy thinker, Evgeny Primakov, who went on to be Russias Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, when he was still Academician Primakov, head of IMEMO, in 1976 in Colombo, when my father hosted him to dinner at the Capri Club. Academician Primakov invited me to study under him at IMEMO after I graduated from Peradeniya, but another destiny intervened.
The diplomat-intellectual Izeth Hussains greatest encomium to Mervyn de Silva made explicit reference to a Russian intellectual, critical and journalistic phenomenon as point of comparison and affinity:
But his greatest achievement, more than his writings, was surely the Lanka Guardian (LG). Through that small magazine, and against all the odds, he created democratic space in Sri Lanka. For some years I was perhaps the most frequent of all the contributors to the LG and some weeks before his death he reminded me that he had never hesitated to publish anything I wrote. After his death I recalled an LG article I wrote on the potential power of the mini-press. Alexander Herzens magazine, The Bell, I wrote, was the most potent instrument for forming Russian public opinion in the five or six years before the Russian Revolution. It has been written up as the most astonishing phenomenon in the history of Russian, and perhaps of world, journalism. At its height its circulation was 2,500. The LG's circulation was not much more, I believe. The LG is Mervyns claim to be regarded as Sri Lankas greatest journalist.

In an important sense therefore, my road to Moscow has been in the footsteps of my father. In a three quarter page polemic against my appointment to Moscow, Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya termed me a political gunfighter whose hunting ground is politics. This made me recall The Gunslingers Prayer in Stephen Kings The Dark Tower, in which the abiding sin which is warned against and has to be avoided, is having forgotten the face of my father. As I attend the International military tattoo at the Spasskaya Tower, hear the rousing cheer reverberating through the Red Square at night for the Sri Lankan Armed Forces band and especially the young Lankan army man bearing the Lion flag and singing Katyusha (the Soviet era tribute to the legendary rocket); shake hands with the guest of honour, much-decorated WW II veteran General Gennady Zaitsev of the legendary Spetsnatz Alpha Group (one of the worlds topmost counter-terrorist special forces); receive an exact replica of the key to the Spasskaya tower of the Kremlin; sit as a member of the Sri Lanka delegation across the table from Deputy Defence Minister Colonel General Alexander Fomin at the Russian Ministry of Defence; and look across the Moscow river at night at the massive Stalin-era Hotel Ukraine (now the Radisson) where I stayed with my parents on our first visit in 1964, I have not forgotten the face of my father.

Necessary arrangements  for JO Janabalaya rally
With the Joint Opposition (JO) yet remaining secretive about the venue and the path for todays Janabalaya rally, the Police will focus on three main areas in Colombo city, Police sources said.
Holding a meeting at the Police Field Force Headquarters last evening, a decision was made by Police top brass to take necessary security precautions and implement a traffic management plan surrounding the Galle Face, Town Hall and Colombo Fort areas.
We speculate that protest may spread to these areas and therefore will take the necessary precautions to lessen its impact on the public, a top Police source said.
According to him, the Police will also focus on the Campbell Park and the Lalith Athulathmudali ground in Kirulapone.
We believe they may be used as meeting places prior to commence their protest march and rally, Police sources said.
He also confirmed that no official information has been provided to the Police regarding todays Joint Opposition rally.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara on Monday claimed that necessary precautions are being taken to maintain law and order within the city during the Janabalaya rally.
Special arrangements have been made to provide additional security to Parliament and other places of importance in Colombo and the surrounding areas, he said, adding that additional intelligence officers and riot squads will be on standby as well. Meanwhile, the Police made three attempts yesterday to obtain injunctions against todays rally, but, were however turned down by the respective courts. Accordingly, the Cinnamon Gardens Police attempted to obtain an injunction order against the rally claiming that the JO were planning to surround the Official residence of the President located on Malalasekara Mawatha and they had obtained intelligence reports to that effect.
The Welikada and Kollupitiya Police stations also made similar requests from the Colombo Additional Magistrate which were denied while the Colombo Chief Magistrate also denied the request made by the Cinnamon Gardens Police.

Remember Me Sri Lanka exhibition
No longer stigma
The Lanka Alzheimers Foundation will celebrate World Alzheimers Month September 2018 with a unique exhibition appropriately titled Remember Me Sri Lanka from September 22 to 30 at the Barefoot Gallery. The objective of this exhibition is to raise awareness of Alzheimers disease and related dementias andcombat the stigma that surrounds the disease.
In March 2017, Sabine Ferber, a volunteer at the Lanka Alzheimers Foundation (LAF) gifted a beautiful piece of art that she had created from cutting and pasting bits and pieces of paintings done by LAFs clients at the Activity Centre. The Mandala was the inspiration for the exhibition of collages. The colourful and vibrant collection of 26 collages skillfully and painstakingly created by Sabine, are based on Sri Lankan themes and will be on sale. This art project has provided LAFs clients many enjoyable hours of self-worth, which has helped to enhance their communication skills, brain function and social interaction. Art serves as a valuable outlet and is known to trigger dormant memories and emotions and inspire conversations among people with dementia who may experience difficulty in expressing themselves. Working on the project has allowed our clients, all of whom are diagnosed with dementia, to express the thoughts and emotions trapped inside them.LAF is very grateful to Sabine for agreeing to take on this enormous challenge with so much passion and commitment  she has worked tirelessly over the past 18 months. As one of many holistic therapies used to help those living with Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia, experts agree that art therapy has life enriching effects for people who suffer from memory loss. Either by viewing or creating art, people with Alzheimers can experience self-expression and social engagement in a way that benefits their overall health. Sabine Ferber believes that art has the ability to alter the mind, affect behavior, emotions and relationship with others. For people living with Alzheimers disease, this truly is important, she says. Art therapy helps to reduce stress, fear, anxiety, agitation and isolation.
So head out to the Barefoot Gallery any day during the period (10 am to 7 pm) to view these unusual creations of art  uniquely different and a first for Sri Lanka.

Over 20 million items lost in Brazil museum fire
BRAZIL: Brazils oldest and most important historical and scientific museum has been consumed by fire, and much of its archive of 20 million items is believed to have been destroyed.
The fire at Rio de Janeiros 200-year-old National Museum began after it closed to the public on Sunday and raged into the night. There were no reports of injuries, but the loss to Brazilian science, history and culture was incalculable, two of its vice-directors said.
It was the biggest natural history museum in Latin America. We have invaluable collections. Collections that are over 100 years old, Cristiana Serejo, one of the museums vice-directors, told the G1 news site.
Marina Silva, a former environment minister and candidate in Octobers presidential elections said the fire was like a lobotomy of the Brazilian memory.
Luiz Duarte, another vice-director, told TV Globo: It is an unbearable catastrophe. It is 200 years of this countrys heritage. It is 200 years of memory. It is 200 years of science. It is 200 years of culture, of education. TV Globo also reported that some firefighters did not have enough water to battle the blaze.
It wasnt immediately clear how the fire began. The museum was part of Rios Federal University but had fallen into disrepair in recent years. Its impressive collections included items brought to Brazil by Dom Pedro I  the Portuguese prince regent who declared the then-colonys independence from Portugal  Egyptian and Greco-Roman artefacts, Luzia, a 12,000 year-old skeleton and the oldest in the Americas, fossils, dinosaurs, and a meteorite found in 1784. Some of the archive was stored in another building but much of the collection is believed to have been destroyed.
Brazils president, Michel Temer, who has presided over cuts to science and education as part of a wider austerity drive, called the losses incalculable. Today is a tragic day for the museology of our country, he tweeted. Two hundred years of work research and knowledge were lost.
Mrcio Gomes, an anthropologist and former president of Brazils indigenous agency, Fundao Nacional do ndio (FUNAI), compared the loss to the burning of the library of Alexandria in 48BC. We Brazilians only have 500 years of history. Our National Museum was 200 years old, but thats what we had, and what is lost forever, he wrote on Facebook. We have to reconstruct our National Museum.
Rios fire chief Colonel Roberto Robaday said the firefighters did not have enough water at first because two hydrants were dry. The two nearest hydrants had no supplies, he said. Water trucks were brought in and water used from a nearby lake. This is an old building, he said, with a lot of flammable material, lots of wood and the documents and the archive itself.
Some Brazilians saw the fire as a metaphor for their countrys traumas as it battles terrifying levels of violent crime and the effects of a recession that has left more than 12 million people unemployed.

Pakistan leaves Hafeez out of Asia Cup cricket squad
LAHORE Tuesday: Pakistan left all-rounders Mohammad Hafeez and Imad Wasim out of a 16-man squad for the six-nation Asia Cup, to be played in Dubai and Abu Dhabi from next week, selectors announced Tuesday.
But left-handed opener Shan Masood gets his first chance in Pakistan's one-day squad after scoring 1,200-plus runs in the two domestic one-day tournaments, chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq said.
The 28-year-old has so far played 12 Tests for Pakistan.
Sarfraz Ahmed will lead the side, which opens their Cup campaign against the wildcard entrant on September 16 before taking on arch-rivals India in a highly-anticipated match three days later. Both rounds are in Dubai.
Hafeez, 37 was part of Pakistan's 5-0 one-day series win in Zimbabwe in July, but was not played in any of the matches.
We conducted fitness tests and since there is no compromise on fitness we have not included Hafeez and Imad Wasim, Inzamam told media while announcing the squad in Lahore.
The Asia Cup begins September 15 and features India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and a qualifier team.
Six teams -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Nepal, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Malaysia -- are currently facing off in Kuala Lumpur to secure the final berth.
Cup teams are divided in two groups. Two sides are culled for the Super Four rounds, after which the top two finishers go to the September 28 final in Dubai.

Conduct your protest in a civilized manner: Law and Order Minister
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, called on the Joint Opposition (JO) to conduct its protest in a civilized manner, while assuring that the Police have not sought any interim order from Courts to stop the protest.
Responding to the queries by the Joint Opposition members, he said the Police would not obstruct the JOs protest, also adding, You come to Colombo, we will provide security to you all.
You want the Police to attack your protest and you will do things to provoke Police personnel. We will not fall into that trap, he noted.
He told Parliament yesterday, that the Police had only requested a Court order to ensure that business of the Parliament be carried out without any obstruction. The MPs must be able to attend Parliament and to do so, roads leading to Parliament must not be obstructed, he said.
We have been made to understand that the protests real intention is to make MP Namal Rajapaksa the future leader of the group over former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he commented.
UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri said there was information that there could be an internal clash of the JO during the protest and that this could lead to the loss of lives.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the JO is trying to take the peoples lives for granted. Minister Harin Fernando said that he would supply 1,000 rice packets free to the protesters if the JO conducted themselves peacefully during the protest.
UNP MP Asoka Priyantha pointed out that the CTB was hesitating to release its buses to the JO, as it had not settled its previous dues.
JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena accused the Government of trying to obstruct the JO protest by obtaining interim court orders. He went on to charge that the Police went to Court following a complaint by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. The Speaker plainly rejected MP Gunawardenas claim and asked the MP not to level baseless accusations against him.
Due to Janabalaya Kolambata protest
Parliament sittings limited to two and half hours
Parliament sittings were limited to two and half hours yesterday, as Joint Opposition members got on to the middle of the House accusing the Government of trying to obstruct their Janabalaya Kolambata protest scheduled for today.
However, the Government passed the three items listed on the Order Paper for yesterday, without a debate. The JO MPs stormed the Well of the House disrupting sittings. While the JO MPs were shouting slogans in the middle of the Well, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe moved a determination to pay a monthly allowance of Rs 100,000 to the Chairman of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) and a monthly allowance of Rs 75,000 to each of its members and it was adopted without a division.
The Leader of the House and Minister also moved a resolution to appoint a Parliament Select Committee to recommend measures to improve communal and religious harmony in Sri Lanka. He also moved the Pharmaceutical Society of Sri Lanka (Incorporation) Bill for Second Reading. Both the resolution and the Bill were passed without debate or division.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya then adjourned the sittings till today and asked that the Adjournment Motion be moved. However, UPFA MP Dullas Allahapperuma was not present to move the Motion which was related to the Janabalaya Kolambata protest. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe observed that the JO MPs could have expressed their concerns during the adjournment debate without resorting to obstruct Parliament sittings.
When Serjeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando was taking the Mace away, the protesting MPs tried to block his way. However, he managed to proceed while the protesters were shouting against the Government.

He said M G Sugars Lanka has now gone before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to settle the matter. They claim the ownership as they have the agreement as proof. There had been a mistake. Now we have the Attorney General to settle this matter, he said.
He further said that the Government had re-awarded the tender to another company after calling fresh bids and that company too is claiming ownership for the project now.
The Minister was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa. Following the reply, JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake demanded that persons responsible for the blunder be revealed.

A Carbon tax, as proposed in Budget 2018, would be levied for every year commencing from the date of commencement of this Act on motor vehicles based on the age and fuel type of vehicle. Electric vehicles are exempted from the tax.
The Bill also provides for one-time payment of Luxury Tax on motor vehicles based on band of engine capacity or motor power of the vehicle. The tax will apply on every specified motor vehicle of which, the first year of registration falls on or after the date of commencement of this legislation. Specified motor vehicle, means any assembled or unassembled diesel motor vehicle of which the cylinder capacity exceeds 2,300 CC or a petrol motor vehicle of which the cylinder capacity exceeds 1,800 CC or an electric vehicle of which motor power of the engine exceeds 200 Kw.
Dual purpose petrol motor vehicles with a cylinder capacity of not exceeding 2,200 CC, dual purpose electric motor vehicles, vans, single cabs and wagons are exempted from this tax.
The SMS Advertising Levy (for bulk SMS advertisements) of Rs 0.25 per SMS (payable by the advertiser), will also come into effect once the Bill is approved in Parliament.
A 7 percent Debt Repayment Levy will be charged for every month, commencing from the date of commencement of this Act, from every financial institution on the value addition attributable to the supply of financial services by each such institution.
JO protest, a civil disobedience:Minister Ajith P. Perera
State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P Perera said that the JO protest which had been scheduled to be held today in Colombo, was a civil disobedience which involves illegal conduct.
He said that the JO had failed to fulfill the basic factors that had to be followed before launching a protest.
They should inform the relevant authorities about the venue and route of the protest and a permit to use a loud speaker should have been obtained. They have not done any of it so far, he said.
He said that democratic protests were not new to the country, the Constitution itself, has assured freedom of speech. Anyone can launch a protest without disrupting the ordinary life of the public.
Minister Perera alleged that the organizers had not informed the Police in order to take necessary precautions and to reduce the disruption caused to the public.
JO organizers have been clamouring that they are ready to stay in Colombo and continue with the protest until the the government is toppled, he said.
The Minister wished them the best of luck and added that they are willing to see how many people would join the protest. He further challenged the protesters to capture Colombo, the Police, Army and the Parliament and carry out their protest as they have been crying out for attention.
Black Maria gives Johnston a liftto Parliament
Former Minister and Kurunegala District MP Johnston Fernando, who was remanded by the Kurunegala High Court on Monday, came to Parliament in a Black Maria yesterday.
The MP who was remanded over an alleged financial irregularity, came to Parliament in a van belonging to the Prisons Department amidst tight security of the Prison Department security personnel.
The MP was also seen taking part in the in-House demonstration conducted by the JO in the middle of the House.
The remanded MP also met former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament.
JO protest only to cut down Gotassupporters, boost Namal: Harin
MP Namal Rajapaksa should be held responsible for all the activities expected to happen at the protest organized by the Joint Opposition in Colombo, today said Minister of Telecommunications & Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando.
MP Rajapaksa should take the sole responsibility if any public property is damaged or any casualties happen as a result of their protest, he said.
Minister Fernando, addressing the media yesterday at the Parliamentary premises, said that they have not informed the relevant officials about their protest plans, therefore anything could happen.
He further said that the government had not taken any initiative to interrupt the protest and added that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure the safety of the public.
He said that Jana Bala has been organized by the Joint Opposition to make Namal Rajapaksa as the leader of the party due to the prevailing issues within the Rajapaksa Family. He pointed out that they do not have a motive to protest and added that the only intention is to get back the power to their own family again.
The purpose of the protest is to cut down the supporters of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and to show Namal Rajapaksa as their leader, he said.
He further said that all their supporters act very weirdly, considering the amount of slaves they have, it is not a big deal for them to gather a satisfactory number of individuals to participate at the protest.
Cabinet approval for revised long term generation plan
State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P Perera, said that the Cabinet has approved a revised long term generation plan which also includes 300 MW of coal power generation by 2024.
The Minister responding to queries by MP Hesha Vithanage, said that the demand for electricity is growing every year, while maximum reported Peak Demand in 2020 is 3077 MW.
He assured that the government had taken all necessary measures to meet the demand. Accordingly, the required numbered Thermal energy power plants, Floating natural gas terminals, Hydro power stations, Wind power stations, Natural gas power stations and Renewable energy plants would be constructed in the coming years to successfully meet the energy demand.
The Minister further said that permission would not be granted to establish Mini hydro projects due to environment pollution caused.
He said that construction of 15 M feet high wind barrier at the Norochcholai Power Plant was started two months before and is expected to be completed in 9 months. He added that the emission of coal dust and fly ash at the Norochcholai Power Plant would be totally controlled.
Family background report for housemaids:Law to be amended
The government yesterday acknowledged in Parliament that there are several loopholes in the law in which a family background report was made mandatory for Sri Lankan women to travel to Middle East countries as housemaids and suggested that the law be amended.
In 2013, the previous government made it mandatory for the women who wish to go abroad to work as a domestic aides, to submit a report on their family background, which should be certified by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE).
During the Oral Question Round, Deputy Minister of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara said that although the number of women who are mothers of toddlers has reduced after the implementation of the said law, many women whose applications were rejected due to the family background report have travelled to the Middle East using forged documents and visit Visas.
Because of this, the government cannot track such women when they are facing difficulties in Middle Easters countries to aid them, he added.
Furthermore, Nanayakkara said that there is international pressure regarding this Law, alleging that it violates the rights of women and causes gender discrimination.
It is alleged that this law discriminates women because it implements an age limit and prohibits certain types of women engaging in foreign employment just because they are females. We do not say that this law should be completely abolished. We also do not want to see the children suffer. But this Law should be amended to overcome these loopholes, Nanayakkara observed.
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunnetti said that there was a mafia created by foreign employment agencies.
He stressed, These agencies do not care about our children. They only want to make more and more money. It is they and not the international community who want to abolish this Law. The government should not allow this to happen.
The Deputy Minister said that the government has appointed a Cabinet subcommittee to look into the matter.
In the meantime, both Government and Ppposition members of Parliament revoked against lifting of the mandatory Family Background Report (FBR) for women migrant workers.
Minister of Women and Child Affairs Chandrani Bandara, SLFP MP representing the Group of 16 Sudarshani Fernandopulle and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti insisted that the FBR should not be lifted as it was implemented with the intention of reducing the adverse psycho-social implications of children left behind by the mothers working abroad.

Mangala Madanayake is an artist who won Presidential awards.
So far all his art exhibitions have been on ball point colour art. He has also used oil painting, acrylic and water colour.
He uses ball point colours such as Blue, Black, Brown, Red and other colours and mix them by drawing on the top of each colour. By this method he paints just as you paint using oil paints and water colours mediums. If you look at these paintings these ball point drawings look as same as water colour or oil paintings. About 20 years ago the ball point pen was used only to write. But today schoolchildren and artists use the ball point for art.
Madanayakes latest exhibition will be held at the Galle Sports Stadium on September 21 and 22 in a bid to celebrate the literary month.

POLICE CAN ACT IF PROTESTERS VIOLATE LAW - MAGISTRATES
The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday observed that police can arrest organisers of the Joint Opposition at anytime, if they attempted to topple the government by surrounding the Presidents official residence during todays protest organised by them.
Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake made these observations when Cinnamon Gardens police sought an order in terms of Section 106 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code to prevent an event of causing any disturbance to the public.
Police told the Chief Magistrate that they received information from intelligence units that eleven Joint Opposition activists including MP Namal Rajapaksa, Wimal Weerawansa, Rohitha Abeygunawardena and Wasudeva Nanayakkara are organising the protest campaign in Colombo today (05).
Cinnamon Gardens police submitted that intelligence reports had revealed that the protesters plan to converge in Colombo to surround the Presidents official residence at Malalasekara Mawatha with the ulterior motive of trapping the President inside his official residence overnight.
The offences against the State have been outlined under section 114 and 115 of the Penal Code. If the respondents mentioned in the B report are attempting to surround the Presidents official residence, it can be considered as a serious offence including offences against State. If they attempt to topple the government in an undemocratic manner, police should take steps to arrest them immediately without seeking court orders,the Chief Magistrate observed.
However, the Police failed to support their argument with substantial evidence.
Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake also turned down a request made by Cinnamon Gardens Police to issue an order preventing protestors causing any disturbance to the public.
The Colombo Fort Magistrates Court and Colombo Additional Magistrates Court issued the same orders following requests made by the Kollupitiya and Welikada Police.
The courts observed that police has power to take necessary legal action if anyone violates the laws.

President Maithripala Sirisena directed senior officials of the Water Resources Board to take urgent steps to provide drinking water to people in Kataragama after resolving internal problems of the Board without delay.
He issued this directive at a meeting held at the official residence of the Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya, when he visited Kataragama for religious observances to mark his birthday on September 3.
At the meeting, Basnayake Nilame Dilruwan Rajapaksa said people in Kataragama and surrounding villages were undergoing great inconvenience without drinking water due to defects in the Water Resources Board filtration plants.
This is further aggravated during weekends when a large number of pilgrims visit the area.
The President, thereafter, directed Water Resources Board officials to resolve this issue quickly and ensure that adequate water supplies were provided to the people.
It was revealed that residents along Sithulpawwa road, Kandasurindugama, Sellakataragama, Karawile Akkara 20, Gothamigama and Kavantissapura dont receive adequate pipe-borne water when pilgrims converge in Kataragama on weekends.
Restaurant keepers and owners of rest houses too were confronted with this problem. A Water Board official said the problem occurred due to the low capacity of the filtration system.

The question of sudden enlightenment
August 29 happened to be a fascinating moment of bliss for those of us who gathered at the Social Sciences Auditorium at Kelaniya University. This happened to be the simple launching ceremony of a scholarly book titled as A Manual of Zen translated from the original Chinese work into English by the two scholars Dr Bhikkhu Ho Beop and Professor S B Hettiarachchi both attached to English Research Centre of Buddhist Texts. This is the first one in a series of Buddhist texts. The original work, perhaps as stated by the two translators, is a work known as Epistle of Da Hui or Letter Sermons of Master Da Hui Pu Jue. Published in English in 2018, the introduction goes to say that the Zen meditation has been the main method for most Korean as well as some other countries in the tradition of seeking enlightenment from the very inception of its introduction from countries such as China and Japan.
The history of the expansion of Zen into other countries has been a serious study undertaken by scholars like D T Suzuki, Paul Reps, Christmas Humphreys, Allen Watts, Lucien Stryle, Takashi Ikemoto and our own scholar Venerable Professor Walpola Rahula Thera. In my address gracing the occasion at the invitation of Social Sciences Faculty Dean Professor Chandana Abeyratne, I drew the attention of the audience as regards some of the salient factors linked to the local narrative traditions as an inspiration from the Zen stories, Zen poems, Zen prayers and Zen sayings.
Zen stories
Two local scholars, Professor Chandima Vijebandara and Professor H M Moratuwagama are credited with translating quite a number of Zen stories from English into Sinhala. We observed a Zen communication culture springing up gradually via media channels for the most part on blissful sudden enlightenment or satori as it is known to Zennists all around the world.
Originally the term Zen has sprung up from the Sanskrit word Dhyana from which sprang up the Chinese Chan and Seon in Korean. Zen tradition is being linked into the occidental popular culture as a result of the intrinsic conflict of the spiritual nuances as well as the realistic momentary bliss it embraces the promoters of popular cultural aspects in the US such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac have often pointed out the introspective nature of Zen as it influenced them in their creative communication patterns.
While working in the BBC World Service, an Indian producer of Music programmes once told me that some of the Indian lyric writers in Hindu and film music directors have utilised the Zen spirit into their respective functions. One of the songs as he pointed out appears in the Hindi Film of the late fifties named as Do Anken Barahat. The song begins with the words, Ye mabik there vande ham. This song was sung melodiously by Nayana Shamali Rajapaksa. Nayana, a music teacher, elaborated the meaning underlying in the song. This too entertained the gathering. Followed by this, a Mass Communication Senior Lecturer, a scholar in Buddhist doctrinal studies, presented a well known Zen story selected from a collection of Zen stories (Zen Kathandara published by Godage in 2004.)
Struggling girl
This simple Zen story narrates the journey of two monks. As they pass through a muddy road, both of them see a struggling young girl. The elderly priest removed his upper dress, drew close to the girl, lifted her in his arms and placed her ashore so that she could resume the journey. The other priest, young in age, showed signs of virtue and kept silent throughout the journey. The elderly priest noticed the silence and questioned why. In response, the silent monks broke the ice.
What you have done is not at all in keeping with the virtuous qualities of a Buddhist monk, for you have lifted a young girl and allowed her to get out of mire full of mud.
The elderly monk replied:
I have lifted her and let her go on her journey. I have done the needful. But you are still carrying her on your back.
This moment of illumination is what the Zen scholars denote as awakening or sudden enlightenment or satori. Those who have read and seriously concentrates on Zen stories, as well as Zen poems, are awakened.
Zen question
While at Amaravathi, the forest sanctuary in London, I had the chance of selecting a few books on Zen. One work is titled as Zen Questions compiled by Robert Allen with illustrations by Andre Sollier. This book answers the most commonly asked questions concerning the philosophy, principles and practice of Zen. A reader finds the work filled with anecdotes or tales as meditative situations drawn from both the ancient and the modern world.
One such question goes as, what is Zen The answer is a traditional definition that goes as follows.
Outside teaching,
Apart from tradition, not founded on words
And letters
Pointing directly to the human mind,
Seeing into ones nature
And attaining Buddhahood.
As noted in the history of religion, it is one saintly scholar Bodhidharma, or Daruma who introduced Zen to China and Japan. Though the Zen does not grossly detour from the essential teachings of the Buddha, the scholars have often pointed out that it had stemmed from various sources of Mahayana thought especially Yogachara the Vajra Sutra and other Prajna Paramita literature. The Zen scholars are quite relaxed and constantly in search of the mental states of happiness in silence. As such, Zen emphasised creativity and spirituality not undermining reality around. There are several terms used to denote the state of mind in the past of Dr Suzuki. He denotes the state of mind as achieved via Zen meditation as no-min- or the mind freed from bonds and obstacles. As a result of the spread of Zen, several scholars of thought have appeared. Most essential point is that it is a practice rather than a theory.
In Zen, dialogues ensue between a teacher and a pupil. This is a koan practice which needs to be developed.

Snow White makes way into  Bharatha Natyam
Nirmalanjali, the Academy of Bharatha Natyam, now 32 years old, finds joy in reviving today some of the past productions that enthralled the audience. Besides traditional classical presentations as well as folk dances, there were many innovative ventures.
One such was the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs adopted from the folktale collections of the German academics, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Brothers titled Children and Household Tales published in 1812 which subsequently gained phenomenal worldwide recognition as classic fairy tales.
The story is about a wicked queen who, envious of the beauty of her step-daughter Snow White, orders her murder, but later discovers that she was still alive hiding in a cottage with seven friendly miners.

Sri Lanka still following outdated idealogy - Minister Amunugama
Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said Sri Lanka is fast becoming the sick man of Asia by following the outdated ideology that the State must do everything.
He was addressing the fifth International Conference on Multi-Disciplinary Approaches-2018 organised by the Science & Technology Ministry and the University of Jayewardenepura at the Tangerine Beach Hotel recently.
The Minister said that even the British Labour Party had to amend the Clause IV of its Constitution relating to social ownership of production, distribution and exchange and the people have to move with the changed world.
The Minister said it is a widely held misconception that policy-making in government is not informed by research. The Minister said that as far as economic policy-making is concerned, there is a continuous dialogue between the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry.
The Minister said the government benefits from the expertise of the many international organisations such as the IMF, the World Bank and the ADB of which Sri Lanka is a member.

SriLankan Airlines bags two titles
SriLankan Airlines was awarded two prestigious titles at the World Travel Awards 2018 Asia and Australasia Ceremony held at InterContinental Grand Standford in Hong Kong, yesterday.
Whilst the Airlines launch campaign to Australia titled Two Cities. One Spirit was awarded the Asias Leading Marketing Campaign 2018 accolade, SriLankan managed to defend the familiar title Asias Leading Airline to the Indian Ocean 2018 for the second consecutive year.
SriLankan Airlines, Group Chief Executive Officer, Vipula Gunatilleka said, SriLankan Airlines emphasis has been on systematic and focused growth in certain markets to reposition the airline as a leader in the region through product/frequency enhancements and induction of new destinations. Our consolidated strength in the Indian Sub-continent has allowed us to offer a wider choice of travel to customers across our global network. Impactful marketing communication activations, on the other hand, have been instrumental in cementing the Airlines brand presence in our focus markets.
These two awards bear testimony to the fact that our efforts have been holistically effective. SriLankan Airlines Senior Manager Marketing, Saminda Perera said, We, at SriLankan Airlines, are delighted to receive two coveted awards at the World Travel Awards Asia and Australasia Ceremony, this year. Whilst one award reinforces our stature as a leader in the ISC region, the other recognizes the innovativeness and universal appeal of our marketing communications endeavours.The campaign conducted for the launch of new destination- Melbourne, Two cities. One spirit stems from a place of honouring and celebrating the affinity between Australia and Sri Lanka.
This was aimed to appeal to the Sri Lankan Diaspora in Melbourne and the Australians who are attracted to adventure on the island.
The creative executions were inspired by characteristics that exist in both Sri Lankan and Australian cultures, expressed through visuals that celebrate the similar vivacity and passion deeply rooted in food, art, cricket, surfing and the iconic wildlife that are inherent to both destinations.
The use of location pin as a stylistic element widely recognized by the contemporary traveller was aimed to emphasize on the non-stop connectivity (the point-to-point quality) and that the connections can be extended to onward destinations across the Airlines network.
This was a creative collaboration between the Airline and its creative agency, JWT Sri Lanka, and this was the second award bestowed upon the campaign after the First Star award at the Golden City Gate Awards, ITB Berlin this year.
Since the launch that took place in October last year, the Airlines operations to Melbourne has been commercially successful and the impactful marketing activations have been a contributing factor to this success.

Sufficient material to issue rule against Dr. Padeniya - CA
The Court of Appeal decided to overrule objections raised by Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya on December 6, 2017, in the Court of Contempt case.
The Court of Appeal observed that there is sufficient material to issue rule against Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya in the charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements.
The case was filed against Dr. Padeniya for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement delivered regarding the SAITM issue.
Dr. Padeniya through his lawyer informed the Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the Court stenographer.
A charge sheet was served on Dr. Padeniya by the Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement dated January 31, 2017. The case was also re-fixed for inquiry by the Court of Appeal yesterday. Court of Appeal President Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara re-fixed the matter for inquiry on October 18.
The judgement was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal had also issued an Interim Order (IO) preventing GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements and articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this contempt of court action.
Two civil society activists Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr.Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by Court of Appeal, the GMOA had condemned and openly criticised the said judgement demanding an annulment or setting aside of the said judgement.
The petitioners stated that the GMOA headed by Dr.Padeniya had called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following the Court decision ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on April 7, 2017 the GMOA had organised islandwide trade union action against SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM. The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast in several media and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under topic of Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr.Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements and articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge to impose sentence on Dr. Padeniya as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya appeared for the petitioners. Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Ravindranath Dabare appeared for the respondent.

## Title: Transforming the Police

## Section: Editorial

Transforming the Police
The proposal to establish a Police and Crimes University to better equip the police to deal with the new trends in crime and other challenges is to be welcomed. Speaking at the 152th Police Day celebrations, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that they hope to present a Cabinet paper shortly to set up a police and crimes university. He said the police are today confronted with new challenges when fighting crime, with the advancement in technology. Now there are drug mafia networks and cyber-crimes which the police have to deal with. We were able to understand the kind of disturbances that social media and new technology can cause to law and order in a country, the Premier noted.
Indeed, crime today has taken on a new dimension. It is no longer straight forward as in the past, like in the case of a plain shooting or stabbing. Sophisticated methods are being used to commit grave crime that defies detection. The same is true of white-collar crime. The recent investigations into some of the crooked financial deals under the Rajapaksa regime reveal to what degree the web of intrigue had been spun which can stump even the best of detectives. The need has therefore arisen for the police to be on the money to unravel the deep layers of deceit and expose the culprits. A Police University would certainly enable the investigators to arm themselves with the special skills needed to tackle white-collar crime that is becoming widespread today, both in state institutions and the corporate sector. The Inland Revenue scam where the suspects fleeced the state for over a billion rupees over several years is a case in point.
As mentioned by the Premier, there is also the case of cyber-crime which is becoming widespread and also the use of Facebook to spread communal strife, as revealed in connection with the recent incidents in Kandy. The police should be geared to handle these challenges through the setting up special branches in the service staffed with specially qualified personnel. There was a time when brawn superseded the brain when recruitments were done to the police. However with the change in times there is a need to make the necessary adjustments in the selection criteria and those with intellectual ability absorbed to the service to deal with the new challenges.
The Premier, in his speech, also commended the service of the police under the present IGP, amidst the most trying circumstances, especially in its success at getting the crime rate down by 35% and the rate of solved cases up by 20%. The police is not praised no matter how hard they work, he added.
Certainly there are bad eggs in any service and the police is no exception. Public criticism of the police could be justified in certain instances, especially in relation to custodial deaths. But by and large the police service has done commendably in the execution of its duties in recent times, going by the high profile arrests and detections made, particularly the seizure of massive hauls of narcotics, which rightly drew the praise of the Premier. The service was fittingly rewarded with salary increases for all grades. It is important that police personnel be made a contended lot due to the nature of their duties that is fraught with danger and risk. There were police officers who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty in recent times, when confronting dangerous criminals.
Not just the officers themselves, the welfare of their families too should receive the highest consideration of the government. Most often when police officers are subject to transfers, this affect the schooling of their offspring. During the war, the children of soldiers received the special privilege of getting themselves admitted to good schools. It is not known if this concession was extended to the police as well. If not, the State should look into this matter and come up with a solution.
There is also the need to build police-public relationship to a satisfactory level. Admittedly, the police have not entirely endeared themselves to the public due to certain incidents in recent times, particular the Embilipitiya brawl that resulted in the death of a youth. Programmes of interaction should be launched by the IGP such as sports events and other recreational activity involving the police and the public. Above all the police should be transformed into an essentially civilian force. We say this because during the war years recruitments were done to the police dispensing with established criteria due to lack of manpower. In the process undesirables too found their way into the service, as in the case with the Tri-Forces. Perhaps it is these elements who are responsible for some of the violent incidents that are reported. There is no denying that the police too, like the members of the Armed Forces, became brutalized with the intensity of the war and some of their members carry these scars to the present day.
Like the Premier said, the police should make a review of its performance and move forward rectifying all its shortcomings. It should re-evaluate where it had gained and where it had gone wrong.

TRUE reflection of spirit
With well over 15 years of experience in crafting out inimitable pieces of art that is a true reflection of creativity, Dillai Joseph is a self-taught artist who later honed her skills under the tutelage of Nadine David. The latter was a student of David Paynter. Dillais art can be described as being a mix of classical and contemporary style painting with a love for portraying the human form and bringing out the spirit of the seemingly mundane.
Proudly displaying a career that spans over a decade in the field of Advertising, she studied Communication Design and Marketing and enjoyed filling the roles of Art Director and later Creative Director in some of the well-known advertising agencies in Sri Lanka. At present, she divides her time by running her own niche creative ad shop, which is known as The Next Big Think (www.thenextbigthink.co), painting during the early hours of the morning, and being the strong-willed mum of two exuberant and creative children.
Drawing inspiration early in the morning, she begins her day at around 3 am. Inspiration comes in varied forms, and it is by taking an energizing walk in the Kimbulawala paddy field in the early hours, where the morning dew and the first puddles of sunlight recharge her.
Inspired by the works of Sri Lankan greats like Paynter and Wendt, Dillais pieces have habitually shown a great interest in the human form with her first successful solo exhibition in 2015 exploring portraiture to great extent, while also showcasing a scattering of beautiful depictions of puddles and nature. She has also produced many commissioned pieces, exhibited in group exhibitions and art festivals such as Cinnamon Colomboscope and the Galle Literary Fest amongst many others.
Her upcoming exhibition Soulscapes, explores more than just the human form in its theme  It is an artistic exploration of the human soul in its barest form. The innermost desires, awakened feelings, beastly hunger and dormant daydreams find their place on canvas in her portrayal of the 'I' within every woman. Her work speaks of an aim to provoke a sense of exploration of oneself; she looks at the deep nature of the woman within, beyond a body of just flesh and skin. Her paintings try to portray as much nature as possible and also try to combine the lives of people and their reactions to their natural surroundings. Interestingly, she uses a lot of trees, a source of security and companionship.
Soulscapes will be exhibiting at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery from October 5 to 7. It is held in conjunction with LEADS, which is a National NGO established in 1985, with charity status, through its child protection division ESCAPE (Eradication Sexual Child Abuse, Prostitution & Exploitation). LEADS works towards restoring the lives of children who are abused through psycho-social support, counselling, advocating and by ensuring justice for children through legal support. The proceeds from this exhibition will be used to fund this work carried out by ESCAPE in Sri Lanka.

Truth about clinical waste
The National Hospital in Colombo was saddled with the enormous problem of disposing the clinical waste that had accumulated over a period of time, creating a severe health hazard.
It was found dumped in the hospital premises and then moved to another place, but the threat of people being exposed to infectious elements remained high. Health authorities made several moves to get rid of this dangerous waste, but to no avail.
Now the Health Minister has sought Cabinet intervention to remove the waste safely to a location in Muthurajawela and destroy it according to accepted norms and procedures.
According to Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, land has already been obtained in Muthurajawela to dump clinical waste collected from the state hospitals located in the Western Province. The plot of land has been obtained by submitting a Cabinet paper and obtaining the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. Clinical waste will be destroyed after preparing the land for the task.
A private company used to collect the clinical waste and destroy it using a place inside the Mulleriyawa Base Hospital, but the process stopped after a court order prohibited it. This place had the approval of the Central Environmental Authority. The company collected the clinical waste and kept it in another place temporarily, gradually destroying the waste, using the system belonging to the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital, the Minister said.
This type of information should be communicated to the public very carefully because of its sensitivity. The media should act very carefully when handling such information. A nurses trade union belonging to a certain political party had given the information to the media without any understanding, the Minister said.
According to Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Lakshman Gamlath, the clinical waste accumulated inside the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) was completely removed by September 3.
The National Hospital and two other state hospitals were affected by the issue. There was a public protest in the area used to destroy clinical waste and a court order prohibited the process in that area. As a result, clinical waste had accumulated at the NHSL. The process of destroying clinical waste in this area went on for five years, but the protest was staged all of a sudden, he said.
The process went on with the approval of the Central Environmental Authority and all relevant institutions and followed all required standards, rules and regulations. The court order was revoked after the intervention of the Health Ministry and the management of the institution which handled the process, Dr. Gamlath said.
It took some time to clear the backlog. This is why clinical waste had accumulated inside the NHSL, but the issue is completely solved now, he said.
According to NHSL Deputy Director K. Wickramasinghe, the issue of accumulating clinical waste inside the NHSL has been resolved and the waste completely removed by September 3. Therefore there is no more clinical waste accumulation inside the NHSL.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), healthcare waste contains potentially harmful microorganisms that can infect patients, health workers and the public. Other potential hazards may include drug-resistant microorganisms which spread from health facilities into the environment.
Adverse health outcomes associated with healthcare waste and its by-products include the following:
 sharps-inflicted injuries;
 toxic exposure to pharmaceutical products, in particular antibiotics and cytotoxic drugs released into the surrounding environment, and to substances such as mercury or dioxins, during the handling or incineration of healthcare waste;
 chemical burns arising in the context of disinfection, sterilisation or waste treatment activities;
 air pollution arising as a result of the release of particulate matter during medical waste incineration;
 thermal injuries occurring in conjunction with open burning and the operation of medical waste incinerators; and
 radiation burns.
According to the WHO statistics, worldwide, an estimated 16 billion injections are administered every year. Not all needles and syringes are disposed of safely, creating a risk of injury and infection and opportunities for reuse.
Injections with contaminated needles and syringes in low- and middle-income countries have reduced substantially in recent years, partly due to efforts to reduce reuse of injection devices. Despite this progress, in 2010, unsafe injections were still responsible for as many as 33,800 cases of HIV infection, 1.7 million of hepatitis B infection, and 315,000 of hepatitis C infection.
A person who experiences one needle-stick injury from a needle used on an infected source patient has risks of 30 percent, 1.8 percent, and 0.3 percent respectively of becoming infected with HBV, HCV and HIV.
Additional hazards occur from scavenging at waste disposal sites and during the handling and manual sorting of hazardous waste from healthcare facilities. These practices are common in many regions of the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The waste handlers are at immediate risk of needle-stick injuries and exposure to toxic or infectious materials.
In 2015, a joint WHO/UNICEF assessment found that just over half (58 percent) of sampled facilities from 24 countries had adequate systems in place for the safe disposal of healthcare waste.

'Turn off' nightmares
A new study may have found a way to 'turn off' nightmares. Scientists from Tokyo have just discovered two genes responsible for nightmares and dreams.
It occurs when you are in a deep sleep and it is also known as rapid eye movement (REM).
REM is believed to play a crucial role in maintaining well-being for mammals, including humans. It is also important to store memories. It is thought to be vital for survival. However, that may not be the case. On an experiment conducted on mice, researchers found when the two genes were removed, the animals continued to live normally.
By removing these genes, it could theoretically prevent people from having bad dreams. The findings are published in the journal Cell Reports.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 42
turnaround  strategies during  trying times
Virtually all small and mid-size business owners and CEOs face the daunting task of managing the recovery of a highly distressed or dying business. Every business during the course of its existence will experience one or more near-death experiences. This is a period characterized by hard business conditions, low sales, low morale, low cash, low market share, and low innovation.
Some recover from this and bounce back stronger than before and others simply do not. It is very important to seek help, such as a business advisor, who can help you plan, make the extremely tough decisions and execute your plan to turn your company around.
There are many factors responsible for this near-death experience, including those that are self-inflicted like a major project failure, lack of information to manage the business or incompetent management, poor sales management, or poor financial controls. These are generally termed internal forces. While those that are not self-inflicted like government regulations, economic recessions, low-priced competitors or natural disasters are termed external forces.
Understanding some of the basic turnaround strategies used by crisis-management companies, you can pinpoint your companys strategic problems and save your business.
If you are struggling with a failing or dying business, here are few turnaround strategies to help you resurrect your business.
Realization of the situation
First of all, you must face the fact that your company is failing and employees are getting jittery and distressed. Then you must identify the real problem(s) and realize there are issues that need addressing with a high sense of urgency. You need to get committed to making the needed changes and seeking the help you need from a seasoned advisor that will help you with the many extremely tough decisions that you will face.
a. Strategy  Look closely at your business strategy to ensure your business is relevant, focused and managed tightly.
b. People  Are the right people running the company Are the right people in the right places Are employees committed to organizational success Are employees properly incentivized to share in the ongoing success of the firm
c. Customers  Are customers satisfied Do they know, like and trust your brand Is the business focused on profitable customers versus unprofitable and difficult customers Are you targeting the right customers
d. Product  Are you offering high quality, innovative products and services Can the business better utilize technology to create better products, reduce costs and improve competitive advantages
e. Process  Is the company performance-driven and goal-oriented Are there processes and procedures in writing to enable the business to improve
f. Finance  Are cash flows sufficient to sustain ongoing commitments and operations Does this business have excessive debt and why does it have excessive debt Are gross margins and pricing proper to optimize profits Do you know your break-even point Is your sales team efficient with strong sales management
Realizing your situation is a critical turnaround strategy; without it all other things are just frantic moves that will yield little results. Before you begin to act, know why, what and how distressed your business is, and get the help you need to right the ship.
Strategies
There are many different turnaround strategies. Regardless of the business, the Management Gurus say that these turnaround strategies fall into 2 types: Wishful thinking and Logical approach.
Wishful thinking  In this strategy, you search for conventional financing. You believe that just a little extra money will fix the problem. You start calling bankers, bridge financiers and other lending institutions trying to get extra financing at a good price. They spend months looking for the funds. But, funnily, the money never arrives and the financiers never offer a term sheet.
Why does the funding never come through Because no financier in his or her right mind will invest in a troubled business with declining sales, profits and cash flow. The risk is too high.
Logical Approach - To achieve the objective of this approach, turnaround strategy must reverse causes of distress, resolve the financial crisis, achieve a rapid improvement in financial performance, regain stakeholder support, and overcome internal constraints and unfavourable industry characteristics.
Complexities
Execution of the turnaround strategy faces immense complexities, pressure of limited time, information and resources, as well as uncertainty about the future. To maintain control, the components of the turnaround plan across all the stages of the turnaround process need to be broken down into smaller manageable time-phased activities and each with associated costs and resources with allocated accountabilities. Meticulous project management is required to track turnaround performance against targets and timelines, and to reschedule and reallocate.
Issues
The distressed company under turnaround management typically faces any of a number of financial issues: It requires funding to meet both its short-term commitments during emergency management, and to cover turnaround restructuring costs. This may include: working capital for trade creditor and interest payments. Restructuring costs such as professional fees, closure and retrenchment costs. Investment in new technology and systems. The balance sheet has to be restored to solvency. Excessive gearing needs to be corrected.
A successful turnaround programme may often affect financial results on the operating profit. This requires the capital structure to be aligned with the projected level of operating profit and cash flow to avoid interest charges keeping the company in the red. The debt structure represents excessive short-term and insufficient long-term debt. Refinancing therefore involves not only the injection of new funds in the form of loan or equity finance, but also changing the existing capital structure per se.
Funding
Finding turnaround funding in the form of loan finance is difficult. Banks and other providers of loan capital invariably look for ways to safeguard and decrease rather than increase their exposure. If a workout is deemed feasible, lenders may in some cases provide a measure of additional finance, but against unencumbered assets or surety. The latter is something the distressed company can seldom offer.
Given the difficulties associated with loan finance, private equity should be the logical answer. The turnaround private equity market is well-developed overseas, but unfortunately not in Sri Lanka. There may be a number of high net worth individuals and organisations that will invest in distressed companies on a case-by-case basis.
Process
While each case is unique, the turnaround process frequently involves the following:
1. Management change - consultants may be called in to manage the turnaround of the firm.
2. Situation analysis - a situation analysis is performed to evaluate the prospects of survival. Assuming the firm is worth turning around, depending on the root causes of the distress one or more of the following turnaround strategies may be selected:
Redefine your strategy
After realization comes re-definition. Realization determines whats wrong with your business and re-definition is putting the business back on track. This is when you go back to the drawing board to set the overall direction for the company. This is where you create the Turnaround Plan.
Be brutally honest with yourself and your advisors every step of the way. Failing in business is often a result of not having a clear direction or being highly diluted and inefficient so pinpoint the issues openly and honestly.
Re-engage people
You cant turnaround a distressed or dying business without talking about the employees. People make or break your business, and accountability is vital to your success. To resurrect a dying business, get the right people on board and get the wrong people off, period! This requires proactive, tough decisions to structure the personnel and management to execute your go-forward plan.
Innovate
Lack of innovation is one of the warning signs of a dying business. It is impossible for a business to remain relevant in the market if it fails to introduce new products and services or update existing ones. People change, markets change, technology changes and so must your business. If you refuse to change and do not innovate your products and services, you are doomed. To bring your dying business back to life, focus on innovation and devise a written plan to generate a high ROI.
Branding and marketing
One of the consequences of a distressed or dying business is the negative impact it has on the brand. Your customers begin to lose trust in the brand as their satisfaction level declines. Negative marketing spreads and the brand is no longer liked or trusted in the market. To correct this negative association with the brand, you have to make fast and definitive changes.
Finance and cash flow
A detailed focus on your finances is critical. Money is a must to any business, and one of the most obvious signs of a distressed or dying business is a lack of money. Insolvency is a situation you must avoid. If you cant meet your financial obligations and are already insolvent, you must create a plan to turn things around immediately.
External funding can be a very daunting task, especially if you are insolvent. Start sourcing for funds from within the business. Only after you have exhausted these internal funding options should you seek external sources.
Execution
After all is said and done, there is no way to bring your dying business back to life by mere words; you need to make the commitment and get busy. You need to both rethink and rework the way you are used to operating.
Many business owners are engaged in a random work approach rather than a performance-driven or goal-oriented work approach to their business, and execution is the key to your opportunity for success.
In some cases, the prospects of the firm may be too bleak to continue as an ongoing operation and an exit strategy may be appropriate.

UNP challenges  JO to topple Govt.
Law and Order and Public Administration and Management Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara while noting that the government was neither scared nor interested in the JO protest planned for today, challenged the JO to topple the government.
We have no fear or no interest about this protest. They have boasted on several occasions that they will bring a large crowd to Colombo and topple the government. We challenge them to do so if possible. These is mere rhetorics to hoodwink the people, he added.
But we are sure that people are not so foolish or gullible to fall for their gimmicks and join the planned protest, Bandara said. This is not the first time that JO members held a protest march to Colombo. But, none of previous protest marches were a success. This protest too is doomed to be a failure like the previous ones, he added.

Week of watersport action
The KTA, Asias long established kiteboard competition organisation is heading Sri Lanka to bring the countries first every international competition in the sport  the KTA Sri Lanka Asian Freestyle X Championships.
Kiteboarding has been growing steadily in Sri Lanka, as its strong wind reputation and stunning riding locations became known across the kiting world.
The KTA Sri Lanka is taking place in Kalpitiya from September 4 to 8 sponsored by Sri Lanka Tourism http://www.srilanka.travel/ . The KTA will also be collaborating with the Kalpitiya Windsports Club http://bit.ly/2OmG74F which acts as the umbrella organisation for all the kite schools in the area.
KTA Sri Lanka is not just one event - its four: Asian Freestyle X Championships, Sri Lanka freestyle X Nationals, International Freestyle X Open and Hangtime.
All the action will be taking place at Kalpitiya the hotspot for kiteboarding in the country which is located in Katunayake. While it is an exquisite coastal region located on the Western coastal belt, north of Colombo, Kalpitiya is a peninsula set in between the deep lagoon of Puttalam to the east and the magnificent Indian Ocean to the west. It is an unrivalled marine sanctuary with a diversity of habitats ranging from bar reefs, flat coastal plains, saltpans, mangrove swamps, salt marshes and vast sand dune beaches.
Little wonder the area is known for its natural environment which consists of 14 islands, with its population traditionally earning their living from fishing. Kalpitiya though is being transformed by the kiteboarding scene and is now considered the best location to kite in the country. It has a great summer season from May to October, with strong consistent winds pumping in during the south west monsoon. The winter season runs from around from mid-December to mid-February, during the north east monsoon.
KTA Sri Lanka offers a cash prize purse of 5000 USD, plus a whole stack of equipment prizes across the four events, so plenty of opportunity for competitors to make their mark and walk away with honours.
Of course no KTA event would be complete without its strong social scene, key to welcoming its field of international competitors and growing the off-water friendships the sport is renowned for. Hosted by kite schools from the Kalpitiya Windsports Club, the official opening event will be held at Sri Lanka Kite, to be followed with mid-week competitors chill-out night at De Silva before proceedings for the week close with the Awards night at Kitesurfing Lanka featuring the infamous KTA DJ Erwin from Area 51 on the famous Philippine island of Boracay.
So, whether you are competing, coaching, supporting or just visiting its going to be a week of watersport action and lifestyle not to miss.

Welcome to the future
Jurassic Park fans, this ones for you. A Japanese hotel is offering guests one of the strangest check-in experiences possible - a reception desk manned by robot dinosaurs.
Whether its Japanese, English, Chinese or Korean, the pair of dinosaurs are more than happy to assist customers arriving at the hotel in east Tokyo through the use of a tablet system.
The hotel belongs to the Henn na (whose name means weird) chain, which claims to offer the worlds first hotels staffed by robots.
As reported by AFP, the robots detect guests motion on approach and bellow out Welcome and gesture with their long arms. However, the icing on the cake are the tiny bellboy hats perched atop their heads.
Yet despite the novelty of the situation, the hotels manager, Yukio Nagai, has said that some customers find the dinosaurs slightly unnerving.
We havent quite figured out when exactly the guests want to be served by people, and when its okay to be served by robots, he told AFP.

Why does economics need a gender lens
I'm very struck by the extent of gender sensitivity of the Vice Chancellor and gender awareness and knowledge of the Honourable Minister.
This is a very important preparation that the Department of Economics and Statistics, led by Prof. Dileni Gunewardena and her team and faculty who have been working hard for this workshop.
I want to share our journey for the programme in Gender Analysis in Economics.
In 2009, a colleague of mine and I launched a unique programme in American University (PGAE). After talking to many stakeholders in Washington DC, we decided to have the following: a graduate certificate in gender analysis in economics, a graduate track in the masters degree and a gender field for PhDs.
There are 2 courses - Gender Micro (topics include household economics, labour markets etc.) & Gender Macro. What drove faculty in setting up this programme is the following: the kind of economy we want for ourselves and future generations, requires an analysis of gender economic issues.
Gender power relations
Gender is a social construct. It defines the behaviour that is appropriate for women and men. It determines their differential access to rights and resources and power in society. An important aspect of gender is power relations and its imbalance. However, there is variation in the way gender manifests itself in countries today. In the case of Sri Lanka, Philippines and the US we have made some progress in addressing this imbalance but much is left to be done.
Some manifestations of gender power relations:
Gender based division of labour within the household
Unequal access between men and women in control over property, assets and resources
Unequal participation in political institutions
Restrictions in physical mobility
Codes of conduct that condone violence against women
An important point is that gender relations permeate economic institutions and affect outcomes. Gender affects the household division of labour, Work urden of women, Womens labor force participation, Wage gaps between women and men, Fertility rates, Economic growth and distribution, Economic development and quality of life and human well-being.
Some examples:
A) Violence against women and its multi-dimensional effects.
A study done by WHO and OECD showed that intimate partner violence is prevalent worldwide, in developed and developing countries. (See map)
Violence against women is not just a women's issue or social issue. It is an economic and political issue too. It has impact on many things. The economic cost not is just on women and families but on the economy and society. (Figure 1)
B) Labour force participation of women, fertility rates and the link with unequal household work burden.
Many regions have experienced a decline in female labour force participation, including China, East Asia etc. South Asia has one of the lowest rates. (Figure 2)
In China, female labour force participation has been declining since 1990. However, a study shows a longer work-day for women compared to men. In India, there has also been declining female labour force participation. A study (using a 1999 time-use survey India), finds a gap in the division of labour of 266 minutes per day.
C) Decline in fertility
Fertility rates are now becoming below replacement rates in many countries. The cost of this decline in fertility affects these countries, not only in economic terms but the reproduction/survival of society. Challenges ahead of us: women are going to face increasing demand for childcare and eldercare. Within our lifetime, the number of older people as a percentage will outgrow the number of children. In the EU, women are providing daily care to adults for 29-30 hours per week.
Paid care work and unpaid care needs to be more visible, we need to acknowledge its important contribution.The care sector contributes to human well-being: reproduces labor and contributes to human capital formation, by taking care of childrens health, nutrition, education and overall upbringing. We need to measure the amount of unpaid care work performed by women and take them into account in policy design and analyses.
Social science discipline
Economics is a long-standing social science discipline. So why does it need a gender lens Economics is also a social construct - it is humanly constructed. Economics is based on deeply ingrained practices in way of knowing and theorising. Well-known economists emphasise economics as being positivist, precise, rational etc. This group of individuals (predominantly men) reflect the way they have come to think about economic life. It reflects the social construction of what is the economy' There is an emphasis on individual autonomy.
Feminist scholarship has had a profound impact on many disciplines. We owe a great deal from other disciplines and feminist scholars. I am privileged to be a part of that journey, with a group of economists and gender scholars. Now we are re-examining what economics is about. It is not just the experience of men in the private sphere, but women in the household, in agriculture, labour markets etc. It recognises gender analysis as important in understanding more comprehensively and more rigorously.
Gender Analysis in Economics introduces new measures: e.g. gender sensitive data collection methods, gender equality indicators, importance of qualitative methodologies (to understand social contexts, traditions etc. and experiences of women and men as social groups) etc.
I have a very optimistic view of what lies ahead for Gender Analysis in Economics at University of Peradeniya. I encourage you to take advantage of this programme.
(The PGIHS will be launching historic postgraduate programme in gender analysis of economics shortly. Directed by the academics from the Department of Economics and Statistics, the University will offer postgraduate courses in Gender Analysis in Economics, a first for Sri Lanka. Stakeholders from a range of sectors participated in the workshop, including academics, public sector officials, private sector representatives and women's rights activists and practitioners. The objective of the workshop was to generate awareness, gather feedback and facilitate future networking opportunities.)

widening Horizons
The English Language Teaching Unit (ELTU) of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura was established concurrently with the first ever faculty Faculty of Arts of the Vidoydaya University in 1958. Having realized the importance of English in higher education, the founder of the university, Ven. Walivitiye Soratha Thera made English a compulsory language for undergraduates.
It is remarkable that when the University celebrates the 60th Anniversary in 2018, the ELTU was bestowed the Departmental status under the headship of Sarath Ananda. At present, the Department of English Language Teaching (DELT) is in charge of improving the English language proficiency of students in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Applied Sciences, the Faculty of Technology and the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Initially, a two-year English language programme was offered to the students of the Faculty of Arts. Different individuals including heads of the unit have contributed to the progress of the ELTU in the past. Senior Professor Rajiva Wijesinhas role and the role played by Parvathi Nagasundaram in the development of English in the University of Sri Jayewardenepura cannot be overlooked. They rendered a great service to develop the English language teaching in the university.
Lack of interaction
The number one challenge for the undergraduates of Sri Lanka, particularly the undergraduates of humanities and social sciences faculties of Sri Lankan universities is the English skill. One of the reasons for this is that English is mostly taught as a subject, not as a real-world language. When English is taught as a subject, students just come and listen to the teacher, write down the note and leave the classroom. No interaction takes place. To learn a language, one has to see the value of it, hear it in the day to day situations and use it as he or she can.
The Department of English Language Teaching (DELT) of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura has taken initiatives to shift the paradigm and teach English as a real-world language that is used for day to day communication. Having realized this problem, Madhubashini Disanayaka Rathnayaka who became the Head of the ELTU in 2013, a new course was introduced to the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences giving an unprecedented amount of time for input in English for first-year students i.e.300 hours per year and for the first time, the course was made a credit-bearing course. In this course, students have compulsory English from 8.00 a.m.  10.00 a.m. every weekday.
The course was introduced with several objectives in mind. The overall objective of this programme was to enhance students knowledge of English through the development of their reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. Consequently, students confidence to use the language competently is heightened eliminating any hesitation or fear towards English. This is approached through the integration of a variety of exciting group-based activities such as drama, singing, library sessions, poster presentations, PowerPoint presentation, learning management systems (LMS) etc. In addition to the traditional face to face teaching, learning and assessment methods, the DELT uses modern technology such as blended learning in the process of language learning and assessment. In the DELT, students are expected to come and watch the news on BBC or CNN and report the main ideas to the class the next day. The development of teamwork, leadership, decision making, time management, organization skills, confidence building, planning and presentation skills which can be identified as key characteristics to be employed in present day world are all involved in these group-based activities.
Sound knowledge
The students who successfully complete the compulsory English programme are expected to have gained a sound knowledge of the structures of the English language as well as be competent in communicating in English. Thus, they will be more desirable candidates for the corporate sector.
The course was further developed under the leadership of the outgoing head, Sarath Ananda with the support of a group of versatile teaching staff consisting of eight permanent lecturers and more than 25 visiting lecturers all with postgraduate qualifications in teaching English as a second language. The DELT also has a dedicated team of non-academic staff.
The DELT offers English proficiency courses to the students of the Faculty of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Technology too. These courses are geared to help students deal with any language problem they come across when they follow their courses in the English medium in their respective Faculties.
In addition to the compulsory English programme, the DELT offers an optional certificate course in English for the second year students of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. The plans are underway to introduce a Diploma in English for those who successfully complete this Certificate Course in English thus enabling the students of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura to graduate with a Degree in a discipline they desire along with a Diploma in English.
The Department extends its further services to the external students who cannot enter the university and offers a highly successful weekend Certificate Course in English and a Diploma Course in English to school leavers, public officers and private sector individuals.
Leadership andmanagement
English Language Society (ELS) of the DELT is a student body mainly run by the first year students of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. Its members are interested in popularizing the English language among the members through communication, creativity, leadership and management. Hence, the members organize various activities and projects to showcase the ability and the skills of the members. The English Day is organized annually by the first year students of the English Language Society. The objective of these events is to create a platform for the students to use English in more or less in a natural manner.
The Department of English Language Teaching celebrated the transition of becoming a Department under my present leadership recently.
The ultimate objective of the DELT is to give all the students a fair chance to compete with everyone out there in the job market by providing students of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura with the ability to function in English in day-to-day situations, developing confidence in the students with regard to using English. Therefore, the DELT of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura extends its fullest cooperation to produce a global graduate who can successfully meet the global challenges using an excellent command of English while being proud of his or her own culture and language.
