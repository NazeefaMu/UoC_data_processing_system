<U+200B>Government has not changed stance on LNG: Dayasiri
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the government has not changed its stance on liquefied natural gas (LNG), and they would review the coal power plant project in case of a crisis, with the recommendation of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
As we have been informed that there would be a coal crisis between 2018 and 2020, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe suggested that we should seek the PUCs advice on what needs to be done in order to overcome it, he said.
Minister Jayasekara said that they support LNG compared to the establishment of a coal power plant, at a Cabinet press conference, yesterday.The Prime Minister also said that with the recommendations of the PUC, proper legal measures would be taken and there is no need to change the governments stance on LNG, he said.
He added that the decision to rely less on coal was taken following a proposal made by the PUC.So far, all measures taken to establish LNG plants were unsuccessful. Therefore, we need to review <U+200B>on what <U+200B>could be done to combat the crisis, he said.
Meanwhile, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that no coal is the stance of the government.

Economy trending  in right direction
Supported by the proactive stabilisation policy measures adopted by the Central Bank and the government, it was possible to move steadily towards achieving overall stability of the economy, opined Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy presenting the eleventh Road Map of the Central Bank yesterday, in Colombo.
But we do not want to be complacent with the achievements so far, and we acknowledge that several challenges continue to weigh down on the overall macroeconomic performance of the country. Therefore, we need to work hard in order to restore the stability of the economy on a permanent basis to create an enabling environment to raise the living standards of our people, and we believe that the policies outlined in the Road Map will help us in this endeavour, he said.
The Governor said the economy required broad-based reforms and commitment to enhance the countrys growth potential if the country was to become an enriched nation as envisaged in the governments vision.
As the agent for macroeconomic stability, the Central Bank will always work hand in hand with the government to enhance economic growth through maintaining low and stable inflation and ensuring financial system stability. We would also like to note that we will be prepared to introduce new policies and measures not in the Road Map, as warranted by dynamic macroeconomic conditions and market developments. This flexibility is necessary in a world of elevated risks and uncertainties as well as rapid changes.
Apart from inclement weather conditions, the tight monetary policy stance of the Central Bank as well as the relatively tight fiscal policy stance of the government, which were adopted with the aim of regaining macroeconomic stability, partly affected public and private investment spending that also contributed to low economic growth. Consumer price inflation increased mainly due to high food prices associated with weather-related domestic supply disruptions, revisions to indirect taxes and increased prices of imported commodities, making our efforts to anchor inflation expectations challenging.
Despite these challenges, 2017 was a year when we made significant progress on many fronts through several policy measures taken by the Central Bank in coordination with the government. In response to these measures, macroeconomic stability is being restored and our economy is trending in the right direction. The Central Bank has implemented several proactive policy measures during 2017 in order to achieve the core objectives of maintaining economic and price stability and financial system stability. Three frameworks have been put in place to improve the countrys overall macroeconomic conditions covering monetary policy, inflation and the exchange rate.
The Governor expressed optimism that the government would continue its fiscal consolidation measures in 2018, which will support the Central Bank to pursue its policies towards macroeconomic stability.

MR can inform not to use his image in SLFP campaign
Since former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is still a member and patron of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), if he does not like his image being used in the SLFP campaign, he can inform the party not to use it on posters and cutouts at the upcoming local government polls, Co-Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday.
He said that normally, SLFP publishes posters and cutouts with images of the present President, former Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga, and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The UNP also uses the images of former Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake onwards for their cutouts and posters.
However, we wonder why the image of Prof. G. L. Peiris is not being used by the SLPP party, although he is the leader of that party, he added.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is retired now and questioned as to why his image is still being used in cutouts and posters of the SLPP instead of using its leader Prof. Pieriss image.

2017 safest year for air travel
The Aviation Safety Network recently released the 2017 airliner accident statistics showing an extremely low total of 10 fatal airliner accidents, resulting in 44 fatalities.
The year 2017 turned out to be the safest year ever for commercial aviation, Aviation Safety Network data show.
Over the year 2017 the Aviation Safety Network recorded a total of 10 fatal airliner accidents [1], resulting in 44 occupant fatalities and 35 persons on the ground. This makes 2017 the safest year ever, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of fatalities. In 2016 ASN recorded 16 accidents and 303 lives lost.
Five accidents involved cargo flights, five were passenger flights. Given the expected worldwide air traffic of about 36,800,000 flights, the accident rate is one fatal passenger flight accident per 7,360,000 flights.
The low number of accidents comes as no surprise, according to ASN President Harro Ranter: Since 1997 the average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline, for a great deal thanks to the continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organisations such as ICAO, IATA, Flight Safety Foundation and the aviation industry.
On December 31, aviation had a record period of 398 days with no passenger jet airliner accidents. Additionally, a record period of 792 days passed since the previous civil aircraft accident claiming over 100 lives [2].
One out of 10 accident airplanes was operated by an airline on the E.U. blacklist.
Statistics are based on all worldwide fatal commercial aircraft accidents (passenger and cargo flights) involving civil aircraft of which the basic model has been certified for carrying 14 or more passengers. Consequently, the June 7 accident involving a Myanmar Air Force Y-8F transport plane that killed 122 is not included.

2018 Budget encourages  foreigners to buy property  in Sri Lanka  Lamudi
Lamudi a global property portal focusing exclusively on emerging markets says that recent budget proposals were very positive and it would bring in more investments to Sri Lanka.
We believe that some of the most exciting changes came in the form of concessions from the government. Some of which were long requested by experts in various local and foreign owned industries.
Lamudi believes that some of the most exciting changes came in the form of concessions from the government.
Some of which were long requested by experts in various local and foreign owned industries. For example, the abolition of the restrictions on the foreign ownership of shipping and freight forwarding agencies is expected to have a considerable effect on Sri Lankas import export sector.
Nevertheless, the latest 2018 budget also comes with a few surprises for the countrys real estate industry. Some of the implementations includes, restrictions limiting land ownership rights of listed companies with foreign owners to be removed. VAT refund scheme to be implemented for foreign passport holders from 1st May 2018 and also allowing foreigners to buy property freehold within condominium developments.
While not directly related, the new rules that will see tourism service providers registering with the Sri Lanka Tourism Board, in an attempt to bring this fast-growing industry under the governments broader tax policy, was received with mixed results. While it is considered as a progressive step by some industry professionals, it is also seen with skepticism by others.
That said, the new budget has also offered a few surprisingly good and highly anticipated concessions for Sri Lanka's property market. By far the best of them all is the removal of pre-existing restrictions.
By removing this limitation, the government essentially eliminated one of the biggest obstacles that affected foreign investors from buying property in Sri Lanka. This will have an undeniable long term effect on the countrys economy, where foreign investors are now far more likely to invest within Sri Lanka than ever before.
But this is not all; the governments 2018 budget has also finally allowed foreigners to purchase freehold property in condominium developments, without the previous restriction that only allowed them to buy condominium units from the fourth floor or above. As a result, this allows Sri Lankan expats and their children who do not have the countrys citizenship to purchase a residential property and will also allow foreign investors who wish to invest in Sri Lanka, to carry out their businesses while residing within the country.
Apart from these highly anticipated proposals, there were also a number of progressive grants, such as a new VAT refund scheme for foreign passport holders at airports and seaports (to be effective from May 1, 2018) as well as fund allocations for massive infrastructure development programs.
This includes the allocation of Rs. 10,000 million for the construction of expressways and Rs. 17,000 million for the development of the countrys major regions that includes Kandy, Anuradhapura, Galle and Jaffna, which will undoubtedly have a positive effect on Sri Lanka's real estate industry in the long term.

Army Chief does some plain speaking
Army Commander Lt. Gen Mahesh Senanayake has stressed on the importance of differentiating between the true war hero and a murderer. Perhaps the vernacular version of his remark made to the Sinhala Service of the BBC would be better nuanced and drive the point home. Responding to the interviewer Lt.Gen. Senanayake said api ranaviruvage saha minimaruvage venasa vataha gatha yuthui. He said the army was prepared to investigate any allegation of war crimes by his men and there was no need to sweep anything under the carpet. They should not fear anything and if any specific charges are brought there is no reason why these should not be looked into, he said. Lt. Gen Senanayake also stated that it was regrettable that the term war hero was used loosely these days and even those seen on roadsides are classed as war heroes.
The Army Chief's remarks comes at a time when the arrest of security forces personnel for abductions and other human rights violations have raised a furor among Joint Opposition politicians and Bikkhus allied to the Rajapaksas. Perhaps, the Army Commander's assertion would allow the public to come to their own conclusions with regard to this song and dance made by JO politicians over the arrest of forces personnel. We say this because Lt. Gen. Senanayake had commanded troops in the North during the height of the war and he has no reason to betray his men out of hand, as the JO is giving character certificates to those members of the forces arrested, out of hand. Lt. Gen. Senanayake is not the only one who has hinted of the possibility of atrocities committed by members of the forces.
There is Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who had specifically named a former Army Commander as having a direct hand in certain incidents and wanted these investigated. Sarath Fonseka, it could be assumed, being a government politician, is answering critics of the regime who accuse it of carrying out a witch-hunt against members of the security forces. But the present Army Chief has no political stake in the matter and may sound credible for this reason. By the same token he cannot also be blind to the fact that the arrest of forces personnel could not have been without basis and the arrests are been exploited by Opposition politicians for political gain. Else they could have protested more vociferously against the incarceration of war winning Commander Sarath Fonseka who was unceremoniously dragged away and thrown behind bars. Where were these patriots and great defenders of the war heroes then, one may ask
The Army Commander's remark that the term war hero was being used haphazardly and those seen on the streets too have been attached the same honorific, no doubt, is pregnant with meaning. His remark cannot be anything but a reference to those who directed the war from their air-conditioned rooms and has been tagged war hero, or, those participating in street protests at the behest of opposition politicians. True, those directing the war, away from the battlefield, may have been responsible for strategising and drawing up battle plans and the tag war hero could not be termed undeserving in their case. But taking to the streets to further the political agendas of others, certainly does not do credit to the army and those involved cannot be described as war heroes but as mere pawns in a political game.
The Army Chief could not be faulted for taking a dim view of such conduct on the part of his former charges which only brought shame on all combatants and more so, the genuine war heroes.
It is time the JO stop using the ranaviruvas in their political games and bring dishonour to the army. The JO has even used disabled soldiers as candidates in their LG elections. Here, on the one hand they are shouting hoarse urging the public to elect dynamic and energetic youth to serve the villages and on the other hand forwarding disabled soldiers for this task. This alone exposes the shameless manner in which the JO is preying on the emotions of the public and using the war hero card to win votes.
Be that as it may, it goes without saying that the law cannot be applied selectively. There cannot be one law for war heroes and another for the ordinary citizens. The media is full of accounts of serious crimes committed by former members of the security forces, such as murder, rape and robbery. The JO is weeping buckets for former Navy Commodore D. P. K. Dassanayake who had allegedly been involved in the abduction of Tamil youth for ransom. They want him released from detention and have charged the government with pandering to the Tamil Diaspora, in continuing to hold him. These same actors were very much in the political scene when Fonseka was jailed for a much lesser offence. But we didn't hear even a whimper from the likes of Udaya Gammanpila or Rear Admiral (Rtd.) Sarath Wijesekera who is today busy shuttling between Colombo and Geneva to espouse the cause of war heroes. Can there ever be a more hypocritical duo

New Zealand regained the top rank in the ICC rankings for teams in T20Is after beating West Indies in the two-match T20I series.
The Black Caps completed a 2-0 series win over West Indies as they won the second match of the series by 119 runs in Mount Maunganui. After the series win, New Zealand gained two places and jumped to top spot from third position.
Pakistan were the number one ranked team in the world before this series followed by India. Pakistan had 124 points and India had 121 points. New Zealand, before this series, had 120 points.
New Zealand moved to second spot in the rankings when they won the first T20I by 47 runs. They would have moved to top rank by winning the second match by it was abandoned after rain. They finally moved ahead of Pakistan by clinching the final T20I.
The loss has affected West Indies severly and they have dropped to number five position with 115 points. They earlier had 120 points. New Zealand now have 126 points at the top.
This is not the first time that New Zealand are at the top of the rankings. In October 2017, they were number one but lost that spot after losing the T20I series against India 2-1 in November.

## Title: The Brokpa Yaks - A dying breed

The Brokpa Yaks - A dying breed
Yaks extensive presence in the snow-clad alpine and subalpine Himalayas makes the landscape look like a crumpled white sheet punctuated with shaggy black dots. And, in the cradle of these mountains, depending entirely on yak produce  milk, fur, skin, dung, and meat  pastoral communities like the Brokpa, a semi-nomadic tribe belonging to the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh that borders China, Bhutan, and Tibet, have thrived. But these totemic animals of the Himalayas and their Brokpa herders are increasingly being affected by climate change  and this has forced them to change their traditional ways of being.
Yaks live at altitudes of 2,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level and are comfortable at an average temperature below 10 degrees Celsius. A flagship species for the high rangeland ecosystem of the Himalayas, they are cold-adaptive and are rightly dubbed shaggy barometers of climate change. Temperature-driven shifts in wild yak grazing ranges and distribution patterns in the Tibetan Plateau, as well as changes observed in the Brokpa yak pastoral practices, are indicators of a changing climate in high Asia, researchers contend.
Temperatures are rising in the Himalayan yak range, with a projected mean annual temperature increase of between 2.2 and 3.3 degrees C by 2050. A University of Wisconsin-Madison study in 2014 found that in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, daily low temperatures have increased in the past 24 years, and daily high temperatures have increased at a rate of 5 degrees C over a period of 100 years.
The Brokpa yak pastoralists are facing multiple challenges like temperature rise, degradation of high-altitude pastures, dwindling of the pure yak population, and a gradually shortening winter, said Indias National Yak Research Centres Sanjit Maiti, who studied Bropka herders traditional strategies of coping with changing climatic conditions. Theyre responding to the changes in climate by modifying their transhumant yak herding practices.
According to Maiti, Brokpa climate adaptation strategies include the proliferation of yak-cattle hybridization, migration to higher altitudes, herd diversification, changes in the migration calendar, changes in pasture utilization practices and the rejuvenation of degraded high altitude pastures, feed supplementation, and adoption of modern healthcare.
Adjusting to a changing climate
Sixty-five-year-old Brokpa Phurpa Saiya of Mandla Phudung Village in Arunachal Pradesh has been living the life of a transhumant yak rearer (meaning he follows a seasonal migration pattern from lowlands to mountains) since he was barely ten. He now owns 45 yaks and dzomos, a hybrid of yak and highland cattle called kot. His grandfather Brokpa Tsering was from Monyul  in the Tawang region of Arunachal Pradesh  and he too was a yak pastoralist.
Like other Brokpas, Phurpa also starts his summer hike along with his herd of yaks and sheep in April, as snow starts to melt, baring the high-altitude meadows on which the herd feed. His final destination is Saiya, a grazing range at around 4,500 meters above sea level (masl) on Arunachal Pradesh-Bhutan border. Phurpas transitory life continues throughout the summer till late November when, with the onset of winter, he descends back to Mandla Phudung. In the winter, Brokpa yak rearers stay in their permanent settlement area at an altitude around 2,000 masl to 3,000 masl.
Earlier we used to embark on the upward journey in late May or early June. But now you cant do that, he explains. The yaks start feeling uncomfortable as early as late February because of the heat. The summer has extended and the temperature risen.
Phurpa says the period of migration has extended by one and a half months in recent years because winter has shortened. Also, according to Phurpa, fodder along the route to Saiya has declined over the years, including Paisang leaves (Quercus Griffithii), yaks favourite winter food.
Brokpa Lobsang, another yak rearer from Arunachal Pradeshs Tawang district, is allowing the proliferation of yak-cattle hybrids, as hybrids like dzomo are more heat-resistant and can better adapt to lower altitudes and rising temperatures. But the problem is, says Lobsang, if the calf is a dzo or a male born out of a male yak and a female Kot, its useless. A dzo is sterile and cant be used as a bull for breeding purposes.
Lobsang, nevertheless, plans to shift entirely to yak-cattle hybrids in case climate difficulties soar. Phurpa, on the other hand, says nothing can be like pure yaks. To me yaks are more than animals. Brokpa identity is based on yaks. A Brokpa must own yak no matter what. Dzomos can only give you milk. He is ready to migrate to higher altitudes for his yaks comfort rather than opting for hybridization. Yaks in the wild have also been affected by climate change. Mother yaks are more vulnerable to climate change affects, Wildlife Conservation Society and University of Montana researcher Dr. Joel Berger told ScienceDaily, as they are likely to climb steeper and steeper terrain in search of snow, which is essential for milk production.
Climatic change or political barriers
However, the biggest problem Phurpas yak herd is facing at present is inbreeding  not climate change. In fact, all yaks outside the pure yak region, now in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) of China, are thought to be suffering from inbreeding due to the lack of availability of new yak germplasm from the original yak area during the past few decades, and the resultant practice of prolonged use of the same bull within herds, notes a 2016 report by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).
The wild pure breed yak population is estimated at no more than 10,000 to 15,000 individuals, of which nearly the entirety is in China-controlled Tibet, where border controls are strict. The free-crossing of yaks and their herders has thus been restricted. Worse still, yak herds usually have very few males  they tend to live in isolation outside the mating season. And the blocking of yak traffic with the pure yak region has caused a serious paucity of yak males outside Tibet when it comes time to mate.

CA Sri Lanka holds  first research conference
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) held its first ever research conference on December 20, where corporate governance, sustainability assurance and forensic accounting which are deemed extremely relevant and important to the accounting profession in the current context was discussed and deliberated at length.
The research conference was held under the patronage of Professor Sampath Amaratunge, Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, who was the keynote speaker, while Professor Hitoshi Takehara, Associate Dean of the Waseda Business School of the Waseda University  Tokyo, Japan, was the guest of honour.
The one-day conference also saw the launch of the institutes inaugural journal of applied research, where six research papers penned by academics attached to leading universities in Sri Lanka and overseas gave their insights on corporate governance, sustainability assurance and forensic accounting.
Speaking at the conference, CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that the accounting profession has faced significant change over the past ten years, and the most major changes that the accounting profession witnessed was the technological revolution, globalization of reporting and disclosure standards, and the complex regulatory compliance reporting requirements, all which has contributed to far more complexities in the way accounting professionals have to do business.
In the midst of increasing challenges and complexities for our profession and professionals, we believe it is increasingly important for professional bodies such as CA Sri Lanka to be at the helm in not only educating our stakeholders on these changes, but also equipping all stakeholders with the necessary knowledge and other requirements to ensure our members can continue to not only be in demand globally, but will also have the necessary knowledge and competence so they can carry out their professional duties as per the latest local and international trends, and regulations, he said.
Wickremasinghe said that since he assumed duties as President of the institute in January 2016, he has paid special attention to the importance of research, so that the accounting profession and its members can be aware of the constant changes, which will help them remain relevant both locally and globally no matter what challenges they face.
He said that the research conference and the journal was part of a larger programme mooted by the institute. We have brought together universities, as well as academics and professionals as part of a research support facility where topics in relation to accounting and auditing will be focused upon at length, he added.
During the conference, Nilupul Weerasinghe, Harshani Senanayake and Sakura De Silva attached to the School of Accounting and Business of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka made presentations on corporate governance, while Dr. Sunil Dahanayake of the Department of Accounting of the United Arab Emirates University and Professor Samanthi Senaratne of the Department of Accounting of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura made presentations on sustainability assurance (plantation sector).
The third session of the conference which focused on forensic accounting education was presented by Lakmali Priyangika, Director of Beyond Business (Pvt) Ltd and Seshani Gunathilake, from the Department of Accounting of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.

CB forecasts 6-7% growth in next two years
The next two years could see growth picking up to 6-7%, predicted Central Bank (CB) Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy, addressing a media gathering yesterday, in Colombo.
If the stabilization of the economy continues and the measures put in force in the budget signals that policymaking going forward is going to be more predictable and consistent in the next year or two, there would be a difference.
Apart from the Hambantota Port project, if the plans for Trincomalee and Kandy and highways, megapolis development, etc, gather momentum, one possible scenario is that with greater macroeconomic stability, more consistent and predictable policymaking by the government will result in more domestic investment picking up in the next 12-18 months.
Then the major developments programmes of the government may start having an impact in 12-18 months down the line; so in these two years the economy could see its growth picking up to 6-7% if those things are in place, he said.
On the Golden Key issue, the Central Bank was not for bail out those people, that was a government decision, he said.
The Governor said in 2017 there was a surplus in the primary account and a deficit in the current account. This year he anticipated that there will be a small surplus in both current and primary accounts.
He said ancillary service programmes were not a part of the co-functions of the Central Bank. But the Central Bank has been performing these functions very well.
The flexible inflation targeting regime will be fully implemented by 2020 and they were reviewing all the major Acts such as the Monetary Act, Banking Act, the Finance Business Act.
The Liability Management Act will be tabled in Parliament very soon, he said.
It was not necessarily needed to loosen the monetary policy to achieve the growth which is below the 6% potential and going by 4% now, said Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe Senior Deputy Governor.
There is a gradual easing of interest rates in the market and with that the potential growth is much lower and the Central Banks forecast with current policy is a growth of 5.5% and if that is not realized the Central Bank would have to take counter actions in the future.
Similarly there was no necessity to tighten the monetary policy right now, he said.
Dr Weerasinghe said a new series of coins will be released to the market soon in the form of Rs 10, 5, 2 and one.
C J P Siriwardena, Deputy Governor, said there will be Rs 2.5 bn sovereign bond maturities this year and if necessary they will go up to Rs 3 bn to collect the balance Rs 500 million to finance the budget expenditure.
However, he noted that this year there was no international sovereign bond (ISB) maturities but there is about Rs 600 million interest payment for the existing sovereign bonds.
Currently, there are 50 non-banking financial institutions and out of the 50, five are in distress situation and they had different plans for these five distressed institutions which has been submitted to the monetary board and received approval and one has been identified for liquidation, Siriwardena said.
Currently, the minimum capital requirement is Rs 400 million and from Tuesday onwards it has been increased to Rs one billion. A stronger regulatory framework to govern these institutes will be introduced, he said.
Siriwardena said the debt service payment liability in 2018 was Rs 1.9 trillion. Out of this Rs 800 bn will be going for interest payments.
K D Ranasinghe, Deputy Governor, said the large part of EPF investment would be in Government Securities in 2018, which will be about 90%. They will also invest in corporate bonds that will be coming into the market.

Chocolate may go extinct in 40 years!
According to a new study, the Cacao plant is slated to disappear as early as 2050 thanks to warmer temperatures and more arid weather conditions.
Scientists from the University of California are teaming up with Mars company to try and save the crop before it is too late. Researchers are exploring the possibility of using gene-editing technology called CRISPR to make crops that survive the new weather challenges.
According to an article published in The Independent, it is mentioned that Myeong-Je Cho, the director of plant genomics at an institute that is working closely with Mars, is working towards creating a more resistant version of cacao plants that will survive, and thrive in dryer, warmer climates.
According to Cho, this is possible with the help of a new technology called CRISPR, which allows for tiny tweaks in the DNA which will make the crops cheaper and more reliable.
Cacao plants can only grow within a narrow strip of rainforested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the equator, where temperature, rain, and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year. Over half of the worlds chocolate now comes from just two countries in West Africa -Cte dIvoire and Ghana.
But those areas wont be suitable for chocolate in the next few decades. By 2050, rising temperatures will push todays chocolate-growing regions more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain -much of which is currently preserved for wildlife, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Mars, the $35 billion corporation best known for Snickers, is aware of these problems and others presented by climate change and subsequently, in September, pledged $1 billion as part of an effort called Sustainability in a Generation, which aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its business and supply chain by more than 60 per cent by 2050.

The poster menace
The removal of election posters that deface walls costs the state millions of rupees. Police stations are compelled to hire labour for the removal of posters and cut-outs.
It is not only politicians who are guilty of this. The private tuition mudalalies are equally responsible. The inability of the government to curb this illegal activity shows not only the inefficiency of the enforcement authorities but the lack of political will to eradicate this practice.
Over the past several decades Elections Commissioners have drilled into the heads of candidates to refrain from mounting cut-outs and pasting posters on walls. But candidates, even political pups do not appear to care two hoots for the instructions of the Elections Commissioner and the law.
Candidates who do not respect the laws of the country have no moral right to become lawmakers. These scum of society who contest elections openly defy laws to impress the voters.
They want to show their rowdy supporters, the Kasippu, Kudu and underworld types that they can even order the police to ignore their unlawful activities.
All political parties have the greatest regard for their poster boys. They belong to the underworld and they are the unofficial body guards of the politicos. To keep these rascals going posters are essential. No wonder, the poster menace continues.
Make the display of cut-outs and posters unseatable election offenses; the printing of posters an offence; and the possession and transport of posters offences.
It is surprising indeed that the forthright Chairman of the Elections Commission has not thus far called for these reforms!

Commercial Bank adopts vocational training as CSR project
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced the adoption of vocational training for school leavers as the next community cause it will champion on a national scale, in a logical progression of its commitments to computer literacy and online education.
Recognising the need to provide viable employment options to the many thousands of students that do not progress to higher education in Sri Lanka each year, as well as the growing dearth of trained artisans in the labour force, the Bank will work with the Ministry of Education and private sector partners to advocate the dignity of skilled labour and provide opportunities for training and placement.
In pursuance of this, the CSR Trust of Commercial Bank has already launched a pilot vocational training programme in six schools in collaboration with the Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET).
The Bank has established Career Guidance Units in the six schools to advise and guide students in grades ten and eleven and also to students in the advanced level technical stream to understand the importance and benefits of acquiring a vocational skill.
The programme will also address the stigma attached to selecting an occupation that involves a skill through seminars and other activities that promote awareness, the Bank said.
This is an effort not only to widen the career opportunities available for students who do not succeed at the GCE Ordinary or Advanced level examinations, but also to help mitigate the crippling labour shortage prevalent in the job market especially in the construction industry, despite unemployment rates in the country standing at 4.5 percent at the close of 2016, the Bank added.
Commenting on the launch of this programme, Commercial Bank Managing Director Jegan Durairatnam said: Increasingly, students that do not qualify for tertiary or higher education seem to be taking up jobs in the unskilled labour market or selecting vocations that are below their potential. This situation does not help them or the country, especially in the context of macro level productivity.
He said many young Sri Lankans choose low-paying office jobs over better remunerated opportunities in masonry, carpentry, plumbing and welding. We will try to change this through this vocational training programme, and help create a body of skilled workers ready to take on the construction industry which is in dire need of skilled construction technicians, Durairatnam said.
The Ministry of Education has granted Commercial Bank permission to set up Career Guidance Units in the six schools chosen for the pilot programme and students interested in vocational training will be taken on visits to technical colleges where they can learn about the study programmes and potential employment opportunities upon completion.
The responsibility of these schools, along with the teachers in charge of the Career Guidance Units is primarily to guide students who have middle to low potential of being successful at GCE Ordinary Level examination into vocational training.
The schools chosen for the pilot programme are Divulankadawala Maha Vidyalaya, Hingurakgoda; Siddhartha M.V. Anuradhapura; Vidyadarshi Maha Vidyalaya, Nochchiyagama; C W W Kannangara Central College  Mathugama, D S Senanayake Central College, Kurunegala; and Parakum Maha Vidyalaya, Vavuniya.The Bank said it expects to set up similar Career Guidance Units at more schools in the next three to five years.
Students from these schools will be introduced to vocational training programmes conducted at affiliated Technical Colleges and Colleges of Technology in Anuradhapura, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa and Vavuniya.
The Banks online educational portal Sipnena will also play a key role in this with content specifically developed for vocational training.
Additionally, the Bank has appointed third year undergraduates in the Service Learning Group at the University of Colombo to visit the six schools and provide information on available training programmes.
As an extension of this pilot vocational training programme, Access Engineering PLC has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Commercial Bank to provide assistance to students who select courses on masonry, carpentry, welding, electricity and air conditioning conducted by DTET.
Under this agreement, Access Engineering will afford a fair opportunity to student candidates from the selected six schools to join the work force of its organisation, should they successfully complete courses at the DTET.
The company will also permit Headstart (Pvt) Ltd., the company that owns the Guru.lk online learning portal and a partner to Commercial Banks own online educational portal Sipnena, to create motivational videos for students shot at Access Engineering sites.
As a result of this collaboration, students will stand a chance of being recruited by Access Engineering at a starting salary of approximately Rs. 40,000, the Bank said.
As part of the programme, the Banks CSR Trust also hopes to improve the occupational English literacy of those who seek foreign employment, enabling them to earn a higher remuneration. Headstart (Pvt) Ltd. will develop an occupational English learning mobile application to help interested parties master specific vocabulary.
Sri Lanka was left with a massive reconstruction task at the end of the conflict in 2009 and consequently annual investments in new homes, roads and ports hovered at around Rs 600 billion (US$ 4 billion) in recent years.
In 2017, this expenditure is expected to triple upto US$ 11.6 billion. This situation calls for about 400,000 new construction workers.
However, the push to recruit skilled construction technicians from Sri Lanka for this sector has suffered due to a cultural stigma surrounding blue-collar labour. The vocational training programme could help bridge this gap and create skilled employees locally, the Bank said.
The CSR Trust of the Commercial Bank has donated IT labs to 175 needy schools across Sri Lanka under one of its flagship community initiatives.
The Trusts education-related community projects also include its involvement in the Smart Schools Project that has enabled digital learning in 65 schools in the Western Province.

It was under the Good Governance government that the identity of the Sri Lanka Police was restored to maintain the law and order in the country, said Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara, yesterday.
The main change made to the Police under the Good Governance government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was to take the Police Department out of the Defence Ministry and set it up as the Sri Lanka Police. The Police changed its usual cause and was assigned to maintain the law and order in the country, the IGP said.
He made these observations yesterday morning, during a ceremony held to mark the assuming of duties of the newly sworn-in Law and Order and Southern Development State Minister Piyasena Gamage, which was held at the Ministry premises in Suhurupaya.
IGP Jayasundara further said that after the three-decade curse of conflict in the country, the people wish for peace, and the Police has a significant role in fulfilling the peoples aspiration. He added that the Police, with no doubt, expect that the assistance given by the President, the Premier, and Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake, would be further strengthened with the assuming of duties of State Minister Gamage.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama, Provincial Councilor Randima Gamage, and Law and Order and Southern Development State Ministry Secretary Pathmasiri Jayamanna also participated the event.

Document awaiting action
The dawn of the New Year saw several crucial political developments occurring this week. As a result of this, battle lines are being clearly demarcated between major political parties, their initial target being the local government elections that have been scheduled for early February.
Arguably the most critical of the events that occurred this week was the handing over of the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank bonds by its commissioners, Supreme Court Justice K T Chithrasiri, Supreme Court Justice Prasanna Jayewardena and Retired Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai to President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday.
The Commission was appointed by President Sirisena to conduct an inquiry into the issuance of Central Bank bonds that took place during the time period of February 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016. The tenure of the Commission was extended several times. Its final extension was until December 31, 2017.
At the time of writing, the voluminous 1400-page report, which incorporates over 100 annexures including evidence given by 70 witnesses, has not been made public but there have been several requests to the President to do so.
Opposition parties
These requests have been made not only by opposition parties such as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) but also from Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ministers within the National Unity government which is a coalition between the SLFP and the United National Party (UNP).
While the President was to make a public statement on the issue yesterday (Wednesday), the most likely outcome was a referral of the report to the Attorney General who could then decide on what actions, if any, need to be taken. In the meantime, the big bone of contention was whether the report would be made public.
Already, the JVP has been in the forefront in making the demand for publication of the report. JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a news conference that the President was duty bound to implement the recommendations proposed by the Commission and take action against those implicated by forwarding the report to the Attorney General.
It is the Presidents responsibility to present the report to the people because they have a right to know how so much of public funds had been misappropriated and about those involved, Dissanayake said and added that the JVP would be making a formal request for a copy of the report under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
While there is justification in the JVPs claims, its motives are clear: to gain a political advantage for the upcoming local government election. While they may not say so publicly, several SLFP ministers are known to have suggested to the President that releasing the report would be politically advantageous for the SLFP at the poll, especially given the divisions within the party.
This is because those likely to be involved in the Central Bank bond issue are mostly UNP ministers and parliamentarians. Evidence led before the Commission revealed many of them had telephone conversations with those at the centre of the controversy. It also led to the resignation of high-profile UNPer and former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake who admitted to living in an apartment for which the rent was paid for by Arjun Aloysius, a key figure in the alleged scam.
Local government polls
By releasing the report, it is possible for the President to take the moral high ground and state that it was he who unearthed corruption in this government and take credit for this, thereby framing the mainstream SLFP as the cleaner, transparent party in the ruling coalition.
That would of course be detrimental to the UNP but it would also take the wind out of the Joint Opposition (JO)s sails as they reorganise themselves as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) for the local government polls. The JO is accusing the current government of corruption but many of its own leaders are facing charges of corruption when they were in office during the tenure of Mahinda Rajapaksas Presidency.
While the prospect is tempting for President Sirisena, it will come at a price: a potential deterioration of relations with the UNP. The two major parties in Sri Lankan politics have never cohabited in government prior to 2015 and when they are in coalition as they are now, a turbulent relationship is only to be expected. Indeed, this has been the case.
In this context, another noteworthy deadline elapsed last week: December 31, 2017 saw the end of the period which bound the UNP and the SLFP to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the purpose of forming a National Unity government. The original MOU was due to end in September 2017 but was extended until the end of the year.
Both parties are playing their cards close to their chest on the MOU but it is very clear that neither is in a hurry to tear up the agreement either. They have also indicated that any evaluation of the future of the MOU will be after the conclusion of the local government elections in February.
Education Minister and UNPer Akila Viraj Kariyawasam was to say that the MOU will be revisited after the elections, a sentiment echoed by Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake. We will convene the SLFP Central Committee no sooner the local government poll is over to make a decision on extending the MOU as we have done previously. We will have talks with the UNP once the election is over, Dissanayake explained.
However, it was also evident that there are differences of opinion on this issue within the SLFP. Minister Susil Premajayantha publicly castigated former President Chandrika Kumaratunga for allegedly suggesting that the MOU should be extended. However, it transpired that Kumaratunga had made no such suggestion. In any event, Premajayantha is viewed by the mainstream SLFP as having strong loyalties to the dissident SLPP faction.
Ironically, a strong showing by the mainstream SLFP at the local government elections would consolidate President Sirisenas leadership and enable him to take the initiative to extend the term of the National Unity government by extending the MOU with the UNP.
SLFP and the JO factions
Conversely, if the mainstream SLFP performs less than optimally and the SLPP is able to demonstrate its strength, there would be pressure on President Sirisena to unite the mainstream party with its dissident faction, possibly under terms dictated to by the SLPP. That would pose an interesting conundrum for President Sirisena because, even if the SLFP and the JO factions unite in Parliament, they still wouldnt have a simple majority.
Meanwhile, the SLPP is sparing no effort to make a lasting impression on the voter, knowing that this election would make or break its prospects- and that of the Rajapaksas. It formally launched its local government campaign at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on Tuesday where the focus of attention was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Rajapaksa made a grand entrance with raised arms, surrounded by a bevy of dancing girls and the launch had all the hallmarks of a tamasha at the height of the Rajapaksa Presidency. If anything, the SLPP demonstrated that it has the funds and the organisational capability of putting up a big show.
Whether that will translate into votes at the election- given the dubious track record of the SLPP hierarchy- remains to be seen. Yet, it is on this issue that the political direction of the country- at least for the next few years- will be determined.

Eye on Vietnam as Asian confidence rises
Deal-makers are licking their lips at the prospect of more big mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity in the region next year, but the candidate they are pinning most of their hopes on is a relative economic tiddler - Vietnam.
That is in part because values in the more obvious candidates have shot up after what has been a prosperous 2017, so eyes are now turning to the lesser known economies.
Ms Srividya Gopalakrishnan, managing director of Duff & Phelps, is seeing more activity in Vietnam and Myanmar, with Vietnam being "very promising" as it starts to attract the attention of more foreign investors.
David Biller, Citi's Asean corporate and investment banking head, is also upbeat about the country, particularly in the light of Thai Beverage's deal last month.
Mainboard-listed Thai Bev had made a winning bid of 109.97 trillion Vietnamese dong (S$6.5 billion) for a 53.6 per cent stake in Sabeco, the largest state-owned brewer in Vietnam. The move could spark a series of deals involving the privatisation of state-owned enterprises in the next year.
"(If) the privatisation goes well, then I think you have a long list of follow-on privatisations and, of course, all of those should be big and relevant enough to require foreign investments and, therefore, Vietnam does become a target rich environment," said Mr Biller.
He added that there could be eight to 10 sizeable privatisations waiting in the pipeline for Vietnam.
In November, mainboard-listed Jardine Cycle & Carriage said it had invested US$617 million (S$825 million) for a 5.53 per cent stake in Vinamilk, known to be Vietnam's largest listed company by market capitalisation, with a value of about US$10.9 billion.
The Vinamilk deal is part of its strategy in investing in market-leading South-east Asian firms, Jardine C&C told the Singapore Exchange.
Baker McKenzie's Global Transactions Forecast 2018 report noted that deal-making in Vietnam has suffered from "a number of knocks to confidence in its economy", including weaker oil prices and the new United States administration's rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
"But domestic drivers are solid, and the programme of economic liberalisation, privatisation of state enterprises and new investment in the energy sector should support a recovery in M&A activity," it said.
The report forecasts a total of 331 domestic and cross-border transactions in Vietnam this year and 338 the year after.
Rob Subbaraman, head of emerging markets economics at Nomura, notes that inbound deals for Asean and India, which he calls the "new foreign direct investment magnet", are averaging about US$100 billion a year, but could hit US$240 billion by 2025.
"A lot of that M&A activity is going to come from within Asia. Companies in Japan or even China (are) starting to do more in Asean. I think the North-east Asia flow of M&A to the South will be a big thing. We're particularly positive on Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines," he said.
The positive outlook is not limited to Vietnam. Citi's Mr Biller notes that Malaysia could emerge as an underdog: "In terms of M&A and capital market activity, I expect it could be the dark horse from the region in 2018 which people have forgotten about because of 1MDB."
Gopalakrishnan of Duff & Phelps says this is due to the restriction in organic growth in Singapore and other emerging markets as well.
She notes that more Asian businesses are acquiring Western ones, compared with the past when Western firms swooped up Asian enterprises.
"The confidence level of Asian companies has definitely increased, compared to what it was a decade back. (Asian companies think) the world is our market, we go and acquire," she adds.
Ms Gopalakrishnan attributed this confidence to the shortening of business cycles in the last few years, like the global financial crisis, when cash-rich Asian companies saw assets in the US and Europe available at "fairly good prices", and snapped them up because companies, including those in Singapore, China and India, see the US as a key market.

Fashioning the future
Global fashion trends have been rocking the city of late. However the countrys awakening towards this fast growing industry had begun on a small scale and had been given less emphasis in the years gone by.
This is evident in the manner that the newspapers of the era had stuck to simply providing political news and details about the incidents that have occurred across the country. Most of the fashion related images were found on advertisements while an occasional new form of attire was donned by an international model in a simple caption and picture, mostly as a filler to cover a blank space or to catch the eye of the reader and draw him or her to read the news items on that particular page.
Later as the interest towards the glamour scene evolved, more fashion articles made it to the Daily News pages. They began to appear regularly once a week on a page aimed at the female readership. Feminine Round (1960), Womans Sphere (1970), Woman to Woman, Women & Leisure (1987 - 1994) and Daily News Woman (2006) are some examples of the pages which carried articles which were regarded as female oriented. Maureen Hingert, the first Sri Lankan beauty queen to win an award as she became the runner up at the Miss Universe 1955 pageant and Rosy Senanayakes triumph as Mrs World 1985 too fueled interest towards fashion and beauty as the Daily News had featured the charity work of the former Mrs World even on its front pages during the time of her reign.
With the dawn of the millennium, the global fashion industry began booming. More fashion related articles and even whole pages with models in colourful attire and various designs were published in the Daily News features section. From the Colombo Fashion Week and Lakme Fashion Week, India, to beauty pageants in the caliber of Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Universe and Miss Sri Lanka for Miss World, the Daily News has provided immense coverage to bring the latest fashion trends and beauty techniques to its readers.
Lake House newspapers have even sponsored beauty pageants, fashion designer competitions and bridal shows in the likes of Derana Veet Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Earth, Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Tourism Queen International, Ms Lanka for Ms Asia, Fashion Designer of the Year, CATS Singer Designer of the Year, Vivaha, Bridal Fair etc. The Spice section carried on Saturdays in 2006 saw not only models on the ramp and individual photo shoots for clothing brands but also fashionistas tastefully dressed during various glamour events like cocktail parties, launches, embassy get-togethers and birthday bashes.
Today fashion photographs are carried and upcoming young designers have been interviewed and featured in the Town and Country section on a regular basis. Garments ranging from bridal outfits, to cocktail dresses, casual clothes office wear, mens cloths, childrens clothes, resort wear and lingerie grace the pages.

FC Research forecasts steady phase for banking sector
First Capital Research (FC Research) expects the banking sector to have a steady phase during 2018E-20E with stable credit growth, improving GDP growth supporting lower Non Performing loans and lower interest rate volatility leading to stable NIMs, it said in a statement issued yesterday.
First Capital Research expects the banking sector universe to provide 25% average return over a one-year period exceeding the expected market return.
Credit growth to stabilize at 16%-18%: FC Research expects private sector credit growth to slow down to remain stable at 16% during 2018E gradually increasing to 18% through 2019E-2020E on improving GDP growth backed by progressing external sector performance levels and lower impairment due to better credit quality resultant to more business-related credit compared to consumer credit.
Interest rate stability to be mirrored in spreads: First Capital Research expects the banking sector interest spreads to stabilize in 2017E and thereon backed by the implementation of Inflation Targeting Framework, improved government revenue streams, increased foreign inflows into government securities market, introduction of Liability Management Bill to stabilize the interest rate and rate of inflation while the flexible exchange rate policy further supports it.
BASEL III Capital requirements satisfied:
Core and total capital adequacy ratios were maintained at 12.2% and 15% where the regulatory minimums were 5% and 10% respectively. Larger banks in the sector have already taken necessary steps to raise capital thus meeting the BASEL III capital requirement. This move ensures more stability and paves way for the industry to be more resilient and better poised for future growth.

Fertiliser ship arrives, ready for distribution
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday the current shortage of fertiliser will end with the arrival of 40,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer from Pakistan.
Addressing the weekly cabinet briefing held in Colombo, the Minister said the fertiliser will be sent to the respective areas in 200 lorries soon after the consignment is released from the port on the special permission given by the relevant authorities.
The reason for the sudden fertiliser shortage was a cancellation of a two tenders due to certain irregularities as well as previous ban on fertiliser imports from Pakistan.
However, President Maithripala Sirisena discussed with relevant authorities in Pakistan in this regard and found a solution.
On the request of the President,Pakistan agreed to send 72,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer to Sri Lanka immediately.
The Pakistan Government has informed that it will take action to export more fertilizer to Sri Lanka in the future.
Commenting on the current coconut shortage,Jayasekera said the government has expedited the process of importing coconut to ease the coconut shortage in the country.
According to the current agricultural laws, coconut cannot be imported to the country. So we had to amend the laws. Normally, there is a significant increase in the coconut consumption in November and December. The drought has also affected over 200,000 coconut trees in the Kurunegala district alone.
It takes the minimum of 45 weeks for a coconut tree to grow and bare fruit.The reason for the escalating coconut price is the current supply is insufficient coconuts to meet current and future demand. But, this situation will change with the increase of coconut production in May, June, July.
He further said figures indicate that rice is available in the market between Rs.73 and Rs.75 a kilo. Both the private sector and Lanka Sathosa brought 500,000 metric tonnes of rice to the country to ease the rice shortage previously.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said the United States has accepted that glyphosate causes CKDu (Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain Etiology) through research.When the Yahapalana government banned glyphosate, certain people blamed us.
Now it has been proved that CKDu is caused when glyphosate is mixed with water,he said.
He said the American Public Health Association sessions held recently upheld the research paper presented by Prof. Sarath Gunatilake who has focused on the herbicide glyphosate and its relationship to an epidemic of chronic kidney disease.

A Glimpse from the past
Queen Elizabeth II visits Sri Lanka
Queen Elizabeth II was only 25 years old when she was appointed to the throne. The Queen has ruled for longer than any other Monarch in British history, becoming a much loved and respected figure across the globe. She came to the throne 65 years ago on February 6, 1952.
The Queen arrived in Sri Lanka on April 10 and left the country after a 11 day stay on April 21, 1954. It was a remarkable visit as April 21 marked her 28th birthday and it was her 3rd birthday since her accession.
The queen opened the third session of the second parliament of Sri Lanka on 12 April and the Daily News on April 13 reported that she was wearing her coronation robes that day and further said, Those who had seen the opening of the first parliament of Ceylon in 1948, by the Duke of Gloucester agreed that the grandeur of yesterdays ceremony surpassed it.
It was also reported that the queens speech was brief and she delivered it with confidence that associates with royalty, she said, We deeply appreciate the warmth of the welcome which has been accorded to us on this visit. The Daily News presented its readers with a free twenty four page supplement to commemorate the visit of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh to Sri Lanka.
As well as visiting Colombo during the ten days she spent here, she also visited Kandy where she experienced a Perahera with 140 elephants. She toured the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, and spent Easter in Nuwara Eliya. As part of official engagements during the visit, she also addressed the nation from the historic studios of Radio Ceylon, now known as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. She came back to Sri Lanka in 1981 as the Head of the Commonwealth.
The Daily News reported on October 22, 1981, her second visit as, After 27 years, the queen receives a welcome from the heart.
In the front page of the Daily News published on October 26, 1981, it had a beautiful coloured photo printed on top which was titled, Good bye, Queen Elizabeth. It was reported that, Queen Elizabeth took with her a Sri Lanka stone- studded ivory elephant - and the happiest memories. The gift - a piece of superb craftsmanship was a gift from the President and Mrs. Jayawardene to the royal couple to commemorate their visit.
British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher visits Sri Lanka
The visit of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to Sri Lanka on April 13, 1985 was a truly historic and memorable one.
The Daily News on April 15, 1985 reported that Thatcher was the first head of government to address the house, Describing the British Premier as the ruling mother of the mother of Parliaments, Senanayake invited her to address.
It was also reported that Thatcher addressing the gathering after the inauguration of the largest dam and hydroelectric power plant said, I am certain that together we have created this mighty work which will stand for decades as a sure sign of what our friendship and co-operation can achieve. More than 10,000 people attended the ceremony, opening the Victoria dam project.
The Daily News also published all significant photos taken of Thatcher during her stay in Sri Lanka under the title visit that made History.
Meanwhile,, the Daily News presented its readers with a free supplement to commemorate the visit of the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher to Sri Lanka.
Ranjan Wijeratne killing
Minister of Plantation Industries and State Minister of Defence Ranjan Wijeratne was killed in a car bomb blast in Havelock road on March 2, 1991. Along with him 12 civilians and 6 STF men who were in his escort were killed. He was known as the successful planter in politics and also known to have taken a hard stance towards the LTTE.
Being a reputed planter he was appointed as the Chairman of the Planters Society from 1967 to 1968 and the Chairman of the Planters Association of Ceylon from 1970 to 1971. He also held offices of the Secretary to the Minister of Agricultural Development and Research, Secretary to the Ministry of State Plantation and the Chairman of Agricultural Development Authority.
The Daily News on March 04, 1991 reported that, Police believed that the assassination was masterminded by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam who had the expertise and capability, as well as a vengeful motive, for eliminating the man, who just two weeks ago went on record to say that he would wipe them out in six months time. It was also reported that March 06 was declared by the government as a day of national mourning and a public holiday.
It further reported that, President George Bush has sent a personal message of condolence over the killing of Minister Ranjan Wijeratne to President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
Death of Foreign MinisterLakshman Kadirgamar
In spite of the aura of peace and unity that the country struggled to maintain as the ceasefire with the LTTE seemed to be crumbling, nothing could conceal the waves of distress that surface following the death of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar on August 12, 2005. Described as a man who stood for peace, unity and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka by the Daily News, the death of Kadirgamar at his personal residence down Bullers Lane, Colombo 7, as he was climbing out of his swimming pool in the late hours of the night, was a catastrophic incident.
The headlines of the following days issue of the Daily News read, Kadirgamar assassinated and the ensuing article reported on the events that had transpired. Kadirgamar had been rushed to the Intensive Care Unit of the National Hospital Colombo and despite the emergency surgeries carried out to save him, had succumbed to his head, neck and chest injuries. Upon hearing of the tragedy, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had declared a State of Emergency and high security alert.
Police had told the Daily News that the shots had come from a higher elevation and as such, promptly arrested two persons in the neighbouring area whom they suspected of having either participated in the shooting or aided the shooter.
It was no secret that Lakshman Kadirgamar was a high profile target of the LTTE owing to his position as a key figure in the peace process of the Peoples Alliance Government. Highly respected by foreign leaders and governments, he had travelled extensively around the world exposing the terror tactics of the LTTE. The early stages of the investigation into his death indicated that the LTTE was responsible for his murder. However, in in spite of the years of investigation, the true culprits were never identified and the initial allegations could neither be proved nor disproved.
We shall never bow down to terror declared President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga as reported by the Daily News, when she addressed the nation following Kadirgamars death, urging that his sacrifice not be in vain.
Death of JVP Leader Rohana Wijeweera
The early hours of November 13, 1989 saw the death of the founder of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), Rohana Wijeweera. A Sri Lankan Marxist politician and rebel, Patabendi Don Nandasiri Wijeweera known as Rohana Wijeweera, was killed at an undisclosed location and his body was cremated as reported by the Daily News the following day.
Wijeweera who had run for Presidency in 1982 had been underground since 1983 when the JVP was proscribed. He had been identified by the army in Ulapane, was taken into custody and was brought down to Colombo for further investigation. Wijeweera volunteered to make an appeal to the youth of the country for the cessation of violence and this speech, made voluntarily was video-recorded.
The Daily News documented how Wijeweera had agreed to lead an army/police team to one of the main military operational headquarters of the JVP which was located in the suburbs of Colombo. Wijeweera had asked H. B. Herath, a high ranking official of the JVP politburo, to hand over whatever documents and articles which were available in the headquarters to the investigators. Herath, while pretending to seek such items, suddenly pulled out a weapon and fired in the direction of Rohana Wijeweera eliciting a reaction from the security forces who immediately opened fire. Both Wijeweera and Herath were killed in the process.
This was allegedly what had happened, however suspicions surrounding the actual circumstances surrounding Wijeweeras death were somewhat murky. When questioned on the immediacy of the cremation, State Minister for Defence, Ranjan Wijeratne, insisted that it had been done for security reasons asking, What is there to see in a dead body
Death of MajorGeneral DenzilKobbekaduwa
A shocked nation went into mourning on August 8, 1992 as news of the death of one of the most senior officers in the country, Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa became known. Northern area commanders Kobbekaduwa, Wimalaratne and Jayamaha along with seven others were occupants of a long-wheel based Land Rover as it ran over an old pressure mine at Araly junction on the island of Kayts. Nine of the ten occupants of the vehicle were killed almost immediately. It is believed that the explosion was due to the excessive weight of the vehicle as in spite of the regular traffic flow down that junction, the pressure mine had not been triggered as reported by the Daily News.
Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa was rushed to the Ratmalana Airbase and transferred by helicopter to the General Hospital, Colombo. Despite the extensive efforts of the doctors, the severe punctures to his liver and brain proved to be fatal.
Commissioned into the army in 1962, Kobbekaduwa became the armys fourth most senior officer and the most senior officer to have been killed in action in the war with the LTTE.
The funeral, held on August 10, 1992 was marred by an organized mob who threw stones and jeered at the funeral procession and those gathered at the funeral, as documented in the Daily News the following day. The unruly mob forced their way into the cemetery toppling one of the iron boundary railings forcing the authorities to open the gates. The jeering crowd proceeded to single out government personalities and monks and fired abuses at them. The police were forced to fire several round of tear gas and shot into the air. This coupled with the shower of rain is what ultimately succeeded in dispersing the crowd.

A source on the French Riviera told MailOnline that the couple arrived on December 31 and met up with friends.
There was speculation that the group may have included Prince Albert, and his wife, Princess Charlene, who are the most senior royals in the millionaires playground in the south of France.
Last year, glamorous Princess Charlene joined Prince Harry at Twickenham to watch a rugby match between England and South Africa.
They are believed to have spent two days with friends in the principality dubbed a billionaires playground - with one source claiming the couple had celebrated the end of 2017 with Prince Albert and Princess Charlene of Monaco.
The source said: Harry and Meghan were somewhere very private and very expensive. Monte Carlo is party central at this time of the year, and the word is that the British royals really enjoyed themselves.
The fun could well have been laid on by Prince Albert, who is a close friend of Harrys. Whats certain is that they were partying like tycoons on New Years Day. Fun around Monaco is never understated, and always costs a fortune!
But a spokesman at the Princes Palace of Monaco said that the fact that Harry and Meghan had partied with the royals was news to them.
A spokesman said: I havent got any information about that. Im not aware of it at all, not at all. It must have been private if it was the case, but I don t know about it at all. Its news to me.
Prince Albert, 59, has already given relationship advice to Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, following their engagement.
The couples trip to Monaco was, however, kept as private as possible, thanks to a massive security operation.
Three bodyguards accompanied them on a British Airways flight from London to the French city of Nice on New Years Eve, when they took up three rows of economy seats.
There was no first class on the short flight, but when they got to Nice they boarded helicopters for the seven-minute hop to Monte Carlo.
They spent two nights in the principality, and were then seen boarding helicopters again at 11am on Tuesday morning.
The loved-up royal couples private flight was a considerable upgrade from their economy trip to Nice - where they are said to have sat beside the toilets among other passengers.
In an attempt to remain incognito, the pair boarded their 9.55am flight from Heathrow before any other passengers and headed straight to the back of the plane, next to the rear toilets.
They also took up three rows of economy seats, either side of the aisle, even though there were only themselves and three edgy and nervous bodyguards in their party.
Harry, 33, apparently slumped down next to the window dressed in jeans, a jacket and with a baseball cap pulled over his face.
Bride-to-be Miss Markle, 36, was sitting next to him in a black beanie hat and minimal make-up.
In Monaco it was likely to have been a far grander affair. Dubbed the Mayfair of the Med, the Principality has become famous as something of a playground for the wealthy.
The crystal clear coastline in the sovereign city-state is lined with super-yachts - with cars worth well into the millions parked on the streets.
The super-rich are drawn to the nation by its relative security and privacy in a space that is only slightly larger than Londons Regents Park.
But it was a quick visit for Harry and Meghan who are already thought to have returned home to London ahead of a series of official engagements in the months leading up to their May wedding.

Illegal electric fence kills elephant: Suspect released on two personal bails
A person produced before the Kantale Courts for the death of a wild elephant due to electrocution, was released on two personal bails worth Rs. 200,000 each by Kantale Acting Magistrate Shanika Perera. The case will be called again on February 16.
The suspect, giving a statement before Courts, said that he used an electric fence to protect his crops and properties because elephants destroyed his crops and damaged his house on several occasions.
As a result of his illegal electric fence, a young male elephant around 25 years of age, had died on the spot where it was electrocuted.

India to stay top even if SA sweep series
India will maintain their numero uno status in the ICC Test Rankings irrespective of how the series against South Africa pans out, but the Proteas will join the visitors at the top if they win all the three matches.
Faf du Plessiss side is presently 13 points behind Virat Kohlis team, which is sitting on top of the table on 124 points. However, both the sides will finish on 118 points if the South Africa side makes a clean sweep of the series which starts in Cape Town on January 5, the International Cricket Council said in a statement.
Even in that scenario, India will be ranked above South Africa when the points are calculated beyond the decimal point. In such a situation, India will be on 118.47 points, while South Africa will be on 117.53.
On the other side of the coin, if India win all the three Tests of the series, then they will move to 128 points while South Africa will slip to 107 points.
Meanwhile, Australia have been guaranteed third place in after leading the series 3-0 with the fifth and final Test to begin in Sydney on Thursday. However, England will have to win the Test to avoid finishing in fifth place. If Australia win the series 4-0, then they will finish third on 104 points and England will end on fifth with 99 points, while a 3-1 series win for Australia will mean they will finish third on 102 points and England in fourth on 101 points.
In the rankings for Test batsmen, second-ranked India captain Virat will aim to break the 900-point mark for the first time in his career. The in-form right-hander is presently on 893 points and a solid performance will potentially see him join the select group of players with a rating of 900 or more, which in ranking terms is an indication of a players quality, as to achieve it a player has to be among the very best over a protracted period.
Cheteshwar Pujara is 20 points behind Kohli in third place, while Hashim Amla of South Africa is the other player who features in the top 10, in seventh position.
Among the bowlers, South Africas Kagiso Rabada is breathing down number-one ranked James Andersons neck. Second-ranked Rabada is nine points behind Anderson and depending on how the two bowlers perform in the coming days, there could potentially be a change at the top of the order.  PTI

Indian Rupee climbs to fresh  2.5-year high on sliding dollar
The rupee shot up to end at a nearly 2-1/2 year high of 63.48, surging by 20 paise against the US dollar as the bullish momentum continued strongly for the fourth-straight day driven by upbeat hopes on macro front.
Extremely bearish greenback sentiment has been one of the key factors driving the rupee higher at this juncture.
Besides, heavy dollar unwinding by speculative traders and exporters further supported the strong run-up to its multi-year highs. This is the best closing for the home currency since July 17, 2015 when it had closed at 63.47.
Abundant capital inflows on hopes of more reform measures along with robust domestic macro fundamentals largely supplemented further strength to the local currency. At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (forex) market, the rupee resumed slightly positive at 63.65 from overnight close of 63.68.
But, soon it encountered resistance and retreated sharply to touch a low of 63.77 due to stray dollar demand from importers and foreign banks.
However, overcoming the initial volatility, the local unit bounced back sharply to hit an intra-day high of 63.43 in mid-afternoon deals before ending at 63.48, showing a smart gains of 0.20 paise, or 0.31%. In the last four-day rally, the rupee has appreciated by a whopping 67 paise against the American currency.
The RBI, meanwhile, fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 63.6728 and for the euro at 765856. The Indian economy made significant headway and has grown at a stronger 6.3% pace on year-on-year in the second-quarter of 2017. In the meantime, eight core sectors expanded at a fastest pace in more than a year at 6.8 per cent in November 2017 on account of robust performance in segments like refinery, steel and cement, official data showed overnight.
Globally, the US dollar languished near a three-month low against its major trading partners, as global markets reopened after new year holiday.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, was down at 91.53 in early trade. In cross-currency trades, the rupee fell back against the pound sterling to settle at 85.96 per pound from 85.91 and drifted sharply against the euro to finish at 76.61 compared to 76.40 yesterday. The home unit also declined against the Japanese yen to close at 56.58 per 100 yens from 56.52 yesterday. (www.indiatimes.com)

Inter-Korean hotline reopens after Seoul proposed talks
North and South Korea on Wednesday reopened a cross-border hotline which had been shut down since 2016, forging ahead with peace overtures despite taunts from US President Donald Trump who said he has a much bigger nuclear button than Kim Jong-Un.
The hotline was restored at 0630 GMT after Seoul proposed high-level talks in response to an olive branch from the North's leader, who has offered to send a team to next month's Winter Olympics in the South.
The phone conversation lasted 20 minutes, a South Korean Unification Ministry official told AFP, adding details were not known immediately.
Kim's overtures to the South marked a rare softening in tone. Tensions have surged in recent months following a flurry of North Korean missile launches and its most powerful nuclear test yet.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 09
It is not just how fast you ran, but whether you finally won the marathon!
Unless you use modern techniques, it is not easy to tackle the tough decisions in todays high-pressure business environment and deliver the results your company needs for sustained growth. Most of the modern high-profiled companies follow proven principles to meet the increasing demands (especially in times of crisis) to do more, deliver more and increase more  while keeping stress low and morale high.
Chuck Martin, New York Times Business Best Selling author, offers 7 good tips.
1. Use clear and frequent communication to align those who execute strategies with those who create them.
2. Prioritize the results, identify actions needed to achieve them, and building consensus on what it will take to get the job done,
3. Make the tough decisions in a timely and constructive manner,
4. Change direction at a moments notice in order to keep pace with changing customer and company needs,
5. Become an indispensable asset by aligning more closely with company values,
6. Foster teamwork, total information sharing and learning culture,
7. Reward good work and giving people everything they need to do their best.
Let us move on a bit further.
In todays business, the SMART model of decision-making is an important tool for drawing conclusions. The model relies on several steps that lead to setting goals and making decisions. The S in SMART is for specific or significant information, the M is for measurable or meaningful data, the A is for agreed-upon or actionable intelligence, as well as achievable standards, the R is for relevant information, as well as realistic goals, and the T is for time, as in the amount of time needed to make decisions and reach goals. Clearly, one of the most important elements of making any well-informed business decision is actionable data. So, what should you do
1. Set clear objectives
Using the SMART mentality, you should be able to set clear business goals and objectives. An example of a business goal may be in the marketing department: to increase audience engagement. Youll need to consider what this means and how to accomplish your objective.
First, you need to be specific and determine how youre going to measure success. What does audience engagement mean Is it the amount of time a visitor spends on a specific page, the number of return visits, or whether they sign up for membership or follow you on social media, for example
Next you need to consider actions you can take to reach your goal of increased engagement, such as revamping your website or your marketing campaigns to increase interest. From there youll have to gather relevant information through testing, surveys, and metrics to see if your efforts are having the desired result.
Finally, you need to set a time frame for action, data collection, and review. Setting clear objectives, including gathering applicable data, is the overall best way to make smart business decisions consistently.
2. Rely on evidence
Making smart decisions requires that you have as full an understanding of a given situation as possible. In most scenarios, this means collecting data from a variety of sources. Returning to the objective of increasing audience engagement, gathering evidence on what isnt working may be your first step. Experts in marketing and sales may provide information on why the copy or layout of a web page or an ad isnt engaging audiences as anticipated. Metrics analysts can spot trends over time to pinpoint which efforts arent working and potentially why theyre falling short of expectations. This information is essential to making decisions about your strategy moving forward.
3. Understand your audience
Communication is an important part of any decision, whether youre communicating with coworkers or with an audience. Of course, opening a dialogue with your audience is much more difficult than carrying on a conversation with coworkers.
In order to speak to your audience in a meaningful and productive way, you have to first understand them. There are several ways to go about accomplishing this goal. If at all possible, its always best to go right to the source and speak with audience members directly, which is why focus groups, commentary, and reviews are so important.
However, you can also track a variety of metrics to get a sense of what your audience likes and dislikes based on their responses. Suppose you see a lot of click-through on targeted ads, but very little follow-through once visitors reach your site.
Your metrics might indicate that the content in your ad doesnt match up to your landing page, that your landing page isnt attractive and engaging, or that there is a disconnect between customer expectations and the content you deliver.
This information can help you discover the problem and determine how best to go about fixing it in order to reach your business goals. It will help you interpret audience response and channel it into communication initiatives that speak to your audience. In short, it will help you make smart business decisions surrounding audience engagement.
4. Learn from your mistakes
Every undertaking has a learning curve, but mistakes only become failures if you dont learn from them. Its called a decision-making process because you will constantly learn and grow, incorporating experience and information into future goals and decisions, honing the process as you go.
5. Create contingency plans
The more you know, the better equipped you are to handle any situation with confidence. This begins with learning the tenets and techniques of proper communication so that you can plan accordingly and prepare for any outcome.
Making smart decisions that lead to success is ideal, but having a backup plan in place is just good business. You can never account for every potential roadblock or setback, but with proper education you have a starting point from which to begin building experience.
Additional advice
Let me add few more guidelines for making business decisions during difficult economic times.
1. Consider your business model
Don't lose sight of your business plan during tough times. Think about how the decisions will fit into the overall business model you have created, regardless of the economic indicators. Consider how you can make the decision cost less or conserve more resource, while continuing to provide a high-quality product or service.
2. Consider your customer base
Before making a decision, consider your customer base and the circumstances they are in. If you wish to introduce a new product, for example, think about whether your customers, will be interested in buying the product. Ultimately, your customers are the driving force behind your business, and you should be sensitive to their economic troubles and consider how each business decision you make can best serve them during the crisis.
3. Act quickly, but not reflexively, and plan contingencies.
Acute anxiety tends to provoke one of two responses - thoughtless activity or deer-in-the-headlights paralysis. Both are understandable but neither is helpful. The challenge is to be both fore-thoughtful about the decisions you will need to make and fearless and daring in implementing them at the appropriate time. Waiting to get specific until the wolf really is at the door will not make the choices any easier, but it will sharply increase the likelihood that the available options will be fewer and more draconian.
4. Identify the people who matter most and keep that group strong.
Its often said that in good times you need good people; and in tough times you need great people. Every organization has a small group of people who are critical to its successcurrent and future. If you were to name your strongest performers, who would they be These are the people who should be receiving the lions share of your attention, so that they can feel like allies and partners in keeping the organization focused on its mission and pulling through.
5. Stay very close to your key funders.
The banks and other financial lending organizations that know you best are the ones that are most likely to help you navigate this downturn. Remember that you dont have to wait for your key funders to call you. You canand shoulduse this as an opportunity to pick up the phone and call them: to let them know what youre seeing and how you plan to respond; to explain the choices youre making or expect to make; to ask whether they can be equally transparent with you about what they expect their payouts or donations to be over the next six to 18 months
Shape up your organization.
Running the kind of organizational marathon that a downturn triggers requires planning, focus, commitment, and stamina. The necessity for belt-tightening can facilitate hard-to-contemplate changes that could make your operations more efficient and your impact greater. Should you merge positions or programs For example, could you out-source a provider to lower back-office costs, create economies of scale, or leverage best practices across operations
Similarly, tough times can be the catalyst for taking advantage of low-cost opportunities to improve internal operations and make it easier for people to work smarter - and not just longer and harder.
Bringing outsider
Finally, it may be the time to think strategically about bringing someone with different skills, or skills you previously might not have been able to access, onto your leadership team. General Manager and Finance Manager are examples. In the face of huge demand for the best-and-brightest management talent, organizations have typically had great difficulty filling these positions. The challenge is to be conscientious about your due diligence, so that if you do make an offer, youre sure its to the right person.

Just write: Something that will be there, always, Like Tomorrow's Sky...
It's tempting to begin the new year writing about writing  the art of it, the craft of it. Writers of serious literature (according to, at least, many writers of serious literature) do not simply type enthralling words onto blank computer screens; instead, 'they stare into an abyss and reach into their souls and find, if they are fortunate, the swirling fires of Prometheus'. True enough, writing could be exciting, but it is for the most part simply work. Its often lonely. Its rarely romantic. (Take yours truly for example. The whole world including even the stars are fast asleep, as I type away to meet my Thursday's deadline). Like how writer Megan Garber puts it, Writing is a craft in the way that carpentry is a craft: Theres art to it, sure, and a certain inspiration required of it, definitely, but for the most part youre just sawing and sanding and getting dust in your eyes.
Until you win the Nobel prize for literature. Like how the British author Kazuo Ishiguro won it last year. Obviously, the dust in his eyes was so thick he refused to see what was right in front of his at first. It was completely not something I expected, otherwise I would have washed my hair this morning, he said with a laugh recalling the day he heard the great news. Then he added, A part of me feels like Im too young to be winning something like this. But then I suddenly realized that Im 62, so I am average age for this I suppose.
Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of The Swedish Academy, explaining the Committees choice of Ishiguro as Noble Laureate in literature, 2017, said If you mix Jane Austen and Franz Kafka then you have Kazuo Ishiguro in a nutshell, but you have to add a little bit of Marcel Proust into the mix. Then you stir, but not too much, and you have his writings.
No doubt, this is high, and accurate, praise  but as one critic observes, it came only after Ishiguro was dedicated enough to sit down, put pen to page, and create those awful sentences, hideous dialogue, and scenes that went nowhere. And now he has a Nobel Prize to show for it.
Ishiguro's journey thus far began in Nagasaki in 1954. At the age of five he moved with his family to the small town of Guildford, in southern England. As revealed in the Paris Review, he didnt return to Japan for twenty-nine years. (His Japanese, he says, is awful.) At twenty-seven he published his first novel,A Pale View of Hills(1982), set largely in Nagasaki, to near unanimous praise. His second novel, An Artist of the Floating World(1986), won Britains prestigious Whitbread award. And his third,The Remains of the Day(1989), sealed his international fame. It sold more than a million copies in English, won the Booker Prize, and was made into a Merchant Ivory movie starring Anthony Hopkins, with a screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Ishiguro was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and, for a while, his portrait hung at 10 Downing Street. The author of three more acclaimed novels The Unconsoled (1995), When We Were Orphans(2000) and Never Let Me Go(2005)Ishiguro has also written screenplays and teleplays, and composed lyrics.
According to Susannah Hunnewell who interviewed him for the Paris Review, Ishiguro lives in a pleasant white stucco house in Londons Golders Green with daughter, Naomi, and his wife, Lorna, a former social worker. He writes in a small office upstairs with rows of color-coded binders neatly stacked in cubbyholes. Copies of his novels in Polish, Italian, Malaysian, and other languages line one wall. On the other are books for researchfor example,Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 by Tony Judt.
Looking back on the details of his life, especially the guitar-playing hippie days, he said to the Paris Review, he wrote his college essays using disembodied phrases separated by full stops. This was encouraged by professors, he recalled. Apart from one very conservative lecturer from Africa. But he was very polite. He would say, Mr. Ishiguro, there is a problem about your style. If you reproduced this on the examination, I would have to give you a less-than-satisfactory grade.
When asked if there were any writing from his youth that were never published, he said, After university, when I was working with homeless people in west London, I wrote a half-hour radio play and sent it to the BBC. It was rejected but I got an encouraging response. It was kind of in bad taste, but its the first piece of juvenilia I wouldnt mind other people seeing. It was called Potatoes and Lovers. When I submitted the manuscript, I spelled potatoes incorrectly, so it said potatos. It was about two young people who work in a fish-and-chips caf. They are both severely cross-eyed, and they fall in love with each other, but they never acknowledge the fact that theyre cross-eyed.
Elaborating further he said, This was a time when I was starting to think about what my career was going to be. Id failed to make it as a musician. Id had lots of appointments with A&R people. After two seconds, theyd say, Its not going to happen, man. So I thought Id have a go at a radio play.
Then, almost by accident, I came across a little advertisement for a creative-writing M.A. taught by Malcolm Bradbury at the University of East Anglia. Today its a famous course, but in those days it was a laughable idea, alarmingly American. I discovered subsequently that it hadnt run the previous year because not enough people had applied. Somebody told me Ian McEwan had done it a decade before. I thought he was the most exciting young writer around at that point. But the primary attraction was that I could go back to university for a year, fully funded by the government, and at the end, I would only have to submit a thirty-page work of fiction. I sent the radio play to Malcolm Bradbury along with my application.
I was slightly taken aback when I was accepted, because it suddenly became real. I thought, these writers are going to scrutinize my work and its going to be humiliating. Somebody told me about a cottage for rent in the middle of nowhere in Cornwall that had previously been used as a rehabilitation place for drug addicts. I called up and said, I need a place for one month because Ive got to teach myself to write. And thats what I did that summer of 1979. It was the first time I really thought about the structure of a short story. I spent ages figuring out things like viewpoint, how you tell the story, and so on. At the end I had two stories to show, so I felt more secure.
He remembers that one of the stories he showed the class was set in Nagasaki at the time the bomb dropped, and it was told from the point of view of a young woman. I got a tremendous boost to my confidence from my fellow students. They all said, This Japanese stuff is really very exciting, and youre going places. After that, he had got a letter from Faber accepting three of his stories for their Introduction series. Thus was launched his writing career.
Winning the Nobel Prize, however, is something he takes in his stride. All he wants is to continue to write. I just hope I dont get lazy or complacent, I hope my work wont change.
With just four days into the new year, it seems right to conclude with Ishiguro's words in 'When We Were Orphans'. Here then is an apt new year resolution for all of us.
All I know is that I've wasted all these years looking for something, a sort of trophy I'd get only if I really, really did enough to deserve it. But I don't want it anymore, I want something else now, something warm and sheltering, something I can turn to, regardless of what I do, regardless of who I become. Something that will just be there, always, like tomorrow's sky. That's what I want now, and I think it's what you should want too.

Kandy SC continue unblemished record
Kandy Sports Club maintained their unblemished record in the current league season, by winning all seven games in a row with bone-crunching tackles, super-human power and breathtaking guile and pace.
They are sure to be crowned champions once again the way are getting about their business of winning matches. This is a team which has a bit of an unknown quality they seem fit and strong and have a core of good players. Kandy is the only club which plays rugby out of Colombo.
Kandy has been the most successful Sri Lankan club winning the league for a record 18 years between 1994 to 2017 and has been runners-up four times. They have the most number of wins by any club since the expanded competition commenced in 1950.
In their last outing, which was the first second round game they beat the Policemen comprehensively at Nittawela by 61 points to 20.
The policemen made some real individual errors and this may be the worst defeat for them. This game was played under ideal conditions. In the first quarter the policemen defended well and played good rugby and their ball handling was good they were able to score one try but they were deprived of further success due to the superb defence of Kandy.
Kandy was majestic and utterly dominant in all phases of the game which completely rattled the policemen. The pack showed more snarl than it has in the first round matches. Kandy passed well, tackled well and played as a team. They launched a vigorous game, and had the opportunity to push the cops into their own area. The Police could not keep up the pressure and were more on the defensive.
Kandy started and finished strongly with nine tries. They were good they were sublime, crisp passing, clever lines of running and footwork skillful enough to confound better teams than Police. The losers began clumsily, with a host of attacking errors. The cops could not make much progress with their play, since Kandy's flankers were up in a flash virtually anticipating their moves.
However the Police forwards were quick to rally round at the breakdown point and set up second phase attacks, but failed to do the need full with the ball.
It was the Kandy forwards most notably their third row who dictated the pace and pattern of the game. The flankers were outstanding; the open side flanker played a largely defensive role effectively supported by the number eight. The rest of the pack rallied splendidly around this dashing trio. They enjoyed a greater share of possession and it was a power-packed display. Cops whose strength lies in their agile forwards failed to utilize their potential to maximum advantage. Their fly half chose to kick ahead with regular frequency though Kandys fullback did not wilt under pressure positioning himself well to the high ball giving him plenty of time to find the safety of the touchline with relative ease.
Kandy was good in the rucks and mauls that they had the upper hand, but on the few occasions the cops did activate their dormant three quarters they brought life into the game. It was in the first half that they were stirred into action, but failed to continue the good work.
On Saturday Kandy will play Air Force at Ratmalana.

Kandy smacks of class and clinical finish
Salutations to all rugby islanders and devoted fans, dedicated to seeing their club colours victorious and stamina to finish strong. The Dialog league now starts its long lung busting lap to the end ...leaving in its swell, all sorts of conclusions ..some joyous, some victims, but mostly players relief, to get through... injury free or with less bruising to finish strong.
Fundamentally the dawn of the new 2018, should in theory, be some time to reflect and all those traditions....for us mortals, yes.
But for our islanders rugby warriors...its time to tunnel vision strength, belief and controlled aggression ..that will make a difference in the middle.
It's an all or nothing theory now ...Kandy sitting very pretty on top of the standings and quite the local super rugby team, absolutely outplaying Police at home ...with a 61points that smacked of class and clinical finishing.
I can well imagine the warm endorphins haze around the lions coaching staff ...all those hours of skill drills, and timing ..all in rhythm and at pace.
Police seemingly mesmerized and short of rapid counter ...leaking 9 tries through their almost virtual defence! The facts are hard to accept, let alone play against ...when you face them up in that Nittawela cauldron...of pain.
Survival is one option ..and defying noise and the intense partisan cheers, adding to the game pressure in the middle. The years haven't dulled the sense of purpose or intimidation...if anything, it is more now ..with the two covered stands looming large.
Havelocks, CR and Navy are the only sides with an outside chance of challenging Kandys domination this season...and the glorious possibility of some real drama if they beat the table leaders and defending champions.
We have to accept the inevitable ..as hopes continue to weaken that tide of real opportunity.
The Kandy habit and system, shining bright for that brood and speaks volumes for their professionalism.
Coach Martis would be positive about the Park boys really stepping on the gas ..pushing harder upfront and petrol to outrun and outlast all comers. His belief has some weight and depends how much mental toughness the Havies carry into each game ...this is the ultimate factor and still some significant time to change the league.
CR and Navy will be nursing similar ambititons..But both coaches in Feretti and Jayatilake for Navy, will be pulling up all that craft and strategy for their matches over the next 4 weeks.
So much depends on the injury and availability of key players...that is the significant and telling difference that the lions carry ...at any given turn.
The bench strength and depth too much class to ignore and difficult to match under pressure....this quality is such a luxury for them and has a razor edge finish to everything they decide to call in the middle.
Captain Weerey ..a little more determined and hopefully fitter and charged up since his new Christmas arrival by stork...happy to report that mother and baby are both well and plenty incentive for Gayan, 1...to get super fit, and 2....demand the next level finish from all his charged up lions, every time they run out.
Fazil, still the master at fly, jnr Weeraratne scrum half...and heaps of skill and pace, compliment the Wiliveera, Ritchie Dhaha, Ratwatte, and Danush. In the form of his life ..Ranjan, looming like a great white shark...what a grand line and Sooriyabandara, the impact specialist. No one wants to confront for the last quarter ..all itching to get on.
The odds favour them massive ...But nothing to stop Tarinda Ratwatte, Omalka, skipper Kavan and the Longdon Place boys from ripping the heart out over the next two weekends...what a tantalising prospect if they turn it on and beat Kandy, win all and bonus up for a dream finish ...aloha the reality of defying the odds!
Navy's captain Danuska Gertha Perera, will be celebrating in his own inimitable style that famous victory with the very last kick of the game ...Again we find the CH on the line and no power to protect the lead ..solid in patches of significant brilliance and then impossible sadness, as they fail to protect their line and a positive to parade back to Maitland...its been mighty quiet back at Gymkhana ..with a few jars to cheer what a telling effect CH are having this season.
Coach Lagga well versed in the subtleties of final round islanders rugby....back from his break away, with a few new options ..,
Coming up this busy rugby weekends storm ...all matches are in our windy city by the sea and 4 pm knockoffs, except the CH v Havelocks under lights for a 6.30pm start ..at the well set Park stadium.
Whilst wishing all my regulars a significant and productive 2018, I would also like to nudge up a small reminder to all involved in our union code at every level ...to carefully seek professional advise and guidance about the use of supplements. The global trend and push for better performance is an inevitable fact ..But caution and safety checks vital before you start the players on this path. Bottom line reality ...chemicals in our blood, change the composition of our system, affects our hormone production and can cause irreversible damage as we continue to absorb the substance as the promise of enhanced muscle and performance, fuddle the brain and cloud our power of reasoning. Seek proper advise and shop from known suppliers.
National rep players need to clear local anti doping rules and also check WADA..the world anti doping authority guidelines...it is an absolute and not to be ignored requirement.
The law on banned substance is the toughest yet..automatic bans even if you are on medication and fail to inform etc. Check on the specifics and get your management to clear each step.
January means a new beginning and heaps of hope for players, coaches and parents alike ...be sensible, stay fair and push beyond the maximum this season.
The code is about skill and fair play ..let's absorb those principles to the max and enjoy the gladiators on their title push. Bigger, better, faster, sharper, and much stronger this season, is our wish.
Blessings to fans and warriors for the most impact on both sides of the touch line ..let's wish the TMOs that balance each game. Bula bula islanders and their favourite game ...for 80minutes of pure impact and magnetic skills.
Rugby hearts stand apart ..Cheers!

Kerber fires in Hopman Cup
Perth: A buoyant Angelique Kerber beat a battling Eugenie Bouchard to lead Germany to a 3-0 win over Canada at the mixed-teams Hopman Cup on Wednesday.
Former world number one Kerber notched her second straight sets wins in Perth to start the new year, while Bouchard once ranked fifth but now 83rd was testy after yet another comprehensive defeat.
Kerber's win gave the Germans a perfect start to the Group A tie. Young gun Alexander Zverev then ensured they remained unbeaten after two outings with an emphatic win over Vasek Pospisil.
In the dead mixed doubles, the Germans completed a clean sweep with a straight-sets win.
If the Germans beat Australia on Friday they will be guaranteed a berth in Saturday's final.
As was the case in her 6-1, 6-4 loss to Australian Daria Gavrilova on Monday, Bouchard barely fired a shot against Kerber in the first set but resurrected her game in the second.
At 3-3 in the second set Bouchard held four break points. But Kerber staved them off, held serve and then strolled through the last two games comfortably to win 6-1, 6-3 in 57 minutes.
The contrasting moods of Kerber and Bouchard told the story, with the former rapidly regaining confidence in her own game after a frustrating 2017 in which she slipped from number one in the rankings to 21st.
With emphatic wins over Belgium's Elise Mertens and Bouchard, who has troubled Kerber in previous meetings, the German was thrilled with her early-season form before the Australian Open, which provided her maiden Grand Slam in 2016.
"I was feeling very good from the first point," she said. "I was trying to be aggressive and play my game.
"It is not so easy to play against Eugenie but today it was a good match.
"It's (her own game) feeling a little bit better than one week ago."
But Bouchard could barely contain her frustration, complaining about match scheduling and the off-court activities in Perth after an error-riddled performance.
The 23-year-old said she was trying not to be consumed by the pressure to climb back up the rankings.
"It will take as long as it will take", she said. "For me, I can't worry about it, I'm trying to do my best.
"However long it will take is what will happen, and I'll have to deal with that."
World number four Zverev cruised past the 108th-ranked Pospisil in a 6-4, 6-2 win. The German called it his reward for putting in extra practice after his disappointing singles loss to Belgium's David Goffin on Monday.

Kesara,  a racing champ  in the making
Kesara Godage, a 11-year- old driver competing in the Udawalawa Sevanagala Supercross held recently won the Youngest Car Driver award. However it has happened unexpectedly, as it was his father, veteran driver Dhammika Godage who was scheduled to be in the car segment contest at the event.
On the eve of the contest, Dhammika had allowed his son Kesara to drive the Nissan March during a practice session. At this moment Kesara had not even possessed a driving licence as he was underage.
But, due to the intervention of Anil Jayakody, Kesara was presented with the licence to compete at the Supercross in the motor car segment.
Kesara was placed third during the initial timing, to the much surprise of many veteran drivers.
During the main event this novice driver won the fourth place.
It was quite a coincidence that Kesara who began his maiden voyage in motor racing riding a 50cc bike five years ago at the Walawa Supercross, also entered the motor car segment at the same venue.
Before competing in the motor car segment, Kesara had proved his potential in motorcycle segment by topping the under-13 category score charts.
Kesara had won the Supercross competitions in Galle and Boyagane, but was forced to recuperate for several months due to an injury at the Fox Hill Supercross.
He then returned to action and won the Gunner Super Cross at Minneriya before repeating the feat at the Gajaba Supercross at Saliyapura.
Kesara continued to showcase his credentials at the Supercross held at Embilipitiya. Godage Jr. also competed at the Katukurunda Rotherham Championship and was featured in the 1500cc Ford Laser/Mazda event.
During the Katukurunda race Kesara caught the attention of Sri Lanka's internationally reputed racing driver Dilantha Malagamuwa, who later predicted that the rookie driver could go places in his chosen sport and bring recognition to Sri Lanka. Kesara Godage who is only 11 is a seventh grade student at Lyceum International School in Nugegoda.

Maxwell, Wade axed from Australias  ODI squad to play England
Sydney: Regulars Glenn Maxwell and Matthew Wade were axed from Australia's squad on Wednesday for this month's one-day international series against England.
Chief selector Trevor Hohns said ODI specialist Maxwell was omitted over consistency concerns, while Tim Paine takes the wicketkeeping gloves from Wade following his outstanding form in the Ashes Test series.
Selectors also named Australia's Test pace trio -- Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins -- and prodigious Twenty20 batsman Chris Lynn for the five-match series, starting in Melbourne on January 14.
Hohns said the selection panel wanted to have another look at Lynn, while seeking more consistency from Maxwell.
"No one is in any doubt about Glenn's ability or his potential to produce match-winning contributions with the bat," Hohns said.
"What we have wanted from him is more consistency but in his past 20 matches in this format he has averaged 22 and we need more than that from a player in the sides batting engine room."He added that Maxwell was "still absolutely in our thoughts" but they opted for Lynn who is now back playing after a shoulder injury hampered him when he was picked against Pakistan 12 months ago.
"Chris has been one of the most feared players at domestic level in limited-overs cricket in the past couple of years and we want to see if he can convert that domestic form to the international stage," said Hohns.
Hohns said Paine had seized his opportunity behind the stumps during the Ashes after being preferred to Wade.
"Tim forced his way into the Twenty20 International squad last summer, and after coming back into the Test squad at the beginning of the Ashes series he has made a terrific contribution with bat and gloves," he said.
"He deserves his opportunity in this form of the game and the challenge for Matthew is to return to the type of form that saw him score an ODI hundred against Pakistan last summer."Hohns said selectors wanted the firepower of Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins in the one-day series and had added extra pacemen Jhye Richardson and Andrew Tye in the squad to share the workload.
"With our defence of the ICC Cricket World Cup just 17 months away, we are seeking to get a squad in place that can form the basis of the line-up for that campaign," Hohns said.
"At the same time we want to regain ground in the ODI rankings, given we have slipped from the number one position over the past 12 months.
"There will still be further opportunities for players to force their way into the reckoning for the squad to go to England and Wales in 2019.
"But the sooner we can settle on our best combination and get them playing together and in form on a regular basis then the better our chances will be of retaining the trophy." AFP
Australias ODI squad: Steve Smith (capt), David Warner, Patrick Cummins, Aaron Finch, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Chris Lynn, Mitchell Marsh, Tim Paine, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Andrew Tye, Adam Zampa.

MTI's reflections  for the new year
"Humanly, on an on-going basis, we can only be awake about 16-17 hours in a day. This has not changed much with time. But the choice of things we can do it a day, be it food, entertainment, socializing, travelling, etc. (and the sub choices within each of these) have exploded. This has several implications for the way we live today:
"We are over-consuming almost everything and we have so much of idling/low utilization assets, from cars to wardrobes, from appliances to apps.
"Because we are over-consuming, we have to work harder and more competitively, to pay for these. This in turn increases stress in our lives. This is evident by the alarming increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases that are lifestyle induced.
"But we cannot slow down if even if we wish to, because the commercial organizations that we work for have to show year-on-year increases in the top-line and bottom-line. So do governments regards the economic growth. This forces us to push consumers to buy more, use more and those in industries like healthcare hope they suffer more. Of course, two of the biggest industries in the world, i.e., arms and ammunition, hope we fight more and Media, hope there is more sensations each day.
"Government, in pursuits of votes, are pushed to borrow more to prop up economies.
"All of the above, by virtue of the economic and commercial systems we are an integral part of, are forced to grow year on year for ever. But, it is very unlikely that our environment can sustain this.
"Mother Nature continues to give us grave signals, although the President of the USA is yet to warm up to it.
"How long can we continue this way What will make us change Personally, would like to see a reverse to a far more simpler, sustainable way of life, but the system we are all part of works against it. But that should not be an excuse for the I that wants to make a change.
"Its about striking a balance, ensuring that our healthy ambitions stop short of greed, our self-esteem stops short of destructive ego and our quest for comfort stops short of materialism.
"May the new year bring you enlightenment."

Munro blasts record century as New Zealand crush West Indies
Mount Maunganui: Colin Munro smashed his way into the record books as New Zealand crushed the West Indies by 119 runs in the final Twenty20 at Mount Maunganui on Wednesday to sweep the series.
Munro, with a rollicking 104 off 53 deliveries, became the first player to hit three centuries in international Twenty20 cricket as New Zealand posted an imposing 243 for five, their highest Twenty20 total.
The West Indies reply began disastrously with openers Chadwick Walton and Chris Gayle out without scoring in Tim Southee's opening over.
Their innings folded at 124 for nine in 16.3 overs with Shai Hope unable to bat after being injured while fielding.
It ended a disappointing tour for the West Indies with New Zealand winning both Tests, the three one-day internationals and two Twenty20s with one match washed out.
With the West Indies two down for one run after five balls, Andre Fletcher did his best to rebuild the innings and ensured the tourists kept up with New Zealand's run rate for the first eight overs.
But the introduction of spin saw Fletcher's innings come to an end. He was bowled by Ish Sodhi for 46, and the momentum fizzled.
From 80 for four after eight overs, the last five West Indies wickets fell for 44 runs in 51 balls.
Munro was in majestic form as he blasted away at the top of the New Zealand innings.
He faced 53 balls, smacking 10 sixes and three fours.
With previous centuries against India and Bangladesh, he moved ahead of a group of four players, including Gayle, who have two international T20 centuries.
Munro and Martin Guptill gave New Zealand a flying start to their innings with a century partnership.
It was a timely return to form for Guptill with 63 off 38 balls after struggling against the West Indies earlier in the series.
Rayad Emrit, selected to make his T20 debut two months short of his 37th birthday, celebrated by breaking the New Zealand opening stand when he had Guptill caught behind.
Munro lasted until the first ball of the last over when he drove a Carlos Brathwaite full toss straight to Shimron Hetmyer at long on. AFP

Namal fears that illegal transactions will be revealed : Minister
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said MP Namal Rajapaksa is skeptical about the foreign visits of FCID officials because he fears that all their illegal transactions based in foreign countries will be revealed.
The minister made these remarks at the Cabinet press conference yesterday at the Government Information Department, responding to a question raised by a journalist about MP Namal Rajapaksas statement that if they come to power, necessary action would be taken against FCID officials over their frequent foreign trips.
The FCID has already found several documents related to their transactions in foreign countries such as Dubai. We will reveal the full details of the transactions soon. Once their account details are revealed, we will see how they come to power, he said.
He further said that they are often questioning about it because they wanted to know the progress made by the FCID and what transactions they have found so far.
When asked about the GMOA's recent objection to the decision made by the appointed committee with regard to the SAITM issue, Minister Senaratne said the GMOA was also a part of it and that they unanimously agreed to the decision.
We shall see if they start a strike or a protest. It is the view of the GMOA, not all doctors. They first agreed to the decisions and now they seem to oppose, he said.
Dr. Harsha de Silva and the committee comprised of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Higher Education Ministry, Health Ministry and GMOA, Medical Faculty Lecturers Association and the Medical Faculty Students' Parents Association were the observers.
He said by January 15, the final transaction pertaining to the SAITM issue will be completed. Minister Senaratne said it is the responsibility of the SLMC to decide on what needs to be done to the students and that has no connection with Dr. Silvas committee.
Therefore, the SLMC decided that the students need to undergo training for nearly eight months covering the specialties and subspecialties. The registration will be provided after conducting an oral exam to test the standard of students, he said.

Oil trades near strongest levels since 2015
Oil prices posted their strongest opening to a year since 2014 on Tuesday, with crude rising to mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded flat at about $60.40 by 1200 GMT after hitting $60.74 earlier in the day, their highest since June 2015. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, were also flat at around $66.80 after hitting a May 2015 high of $67.29 a barrel earlier in the day.
It was the first time since January 2014 that the two crude oil benchmarks opened the year above $60 per barrel. Growing unrest in Iran set the table for a bullish start to 2018, the U.S.-based Schork Report said in a note to clients on Tuesday.
Geopolitical risks are clearly back on the crude oil agenda after having been absent almost entirely since the oil market ran into a surplus in the second half of 2014, Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, said, also citing Kurdistan and Libya. Even without the unrest in Iran, which is a major oil exporter, market sentiment was bullish.
Falling inventories globally and strong economic growth offset the restart of the Forties pipeline and the resumption of production following a pipeline outage in Libya, said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.
Oil markets have been supported by a year of production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia.
U.S. production impact
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20% from historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels. However, rising U.S. production is somewhat hampering the outlook into 2018.
U.S. tight oil production growth warrants close monitoring as it could spoil OPECs market-balancing efforts, pushing the market into surplus in 2018, Barclays bank said. U.S. oil production has risen by almost 16% since mid-2016, to 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year. The Hindu News

Pathfinder Foundation inaugurates Centre for the Law of the Sea
The Pathfinder Foundation commenced the New Year by inaugurating its 'Centre for the Law of the Sea (CLS) at Riverpoint, Peliyagoda.
Milinda Moragoda Founder, Pathfinder Foundation officially released an occasional paper containing a draft Code of Conduct for the Indian Ocean at the organizations New Year celebration held at the MMBL-Pathfinder Group headquarters yesterday.
This draft Code of Conduct is open for public discussion and is accessible on the Pathfinder Foundation website: www.pathfinderfoundation.org
The draft Code of Conduct for the Indian Ocean was created to assist consideration of the idea by the 21 littoral States members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). The draft is based on the Djibouti Code of Conduct concluded by the East African countries in 2009, and the Yaound Code of Conduct signed by the West African countries in 2013.
The former was aimed at providing maritime security to counter piracy and armed robbery against ships by 9 states in the Western Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden and Red Sea areas.
The latter concluded by 25 countries in Western and Central Africa, seeks to eliminate armed robbery against ships and illicit maritime activity. These two Codes of Conduct were adopted under the aegis of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
President Maithripala Sirisena, when speaking at the IORA Summit held in Jakarta in May 2017, called on member states to work out a stable legal framework to deal with drug smuggling by sea, while maintaining principles of freedom of navigation.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, referring to wider security concerns, proposed adoption of a Code of Conduct to apply in the Indian Ocean in several forums, including the 2nd Indian Ocean Conference held in Colombo September last year.
In an address at Deakin University in Australia last February 2017, he observed that there had been a massive transfer of economic and military power to the Asian countries of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific and emphasized the need for a Code of Conduct on freedom of navigation to be observed in the Indian Ocean, adding that any such proposal would also need to deal with the escalation in human smuggling, illicit drug trafficking and the relatively new phenomenon of maritime terrorism.
Sri Lanka is not alone in expressing concern over recent developments in the Indian Ocean. Speaking at the 2nd Indian Ocean Conference, Indias External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj emphasizing the need to develop an arrangement that strengthens the culture of cooperation and collective action and said that the Indian Ocean is prone to non-traditional security threats like piracy, smuggling, maritime terrorism, illegal fishing, and trafficking of humans and narcotics. We realize that to effectively combat transnational security challenges across the Indian Ocean, including those posed by non-state actors, it is important to develop a security architecture that strengthens the culture of cooperation and collective action.
The list of issues raised by President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Indias External Affairs Minister Swaraj is significant and piracy in the Indian Ocean became so rampant around 2009, it resulted in the stationing of multinational Naval Task Groups and warships of several individual navies of major maritime users of the Indian Ocean.
Some of these activities caused political and security concerns to some countries. In addition, merchant ships operating in the high-risk area in the western Indian Ocean too were compelled to implement additional security measures such as privately contracted on board security personnel and hardening of vessels against possible attacks by pirates.
Development of a Code of Conduct could be a time-consuming exercise as 21 countries, who are members of IORA, would need to negotiate the final document. The intention of the CLS is to facilitate such a process and building of consensus leading to a final text, which would be acceptable to the Indian Ocean community.
The CLS has become a reality with a generous contribution made by Moragodage Christopher W. Pinto, former Legal Adviser and head of the Legal Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who also served as Sri Lankas Ambassador to Germany and Austria.
A former Chairman of the United Nations International Law Commission, he was later appointed Secretary-General of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, at the invitation of both countries concerned.
The Moragoda Trust established by him has funded internationally recognized professors of Public International Law to teach at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University in their areas of specialization since 2014.
Milinda Moragoda, Founder, Pathfinder Foundation; Bernard Goonetilleke, Chairman, CLS; Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director, CLS; Lalith Weeratunga, Senior Fellow Pathfinder Foundation; Luxman Siriwardena, Executive Director, Pathfinder Foundation; Nandana Devage, Director MMBL Pathfinder; and K.D. Liyanage, Director Legal, MMBL-Pathfinder, participated at the event.

Plastic Packaging provides 6 mn  compostable bags to supermarkets
A pioneer Sri Lankan compostable and biodegradable film manufacturing company, the Plastic Packaging Ltd has supplied over six million compostable bags to the local market including three major supermarkets in the country, Keells, Cargills and Laugfs, during the past three-month period.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Plastic Packaging Chairman Dr Mervyn Dias said from the time of the governments decision of banning the use of high density polythene bags and food wrapping sheets, the supermarkets started providing the option of compostable and biodegradable bags to their customers.
The 30-year old Plastic Packaging has not only been catering to local consumers especially from last year but also exporting biodegradable food wrapping sheets and bags to the UK and few other European markets during the past ten years.
Dias further said although the company manufactured 10 micron bin liners to the UK market during the early stage, now the thickness has been reduced from 10 microns to 3 microns.
Although the thickness was reduced, the strength of the bag is maintained to the maximum, he said.
He further highlighted that they manufacture these polythene free compostable and biodegradable bags according to the UK approved EN 13432 standard.
He said all compostable wrapping papers and bags currently used by Sri Lankan consumers are manufactured according to the standard and unlike polythene, these compostable bags gets composted within 180 days in an industrial composting unit or the bags can be disposed to the home composting unit.
He said polythene bags take over 500 years to degrade and such a situation badly pollutes the environment and causes heavy damage not only to human beings and other living beings but also to fauna and flora.
Dias further said that no exports could be done to any EU country without this certification which is carried out accurately in independent laboratories in Belgium.
His factory is now manufacturing products to cater to the domestic market in addition to their overseas customers. We currently supply compostable and biodegradable bags and sheets to supermarkets, shops and also to customers who request compostable food sheets and bags.

Port of Colombo  handles 6 millionth TEU
Port of Colombo handled its 6 millionth TEU on December 22. A special function was held at the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to celebrate the handling of the 6 million TEU mark. Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe attended as the Chief Guest of the event.
Speaking at the occasion, the Minister stated that it was commendable to witness that the Port of Colombo has achieved great feats through public private collaboration. Deviating from the traditional competition, Sri Lanka Ports Authority controlled Jaya Container Terminal, privately owned SAGT and CICT together have proved to be a success story. "We can continue to make the Port of Colombo the hub port in the region, the Minister said.
He also thanked all officials, staff and employees of SLPA, SAGT, CICT, shipping agents, freight forwarding agencies and stakeholders who always contributed in numerous ways to elevate the position of the Port of Colombo to higher standards among the container ports of the world.
Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake, Chairman of SLPA, speaking at the occasion, stated that it was a historic milestone to Sri Lanka Ports Authority as it was the collective effort of SLPA with the JCT, SAGT and the CICT handling 6 million containers for a year in the Port of Colombo.
We have to be mindful of the marketing challenges we are expected to face. The commencement of operations of the East Terminal of the Colombo South Harbour in near future will see further increased efficiency in the Port of Colombo to attract more ships at its deep draft berths, Dr. Dissanayake added.
The Port of Colombo marked the operation of its first TEU in 1973. Accordingly, the construction of Jaya Container Terminals stage I was completed in 1985. The completion of the stage II of the JCT in 1987, stages III and IV in 1995 and 1996 respectively marked the increase of operation volumes of the Port of Colombo. Commencement of the South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) at the Port of Colombo took place in 1999. In 2002, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, SLPA initiated the construction of the Colombo Port Expansion Project (CPEP) which is known as the Colombo South Harbour today.
The new harbour was constructed with plans to the ever-increasing ultra large container vessels. Its first terminal, known as the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), was completed with the investment of over US$ 500 million as a PPP loan and on BOT model. The CICT of Colombo South Harbour came into operation in 2013.
With the rapid development of port infrastructure including the construction of new terminals and the public private partnership in operations at the Port of Colombo, the handling capacity of the Port dramatically increased.
The Port of Colombo marked the achievement of handling 1 million TEUs in 1995. Although it took almost nine years to reach the mark of 2 million TEUs collaboratively with the SAGT in 2004, the Port handled 3 million TEUs in 2006, 4 million TEUs in 2010 and 5 million TEUs collaboratively with the CICT in 2015.
Together with the latest developments in the Sri Lankan port sector, the 06 millionth TEUs mark this year is recorded through aggressive marketing strategies implemented in collaboration with the SAGT, CICT and the public sector controlled JCT to offer a world class service with the maximum customer satisfaction and the minimum vessel turnaround time.
SLPA being the landlord, regulator and the port operator, together with other terminals, has been able to attract more main lines and feeder services to the Port of Colombo in 2017.
With the latest initiatives implemented by the SLPA, under the guidance of Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe and under the management led by SLPA Chairman Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake, all sectors of port operation show a rapid growth compared to similar periods during the past.
A number of processes are currently being implemented in all commercial ports around the country under the purview of SLPA to realize the vision of the government to develop Sri Lanka as the premier maritime hub of the region.
Higher officials of SLPA including the Vice Chairman P.G. Dasanayake, Managing Director H.D.A.S. Premachandra, officials of the SAGT and CICT, officials of shipping lines and agents, officials of freight forwarding agencies and a number of staff members and employees of SLPA and other stakeholding institutions attended the event.

President makes special statement on Bond Commission report
May the Triple Gem Bless You!
First of all, I offer my best wishes for the New Year.
As the people of the country are eagerly waiting with high interest, I wish to make a statement on the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Issue of Treasury Bonds of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which was appointed by me taking into consideration the opinion of the people regarding allegations of corrupt practices and misdeeds during the period 2015 and 2016. Its report was handed over to me on December 30, 2017.
The Commission was mandated to inquire into the issuance of Treasury Bonds during the period from 1st February 2015 to 31st March 2016 to find out actual facts and to make recommendations as to the steps to be implemented in the future.
I thank the Supreme Court Judges and former Auditor-General who functioned as members of the Commission and its Secretary and the staff, and those who assisted the work of the Commission, Attorney Generals Department, Police Department and other relevant organisations and individuals.
The Commission is of the opinion that similar incidents as revealed in the Commission Report had happened even in 2008. The Commission recommends that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka should first conduct a forensic audit with regard to the alleged fraud and corrupt practices from 2008 on wards, and based on such findings, legal actions should be taken.
Commission states that funds of the Employment Provident Fund (EPF) were lost mostly during that period.
The Commission has submitted a full report covering the period 2015 and 2016, comprising 1257 pages and it is not an interim report. The Commission has taken 10 months for this task.
I have already submitted this report to Attorney-General and the Commission recommends that the criminal and civil court action must be taken through the Criminal Investigations Department and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
The Commission has clearly stated the structure of the Central Bank, Public Debt Department, direct issuance of Treasury Bonds and the pros and cons of the system of issuance of bonds as well as bond auctions. The report stated that the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has earned profits through means that are not legal, with the involvement of Arjun Mahendran, Bank officials and some external parties.
In the auction held on 27thFebruary 2015 alone, Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made a minimum profit not less than Rs 688 million. The Commission is of the opinion that further investigations could reveal that this amount could even be more than that. As revealed during the investigations, PTL has made an undue profit of Rs.11,145 millions in the secondary market. In this, EPF and other government institutions had lost more than Rs. 8,524 million or Rs. 8.5 billion.
It is stated that senior officials of the Central Bank were inactive before the former Governor of Central Bank, Arjun Mahendran. The report states that, such false decisions have been made because these officers had become inactive.
Mr. Mahendran has made interference into Treasury bond auctions through a process of incorrect and unconventional methods and he was responsible for providing internal information to outsiders. Such conduct has allowed one party to obtain undue monetary gains, the report states.
Recommendations
Members of Monetary Board and Central Bank Governor must be appointed by the Constitutional Council in concurrence of the members. The regulations must be amended accordingly.
The report recommends that there should be highest levels of supervision over the Public Debt Department. As auditing at the Central Bank has not been conducted in a proper manner, the Commission recommends that the Audit Department must be reorganized completely. A Legal Department must be established in the Central Bank and ensure that the Legal Department functions efficiently.
As the Commission did not have the mandate to inquire into Treasury bond issues from 2008 to 2015, the Commission had not done that. However, Commission recommends that there should be an investigation into that period too.
The Commission recommends that the dealings with the Pan Asia Bank and the conduct of Chairman must be investigated into. It also recommends that activities of the EPF must be looked into, and in order to bring the EPF into a proper order, steps must be taken to restructure the EPF.A code of conduct for the officials of the Central Bank must be introduced. The code of conduct for Primary Dealers must be revised and updated.
The Commission has stated that the Attorney General and the Commission to investigate Bribery or Corruption must take the legal actions to implement the recommendations of the Commission.
Under normal circumstances, recovery of money can be done through civil legal action. However, it is a time consuming method. As an alternative, the Commission recommends that a Parliamentary legislation could be passed and the money could be recovered in a speedy manner following a Parliamentary approval. We agree to that recommendation.
The recommendation of the Commission is that all the expenditure occurred for the Commission must be recovered from the Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
I have already submitted a copy of the Commission Report to the Attorney-General and he will identify the persons against whom the legal action must be taken and initiate necessary criminal or civil legal action to implement the recommendations of the Commission.
I wish to clarify here, that a minor amendment to the Bribery or Corruption Commission Act must be enacted to take legal action on the recommendations of the Commission. For this purpose, experts at the Legal Draughtsman are already working on the required amendment.
The steps needed to make the Commission to investigate allegations of Bribery or Corruption more active and efficient should have been done long time ago, and now we are taking required steps for that purpose.
The confidentiality,astuteness and auditing methods of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were extremely weak. There were no tele-recording systems, electronic monitoring or even CCTVs. The current Governor of the Central bank has already taken steps to remove weaknesses and rectify these errors.
The Governor has informed that he has suspended some employees of the Central bank after their malpractices were revealed in the investigations in the Commission and disciplinary actions are being taken against those officers.
I expect the Governor to make a statement in the near future regarding the shortcomings in the Central bank as revealed in the Commission Report.
I urge the Justice Ministry and the Attorney General to take early steps to draft the three bills proposed by the Commission present them to Parliament, in order to make required changes at the Central Bank to ensure such corrupt practices, frauds and malpractices would not take place in the future.
I have informed my Secretary to hold monthly review meetings with the heads of relevant departments and institutions to examine the progress in implementations of the recommendations of the Commission to take legal steps against those individuals and take other required steps in an efficient and speedy manner.
I would like to specifically state here that I would not hesitate to take steps to recover the loss of Rs 11145 million to the government and take legal action against the offenders and punish them.
The sum of Rs 8529 million of the total losses Rs 11,145 million was the funds of the Employees Provident Fund, Mahapola Scholarship Fund, National Savings Bank and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. The balance was from private institutions. Hence the loss to the public sector  EPF, Mahapola, NDB and SLIC was over Rs 8.5 billion. The Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made this profit of Rs 11,145 million within a short period of 5 months.
Finally, especially I would like to mention that this final report must be presented to the Parliament and through this initiative the report must be open to the public. In the future, necessary as well as legal steps in this regard will be taken expeditiously according to the advice from the Attorney General. I kindly request to consider the openness of the facts of this Commission Report and I assure that any hesitation would not occur in filing cases against the offenders. Furthermore, I wish to state that this is the final report of the Commission.
I have previously appointed a Commission and the report of that has been handed over to me. It is the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC).
This Commission carried out their respective duties during the past two and half years. I extend my gratitude to the staff of the Commission and all the institutions including the Secretary and High Court judges for giving their support in this task. Already, 34 reports of that Commission had been handed over to me and recently 17 reports have been handed over and another 17 previously, the 17 reports handed over previously I have submitted to the Attorney General to take necessary actions through relevant institutions.
By now, the Fraud and Corruption Commission, institutions, departments and Police have taken actions to file cases based on the facts of these reports. The report which was handed over to me before two days I will submit to Attorney General within this week to take appropriate actions.Especially I have to mention the actions on this report will be taken in the near future.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges has presented several major facts and it is the responsibility of the Government to implement facts presented at the Commission. I will explain to you regarding those facts for the general public information. Training and appointment of suitable officials as there is lack for skilled well-trained officials to carry out investigation regarding fraud and corruptions. This Commission emphasized that people without required qualifications had been appointed and only the qualified persons should be appointed to essential positions including the State institutions, Authorities and Constitutional Boards.
The Commission revealed that the money spent by the Government for the establishment of this Commission has already been recovered through the cases initiated through the findings of this Commission. A system must be implemented to hearing the cases in the courts in other areas as holding these cases only in Courts in Colombo is causing difficulties for those who travel from distances.
I must states a special thing, before I conclude the facts of these two reports, I saw a great eagerness and inquiring trend among the general public regarding these Commissions. At the same time when the Commissions were appointed, especially before the appointment of the Treasury Bond Commission as well as at the time of appointing this Commission. , the same destiny happen to other Commissions will be happen to this Commission too and I saw in media some in the Parliament and outside the Parliament too commenting that this Commission will be appoint to hidden the prevailing issues. But all of us must be very pleased regarding the fulfillment of duties of these Commissions and again I must thank the judges and all who contributed in this regard for their great service rendered while wining the confidence of the general public.
Finally, I must state regarding the allegations leveled against me by some political parties for appointing these Commissions and I never appointed these commissions targeting any political party. I must specially mention in future when filing cases according to the recommendations and information of these Commissions, individuals belongs to two main political parties will be defendants in the legal process. We must be happy over our independent and impartial Judiciary. I must state all of us will provide our maximum support for this process.
Thank You

It suggests that the Prime Minister should not have done so.The Commission report also observes that he explained that even though the COPE Committee had enough evidence against Arjun Mahendran, no proper action was taken against him at that time.
President Sirisena stated that the Commission has observed that The sum of Rs 8,529 million of the total losses Rs 11,145 million was the funds of the Employees Provident Fund, Mahapola Scholarship Fund, National Savings Bank and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation.
The balance was from private institutions. Hence the loss to the public sector - EPF, Mahapola, NDB and SLIC was over Rs 8.5 billion. The Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made this profit of Rs 11,145 million within a short period of 5 months.
President Sirisena pointed out that, according to the Commission the funds of the EPF were lost mostly during the period from 2008 onwards and based on such findings, legal action should be taken.
He further said said that he is in agreement with the Commissions recommendation to pass a Parliamentary legislation to recover the losses to the government expeditiously. The Commission was quoted recommending that Under normal circumstances, recovery of money can be done through civil legal action. However, it is a time consuming method. As an alternative, the Commission recommends that a Parliamentary legislation could be passed and the money could be recovered in a speedy manner following a Parliamentary approval.
The recommendation of the Commission is that all the expenses of the Commission must be recovered from the Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
In the auction held on 27thFebruary 2015 alone, Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made a minimum profit not less than Rs 688 million. The Commission is of the opinion that further investigations could reveal that this amount could even be more than that. As revealed during the investigations, PTL has made an undue profit of Rs 11,145 millions in the secondary market. In this, EPF and other government institutions had lost more than Rs 8,524 million or Rs 8.5 billion. President Sirisena pointed out.
President Sirisena pointed out that the Commission has observed that the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has earned profits through means that are not legal, with the involvement of Arjun Mahendran, Bank officials and some external parties.
According to the report, the Commission believes that Arjun Mahendran has interfered in the bond issuances with a false and unconventional decision making process. It also holds Arjun Mahendran as one of the responsible persons who have divulged confidential information to outsiders. Thus, the Commission believes that such an act has been in favour of a particular party.
The Commission also recommends a Forensic Audit Examination on the Employment Provident Fund on the basis that it has been misused to find out the amount of losses the fund has incurred.
The Commission recommends the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to conduct a forensic audit with regard to the alleged fraud and corrupt practices from 2008 onwards, on which legal actions should be taken.
The report also identifies parties and individuals who were involved in misusing the EPF. It suggests legal action be taken against persons, including Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena. It further suggests taking Criminal and Civil legal action taken against the responsible state officers involved in the matter while recommending taking steps to recover the losses incurred by the EPF as well.
The Commission also proposes for a new Monetary Law Act and amendments to the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance in order to prevent incidents in the future.

Quick-fire City back in the  groove, Llorente fires Spurs
London Raheem Sterling scored the fastest goal of the Premier League season as leaders Manchester City got back on track with a 3-1 win against Watford on Tuesday, while Fernando Llorente put Tottenham on course for a 2-0 victory at his former club Swansea.
Sterling struck after just 38 seconds before Christian Kabaseles first-half own goal put Pep Guardiolas side in control at Eastlands.
Sergio Aguero made it three as City gave the perfect response after their 18-game winning run was ended in a goalless draw at Crystal Palace on Sunday.
Unbeaten City are 15 points clear of second-placed Manchester United as they continue to turn the title race into a lengthy coronation party.
Guardiola had complained that the hectic festive fixture schedule was a disaster after City striker Gabriel Jesus suffered a knee ligament injury at Palace.
But Guardiola was able to replace the Brazilian with Sergio Aguero, while David Silva returned from a two-game absence.
City, playing their fourth match in 11 days, were ahead inside a minute as Sterling met Leroy Sanes cross with a near-post finish for his 18th goal this season.
Having won 6-0 at Watford in September, City looked on course for another rout in the 13th minute when Watfords Kabasele sliced an attempted clearance into his own net from Kevin De Bruynes cross.
Yet they had to wait 50 minutes to score again as Argentine forward Aguero netted from close-range for his 16th goal of the season. Andre Grays 82nd minute goal for Watford came way too late to avoid a sixth defeat in their last seven league matches.
We played really well. After dropping two points, we spoke about our reaction because big teams drop points but not too much, Guardiola said.
With Harry Kane only fit enough for a place on the bench after illness, former Swansea striker Llorente made his first league start for Tottenham at the rain-lashed Liberty Stadium. Llorente marked the occasion with a 12th minute goal, the Spaniard powering home a header from Christian Eriksens free-kick despite Swanseas appeals for offside. Puddles all over the pitch made it hard for Tottenham to establish their smooth-passing game and Kane, who finished 2017 with consecutive hat-tricks, was sent on for Llorente after 68 minutes.
Dramatic winner
Kane made his presence felt with a perfect pass to Dele Alli and the Tottenham midfielder finished at the second attempt to wrap up the points in the 89th minute.
Tottenham move above Arsenal into fifth place and sit four points behind fourth placed Liverpool with a game in hand.
The weather was horrible but we dominated and tried to play football. Overall I think we were better and deserved the three points, Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said.
Swansea remain bottom of the table as new boss Carlos Carvalhal was beaten for the first time in his second match since replacing the sacked Paul Clement.
Andy Carrolls stoppage-time strike sealed a vital 2-1 win for West Ham against second bottom West Bromwich Albion at the London Stadium. James McCleans deflected shot from the edge of the area put Albion in front in the 30th minute. But Carroll equalised with a bullet header in the 59th minute, his first goal since April.
Carroll followed up his opener with a dramatic winner from close-range, lifting David Moyes side out of the bottom three.
West Brom are winless in 20 top-flight fixtures -- only three clubs have endured longer runs without a victory in the Premier League: Derby with 32, Sunderland with 26 and Norwich with 21.
Crystal Palace came from behind to win 2-1 at Southampton thanks to Luka Milivojevics late goal.
Palace fell behind in the 17th minute as Saints striker Shane Long scored for the first time since February last year.
Longs fine finish raced into the top corner from Jeremy Pieds cross.
But Palace equalised in the 69th minute when Scotland midfielder James McArthur volleyed home from Christian Bentekes header.
And Serbia midfielder Milivojevic redeemed himself for missing a last-minute penalty against Manchester City at the weekend as his long-range curler in the 80th minute lifted Palace away from the relegation zone.

Raids on Foreigners Only hotels, managements to be prosecuted
The Tourist Police, with the assistance of the Local Government bodies, the Tourism Development Authority, and the Tourist Board, would conduct raids on restaurants, villas, and tourist lodges in the Southern tourist belt that cater only to foreigners and discriminate Sri Lankans saying Foreigners Only, under the directive of the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
The managements of tourist facilities who were found discriminating Sri Lankans during the raids will be prosecuted under the common law and Tourist Promotion law and their trade permits will be withdrawn.
A crucial discussion was held at the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry chaired by Minister Musthapha, where the decision to prevent what he described as the outcome of a slavish or colonial mentality was taken.
Minister Musthapha pointed out that a large number of villas, restaurants and tourist lodges from Wadduwa to Tangalle have put up boards saying Tourists Only in front of their facilities on the Southern Coast and restricted access to Sri Lankans, which is a violation of the Constitution, human rights, and confronts the dignity and self-respect of Sri Lankans.
This cannot be accepted. We have experienced second-hand treatment at times in certain countries as Sri Lankans. It is impossible to keep exclusive areas for tourists alone and bar Sri Lankans, which is an affront to our national dignity, Minister Musthapha added.
Officials of the Tourist Board and Tourism Development Authority pointed out that many of these establishments had not been duly registered with the Tourist Board and run on a Trade License obtained from the local government authority, which is also illegal.
Officers from the Tourist Police pointed out that the managements of these establishments tell when questioned that local tourists behave indecently and harass tourists and therefore, they have barred Sri Lankan tourists from their facilities.
However, it was revealed at the discussion that those excuses were a ruse to prove their point, and these kinds of incidents happen rarely.
The villas, lodges, and restaurants discriminating Sri Lankans were run mainly in Wadduwa, Hikkaduwa, Galle, Mirissa, Weligama, Habaraduwa, and Unawatuna, it was revealed.
Raids would be started from today and would continue until they are brought to justice. Officials of the Tourist Police will carry out raids with the help of officials of the respective local government body, Tourism Promotion Authority, and Sri Lanka Tourist Board.
The programme to eliminate this discrimination against Sri Lankans will be expanded to tourist areas in other parts of the country with the experience gained from these raids, Minister Musthapha added.
It was also revealed at the discussion that some tourist facilities with Foreigners Only tags are owned by foreigners.
They do not pay taxes and income is taken out of the country without any contribution to the tourist industry or the economy.
It was also revealed that there are 14 tourist villas and restaurants at Weligama alone that cater only to foreigners.
A senior police officer pointed out that a person or establishment that discriminates against a Sri Lankan can be prosecuted under the provisions of the Constitution and Criminal Code.
The discussion was attended by Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Ministry Secretary Esala Weerakone, Local Government and Provincial Councils Secretary Kamal Pathmasiri, Southern Provincial Council Chief Secretary R. C. De Soyza, and representatives of the Tourist Hotel Association, Sri Lanka Tourist Board, and Tourism Promotion Authority.

Sales of bonds look set  to rise this year in China
More Chinese companies are expected to sell bonds in overseas markets this year, continuing the trend in 2017 as they seek to take advantage of lower financing costs in offshore markets and a stronger domestic currency, analysts said.
Offshore bond issuance by Chinese companies saw explosive growth last year, with the total funds raised by Chinese companies expected to exceed $190 billion, more than seven times higher than in 2016.
Such a trend will continue in 2018 as Chinese companies look to diversify their funding channels with lower financing costs, said Ivan Chung, a senior analyst at credit ratings agency Moodys Investors Service.
Onshore interest rates have risen steadily over the past year, with the yield of 10-year treasury bonds reaching 3.9 percent and the average interest rate for corporate bonds jumping to 6.72 percent, according to financial data provider Wind Info.
Tighter liquidity at home, higher financing costs and loosened regulation, that made it easier for Chinese companies to sell offshore bonds, were the main reasons for the surge of bond issuance in overseas markets, analysts said.
As the onshore market experienced rising bond yields, the regulatory reforms facilitated onshore issuers to switch to offshore issuance and tapped the US dollar market in 2017, Chung said.
Analysts said liquidity conditions will likely remain tight in China as the authorities will continue with a prudent monetary policy to curb financial risks and asset bubbles, which means the fundraising cost for domestic companies will stay at a relatively high level. They added that the expectation of a stronger yuan will also encourage more companies to raise dollar-denominated bonds in overseas markets. Chung said greater demand by international investors for long-term and high-yield bonds, better liquidity of overseas markets as well as the desire to penetrate into international business will continue to drive offshore bond issuance by Chinese issuers. While real estate developers have been the main driver of offshore bond issuance, public finance issuers such as State-owned companies that serve as the financing vehicles for local Chinese governments will join the trend in 2018, tapping overseas capital to fill the financing gap for civil infrastructure projects.
Investors have shown growing interest in offshore bonds issued by local government financing vehicles as they could offer good yields with relatively low default risks. We expect more such bond issuance in 2018, said Samantha Xie, China head of debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
But Cheng Chunshu, deputy director of Golden Credit Rating International, said the financing cost for Chinese companies in overseas markets will also rise this year as the US Federal Reserve continues with its rate rise plan, which will narrow the gap between onshore and offshore interest rates.

SLCPI welcomes move  to up drug prices
The Sri Lanka Chamber of the Pharmaceutical Industry (SLCPI), in a statement to media, said they were grateful for the effective action taken by the Ministry of Health in increasing the price of drugs by 5%.
Implemented in October 2016 on 48 molecules, the price ceiling impacted the pharmaceutical industry, particularly as importers had to reimburse retailers and distributors for the stocks held at the time of the pricing ceiling and in support of effective implementation.
Since March 2014, when all pharmaceuticals products were gazetted as essential items, prices of most drugs have remained unchanged despite the devaluation of Lankan rupee from 130 to 155 for 1 US dollar.
Most pharma companies did not adjust prices expecting a viable long-term pricing mechanism as envisaged in the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Act, thereby sustaining losses year on year. The governments increase of prices of 48 drugs was well considered and appropriate, given global market conditions. Globally, the disease burden on countries and economies has been shifting to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and lung-related diseases.
Addressing the NCD burden will call for new and innovative medicines, including biologics, and new forms of treatment and therapies, said Shyam Sathasivam, President of SLCPI.
Almost 90% of pharmaceutical products are imported and the exchange rate impacts significantly on the pricing. The exchange devaluation of the Lankan rupee has greatly increased the cost of pharmaceutical products causing a risk to its continuity, he stated.
SLCPI asserts that access to healthcare includes access to medicines. It is important that healthcare be affordable; much of healthcare is already very affordable in Sri Lanka. Currently, around 80% of inpatient care and 50% of outpatient care is provided by the public system, while the private sector accounts for the remaining.
Capping prices on much-needed medicines for cancer and cardiovascular diseases, for example, in the name of making them affordable could result in their not being available for the people that need them. Many of those medicines have to be imported, since we do not make them. In raising prices even marginally, the government has balanced affordability with availability so that the patients receive the benefits of both, SLCPI said.

Starc ready to go
Sydney: Pace spearhead Mitchell Starc is in line to return to Australias bowling line-up with second spinner Ashton Agar unlikely to play in Thursdays final Ashes Test against England.
Captain Steve Smith said Starc was ready to go after bowling this week in the nets after missing the drawn fourth Melbourne Test with a bruised heel.
Starcy has pulled up pretty well this morning and he says hes ready to go. I guess thats a good indication, Smith told reporters on Wednesday.
Agars chances of playing in his fifth Test, bowling in spin tandem with Nathan Lyon, have also been downgraded with extra grass on the Sydney Cricket Ground pitch.
The wickets got a fair bit of grass and looks to be a pretty good wicket, Smith said.
Id say well probably opt for just the one spinner. Nathans done a terrific job throughout this series and Id say well go down that route.
Australia have already clinched the Ashes with an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-Test series ahead of the Sydney finale.
Left-armer Starc is the leading wicket-taker in the series with 19 despite only playing three Tests and will boost Australias pace attack after he missed out in Melbourne, giving way to Jackson Bird who went wicketless.
Smith, who has dominated the series with three centuries in his tally of 604 runs in six innings at an astonishing average of 151, has been troubled this week by a sore back, but said he will play.
A little bit stiff but nothing I havent dealt with before, Smith said.
Ill have a good hit today, a catch, and Ill be fine tomorrow.
Smith has spent more than 31 hours at the batting crease against England in this series, becoming Australias first captain to score 600 or more runs in an Ashes campaign since Don Bradman. The 604 runs Smith has scored is the fourth-most by a captain in an Ashes series, with the 810 Bradman scored in 1936-37 the high mark.
Another century in Sydney will see him join Bradman, Herbert Sutcliffe and Wally Hammond as the only men to score four hundreds in the same Ashes series. The Australia skipper averages 63.55 in his 60 Tests which places him only behind Bradmans pinnacle of 99.94. AFP
Teams (probable):

Australia - David Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith (capt), Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Tim Paine, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon.
England - Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, James Vince, Joe Root (capt), Dawid Malan, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Mason Crane, James Anderson.

Style, tips and trends for 2018
Fashion makes the world go round and round. The fashion meter changes by the day and social media applications like Instagram and Snapchat makes everyone look flawless. Here is a glimpse at whats in and whats out in 2018.
Eyes
Glittery eyes: Its no surprise that were feeling the glitter moment thats happening right now. While it is prime time to turn up the sparkle factor, this trend will stay long after holiday party season has come and gone. Whether its a wash of a subtle shimmery shadow across lids, a chunkier glitter embellishment in the inner corners, or sparkly eyeliner along the top or lower lash line, you no longer need a special occasion to break out the bling.
Lips
Red hot lips: Red lipstick isn't a trend, but the way people are wearing it certainly is. Rather than pairing the shade with cat-eyes or bold eye makeup, makeup artists are taking a less-is-more approach. At the Spring 2018 shows for Temperley London, Haider Ackermann, Blumarine, and Max Mara, models walked the runway in bright crimson lipstick and barely-there makeup.
Peach lips: We hagve spotted peach tones all over this season. Use the shade to complement any eye look, or pair it with matching peach blush and shadow for a monochromatic effect.
Cupid's bow: Makeup artists have been applying touches of carefully-placed highlighter to Cupid's bows to fake fuller, juicier lips for decades. Lately, though, they have taken the tried-a true hack and opting for in-your-face metallic and glitter finishes that don't just highlight the area, but make it the focal point of a look.
Glass lips: The beauty world's obsession with all things dewy has turned to lips. You have likely seen images floating around of juicy, heavily-glossed lips that toe the line between a healthy pucker.
Skin
The difference between matte and dewy skin has to do with the finish that the skin leaves; the amount of shine and radiance. Matte skin is void of any excess oil. It has a more velvety finish that pulls light inward, often with a powdery texture. Dewy skin has an almost moist appearance. It has natural oils that reflect light and create a radiance.
Matte skin is good for people with excessively oily skin or acne/breakouts. People with this concern usually want to minimize the oil and prefer a matte formula that wont add more moisture.
Dewy skin is my favorite. It is young, fresh, and vibrant. It works well on any age including mature skin as it moisturizes and reflects light, softening any fine lines or imperfections. Dewy skin gives the appearance of health and an active life.
Hair trends for women
Fake bangs: Not into the idea of fully committing to bangs It's easy to make fake ones for the night just by flipping over a section of hair from the back of your head, and putting the rest up in a top knot.
Long, long locks: Kim Kardashian channeled her inner Cher by rocking long, luscious hair - ad it works! You will probably need help from extensions to get the full length like Kim, but if you decide to grow your hair out instead, be sure to trim it every few months to keep your strands healthy.
Tow-toned blonde: Stars like Selena Gomez are going into the new year with newly-blonde locks. But if you want to do the same, that doesn't have to mean completely abandoning your original hue. If you're changing your colour, keep the roots dark underneath and have your stylist blend out the top to a bright blonde or silvery grey.
Barely-there waves: No need to spend hours on your hair. Barely-there waves are in, and they are super easy to master. Just grab your straightener and create a few subtle waves here and there, and you're good to go.
High and tight pony: It is easy to beat humidity when you sport a high pony. Slick your hair back, secure with a hair tie and some spray, and go about your day looking totally chic and cool. The heat doesn't even stand a chance.
Super blunt bobs: The return of strong architecture is back with super blunt lines in bobs. Women who became comfortable going from long hair to mid-length hair have now built up enough courage to go shorter.
Hair trends for men
There are so many new hair trends for guys this year including fresh looks, updated classics and even some old favorites. What is old is new again and vice versa. There are new men's hairstyles that reinvent older styles, like the crop that is an update of the Caesar cut. And classic styles with updates like the pomp fade. These cool men's hairstyles range from fades to tapers, buzz cuts to man buns.
Haircuts with shaved sides are cool, clean cut and easy to wear. Whether it's an undercut or fade, shaved sides emphasize hair on top and make hair seem thicker. Fade haircuts taper down from short to shorter or down to the skin. These shaved sides haircuts have mid to high fades. Undercuts are similar to high fades because they shave hair from the top of the temples down but it is all one length.
Nails
Darker hues: A darker hue like cobalt blue or burgundy is perfect for the colder months. It is sophisticated and flatters all nail shapes and lengths.
Minimalism: Less is more. Play with simple embellishments, nail tape, and negative space for subtle art that's fashion forward.
Glitz and glamour: There is no time like New Years to go all out with disco ball nails, If disco ball nails are a bit too much, you can always audible for a sparkly shimmer in a classic silver.
Bridal hair and make up trends
Bold up dos, plaits, waves and defined eyes were big on the catwalks at New York fashion week. While last season's trends aren't going anywhere, this season saw a new take on some of our favourites. Capes are still going strong, but this season they've been upgraded from capelet to full-on princess cape.
Off-the-shoulder dresses are still everywhere and ultraflattering, but designers put a new spin on sleeves for them. Ladylike mid-length dresses have us all seeing visions of Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face.
From princess-inspired capes to detachable sleeves, tea-length ladylike frocks, and even shorts, these are the wedding-dress trends of 2018.

Trending e-Courts
According to recent reports, Sri Lanka is exploring the possibility of introducing paperless e-Court services. Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala has shown keen interest on the concept after having a conversation with a visiting Malaysian Minster - Azalina Othman said.
Although the e-Court system is quite new to our country, it has been adopted by policymakers around the world to increase efficiency in the courts and to guarantee fair and speedy trials.
An e-Court (or Electronic Court) is a location, which has a well-developed IT infrastructure, in which matters of law are resolved upon, with the participation of qualified Judge or Judges. The system uses minimum amount of paper work from the moment a case is filed until its disposal.
With e-Courts, information is captured and passed on digitally, case management is automated, correspondence and payments are done electronically and forms are created to simplify and streamline court proceedings. All these are available online to court users.
The e-Court system will offer considerable potential to improve the way courts operate incourt management, case management, case allocation, record keeping, archiving, the recording of witness testimony, the presentation of evidence and court reporting.
It also will improve the systems that assist judges and other key professionals, through the provision of databases of current and past court decisions and legislation and electronic legal information and internal communication systems.
Acceptance
But will the concept of e-courts, be successful in Sri Lanka
To answer this question, we should know where do we stand in our e-Government Readiness Index, a composite measure of the capacity and willingness of economies to use e-government for development. This index is given by UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Our current (EGDI) E-Government Readiness Index, is 0.5445 with a rank 79, out of 193 countries. It is a good jump from 115th rank two years back. Our improvement is noteworthy, and compared with other countries, we are in a position to start planning for e-Courts system in Sri Lanka.
Advantages and drawbacks
It is obvious that there are a number of advantages of e-Courts:
(1) The speed of court proceedings. Minimal paperwork. All actions automated therefore process speed improves.
(2) Information available: 24/7 access to registries and court documents. It would be available to the attorneys, parties and the general on-line.
(3) Easy filing of documents  Registered attorneys can file their case document directly from their home or office. They can create a docket sheet and update it immediately, when the documents are filed.
(4) Increased transparency: This is because litigants can also access the system.
(5) High document security: This is guaranteed by a high-tech information technology system.
(6) Better court management  E-courts would help in the computerization of work flow management in courts. Thus, it would help to create a better court and case management.
Of course, there are also a few drawbacks of the system.
(1) Complicated process - The process of e-filing a document is a difficult process. All the evidence cannot be produced in a digital format.
(2) Lack of techno legal expertise  This inadequacy can be a hindrance to implement an e-Court system in Sri Lanka unless corrective action is taken.
(3) Lack of funds  The project of e-Court involves a fair amount of expenditure. It involves the use of a lot of IT equipment and infrastructures. However, this is not an issue.
Budget
Concerns about budget and technology limitations are among the most common reasons for not implementing e-Court features. That should not prevent us from looking into e-Courts.
Rwanda and Tanzania, two countries with Gross National Income per capita is less than 25% of Sri Lanka, have also started computerizing their courts. Tanzanias project received funds from several donors and provided the judiciary with modern information technology and training for judges and staff. Rwandas Strategic Plan of the Supreme Court has recruited new court officers well trained in the use of information technology. Thanks to donor funds, the country now has an e-filing system, electronic records management system and legal information portal.
e-Courts can be implemented with donor assistance, and reforms can be inspired by peer learning from leading economies. The question which pops into anyones mind is what were we doing all this time.
Malaysian experience
Malaysia has implemented an ambitious computerization of its courts. In late 2008, with the appointment of a new chief justice, Malaysia initiated reforms targeting judicial delays and court backlogs. The results were astonishing. For example, 98 per cent of the Commercial Court cases were disposed within nine months. Cases which exceeded the nine months were disposed in a year. The Malaysian judicial system was also recommended by the World Bank for adoption by judiciaries facing similar problems and among countries which visited and adopted the practice were Sri Lanka, Thailand, Brunei, Nepal, Sweden and Taiwan.
e-Court system in Malaysia has six main types of mechanisms.
(VCS) Video Conferencing System: VCS allows virtual court proceedings to be conducted between two or more geographical locations. Witnesses and experts required to appear in court can conveniently and economically give evidence from anywhere in the country or the world - saving not only on time, but also on airfare and accommodation costs.
VCS is also used for protected witnesses in the case of rape or cases involving children under the age of 18.
(CMS) Case Management System: CMS allows court officials to manage the information and workflow of cases from registration to judgment. The system also features overall calendars of court activities as well as a master-listing module to allow for easy scheduling, tracking and viewing of cases and judges.
(CRT) Court Recording and Transcription System: During court hearings, the Court Recording & Transcription System (CRT) facilitates the recording and tracking of audio and video in order to ease the development of court-transcripts of the proceedings.
E-Filling: The e-Registration & e-Filing System allows the electronic filing of court cases and legal documents throughout court proceedings and enables legal firms to monitor the whole flow of cases, from registration to disposition.
(CAP)Community and Advocate Portal System: CAP is the primary gateway for the Court to reach its external customers and stakeholders. Through CAP, information such as general court information, announcements, news, cause lists and trial judgements is made accessible.
(CARE): Court-Advocate Resource Engagement System:CARE System enables the systematic and organised sequencing of the multiple court hearings of the day.
Solutions
The implementation of e-Court project helped Malaysia in clearing the backlogs within a short period of time. Malaysias Chief Justice TunMdRaus Sharif said, No doubt we have made a good progress thus far, but reform is a continuous process. Our immediate concern is to dispose old cases which are more than a year or longer, while on long term, we intend to concentrate on the capacity building through continuous Training of Judges.
Justice must not only be done, but also seen to be done, he further said.
e-Court solutions could unquestionably improve the transparency of court processes and speed up the flow of information through various organs of the Sri Lankan judicial system. They will also make the system much more open, both to public inquiry and to the entities with which it regularly communicates. In many countries, internet-based distance learning courses for judges, other court staff, Attorneys, public defenders and prosecutors are conducted with facilities for video conferencing.
We are well behind with many other developing countries on computerization of our judiciary. Its time we wake up. The good news is, if we are going ahead with the implementation, we can make use of the experience of those countries.

Trump administration may send back  more than 500,000 Indian tech workers
WASHINGTON: India may be looking at upwards of 500,000 of its "skilled" work force returning home from America if a proposal by the Trump administration not to extend H-1B visa of those waiting for permanent residency (Green Card) is implemented.
The Department of Homeland Security is said to be considering new regulations that would prevent H-1B visa extensions as part of President Donald Trump's "Buy American, Hire American" initiative promised during the 2016 campaign.
Under current law, foreign guest workers are allowed one three-year extension of the H-1B visa of three-year validity. If at the end of those six years the guest worker has a pending Green Card (Permanent Residency) application, then there is an almost indefinite extension of the H-1B visa till such time the applicant's Green Card processing is completed.
Because there is such a huge backlog of Green Card applicants, particularly for countries such as India and China, hundreds of thousands of workers from these countries spend 10-12 years in what is mirthlessly called H-1B hell or limbo. The small 'comfort' they currently have is they can remain in the US while the Green Card is being processed.
The Trump administration is considering ending that concession. If an H-1B visa holder has applied for a Green Card at the end of his six-years then he or she will have to exit the United States till the processing is complete.
Technically, the Trump administration is correct and well within the law to amend the rules because the H-1B was meant to address skilled worker shortage in the US, and not intended to become a route for immigration.
But over the years, hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers, particularly Indians and Chinese have used the H-1B route to first become permanent residents (Green Card holders) and then become citizens.
They include some of the most storied names in the US tech industry, including Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai, India-born head honchos of Microsoft and Google respectively, and because they added such immense value to the US tech industry, the whole visa category has generally been looked at favorable by both the tech industry and previous administrations.
However, in the run-up to the 2016 Presidential elections, nativist American tech workers who felt short-changed by the influx of foreign workers managed to convince the Trump campaign that there is no shortage of American tech workers and the H-1B inflow was part of the US tech industry's tactics to keep wages low.
Although, successive administrations have fiddled with the rules to make it difficult for US companies to hire foreign workers, including hiking processing fees and minimum salaries, demand for H-1B remains unabated because the US industry says America does not produce enough STEM graduates with requisite skill sets.
Changes to the current H-1B rules will affect India more than any other country. More than 50 per cent of the 85,000 H-1B visas that are currently being issued annually goes to Indian workers, which means there are an estimated 255,000 Indians with H-1B visas in the last six years alone. Tens of thousands more H-1B visa holders going back more than a decade are already awaiting Green Card processing.
Of course, it is not necessary that all H-1B visa recipients are immigration aspirants or are having their Green Cards processed. Many simply go there for short term work or return after their stint.
This is not the first blow dealt by the Trump administration to foreign worker inflow as part of its effort to keep US jobs for Americans.
IT has already announced that it plans to roll back the H-4 EAD introduced during the Obama presidency that allowed spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the US subject to certain conditions.
It is also possible that the visa extension roll back is never implemented. It is currently at a proposal stage and there are powerful arguments against implementing it.
Chief among them is that the young, foreign-born skilled workforce pays into the US tax system and enhances the country's economy.
Many tech savants have warned that if the US keeps them out, then it will accrue to the benefit of their home countries; they will simply go back and start Facebooks and Ubers, something US tech mavens have warned is already happening in China.

UPFA will win this LG election - SB
The SLFP led UPFA is confident of winning the LG election to set up a strong local government institution since it is supported by most of the political parties in its alliance, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said yesterday.
He said MP Mahinda Rajapaksa will have to resign from politics following the election as he has left with a group of most junior members of the SLFP and UPFA unlike the stalwarts who left the party in the past.
He had said that he would resign following the election results, Minister Dissanayake said.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) head office in Colombo.
Minister Dissanayake said the SLFP which has the lions share in the UPFA is being supported by the highest number of parties. He added that except for Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardena, the rest of the party has joined the UPFA. The National Freedom Front (NFF) members too are leaving its leader Weerawansa with Mahinda Rajapaksa hasjoined the UPFA,Minister Dissanayake said. The active group of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) too have joined the UPFA while the Ceylon Workers Congress has joined UPFA and are contesting under our flag in Kandy and Nuwara Eliya.
Dissanayake further said that when Minister Rishad Bathiudeens Party joined with the UNP, the other two parties of Minister Athaulla and State Minister Hisbullah joined with us. Its the SLFP led UPFA, the only coalition that would contest all the Pradeshiya Sabhas across the country, Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
He also said although few members left the party to sit with the opposition, the two secretary generals of SLFP and UPFA have not left while almost all the senior members remain in the party. None of the ministers and deputies of the SLFP government set up in 1997 have not left to sit with the opposition except for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister Dissanayake said. But when Maithripala Senanayake and T.B. Ilangaratne left SLFP in past, most of the party stalwarts left with them. But when Mahinda Rajapaksa left only a group of juniors left with him.
National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H. M. Fowzie, Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha, SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake and former Minister Athauda Seneviratne also participated in the press conference.

US nuclear button much bigger than N.Koreas: Trump
US: US President Donald Trump warned Kim Jong-Un on Tuesday he has a much bigger nuclear button than the North Korean leader, as Washington dismissed the prospect of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Seoul.
Trump launched the highly personal missive on Twitter hours after his ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley described proposed dialogue between the two Koreas as a band-aid and said Washington would never accept a nuclear-armed Pyongyang.
Trump said: North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times. Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! The tweet was in reference to Kims annual New Year address in which he warned he has a nuclear button on his table, but sweetened his remarks by expressing an interest in dialogue and taking part in the Pyeongchang Games next month.
South Korea has responded positively to Kims overture, suggesting January 9 as a date for rare talks aimed at easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. But the US questioned whether talks could be taken seriously.
North Korea has rattled the international community in recent months with multiple missile launches and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test -- purportedly of a hydrogen bomb.
It has shrugged off a raft of new sanctions and heightened rhetoric from Washington as it drives forward with its weapons program, which it says is for defense against US aggression.
Pyongyang claims it needs nuclear weapons to protect itself from a hostile Washington and has striven to create a warhead capable of targeting the US mainland with an atomic warhead. Earlier, South Koreas President Moon Jae-In welcomed Kims comments as a positive response to Seouls hopes that the Pyeongchang Olympics would be a groundbreaking opportunity for peace The Souths unification minister Cho Myoung-Gyon told a press conference Tuesday that Seoul was reiterating our willingness to hold talks with the North at any time and place in any form. We hope that the South and North can sit face to face and discuss the participation of the North Korean delegation at the Pyeongchang Games as well as other issues of mutual interest for the improvement of inter-Korean ties, he added.
The Koreas, divided by a Demilitarized Zone since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, last held high-level talks in 2015 to try to ease tensions.
But Haley, the US Ambassador to the UN, told reporters Washington could not take the talks seriously if they dont do something to ban all nuclear weapons in North Korea. She said: We consider this to be a very reckless regime. We dont think we need a band-aid and we dont think we need to smile and take a picture.
We think we need to have them stop nuclear weapons and they need to stop it now, she said, warning: We will never accept a nuclear North Korea. Trumps tweet was also the latest in a series of personal insults the two leaders have traded since the US president took office a year ago.
Trump has mocked Kim as fat and a little rocket man. Kim, for his part has described Trump as a mentally deranged US dotard. - AFP

Woakes out of fifth Ashes Test, Crane to debut
SYDNEY: England leg spinner Mason Crane will make his debut in the fifth and final Ashes test against Australia this week after all-rounder Chris Woakes was ruled out of the match by injury, captain Joe Root said on Wednesday.
Woakes missed a significant part of Englands home season after straining his side in the opening match of last years Champions Trophy and pulled up sore after the fourth test in Melbourne last week.
The 27-year-olds enforced absence will be the only change to Roots side for the test at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), which starts on Thursday.
Hes obviously an integral significant member of both the white ball and test team and its important hes not out for a long time like he was last summer, Root told reporters.
Hes going to miss this week and its a great opportunity for Mason to come in and make his debut.
Woakess injury has probably resulted in a reprieve for out-of-form all-rounder Moeen Ali, who had been expected to make way for 20-year-old Crane.
England have already handed back the Ashes after losing the first three tests of the series but Root has made it clear the tourists would not be handing out test caps in Sydney willy nilly, as they did at the end of the 2013-14 whitewash.
Crane, who played at the SCG for New South Wales last year during a highly successful stint with the Gordon club, will become the youngest England spinner to make his test debut for 90 years.
Hes been outstanding. For a young man to apply himself and absorb himself in the environment as he has, is exactly what you want, Root said.
You can see a big progression in his game since hes been involved in this tour. Hes right up for international cricket and hes not someone whos going to back down.
On this surface, hes going to be a really good option. It looks like its going to give a bit of turn throughout. - Agencies

Word play!
Scrabble lovers know that the word board game, even when played among family and friends, can bring out their competitive nature. This game of alphabets is fantastic because of its links with the written words. Many of these words may not be encountered in daily life. It is a thrilling learning process which develops the vocabulary.
At an age when children cannot look beyond video games Adheesha Dissanayake has displayed an inexplicable interest in words. The nine year old became the Under 10 World Champion at the World English Language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA) Youth Cup (World Youth Scrabble Championship) held in Malaysia recently. Though the event was titled as WESPA Youth Cup in 2017, it was originally called the World Youth Scrabble Championship. The event is held every year in different parts of the world since 2006 for young Scrabblers who fall into the under 18 category. Aabid Ismail from Royal College, Colombo, was the overall champion while Janul de Silva won second place and was also adjudged as the under 16 champion at the WESPA Youth Cup 2017.
Adheesha had to compete against players from all age groups to clinch the title. He was even paired off against 16 and 17 year olds in many rounds. Thus he scored and won the title beating players who were senior to him not only in age but also in experience.
A student of Willesden International School, Battaramulla, Adheesha had developed a passion for the word game primarily because of his sister Radinka who is the current Sri Lanka under 18 champion and highest rated female player. His first tournament was the Sri Lanka Age Group Scrabble Championship in 2015. He bagged 10th place at the event. He was not even six years old then and was the youngest player at the event. He competed in the under 13 division.
I was drawn to contests which involved letters and words. What really drew me to the sport is that age makes no difference when you sit before the Scrabble board. It is especially exciting to win a game against senior and high rated players, the youth said.
Throughout the years Adheesha has displayed an uncanny ability to spell and frame words. He won sixth place in the Sri Lanka Age Group Scrabble Championship in 2016. He is the highest rated under 13 player in Sri Lanka today.
Though WESPA Youth Cup was his first international tournament, Adheesha has been able to relax and have fun as well as show his prowess in the sport. He had even made a handful of friends from different nations at the event. He mainly engages in the sport because he enjoys it.
The best way to push yourself to expand your diction is to relax and have fun with it. There are lots of benefits in playing Scrabble in addition to the obvious fun part. The more you play this board game the better you get at it and the more rewarding it would be to you in many ways: mentally, socially and emotionally, he opined.
Besides the fun part Scrabble teaches strategy, builds intellectual capacity, increases social bonding and cooperation, improves emotional wellbeing, increases personal confidence and encourages players to compete against each other. The game is nearly nine decades old and is sold in around 121 countries and comes in 31 different languages. At least 30,000 Scrabble games are started each hour.
Scrabble contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10. The highest score recorded for a word is 1674 points by forming the word Oxyphenbutazone.
The letters Q and Z have the highest point values in Scrabble, worth 10 points each.
Adheesha is trained by his father, Raditha who is a software architect. His mother, Madhavi, is the daughter of the late Vivien de Silva Boralessa. Apart from his elder sister Radinka, his sister Aminthika too plays Scrabble. However Adheesha noted that she is keener on writing than Scrabble. She had published her first story book Little Dreams when she was 10.
Queried on what makes a Scrabble champion, Adheesha says that one needs to possess anagramming skills and a large vocabulary.
You need to be able to do mental arithmetic very quickly as well, he said.
Though he has no role models or idols, Adheesha vies to become one of the top Scrabble players in the world.
He invites budding young Scrabble players to join the Sri Lanka Scrabble League.
They have lots of tournaments. You might even find yourself playing for the WESPA Youth Cup, he noted adding that he is open to listen to any words of wisdom from seasoned players who have excelled in their chosen fields.
Perhaps in 10 more years I too would be able to give some pointers to youth who wish to shine in Scrabble. I am too young and not in a position to advice others yet, he concluded with a smile.

Wrapping paper dresses
Few things are more thrilling than ripping open a Christmas present, but the shiny wrapping paper that gets thrown away afterward usually goes straight to the landfill. North Carolinian costume designer Olivia Mears, known on social media as avantgeek, has come up with a brilliant way to reuse those picked-over packages  by turning them into majestic dresses.
The ingenious idea came to Mears back in late December of 2013, and after going viral with her first design, it became clear that the eco-conscious dresses would have to become a yearly tradition. Im continuously inspired to find unconventional or recyclable things to make dresses/art out of, she wrote about the concept.
Each dress is composed of recycled wrapping paper, ribbons, bows, and plenty of glitter. If youve ever imagined what a Disney princess might wear to a Christmas party, this is undeniably it.Earlier this year Mears was in the news because she made an incredible pizza dress.
