Certain N/E politicians attempting to damage reconciliation process
Certain Northern and Eastern politicians are attempting to grab political power by damaging the reconciliation process among the communities and threatening the countrys unitary status, Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara said.
The Western Province Governor was addressing the media at his office in Rajagiriya yesterday.
He said extremist politicians in the Northern and Eastern Provinces want the Army Camps in those areas removed in order to secure their vote base by misguiding the masses.
Even the Tamil Diaspora wants to create a tense situation in those areas and thereby secure their foreign refuge, he added.
Certain international organisations try to create political instability and create a tense situation in the North in order to sell their weapons, he said.
According to Nanayakkara, some Tamil politicians were enjoying luxury lives in Colombo while the Police and the Tri-Forces have been wirking with dedication to provide relief and rescue the Northern people affected by the floods.
The Police and the Tri-Forces personnel have also donated blood to save the lives of the Northern flood victims, he pointed out.
President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the authorities in the Northern Province including Governor Reginald Cooray to take all possible measures to provide relief to those people, Nanayakkara said while criticizing some Northern politicians for not doing enough for the affected people.
Only one death has been reported from the flood situation in the Northern Province. This is due to the dedication of the Police and the Security Forces personnel, he said. Northern health personnel and other personnel from Government institutions have also rendered a yeomen service in the flood relief efforts, he added.
Speaking about the removal of the military camps in the Northern Province, the Governor said nearly 80 per cent of the private lands acquired during the war period have now been released by the Army and steps are being taken to set up these Army camps in government owned lands.

Book review:
Sri Lanka at Crossroads: Geopolitical Challenges and National Interests
The book, Sri Lanka at Crossroads by Asanga Abeyagoonasekera could not have come at better times. But more than being so timely given Sri Lanka's political developments of last two months, it holds enduring relevance in its own right and assures a longer shelf life for being such an ambitious project by a relatively young author. It shows his erudite width in painting such a large canvass ranging from the island nation's strategic significance germigtnating from its ancient diplomatic interactions with Romans to being a central and oversized island in the Ptolemy's world map from where he moves with his characteristic ease to untying complex knots of charged political polemics of contemporary times. In this complication of his recent essays, his examination of Sri Lanka's decade-long peace-building and reconciliation remains especially sharp and candid, even blunt!
These essays are equally forthright when it comes to examining challenges to Sri Lanka's democratic institutions and traditions as also in dissecting specific sectors of cybersecurity and forecasting futures. There is an impressive intellectual groundwork that makes analysis constantly crisscrossing multiple locales and narratives; laden often with an emotional restlessness and deeper connection with the subject which often makes author prescriptive, sometimes even caricaturing to push his argument forcefully to his readers. There is this discomfort of complex situations in Sri Lanka being addressed in simplistic frames of reference. For an instance, he recommends shifting towards a pure technocracy if Sri Lankans are not able to overcome repeated episodes of indiscipline that undermines their democratic credence. Asanga sees weak state institutions as the most formidable cause for the current morass, especially corruption and inaction.
Myopic political decisions like allowing all hundred ministers new cars worth 36 million rupees each, lure and lustre of rapid investments, stereotyping of Tamils, underinvesting in their youth on the one hand and being unappreciative of complete absence of choices for those successive generations during the Eelam conflict that ignites sub consciousness-driven slogans (Eluga Tamil) does not call for one-time engagements with the Global Tamil Forum for public relations. While there is a conviction in seriously engaging Tamil diaspora, there is also an urge to recognise Sri Lanka's war heroes: politicians for their political will; soldiers for their dedication and bravery; and, intelligence for their precision in cutting all supply lines of rebels to make this victory possible. The book is also unique the way it uses a whole treasure of quotations from various historical icons throughout the world over. It is reflective of an author constantly rubbing shoulders with global leaders attending forums from the Davos World Economic Forum to the Shangri-La Dialogue and brain teasing of several experts from ivy institutions of great reputation.
The book indeed runs like a roller coaster leaving a reader with more questions than answers. But for a discerning eye, it also alludes to several unwritten insinuations, forcing the reader to read in between the published lines. In explaining Sri Lanka's strategic location; as its greatest asset; Asanga talks of Mackinder's 'outer crescent' that makes him see two other nations, Britain and Japan, being similarly ordained. However, as world drifts from continents to Oceans following Mahanian axioms, it leaves only Sri Lanka that sits in the midst of global east-west super expressway of sea lanes of communications connecting the two ends of the Indo-Pacific geopolitical paradigm. He calls it a 'super connector.' The unsaid part here explains why the Chinese have not only invested about 2 billion dollars in the Hambantota Port but takes a 99 years lease to manage it as well. He reminds us of Robert Kaplan of Monsoon fame saying ''whoever controls the Indian Ocean will dominate Asia, the destiny of the world will be decided on these waters."
The Sri Lanka at Crossroads makes an admirable effort to provide an objective analysis of the connection between Sri Lanka and India, especially the Tamil factor in knitting his narrative on ups and downs of Delhi-Colombo equations. It highlights limitations of New Delhi's coalition politics and as he puts it, Indian leaders have often themselves confessed about it. Likewise, he also highlights how sometimes insurrections were triggered by "Sinhala Buddhists who set off anti-Tamil pogroms in the south" as also sometimes the state agencies reacting rather slowly and then resorting to using of brute force to restore order.
Similarly, on China, he highlights how China's One Belt One Road was originally conceived by famous Beijing University professor Wang Ji Si, who proposed it (in Mackinder's model) of connecting China to Eurasia. Surely Wang has not been publicly credited for this and addition of the Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road to China's reformulated Belt and Road Initiative surely drifts far from the so-called the Wang proposal. While Wang's authorship may be established over a period of time, the other notable puzzle which the reader will come across is repeated prescriptions of what needs to be done. This is perhaps how policy research works quite often. But in the end, readers will find this book very lucid and therefore an easy read and also engaging while keeping the reader on edge of moving faster to keep pace with author's inferences and imaginations.

ACJU strongly condemns the act of damaging Buddha statues

The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) strongly condemns the act of religious blasphemy that occurred recently in the Mawanella Area.
The ACJU considers this act of damaging of the Buddha statue, which is worshipped by the majority Buddhists living in this country, as a deed of damaging the mutual understanding and reconciliation among the communities. The ACJU hereby reiterates that humiliating other religions by damaging the religious icons of worship is against the teachings of Islam.
These types of misdeeds may result in creating unnecessary commotions in the country, where the Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims are living together in unity and reconciliation.
Therefore, the ACJU requests the authorities to take legal action against the offenders whoever they are and implement justice, and the ACJU also requests His Excellency the President, Hon. Prime Minister and Inspector General of Police to take the necessary measures to maintain law and order at this situation, not allowing any evil opportunists taking law into their hands.

Australia openers survive after Kohli, Pujara heroics
MELBOURNE : A 170-run stand between century-maker Cheteshwar Pujara and captain Virat Kohli put India in a dominant position in the third Test Thursday as Australia's openers survived half a dozen nervy overs before the close.
Dogged Pujara stroked 106 and Kohli 82 before they both fell soon after lunch on what until then had been a lifeless Melbourne pitch.
Rohit Sharma was not out 63 after notching his 10th Test half-century when Kohli called a halt to the innings late in the day at 443 for seven as India go in search of a crucial 2-1 lead in the four-Test series.
That left gave the tourists' attack six overs before stumps to target Australian openers Marcus Harris and Aaron Finch, who battled through to be eight without loss.
Earlier Pujara and Kohli had continued to build their intimidating partnership after coming together when openers Hanuma Vihari and Mayank Agarwal fell on day one.
They batted through to lunch with scarcely an alarming moment as they worked to take the match out of Australias reach.
But when Kohli started to take on the short ball soon after being seen by the physio for an apparent back complaint in the afternoon session, he was undone by pace spearhead Mitchell Starc.

Be careful with medicines, doctor warns
Doctors should be very careful when they treat patients, Sri Jayawardenapura University Medical Faculty Prof. Chandanie Wanigatunge said.
She was speaking at the AGM of the National Council for the Deaf (NCD) held in Colombo. NCD President W. Ratnayake, Senior Director Maud Senaratne and Shirani Dissanayake were present. Prof. Wanigatunge lauded the invaluable service that NCD provides for children with hearing difficulties and said doctors should be careful when prescribing medicines to people with hearing problems since they can purchase wrong medicines.
The medicines help persons to live healthy lives. But every medicine has side effects, she said. If patients take in wrong medicines, they will suffer from various illnesses, she said.
She said medicines can harm even when they are taken correctly as prescribed by the doctor.
The Prof. said a safe medicine is not available now and therefore, people should know the best way to use medicines to minimise harms they do.
We take medicines for a short period for infections and a long period to control health issues such as high blood pressure and high glucose level in the blood, she said.
When taking medicine we need to take right medicine and right dose in right duration, she said.
If patients do not take medicines properly, treatment process will not work and it could even harm patients, she said.
She advised patients to take all their medical records when they go to consult a doctor as it will help the doctor to give them the right medicines. Prof. Wanigatunge asked patients to refrain from over-the-counter purchasing as doctors change medicines or doses in accordance with the latest situation of a patient.
She said that if prescriptions of a patient are not changed when his or her condition changes, the doctor may not be giving the correct medicines and the patient will not get the expected result. Errors can occur in transcribing, dispensing and administration, she said.
Patients/caregivers play a vital role in administering medicines correctly. When they stop taking or giving medicine abruptly, when they do not know about the disease they are treating and when they neglect instructions, they may cause fatal errors, she said.
Damaged medical records, incomplete records or unavailability of records may lead the prescriber to make errors, she said.

Big-hitting Guptill back in New Zealand colours
CHRISTCHURCH, Thursday : Martin Guptill, one of only a handful of players to have scored a double century in one-day cricket, will return to the New Zealand squad for next months one-day series against Sri Lanka.
All-rounders Doug Bracewell and Jimmy Neesham also return in the 13-man squad named Thursday.
Guptill, whose unbeaten 237 against the West Indies in the 2015 World Cup is the second highest ODI score of all time, has been sidelined by injury in recent months.
Its great to have Martin back after injury and hell obviously add all his class and experience to the side, selector Gavin Larsen said as New Zealand build towards next years World Cup in England and Wales.
With the selectors endeavouring to give opportunities to a wider group of players, incumbent one-day wicketkeeper Tom Latham will miss the Sri Lanka series, while Colin de Grandhomme has been rested.
Lathams absence paves the way for 24-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Seifert to make his ODI debut.
With the World Cup now on our radar there is a need to look at different players over the home summer, Larsen said.
We want to win the one-day series against Sri Lanka, and we want to gain as much new information as possible while doing so.

Brilliant Boult in the groove as NZ take full control
CHRISTCHURCH, Thursday: Chief destroyer Trent Boult felt he was in the groove as his sublime six-wicket spell, backed by half-centuries from Tom Latham and Jeet Raval gave New Zealand a vice-like grip on the second Test against Sri Lanka in Christchurch on Thursday.
At the close of the second day, New Zealand were 231 for two, holding a commanding 305-run lead in their second innings with eight wickets in hand.
Sri Lankas hopes of taking the series-deciding Test were severely dented in a 15-ball masterclass of swing bowling from Boult when he took six wickets for four runs to give New Zealand a 74-run first innings advantage.
It is probably one of the best swing bowling grounds in the country. It was quite still out there and the ball was in good nick as well, Boult said.
It is nice to get the ball moving around, making the most of it.
Its all about rhythm for me anyway. I suppose getting into a groove, a couple of wickets gives you a bit of confidence and just lets you go about your thing. Sometimes youre not really thinking about much and its kind of happening for you.
With the Sri Lanka innings in tatters, New Zealand took 74-run first-innings lead, which Latham and Raval extended to 195 with a century opening stand.
WE ARE WELL BEHIND
Kane Williamson and Latham added a further 68 for the second wicket until Williamson played a lazy shot to Lahiru Kumara and was caught at first slip for 48.
At the close of the second day, Latham was on 74 with Ross Taylor on 25.
Latham received a life on 32 when he top-edged Suranga Lakmal to fine leg where the ball slipped through the fingers of a diving Dushmantha Chameera.
Patel, who worked with Latham to produce the first wicketless session in the Test when they batted from lunch to tea, was out in the second over after the resumption for 74.
Sri Lanka had resumed at 88 for four harbouring thoughts of overhauling New Zealands first innings 178.
But nine overs and 16 runs later their last six wickets were gone, all taken by Boult, who finished with a career best six for 30.
Honestly, we are well behind in the game, Sri Lanka batting coach Thilan Samaraweera said, but adding that they remained hopeful.
Anything can happen. The new ball is due after one over (on Friday). If we can get through a couple of wickets, keep them under 420, thats a good thing.
Only Angelo Mathews was able to keep Boult out and he was unbeaten on 33 at the close of the innings.
Boult triggered the collapse when he had Roshen Silva caught by Tim Southee at third slip for 21.
A diving Southee produced a spectacular one-handed catch in Boults next over to remove Niroshan Dickwella for four.
Dilruwan Perera, Suranga Lakmal, Chameera and Lahiru Kumara all misread Boult and went quickly leg before wicket without scoring to end the innings.
Perera and Lakmal fell in consecutive deliveries with Chameera blocking the next ball to avoid a hat-trick before he was removed with the second ball he faced.  AFP

Fighting for power and wealth
Buddhas interpretation on Kings Kosols 9th dream:
King Kosol of India, during the time of the Buddha, had 16 dreams which were strange and he was eager to find out whether they were good or bad or what they actually meant. The King approached the Buddha for clarification.
As at today, corruption appears to be widespread and as such I quote dream 9 and the Buddhas prophecy.
The dream
King Kosol dreamt of a big pond. The water in the outer part of the pond was clean, clear and cool, but the water in the middle was cloudy and muddy. Big and small animals fought each other to drink the muddy water but no animal ventured to drink the clean, clear and cool water.
The Buddhas prophecy
In the future people will be full of greed and desire. They would crave for more and more money and will never be satisfied. They will not want clean, honest low-paying jobs which will not satisfy their greed. They will want political power and seats in National Assemblies so that they could rule the countries and manage the finances. They would acquire large amounts of money regardless of how dirty the means were. That would occur all over the world. They would be tricky and corrupt with no shame.
It will become more and more severe resulting in disorder. There would be fights over positions in which they could amass wealth. There would be fights over who should get more wealth, who should get less and who should get nothing.

States Services TT in Jaffna
Combined University Staff team barred from participating
Combined University staff team was inconvenienced when their entry was rejected at the last moment at the States Services table tennis championship worked off at Jaffna Central College yesterday.
The organizers did not allow Combined University to participate saying that they were not eligible to participate according to the rules.
Combined University staff team captain Anoma Ratnayake told the Daily News: We applied to participate in this tournament a couple of months before, and our application was accepted by the organizers. But at last minute they rejected it after we had reached Jaffna for the tournament. If they had any issues of us participating they could have informed us earlier.
The organizers stated that the University staff team does not come under State Services category but the question remained unanswered why they had accepted their application if it was so.
I requested the organizers to the allow us to compete and said that we dont need any trophies or anything but the for betterment of sports, but they rejected our request, Anoma said.
The Combined University staff team won the C category title of the State Services championship held in Anuradhapura last year. Thus it is strange that they were not allowed to participate this year.

EGUARDIAN, Nutanix hosts  knowledge sharing session
EGUARDIAN Lanka, one of Sri Lankas leading value added IT distributor, hosted a knowledge sharing session on hyperconverged infrastructure for enterprises in partnership with Nutanix, Inc., a leader in enterprise cloud computing, at The Hilton Colombo, recently.
Experts from EGUARDIAN and Nutanix engaged with senior IT decision makers from leading public and private sector enterprises at this forum.
Apprising the audience of the importance of hyper-converged infrastructure for enterprises, Mafaz Fahrid, Head of Businesses and International Operations, EGUARDIAN Lanka Private Limited, said, The pace of business transformation and the demand for enterprise applications continues to grow, legacy IT systems with separate storage, storage networks and servers face the risk of failure. Ever more enterprises around the world are combining server and storage resources with intelligent software through hyperconverged infrastructure to streamline the deployment, management and scaling of resources.
Elaborating on how Nutanix could help them in this regard, Faiz Shakir, Regional Director  India South and Sri Lanka, Nutanix Inc., noted, At Nutanix, we seek to enable IT teams to build and operate powerful multi-cloud architectures. Having pioneered hyperconverged infrastructure, we continue to evolve the hyperconverged platform. Our Enterprise Cloud OS software melds private, public and distributed cloud operating environments and provides a single point of control to manage IT infrastructure and applications at any scale. Working together with partners like EGUARDIAN, we look forward to helping enterprises in Sri Lanka build fast, efficient and highly scalable datacenters.
Nutanix was positioned as an MQ Leader again in the November 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure. The company was also named as a leader in The Forrester Wave: Hyperconverged Infrastructure, Q3 2018, published by Forrester Research, Inc, earlier this year. The report evaluated 11 vendors on Strategy, Market Presence and Current Offering, and Nutanix was positioned as a leader.
Nutanix is a global leader in cloud software and hyperconverged infrastructure solutions, making infrastructure invisible so that IT can focus on the applications and services that power their business.

Environmental conservation through  NDB employee volunteerism
Identifying the importance of trees, over sixty volunteers from the NDB Southern Region in partnership with the Road Development Authority planted 1,000 trees along a 2 km stretch from Pinnaduwa to Hikkaduwa.
A key success factor of this project is that it created awareness and caused a ripple effect, motivating others to carry out similar projects.
Sri Lankas Southern Highway links Colombo with Galle and Matara, with over 70,000 vehicles traveling along the highway on a daily basis.
The Banks Southern Region recognized the need for growing trees along the Southern Highway to combat climate change, absorb carbon dioxide, prevent soil erosion, beautify the area, raise awareness on environment conservationand replenish trees cut down to build the highway.
The NDB Team was headed by Regional Manager Thilina Hewage. NDB commenced the Employee Volunteerism CSR Initiative in 2009. As a responsible corporate citizen, NDB believes that Community Involvement goes beyond core business activities and with an objective of creating value through employee participation, the Bank encourages its employees to volunteer their time and effort to give back to the community.
Employee volunteering programs can allow workers to feel that the work they do is not only contributing to the overall success of the company, but that it is also helping out a charitable cause that is important to them.
Whilst, inculcating responsibility towards the Community and Environment in all NDB employees, this initiative also motivates them to venture out on their own and implement their own projects. As a responsible corporate citizen, NDB strives to make meaningful contributions to the society through its strategic sustainability initiatives that aim to inspire the sustainable growth of a progressive Sri Lanka. Sustainability is a strategic priority at NDB and the Bank continuously endeavours to foster it across all its business decisions and activities.

China's ex-intelligence chief Ma Jian has been sentenced to life in prison for crimes including taking bribes and insider trading, a court says.Ma had been put under investigation in 2015 and expelled from the Communist Party one year later.He pleaded guilty and would not appeal, a court in the north-eastern Liaoning province said.Many high-ranking officials have been toppled as part of President Xi Jinping's vast anti-corruption drive.Ma Jian was vice-minister in the powerful ministry of state security, which oversees foreign and counterintelligence operations.His case is linked to that of one of China's most-wanted fugitives, exiled property tycoon Guo Wengui, who has published a series of allegations of corruption among top members of the Communist Party.Ma used his position to help Guo Wengui, who now lives in New York, further his business interests, the Dalian Intermediate People's Court said in a statement.He took more than 100m yuan (11.4m; $14.5m) in bribes and profited by trading stocks based on insider information, it added.

Export earnings from food and beverages up
Earnings from merchandise exports increased by 0.4 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 979 million in October 2018. The marginal growth of exports in October reflects mainly the decline in agricultural exports by 11.5 per cent which offset the 4.5 per cent growth of industrial exports.
Under industrial exports, export earnings from textiles and garments increased marginally in October 2018 due to higher earnings from textile exports despite the slight decline registered in garment exports.
The reduced earnings from garment exports was mainly driven by the lower demand from the USA, despite an increase in exports to the EU market and non-traditional markets such as India, Canada, Japan and Hong Kong. Further, reflecting the combined impact of both volume and export prices, earnings from petroleum products increased significantly in October 2018.
Export earnings from food, beverages and tobacco and base metals and articles increased substantially during October 2018 due to improved performance in most of their sub categories.
Meanwhile, earnings from agricultural exports were lower during the month owing to the poor performance in almost all sub categories except seafood, vegetables and rubber.
Reflecting lower average export prices and exported volumes, export earnings from tea declined in October 2018. Export earnings from spices also reduced during the month due to the poor performance in most categories of spices.
Further, despite an increase in earnings from coconut non-kernel products, earnings from coconut exports decreased due to the drop in earnings from coconut kernel products such as desiccated coconut and coconut oil.
However, owing to higher exports to the EU market, earnings from seafood exports rose during the month.
Leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka in October 2018 were the USA.

Fourteen industrialists will receive ISO 14001 Certification today, Friday, December 28, at 9 am, at the Anthony D. Anjelo Auditorium - MILODA, the Academy of Finance Studies in Colombo 1.
The IDB has organised this half a day seminar with a view to encourage and facilitate small and medium enterprises(SMEs) in order to develop their standards which would enable them to receive ISO 14001 Certification through the promotion of cleaner production practices.
It is believed that these programmes would encourage industrialists island-wide to join the movement in order to change interactive methods between industries and the environment and also to reduce the negative impact from industries on the environment due to changes in industrial work patterns and the technology they use.
Industry and Commerce, Resettlement of Protracted Displaced Persons and Co-operative Development Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is scheduled to be the chief guest at the event.
Additional Secretary of the Industry and Commerce Ministry M. Thajudeen, Director of the Finance Ministry Rohan Jayathilake, Director General of the IDB P.L.U.Rathnamalala, Sri Lanka Standards Institution(SLSI) Director General, IDB Director K.M.S.G. Bandara, SLSI Director Samanthi Narangoda, National Cleaner Production Centre CEO Samantha Kumarasena, and SLSI DD Theruni Wijesuriya will be among invitees. The organisers expect participation of industrialists representing different industries countrywide in addition to their invitees.
Cleaner production is a broad concept that addresses all aspects of inputs, production and outputs. It can be defined as the continuous application of an integrated, preventive environmental strategy applied to processes, products and services to increase overall efficiency and reduce risks on humans and the environment.
Currently, there is a growing world movement among governments and industries to change the manner in which industries interact with the environment. The focus of this movement is to reduce the impact caused by industries on nature.
It is mandatory for SMEs to minimise waste which in turn would reduce harmful impact on the environment.
At the seminar and certificate awarding ceremony, 14 industrialists including three from Jaffna, representing different industries, will receive the ISO 14001 certification as an assurance to their company management while maintaining a clean environment. This will be an eye-opener and encouragement to other industrialists to be part of this growing world movement.
The ISO 14001 specifies the requirements for an environmental management system that an organisation can follow to enhance its environmental performance.
It assists an organisation to achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, which protects the environment, the organisation itself and interested parties.
The project includes the following objectives:
1. To provide financial assistance to take remedial action or preventive measures to minimise waste of resources
2. To facilitate in obtaining ISO 14001:2015 and to facilitate SMEs to optimise the usage of resources through CP approaches certification for the industry.
Right now the IDB has registered SMIs operating in nine districts such as Ratnapura, Matara, Hambantota, Kandy, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kurunegala, Kalutara and Gampaha.

inflation down to 3.1% in Nov.
The core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, decreased to 3.1% in November from 3.4% in October on year-on-year basis. The annual average core inflation remained unchanged at 2.4% in November.
However the headline inflation as measured by the year-on-year change in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) reversed its declining trend, recording 1 per cent in November 2018 from 0.1 per cent in October 2018.
The increase observed in year-on-year inflation in November 2018 is mainly driven by the increase of the prices of Food items. Year-on-year Food inflation increased to -3.9 per cent in November 2018 from -6.6 per cent in October 2018. However, year -on- year Non-food inflation decreased from 5.8 per cent in October 2018 to 5.2 per in November 2018.
The change in the NCPI measured on an annual average basis decreased to 2.7 per cent in November 2018 from 3.3 per cent in October 2018.
The month on month change of the NCPI increased by 2.2 per cent in November 2018 due to increase in the prices of the items in the Food category, particularly that of vegetables, green chillies, rice, limes and potatoes.
Meanwhile, prices of the items in the Non-food category also increased during the month where Health sub- category reported the highest increase.

Inland fish production is inadequate  Harrison
Inland fish production should be increased to meet fish consumption since the per capita fish intake in the country is insufficient to cater to the nutritious level that the people need, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister P. Harrison said.
The Minister was speaking at a discussion held at his ministry on December 26. State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, Parliamentarians Hesha Withana, Chaminda Wijesiri and Ministry officials were present.
The Minister said the country has 27,000 waterways. The quantity of fish that people consume could be increased by catching more fish from the waterways. Although the country is surrounded by sea, we cannot increase the fish harvest because our maritime zone was very deep and not conducive for large scale fish breeding, he said.
The Minister said that health reports state that a person should consume at least 46 kg of fish annually, but the people, particularly those in the up country, eat only about 12 kg that is woefully inadequate.
The fisheries Ministry, therefore, has a great responsibility towards increasing fish production and making fish available at a fair price to consumers, he said. He said people today went for meat instead of fish because fresh fish was not easily available and the prices were much higher than that of meat.
The Minister requests ministry officials to expedite the programme to increase fish production.
He said that earlier the European embargo on the fish exports in the Rajapaksa regime deprived the country of an annual income of Rs. 16,000 million. The government elected in 2015 was able to reverse that trend and increased fish exports by 44 per cent. We will further increase fish exports, the Minister said.

JA-Ela UC grapples with lasting issue
Thanks to the Ja-Ela Urban Council (UC), the people of Kanuwana, Ja-Ela from the St Josephs Church to the Minuwangoda Road had to drench and wade through this water logged road stretch.
The road stretch is even less than a quarter of a kilometer and the problem has been perennial stretching for nearly 100 years. During this time, the Ja-Ela UC have been spending millions of rupees to solve the problem but merely failed. Now, no attempt has been made to solve the problem.
Around six years ago the Council launched a major project in laying huge concrete pipes underground along the other side of the road and the water from the households on the other side of the road were connected to the underground concrete pipe. Though millions have been spent by the JUC, the water logging on the road still continues during rainy days.
It is really a misery to see the faithful to the church as well as the children attending the St Josephs School, Kanuwana wading through this eternal water log.
A private construction company has launched a massive pipe laying project around three months ago using giant heavy machinery, like backhoes, cranes and pile boring covering the entire stretch of the road and during the three months, the road was completely closed.
They also pumped thick mud water from the huge trenches on to the road. The project was temporarily stopped halfway as the faithful complained that the pipe laying would tremendously inconvenience them. This project would resume now.

Dissolution of Parliament :
Justice de Abrew affirms the majority decision
The Supreme Court seven-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Nalin Perera on December 13 unanimously ruled that the gazette notification issued by President to dissolve the Parliament has been issued outside legal limits and has resulted in a violation of Petitioners fundamental rights.
While agreeing with the judgement delivered by Chief Justice and five other judges regarding these ten Fundamental Rights petitions, Justice Sisira de Abrew delivered a separate judgement explaining different reasons to justify his stance.
This is an excerpt from judgement delivered by Justice Sisira de Abrew in respect of the Fundamental Rights petition filed by TNA leader R. Sampanthan.
The President had, by a Proclamation published in Gazette No.2096/70 dated 09.11.2018 dissolved Parliament with effect from midnight on 09.11.2018. The petitioner R. Sampanthan who is a Member of Parliament whilst challenging through SC. FR Application No. 351/2018 the said Proclamation inter alia seeks the following reliefs from Supreme Court.
1. To declare that the Proclamation dissolving Parliament infringes his fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.
2. To make order declaring that the said Proclamation dissolving Parliament is null and void ab initio and of no force or effect in law.
3. To quash the said Proclamation dissolving Parliament.
4. To quash the decisions and or directions contained in paragraphs (a),(b),(c) and (d) of the said Proclamation.
The Supreme Court by its order dated 13.11.2018, granted leave to proceed for alleged violation of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.
The Attorney General whilst submitting the following grounds contended that the Supreme Court is precluded from exercising the jurisdiction in respect of the alleged violation of the Petitioners fundamental rights and from granting the reliefs sought by the Petitioner.
1. A specific mechanism is provided in Article 38(2) of the Constitution for the Supreme Court to exercise jurisdiction over allegation of intentional violations of the Constitution, misconduct or abuse of power by the President of the Republic.
2. The dissolution of Parliament by the President of the Republic does not constitute Executive or Administrative action falling within the purview of Article 126 of the Constitution.
* now advert to the above contentions.
When Article 38 (2) of the Constitution is examined, it is clear that the mechanism provided in Article 38 (2) of the Constitution is only available to the Members of Parliament. This mechanism is not available to the other citizens of the country. In fact there are several petitions filed in this court seeking to quash the Proclamation dissolving Parliament. The said petitioners are not Members of Parliament. For the above reasons, I reject the above contention advanced by the Attorney General. I now advert to the 2nd contention advanced by the Attorney General. He contended that the dissolution of Parliament by the President of the Republic does not constitute Executive or Administrative action falling within the purview of Article 126 of the Constitution. The general power given to the President of the Republic is contained in Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution. The same power is contained in Article 70 of the Constitution with a procedure governing the exercise of the said power. Article 33 is found in Chapter VII of the Constitution. The Chapter VII of the Constitution deals with Executive and the President of the Republic. Therefore it can be safely concluded that the power of the President of the Republic to dissolve Parliament is an executive action of the President of the Republic.
The making of the Proclamation and the Regulation as well as the conduct of the respondents in relation to the five elections, clearly constitute executive action and the court would ordinarily have jurisdiction under Article 126 of the Constitution.
I hold that the power of the President of the Republic to dissolve Parliament is an executive action. I therefore reject the contention of the Attorney General that is to say that the dissolution of Parliament by the President of the Republic does not constitute Executive or Administrative action falling within the purview of Article 126 of the Constitution.
The President of the Republic in terms of Article 32 of the Constitution must take an oath stating that he would uphold and defend the Constitution. Therefore it is seen that the President of the Republic is subject to the Constitution. In Mallikaarchchi Vs Shivapasupathi, Attorney General [1985] 1 SLR 74 wherein Sharvananda CJ at page 78 held thus: the President is not above the law.
I have earlier held that the acts of the President of the Republic except the acts done in the exercise of his powers conferred by Article 33(2)(g) of the Constitution are not immune from suit.
I hold that this court has the power to examine legality of the impugned acts or omissions by the President of the Republic except the acts done by him in the exercise of powers conferred to him by Article 33(2)(g) of the Constitution.
For the above reasons, I hold that this court has jurisdiction to inquire into the legality and correctness of the Proclamation issued by the President of the Republic dated 09.11.2018 published in Government Gazette No.2096/70 dated 09.11.2018 dissolving Parliament. I further hold that acts of the President of the Republic in issuing the said Proclamation and the said Proclamation are subject to the judicial review of this court and do not come under immunity stated in Article 35 of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel for the 1st added Respondent Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardena drawing our attention to both Sinhala and English versions of Article 62 of the Constitution, contended that the President of the Republic under Article 62(2) of the Constitution has the power to dissolve Parliament at any time. I now advert to this contention. If this contention is accepted as correct, the moment the notice of resolution discussed in Article 38(2) of the Constitution is handed over to the Speaker of Parliament, the President of the Republic can dissolve Parliament. If it happens, no resolution discussed in Article 38(2) of the Constitution can be passed by Parliament. Thus if the above contention is accepted as correct, Article 38(2) of the Constitution would be rendered nugatory. Sinhala version of Article 62(2) of the Constitution contains three sentences. But the English version of the said Article contains one sentence. The second sentence of the Sinhala version of the said Article is to the following effect. However Parliament can be dissolved before the expiry of its fixed term. According to Article 62(2) of the Constitution, fixed term of Parliament is a period of five years. Article 62(2) of the Constitution deals with the dissolution of Parliament at the end of term of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting. It is an automatic dissolution. Since it is an automatic dissolution, there is no necessity for the President of the Republic to issue a Proclamation. Article 62(2) of the Constitution (English version) reads as follows:
Unless Parliament is sooner dissolved, every Parliament shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer, and the expiry of the said period of five years shall operate as dissolution of Parliament.
This Article discusses a dissolution called sooner dissolution of Parliament. What is sooner dissolution of Parliament It is discussed in Proviso to Article 70(1) of the Constitution. Article 70(1) of the Constitution reads as follows:
The President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament:
Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour.
According to Article 70(1) of the Constitution, there are only two ways in which Parliament can be sooner dissolved. They are as follows:
1. At the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting.
2. When the Parliament by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present) requests the President of the Republic to dissolve Parliament.
These are the two ways in which Parliament can be sooner dissolved. Thus it is seen that sooner dissolution of Parliament discussed in Article 62(2) of the Constitution is the dissolution that is discussed in Article 70(1) of the Constitution. For the above reasons, I hold that the President of the Republic has no power to dissolve Parliament under and in terms of Article 62(2) of the Constitution.
It was contended on behalf of the Respondents that the President of the Republic, in terms of Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution, could dissolve Parliament. However it was contended on behalf of the Petitioner that the President of the Republic without fulfilling the requirements stated in Article 70(1) of the Constitution, could not dissolve Parliament in the exercise of the powers conferred to him by Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution. Can the President of the Republic acting under Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution dissolve Parliament without fulfilling the requirements stated in Article 70(1) of the Constitution This is one of the important questions that must be decided in this case.
The 1st sentence of Article 70(1) of the Constitution which reads as follows the President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament should be stressed. When this sentence is considered, it is seen that the power given to the President of the Republic to dissolve Parliament by Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution is reproduced in Article 70(1) of the Constitution. When Article 70(1) of the Constitution states that provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament . he (the President of the Republic) cannot and is not empowered to dissolve Parliament without the requirements set out in Article 70(1) being satisfied. What are those requirements
1. There must be an expiration of a period of four years and six months of Parliament from the date appointed for its first meeting.
2. Parliament by a resolution passed by not less than two thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present) must request the President of the Republic to dissolve Parliament. This requirement becomes necessary only when the President of the Republic intends to dissolve Parliament before expiration of a period of four years and six months of Parliament from the date appointed for its first meeting
Therefore I hold that in terms of Article 70(1) of the Constitution, the President of the Republic cannot, until the expiration of a period of four years and six months of Parliament from the date appointed for its first meeting, dissolve Parliament at his own will. In other words the President of the Republic cannot, at his own will, dissolve Parliament during the period of four years and six months of Parliament from the date appointed for its first meeting. If the President of the Republic wants to dissolve the Parliament during the said period of four years and six months, there must be a resolution passed by two third majority of the Members of Parliament (including those not present) requesting the President of the Republic to dissolve Parliament.
Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution only confers power to the President of the Republic to dissolve Parliament. The same power is contained in Article 70(1) of the Constitution. The requirements which should be fulfilled in exercising the said power are found in Article 70(1) of the Constitution. The dissolution of Parliament by the President of the Republic should always be by a Proclamation. This is clear when one examines Article 70(1) of the Constitution. Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution does not discuss about a Proclamation. For the above reasons, I hold that the President of the Republic cannot, under Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution, dissolve Parliament without one of the requirements stated in Article 70(1) of the Constitution being fulfilled.
In the present Case, the date appointed for first meeting of Parliament was on 01.09.2015. This is evident by Government Gazette No.1929/13 dated 26.08.2015 marked P2. Thus, the period of four years and six months of Parliament from the date appointed for its first meeting would end on 28.02.2020. The President of the Republic has dissolved Parliament with effect from mid-night on 09.11.2018. Thus President of the Republic has dissolved Parliament before the expiration of 4 years from the date appointed for its first meeting. Parliament by a resolution passed by two third Members of Parliament (including those not present) has not requested the President of the Republic to dissolve Parliament. Considering all the above matters, I hold that the Proclamation issued by the President of the Republic dated 09.11.2018 published in Government Gazette No. 2096/70 dated 09.11.2018 dissolving Parliament, is contrary to Article 70(1) of the Constitution; is therefore null and void ab initio; and of no force or effect in Law.
For the above reasons I hold that the Proclamation issued by the President of the Republic on 9.11.2018 published in Government Gazette No.2096/70 dated 9.11.2018 dissolving Parliament has violated fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. I have earlier held that the Proclamation issued by the President of the Republic dated 09.11.2018 published in Government Gazette No.2096/70 dated 09.11.2018 dissolving Parliament, is contrary to Article 70(1) and 70(3) of the Constitution; is therefore null and void ab initio; and of no force or effect in Law.
For the aforementioned reasons, I make order quashing the Proclamation issued by the President of the Republic dated 09.11.2018 published in Government Gazette No.2096/70 dated 09.11.2018 dissolving Parliament and declaring the said Proclamation null and void ab initio and of no force or effect in law.
I have read the draft judgement of the Chief Justice. For the aforementioned reasons, I agree with the conclusion reached by His Lordship.
The judgement delivered in this case and aforementioned orders will apply to SC FR 352/2018, SC FR 353/2018, SC FR 354/2018, SC FR 355/2018, SC FR 356/2018, SC FR 358/2018, SC FR 359/2018, SC FR 360/2018, and SC FR 361/2018.

## Title: The Marathon men MATHEWS and MENDIS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports
## Date: Friday, December 28, 2018 - 01:00
The Marathon men MATHEWS and MENDIS
When people deliver in the least expected of times, the achievement is all the more profound and laudable. So it was with the marvelous unbeaten centuries by Kusal Mendis (141) and Angelo Mathews (120) who were involved in a record stand of 274 for the 4th wicket that saved the blushes for Sri Lanka when defeat was staring them in the face in the first of Two Tests against the Black Caps at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on Wednesday.
But the Lankans cannot be satisfied with this effort. Had not rain ruined the final days play, with cricket associated with the glorious uncertainties, what could have finally happened only the cricketing gods could predict.
But that apart, the two Ms Mendis and Matthews provided an example to all their batting team mates how to bat in adversity. When the Lankans took second knock, trailing by a lot of runs and with three top order batsmen in the dugout for 13, it looked as though it would be a matter of time before the inevitable.
It is usual for a team losing a wicket in the closing stages, to send in what is called a night watchman. But the much maligned former Sri Lanka Captain in all versions Angelo Mathews took it on himself to come out and face the Black Caps pace trio of Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Neil Wagner who were threatening destruction.
First to Kusal Mendis. That this youngster is oozing with talent there is enough proof. He has matured into wielding the willow with RESPONSIBILITY. He has what it takes to be classed with the best in the world. But his impatience and impetuosity has gone to cause his downfall when his innings seems to be blossoming.
We are sure his coaches would have told and shown him how many a time. It is time now to gather the advice and get down to scoring consistently which is what the game is all about.
While he has strokes all round the wicket, the stroke that brings about his downfall is the wrong delivery he picks to hit between mid wicket and mid on and dollies a catch to either mid wicket or short mid on fieldsmen. Opponents have studied this weakness and fed him deliveries to go for this shot.
Mendis must now be aware that to be bracketed with the greats, he needs to score consistently. Then and only then can he be called great. Today great is a loosely used a word. He must also cut out the risks. It is said that a vulture is a patient bird. Mendis must base his batting on patience, determination and concentrating for great periods like he did at the Basin Reserve.
Mendis had the good fortune of having the GREAT Angelo Mathews one of the best all rounders to come out of the Sri Lanka cricketing cupboard to speak to him, control his exuberance and like a father guide and guard him during his marathon innings.
Mathews who has been pushed from pillar to post and shabbily treated, and who suffered the ignominy of being dropped from the shorter formats, had the last laugh at his detractors. Every time he made ball hit bat, I am sure he was hitting at his detractors.
But Mathews must not be unduly worried and always when he walks out to take strike, must show that he is indispensable and a rock in the team on with big scores and even when matches are saved and won.
Mathews is the elder statesman in the team and is aware that the youngsters in the team are looking up to to him as a role model and an example and should walk the gauntlet like that.
Mathews in this big innings showed that he has a lot more cricket left in him. In putting his head down, farming the bowling on its merits, giving directions to his junior, showing tremendous dedication and determination he saved his team the blushes.
It is no easy task batting for a full day. But the two MS showed that if there is a will there is a way, and it is this will that made them to stand up to the probing Black Cap pacemen Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Niel Wagner and the spin of Ajex Patel and while keeping their wickets intact, did not respect to the bowling by scoring runs when the loose balls came along.
While critics are taking Mathews detractors daily to the cleaners, the writer feels sympathy for them. The darts they threw at Mathews, was not done to belittle the great, but done in good faith and it must be taken in the spirit it was done.
Accepted that the detractors were a wee bit harsh on Mathews by picking holes and challenging his fitness and citing the many run outs that he was involved in to keep him out of the limited over bashers.
With this marathon innings he has done more than enough and proved that he is in peak fitness and the detractors must now pocket their beliefs and allow Mathews to perform the way he is capable of and give him all the inspiration and courage to motor on and be fit as a fiddle when 2019 World Cup comes around and push him to be the vital cog in our push for the World Cup.
Mathews is also human and like all sportsmen or sportswomen is bound to suffer injury in this highly professionalized and commercialized cricket world. It is the job of the medical men around the team to treat the injuries and give him time to recover.
When this homily is read, the second day of the Second Test was over which saw ugly batting at the Hagley Oval with Sri Lanka after restricting New Zealand to 178, collapsed sensationally from 88 for 4 to be all out for 104, losing the last six batsmen for 16 runs.
The Black Caps batting a second time were 231 for two a lead of 305 and in the driving seat. It will be an uphill task for Sri Lank to save the Test.

Today, the company has a fully equipped manufacturing plant. Modern technology and a quality production process have been introduced in order to improve the quality of products. The surgical dressings are very essential in the health care sector. Sri Lanka can save vast amounts of foreign exchange yearly by developing this industry. The heavy import duties on these products , is a protection given by the government for this industry.
On the other hand, there are many existing regulation to control importation of low quality products but unfortunately, low quality products are coming in at cheap prices imposing a threat on local industry. As a local manufacturer, I am satisfied with existing rules and regulation to control illegal (low quality) imports. But unfortunately low quality products are coming to the market. We believe that it is the duty of implementing authorities to be responsible for same, Pelpola said.

## Title: The migration conundrum
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

The migration conundrum
Looking back at the biggest news stories of 2018, one story stands out from the rest  the migrant crisis. The movement of people fleeing conflict, persecution, Climate Change and poverty across the world has grabbed the headlines throughout the year. Sri Lanka has remained out of this picture as illegal crossings to Australia have ceased almost completely, but in other areas of the world, mainly the US and Europe, it was a different picture.
Migration is a complex humanitarian issue that has many dimensions. This reality was brought into focus this week as a second Guatemalan child died in the custody of US officials. The caravan of migrants heading to the US from a raft of Latin American countries was very much in the headlines. Hundreds of African migrants have died in the water trying to reach Western European countries. No country can give asylum to all migrants knocking at its doors, but there may be genuine fears and concerns among people ruled by oppressive governments that spur them to reach more tolerant parts of the world. Balancing these two aspects of the migration crisis is an extremely delicate task.
Migration has become a domestic political issue in many countries. Today, there is a lot of antagonism towards migrants in many parts of the world. Many world leaders have taken an anti-immigrant stance, mainly to pacify the majority communities in their respective countries. There is a tendency to blame all ills of the economy and other sectors on migrants. What we do not realise is that many countries from USA to Australia have actually been established by migrants. Sri Lanka is no exception  our ancestors hailed from many other parts of the world including India. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that migrants generate economic, social and cultural benefits for societies. Yet hostility towards migrants is unfortunately growing around the world.
The stark reality is that we are all migrants. Migration is the very foundation of humanity. The first humanoids are believed to have migrated from what is now East Africa nearly 120,000 years ago to other parts of Africa and the world. In essence, human history is actually a story of migration. Many countries would not have developed to this extent if not for the massive contribution made by migrants. Today, globalization, together with advances in communications and transport, has greatly increased the number of people who have the desire and the capacity to move to other places. Nearly one million Sri Lankans too have permanently settled down in other countries.
Migration is here to stay  as long as people desire a better life, it will persist. The answer is effective international cooperation in managing migration to ensure that its benefits are more widely distributed. In a victory for migration and migrants, 164 countries have agreed to a global pact that plans to prevent suffering and chaos for global migration. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) was agreed upon recently in Marrakech, Morocco. The GCM aims to better manage migration at regional and global levels, including reducing the risks and vulnerabilities the migrants face at different stages of their journey.
The total number of international migrants has increased from an estimated 175 million in 2000 to 258 million in 2017. The number of migrants, representing 3.4 percent of the worlds population, is increasing faster than the static global population. Around 80 percent of the worlds migrants move between countries in a safe and orderly fashion. But more than 60,000 people have died on the move since the year 2000, according to the UN.
Migration can be both legal and illegal. Europe has faced a wave of illegal migrants coming over on rickety boats, with thousands losing their lives en route. Many countries do offer a legal pathway for migration, mainly because their populations are not adequate to meet labour needs. Japan is the latest to join this list, with the Government planning to issue work visas (with option of Permanent Residency) for more than 300,000 foreigners. Many countries offer a PR pathway for students and professionals.
In this category are people from developing countries with skills and professional qualifications who legally obtain permanent residency and citizenship in countries such as Australia and Canada with generally low populations. Many advanced and dynamic economies need migrant workers to fill jobs that cannot be outsourced and they cannot find local workers willing to take them at going wages. In the other category are people who try to escape their own countries illegally to regions such as Europe and Australia due to economic reasons, conflict or other factors.
Migration, though not a new phenomenon by any means, is re-defining the world we live in. It is essentially a two-way street. Developing countries must do more to create opportunities for youth within their boundaries which will dampen the enthusiasm to migrate. Destination countries too must be more compassionate towards the plight of genuine migrants fleeing conflict and persecution while balancing their national security, interests and resources. The world will be a better place to live in if we can all get along.

New strategies to boost agri-crops - State Minister
As a country with a long history of agriculture, we should be self-sufficient at least in one crop, Agriculture, Irrigation and Rural Economic Affairs State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare said yesterday.
Aluvihare said an extensive programme will take place to identify at least three crops and be self-sufficient in those in order to stop their imports addressing the gathering after assuming duties.
We still import most of our food from other countries.During the last 25 years, we have not been self-sufficient at least in one crop.We even dont have a national policy for agriculture. Although many previous governments had launched several programmes to develop agriculture, none have succeeded so far, he said. It is after 24 years that the UNP has received the Agriculture Ministers portfolio.Therefore, we will implement a new strategy, aimed at strengthening the sector, to boost both income and employment from agriculture, while also paving the way for Sri Lanka to achieve its target of reducing food imports and building an economy with agriculture at its core.

Olivier strikes again as Pakistan collapse at Centurion
Centurion, Thursday: A magnificent spell of fast bowling from Duanne Olivier inspired a Pakistan collapse after tea on the second day of the first Test against South Africa at SuperSport Park on Thursday, leaving South Africa needing 149 to win.
Pakistan slipped from 100 for one at tea to 190 all out, at one point losing five wickets for 25 in 11 overs.
The last wicket fell shortly before the close of play which did not leave enough time for South Africa to start their chase.
Olivier took two wickets in four balls immediately after the tea interval and went on take five for 59 for match figures of 11 for 96 following his six for 37 in the first innings.
Imam-ul-Haq (57) and Shan Masood (65) gave Pakistan hope of setting a difficult target for the hosts on a pitch which has helped the fast bowlers throughout.
But Imam was bowled off an inside edge in the first over after tea and Masood quickly found himself effectively fighting a lone battle before he was ninth out after a fighting 120-ball innings which included seven fours.
Kagiso Rabada and Dale Steyn supported Olivier with three and two wickets respectively.
It was the second successive day on which 15 wickets fell. Although the pitch appeared to be playing slightly easier than on the first day, Pakistan will seek to make early inroads on Friday after restricting South Africa to 223 all out in the first innings.
Mohammad Amir took four for 62 and teenager Shaheen Shah Afridi claimed four for 64 and together with Hasan Ali (two for 70) are likely to make South Africa work hard to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
Temba Bavuma (53) and Quinton de Kock (45) were mainly responsible for South Africa squeezing out a 42-run first-innings lead.
Imam and Fakhar Zaman wiped out the deficit with a first-wicket stand of 44 and Masood joined Imam in a 57-run second-wicket partnership.
After a shaky start, the left-handed Imam hurried to 15 off 11 balls but all three of his boundaries to that point were off the edge of his bat.
He was still on 15 when he was dropped low down by Hashim Amla at first slip off Dale Steyn. But he then batted solidly in reaching fifty off 71 balls with seven fours and a hooked six off Olivier.
After bowling Imam, Olivier claimed the wicket of the experienced Azhar Ali, with the help of a diving Rabada at midwicket after a mistimed pull shot.
The rest of the batting crumbled, with Steyn having Asad Shafiq caught behind and Rabada ripping out the next three batsmen cheaply.  AFP

Organised gang mooting religious tension - Dr.Amarasekara
Foreign powers are planning to deploy an international peace keeping army into the country to solve a tense situation among religions, to be created artificially and thereby divide the country, the Federation for National Organizations said yesterday.
They said damaging Buddha statues in different areas of the country is an intended attempt by an organized gang to create religious tension situation among the different religions.
The members of the Federation stated this addressing media in Rajagiriya yesterday.
Dr.Gunadasa Amarasekara addressing the press conference said the Ava Group functioning in the North is also an extension of the LTTE organization, which fought for a separate state. It is led by a rehabilitated LTTE member.
Therefore, Amarasekara urged the government to probe into the damaging of Buddha Statues and eliminate all possible ways leading to communal and religious tensions.
Amarasekara also accused the government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe saying that his government was appointed in 2015 by the foreign powers to divide the country through a new Constitution.
The international powers had taken this new initiative to divide the country when their plan to bring a new Constitution was defeated, he added.
Ven.Maduru Oye Dhammissara Thera speaking on this occasion requested President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission to look into the damages that have been done to the archeologically valuable sites by organised gangs during the recent past.
Conducting such a investigation by a Presidential Commission would help to minimise the possible damages in the future, the Thera added.International news analyst and critic, Mohan Samaranayake and Dr. Wasantha Bandara also addressed the occasion.

Power rivalry in Indian Ocean
The year ending this week has seen growing power rivalry in the Indian Ocean region with stakeholders in the region as well as super powers outside playing dominant roles with small countries in the region such as Sri Lanka also getting deeply involved, willingly or otherwise.
The most recent US naval ship to come to Sri Lanka was USS Rushmore (LSD 47) with the embarked 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The ship left Port of Colombo on December 26.
Last week three Russian naval ships too arrived in Colombo Port on a goodwill visit. Concluding their four-day goodwill visit, the three Russian ships, Varyag, Admiral Panteleev and Boris Butoma which arrived here on December 20, set sail from the Colombo harbour on December 24.
Sri Lanka Navy participated in the US Naval Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) which concluded on August 2, as well as exercise Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Sri Lanka, held for the first time last year.
Joint naval activities
While China is making attempts to play a dominant role in the Indian Ocean region, it seems to push India to seek closer cooperation with the United States. This year, a significant number of joint naval activities have taken place between India and US. The two countries signed the bilateral Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Association (LEMOA) in 2016 and these activities in 2018 gave a clear indication of fully implementation of the pact. The LEMOA is the first of the three foundational agreements proposed by Washington to deepen bilateral military cooperation between India and the US. Easing logistical constraints under the LEMOA legal framework, Indian and US warships are being refuelled regularly by each others tankers at sea since the agreement came into effect. This includes refueling of warship deployed in the Gulf of Aden for anti-piracy patrols.
Sri Lanka aims at becoming the most strategic naval hub in the Indian Ocean. Hence, it is of paramount importance to keep the ocean free of big power rivalry. Addressing the Indian Ocean Conference in September 2017, President Maithripala Sirisena called the littoral nations and the big powers to treat the Indian Ocean as a peace zone so that maritime shipping and utilization of ocean resources could be conducted in a peaceful manner. He also recalled that it was Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike who first called on the United Nations to declare Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace more than half a century ago.
Sri Lanka is well aware of its strategic location in the Indian Ocean. As an island-nation, Sri Lanka wishes to make maximum use of its proximity to one of the most important international sea routes.
China is quite open about its interest in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, China conducted its biggest-ever show of naval power, with nearly 50 warships sailing through the South China Sea. Chinas displays have prompted other Asian nations to cooperate more closely and initiate joint drills of their own.
Following that, Japan sent a large helicopter carrier and escort ships to the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, with the fleet making stops in the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and India, and conducting joint military exercises along the way.
From time to time there were joint naval exercises by US and China. However, last year the US disinvited China from the biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise in Hawaii, despite its participation in previous years. American defense officials cited Chinas continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea as the reason. They said Chinas moves were inconsistent with international norms and the pursuit of free and open seas.
Military cooperation agreements
India and US taking their new found defence cooperation very seriously. In the second week of December, senior Indian and US Navy officials held the 21st Executive Steering Group on bilateral naval cooperation in New Delhi to underlined how the naval partnership was getting stronger under the LEMOA pact.
Currently, there are two main military cooperation agreements between the US and India. Two countries signed the second foundational defence partnership agreement in September and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) was signed by India and the US at the inaugural two-plus-two dialogue between their foreign and defence ministers. COMCASA pact is valid for 10 years.
US also expressed desire to establish a temporary logistics hub ashore Trincomalee in the East. The air logistics hub was first operated in August when USS Anchorage (LPD 23) visited Trincomalee, Sri Lanka and supported the Essex Amphibious Ready Group as it transited the western boundary of the 7th Fleet area of operations.
US Commander Task Force 70 Maintenance, Material, Logistics, Readiness, Lt. Commodore Fredrick Espy said the cumulative efforts of numerous stakeholders to facilitate the logistics hub in Sri Lanka will pay dividends for all future transiting units in addition to make the US Navy more sustainable and a more formidable force throughout the Pacific theatre.
Strategic location
All these military activities are evident of the United States, India and Japan have cast their eyes on the Eastern Sri Lankan port of Trincomalee to counterbalance the presence of the Chinese in Hambantota in the South and Colombo in the West and its growing clout around the Bay of Bengal.
What Sri Lanka interested is to keep the Indian Ocean free of big power rivalry.
Sri Lankas desire is to obtain the commercial interest from its strategic location as a hub in the Indian Ocean. Hence, the country should earnestly push the Indian Ocean Peace Zone concept first proposed by the worlds first women Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in the 1960s and reiterated most enthusiastically by President Maithripala Sirisena at BIMSTEC Meeting in Kathmandu and Indian Ocean Rim Conference in Jakarta last year.

Rugby - Cracks in New Zealand edifice give rest of world hope
LONDON - New Zealand won 12 of their 14 games, secured the Rugby Championship for the fourth year in a row and Bledisloe Cup for the 16th, yet 2018 was the year when people began to think the mighty All Blacks might be vulnerable.
Such is the dominance of the back-to-back world champions, still clearly ranked number one, that rivals are forced to seize on the slightest chink in their armour to build belief they are beatable in next years World Cup.
That crack, initially exposed by the British and Irish Lions in 2017, reappeared against a resurgent South Africa this year, in a 36-34 defeat in Wellington and in Pretoria when only a superb late fightback earned New Zealand a 32-30 victory.
The All Blacks also needed a controversial TMO intervention to scrape a one-point win over England before the game that really buoyed the rest of the world, when Ireland beat them in Dublin for the first time.
What made that 16-9 victory so much of an eye opener was that it was not any smash and grab affair or something achieved after an hour of heroic defence, but a controlled and deserved triumph in which Ireland looked the better team for most of the match and played as if they expected, rather than hoped, to win.
It was the first time since 1995 that the All Blacks had failed to score a try against a northern hemisphere team and, in the face of the rush defence masterminded by Andy Farrell, superstars like Beauden Barrett suddenly looked distinctly human.
I think Irelands success against the All Blacks has been a positive for the whole world - theyre not invincible, said former Ireland captain Brian ODriscoll.
If teams get their act together and perform well against the All Blacks they are not the team they were in 2015 when they won the World Cup. Theyve not got the same quality in certain positions.
New Zealand have not dominated the game for a century without learning lessons from defeat, however, and they will no doubt return refreshed and tactically invigorated for World Cup year when they will head to Japan as favourites.
But that Dublin victory capped an incredible 2018 for Ireland and coach Joe Schmidt, who will stand down after the World Cup. They began with a Six Nations Grand Slam, beat Australia 2-1 in an away series and won all their November tests.
Those achievements were recognised in the World Rugby awards where they were named team of the year, Schmidt coach of the year and flyhalf Johnny Sexton player of the year.
SETTLED SQUAD
With a settled squad and domestic system geared to support the national team they head into 2019 - where they begin their Six Nations defence at home to England - full of optimism and confidence.
Other than Italy they remain the only Six Nations team never to have reached the World Cup semi-finals but to do so they will almost certainly need to beat South Africa or New Zealand in the last eight.
Ireland were undoubtedly the team of the year but, such are the slim margins of elite sport, it should not be forgotten that they needed a last-gasp Sexton drop goal to snatch victory in Paris in their opening Six Nations game.
That marked the start of another poor year for France which ended with an ignominious home defeat by Fiji.
Double defending champions England also suffered as Eddie Jones previously all-conquering side lost three matches to finish fifth - their worst Six Nations showing for 31 years.
A 2-1 series loss in South Africa followed but an encouraging November, including wins over the Springboks and, for the sixth time in a row, Australia ensured they finished the year in a positive state of mind.
The northern hemisphere sides generally did well in those November matches, not least Wales. Traditionally poor at the end of the year, they won all four, including a first victory in 14 against Australia, to take their winning run to nine.
The Wallabies had a poor year, losing nine of their 13 matches, but defiant coach Michael Cheika said they would be right back in the World Cup mix and, given their remarkable record in the tournament, they probably will be.
South Africa will also head into 2019 in buoyant mood after new coach Rassie Erasmus brought pride back into the jersey.
True, the Springboks won only seven of their 14 games but their performances against New Zealand in particular reminded everyone just what a fearsomely aggressive outfit they can be.
Perhaps of even greater importance, given the quota system the team must operate under, was the appointment of Siya Kolisi as their first test-level black captain. Agencies

## Title: Sending Sri Lankans and welcoming Chinese workers
## Supertitle: Sri Lankas emerging trend in labour migration:
## Section: Features

Sri Lankas emerging trend in labour migration:
Sending Sri Lankans and welcoming Chinese workers
Kamal, a construction labourer living on-site in Colombo, finds it difficult to make ends meet with his daily wage of Rs. 1,500. On the other hand, Hong Chua, a Chinese construction worker in Colombo, who works 10 hours a day, says we are paid a daily wage of Rs. 1,000, while food and accommodation are provided free of charge. So, we are okay
Workers such as Kamal are looking for employment opportunities outside Sri Lanka because job opportunities and working conditions in the country are not attractive enough to retain them, while similar working conditions and wages are attracting foreign workers such as Hong Chua to Sri Lanka.
This is an apparent reality in the local labour market; the Sri Lankan economy is gradually transitioning from the mere labour-sending economy into one that sends and receives workers. The same employment opportunities, working conditions with demand and supply conditions that necessitated out-migration of Sri Lankan workers are now attracting foreign workers towards Sri Lanka. The only difference here is the relative point of reference for each group. In the eyes of Sri Lankans such as Kamal, the local opportunities pale in comparison to those available in destinations such as Saudi Arabia, while from the point of view of the Chinese immigrant workers like Hong Chua, the opportunities in Sri Lanka are rosy compared to working opportunities in their country of origin.
From sending to receiving
A recent study identifies three phases of aggregate migration:
A) Net emigration (out-migration) phase
B) Transition phase (growth in immigration numbers despite net emigration)
C) Net immigration (in-migration is greater than out-migration) phase.
Sri Lanka is still a net emigration country. Nevertheless, a new trend is emerging in terms of labour migration.
In recent years, the gradual rise in immigrant workers in Sri Lanka coincided with the decline in the departure of Sri Lankans for overseas employment. In fact, worker departures from Sri Lanka have been experiencing a downward trend since 2014, and have dropped to 212,162 departures in 2017. At the same time, issuance and extension of resident visas for foreign nationals to reside in Sri Lanka have been on the rise to reach 53,583 in 2017 from 41,306 in 2014 (Figure 1).
As per the current regulatory framework in Sri Lanka, only certain types of resident visas allow employment in Sri Lanka. As shown in Figure 2, in 2017, out of the total 53,583 resident visas issued or extended to foreigners, 24% was for employment in the private sector. Almost equal shares of 16% each were for resident visas allocated for foreigners extending their services to the public sector and workers of the Board of Investment (BOI) projects.
In addition to these employment-related resident visas, there are two notable employment visa cohorts such as visas for students/scholarship holders and resident visas for medical purposes. As noted earlier, 16% of resident visas are allocated to foreign students and their scholarships, while those seeking resident visas for medical grounds account for 2%. Within the 16% identified as other, various types of resident visas, such as children of Sri Lankan parents, clergy, as well as a separate category for construction sector workers are included. The Department of Immigration and Emigration reported that they had issued 82 such construction worker type resident visas in 2017, in addition to the construction worker visas that may have already included under the category of workers of the BOI projects.
Figure 2 also suggests that nearly 60% of resident visas for employment purposes(approximately 30,000 visas) had been issued/renewed in 2017. Additionally, there may be other lawfully residing foreigners who would have obtained or renewed their visas for employment before 2017.
As shown in Figure 3, apart from these lawfully residing and working foreigners, another group comprises of unauthorised foreign workers. It consists of those working without work authorisation for their visa type, those over-staying their resident visas for employment, and those who have illegally entered Sri Lanka. The exact numbers of such unauthorised foreign workers in Sri Lanka remain unknown. Despite the absence of a clear estimate of the number of such unauthorised foreign workers, statistics for 2017 from the Department of Immigration and Emigration show that there were 793 investigations and 392 removals of foreign nationals for violating the Immigration and Emigration Act No. 20 of 1948.
Immigration and Emigration Act
The existing Immigration and Emigration Act in Sri Lanka is archaic. Despite the amendments in 1993, 1998, 2006, and 2015, the Immigration and Emigration Act No. 20 of 1948 still is in need of revising in order to address the current mobility of individuals in and out of Sri Lanka, including the skills deficits and labour shortages in the labour market, and the demographic transitions of the native population.
The limitations of the existing Act include the absence of a separate visa category to facilitate employment of foreign nationals, inability to allow the domestic labour market to benefit from the large proportion (16% of resident visas) of foreign students that reside in Sri Lanka, and not facilitating family members of diplomatic and employment purpose resident visa holders to contribute to the local labour market.
The process to repeal the existing Immigration and Emigration Act by drafting a new Immigration and Emigration Bill and paving the path for a new Act is already underway, and it is expected to be finalised and effective in mid-2019.
Institutional framework
Along with an updated Act to govern immigration into the country, Sri Lanka also needs a matching institutional framework to ensure efficient and foolproof operation of related activities, such as ensuring employers do not penalise native workers, authorisation of work permits, validation of foreign qualifications, experience and credentials, and continuous monitoring of foreign workers in Sri Lanka in terms of aspects such as their welfare, health, integration to the local society, and return to their country of origin at the end of their working period.
In formulating such an institutional framework, it is important to note that migration transition is a long, complicated, and dynamic phase. A research hints that, initially, immigrants would be socially marginalised in Sri Lanka, followed by increased family reunification when more skilled immigrants start to pursue settlement in Sri Lanka with their families. At the tail end of the migration transition, it would be a phase that requires attention to long-term inclusion and integration of immigrants in the Sri Lankan society. Once this immigration transition is completed, Sri Lanka may embark on an era of net immigration.
Future
As such, new laws, regulations and institutions which are being drafted at present ought to be sufficiently forward thinking to guide Sri Lanka beyond the incipient beginning of immigration to all the way across the migration transition phase and to a possible scenario of net immigration. The country cannot afford any weaknesses in the institutional framework in immigration to foster a breeding ground for hostility and friction between natives and foreign-born workers.

Serendib Signature Resort Digana opens new wing with Rs 50 mn
Serendip Signature Resort Digana, the tranquil, eco nature hideout unveiled its new wing on December 21 adding 10 more keys to its existing 16 with an investment of Rs 50 million.
The structure in a three acre, landscape depicting the rich traditions of Kandyan royalty, its history as well as the culture of Dumbaramitiyawatha (Kandyan hills), hit the limelight in July 2016 taking the Lankan nature hospitality landscape by storm.
The brainchild behind the project, top marketer and hotelier Serendib Signature Resort Digana Managing Director Dananjaya Rathnayake said the overwhelming demand for his property from tour operators enticed him into the investment for the new wing with 10 rooms.
Rathnayake was at his peak in his career operating as sales and marketing director in a blue ship multinational brewery company when the idea first mooted in his mind to enter the hospitality trade. Rathnayake scarified his lucrative post and launched the eco nature resort Serendib Signatue Digana in 2016 which was an instant hit among nature hunting guests.
Ratnayake emphasized that there was also a very big vacuum for properties which gives relaxing tranquil offers. Although there were a lot of hotels in towns and major cities with a lot of luxury, people need relaxation on and off, not like the good old days. I saw these opportunities and invested in this property which took me one year and six months to complete with an initial investment of Rs 150 million.
He said after the opening in 2016, July the responses were very positive. As a part of my Social responsibility most of my 35 member staff are recruited from the village and trained.
He said during the past two and a half years there were lots of challenges particularly when the Digana issue propped up. But sheer commitment and passion by his team had managed to overcome them. He said in July 2018 he thought of putting up 10 more rooms due to the sheer pressure from travel agents who loved the property for its unique features.
He said the property was completed with Kandyan architecture, Laksha work and Dumbara ratha which are some of the key themes used in interior designing which speaks out the Kandyan identity.
He said they also have some special Kandyan local cuisines and traditional Serendib Signature lunches plus having everything from A la carte of Western to Eastern and Indian cuisine.
The hotel facilitates many activities that the clientele can engage in which simultaneously fulfills the need for relaxation and grasping the full Sri Lankan traditional experience.
Another option is village tracking on bikes with the bikes being provided by the hotel. Hotel also organizers several other excursions to nearby attractions such as Victoria Golf Club and also to Dumbara Ratha village and the Laksha work village of Hapuwida which allows guests to become familiar with the ancient origins of the wonderful traditional designs.
The hotel is also gaining a reputation for hosting corporate meetings at their fully equipped conference facility. Even though initial average occupancy rates stood at 40%, it has skyrocketed to 80% within the short time frame since its beginning till present, owing to the unique serenity that it offers, Rathnayake said.
He said with the success of this venture they were planning to go into two more resorts down south close to Yala and Sigiriya or Habarana in the cultural triangle with an investment of Rs 250 million for each property. The constructions of the two resorts will commence in 2020.

Sewmadi needs your help
Tasheena Sewmadi Badiwattage, 4-year-old daughter of retired army officer B.N. Tillakaratne of Pahalawatta, Hiriliyadda Road, Wawwa, Modarawana, is suffering from transfusion dependent thalassaemia.
Consultant Haematologist Dr. Lalindra Gooneratne, who is treating her, has recommended a bone marrow transplant to cure her. The girl is now undergoing pre-transplant work-up at a private hospital in Colombo.
The cost of the surgery including provision of donor cells from overseas is nearly Rs. 8 million.
Tillakaratne says his eldest son died of thalassaemia at 14 in 2013. Two other younger children are attending school. Since they would not find local donors, it was planned to obtain donor cells from abroad. His family cannot afford the expenditure and therefore, he requests the public to assist his childs cause by sending whatever financial contributions they can to help expedite the surgery. He is making this appeal as a war hero, who had rendered 22 years of service to protect the motherland. All contributions should be remitted to the Account No. 80191279, Bank of Ceylon Walasmulla Branch. Contact Number 0718604270.

Sixty years after Cuban revolution
CUBA: On January 1, Cuba will mark the 60th anniversary of the Communist revolution that brought the late and enigmatic leader Fidel Castro to power. Here, AFP talks to four Cubans about what the revolution still means to them.
For 97-year-old Alejandro Ferras Pellicer, the revolution is as alive now as it ever was. He was the oldest of a group of 100 rebels, including two of his brothers, who joined Castro in an unsuccessful attack on the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba in July 1953, an operation widely considered to have launched the Cuban revolution.
On January 1, 1959, Ferras Pellicer was an exile living in the United States as the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista fled his island homeland. Ferras Pellicer left his wife behind to take the first plane to Havana. I arrived before Fidel, who was still in Santiago, he said.
I had to come to join the revolution here, he told AFP from the tiny museum dedicated to the Moncada operation that he built in the capital. Ive never left the country since, he states with pride.
When confronted by the Batista dictatorship, revolution was necessary because it was about fighting for the future. Most of all, though, the revolution was Fidel. The charismatic leader died in 2016. His brother Raul had taken over as Cubas president from 2008 and ruled until earlier this year, when he passed the baton to the first non-Castro post-revolutionary leader, Miguel Diaz-Canel.
For us, Fidel is not dead. Were keeping him alive, insisted Ferras Pellicer, because were continuing the revolution which can last another 50 years with public support. As long as the revolution has the people, it is secure.
Ana Fidelia Quiros was a two-time world champion and twice Olympic medalist in track and field. She says she owes everything to the revolution, even her life. In 1993, she survived a stove explosion in her home that left burns over 40 percent of her body and killed the child she was expecting.
The revolution represents everything for me. Its thanks to the revolution that I was able to train as an athlete, become a better person and, most of all, allowed me to get through what could have been a fatal accident, the former 800-meter runner told AFP.
Two years later, the Caribbean Storm won her first world title in Gothenburg, before repeating the feat in Athens in 1997.
Such a Lazarus moment wouldnt have been possible if I didnt live in a country like this one, where medicine is free. The revolution also helped make sport accessible for everyone, turning the island nation of 11.5 million people into an Olympic over-achiever, with 78 gold medals in the Summer Games.
Now 55, Quiros recognizes that many things are missing in the country but hopes that political reforms will improve the economy and help Cuba regain its place on the world sporting landscape.
The son of a communist leader, Vladimiro Roca has nonetheless been one of the regimes fiercest critics for many years.
The revolution died a long time ago. Now theres a dictatorial regime, the 76-year-old former fighter pilot told AFP.
Having originally followed in his fathers footsteps -- Blas Roca was a Marxist theorist and parliamentary president from 1976-81 -- the son grew disillusioned with the revolution.
I fought for a democratic revolution and not for a family dictatorship, which is what has been established in Cuba, said Roca, who was fired from his job in 1992 and sentenced to five years in prison in 1997 over his opposition to the regime.
People are afraid of repression, according to the dissident, who insists the revolution will blow itself out. First of all, the youth are fed up. They dont believe in any of that, and then theres not much support from abroad. Its possible that when (87-year-old) Raul Castro dies, everything will end because those following arent prepared to risk everything for something that has no future.
Lourdes Garces was part of the Cuban humanitarian mission to Brazil that was abruptly ended last month after Cuban authorities reacted with indignation to criticisms from Brazils far right president-elect Jair Bolsonaro.
The 54-year-old doctor was part of previous humanitarian missions to Venezuela and Guatemala.
She says the revolution is developing and can still offer a lot more. Since its inception... it has shown solidarity in every sector of society, whether thats in culture, education, sport or health. Her foreign missions meant she missed many important events in the lives of her two sons, but Garces is happy to have gained professional experience by helping the poorest people. She refutes any accusations that Cuba has been using its highly trained medics to indulge in political indoctrination known as white coat diplomacy. We dont interfere in politics or any other domain outside of health, she insisted. - AFP

INCREASING CABINET MINISTERS ABOVE 30 :
SUPREME COURT OPINION TO BE SOUGHT
The government through the President would seek the opinion of the Supreme Court to determine the exact number of Cabinet Portfolios that it could hold, Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma told the Daily News.
He said according to the countrys Constitution, the number of Cabinet portfolios that a single party government can hold is 30. But, the government would seek the opinion of the Supreme Court as to whether it can increase this number up to 32 as both the President and the Prime Minister are also holding portfolios.
Seeking the opinion of the SC before doing such a change would be better than having different explanations by various parties as the 19th Amendment to the constitution is also in force, the Deputy Minister added.
When asked whether the new government led by the United National Party would run in the nature of a unity government, he said they would consider in this regard as the United National Front has the support of many political parties. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and the SLFP MPs are supporting the government at present, he pointed out.
The Deputy Minister also spoke about the Opposition Leadership of the House. He said selecting the Opposition Leader is not a duty of the government. The MP who represents the majority of the Opposition and has no connection to the government party should be Opposition Leader, the Deputy Minister said.
However, Mannapperuma emphasized that there is no influence from their government in selecting the Opposition Leader of the House.

Surge in traffic on expressways this December
Traffic along the Southern and the Colombo-Katunayake (CKE) Expressways increased by about 15 per cent compared with the statistics in December last year, Road Development Authority Additional Director General Saman Openayake said.
He said the revenue from the expressways was increased comparatively by eight per cent..

Openayake said the traffic flow along the countrys main two expressways would further increase after the two were connected from Kadawata and Peliyagoda exists.
The Matara-Hambantota extension of the Southern Expressway would reach Kataragama by the end of 2019, he said.

University students unions controlled by FSP, not JVP - Hemakumara
The power block of all university students unions lies on the hands of the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) led by Kumar Gunaratnam and not with the JVP led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara said. He said the JVP is a very weak political party today. This is because Kumar Gunaratnams party has taken the biggest lies of JVPs with him.
The Western Province Governor was speaking at a press conference at his office in Rajagiriya yesterday. Answering a question by a journalist on the President Maithripala Sirisenas stance on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution proposed by the JVP, he said it is still not known as the aforesaid amendment is yet an unborn thing. The 20th Amendment was introduced by the JVP. But, the people at the grassroots level of the JVP are very much disturbed about it. We know as to why the JVP top rung brought it and how many top notches went for secret discussions with some international NGOs.
Nanayakkara said the JVP is on the decline day by day. They hasten the process of becoming weaker by bringing in the 20th Amendment, he said.
According to him, although the JVP had a base support of youngsters at grassroots level, they are now withdrawing from the party. Therefore, the JVP is heading towards a very sad destination, Nanayakkara said.
However, Governor Nanayakkara also said President Sirisena is not in agreement with the 20th Amendment at the moment.

WHEN THE TWO ALMOST BECAME ONE
KOREA: The Moon Jae-in administrations strenuous effort to engage North Korea laid the groundwork for inter-Korean rapprochement throughout the year despite lingering worries over Pyongyangs nuclear threat.
Three rounds of historic summit talks between South Korean President Moon Jae- in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un highlighted the unprecedented peace mood on the Korean Peninsula, which has been divided since the 1950  1953 Korean War. The war ended in a truce, not a permanent peace treaty.
The first Moon-Kim summit at the truce village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone on April 26 was in the global spotlight, as the face-to-face meeting was seen as a success following years of Pyongyangs nuclear provocations.
While holding hands, the two leaders stepped across the Military Demarcation Line, raising hopes of ending conflicts and bringing peace on the peninsula. Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South territory.
Speaking after the summit to the media, Moon and Kim issued the so-called Panmunjom Declaration to usher in a new era of peace.
The two leaders agreed to cease all hostile acts and work toward establishing a peace regime in place of the current armistice treaty, which had been signed by the US, China and North Korea at the end of the Korean War.
We bade farewell to the frozen relationship between North and South Korea, which was a nightmare. And we announced the beginning of a warm spring to the world, Kim Jong-un said during a press conference.
The Panmunjom summit became the catalyst for the landmark June 18 summit in Singapore between the leaders of the US and North Korea.
At the one-day talks, US President Donald Trump and North Koreas Kim signed a document in which both committed to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Trump announced that US-South Korean military drills would be suspended to help facilitate denuclearization talks with North Korea. In return, Kim pledged to destroy a missing engine testing site as a step toward removing its nuclear arms following the destruction of the Punggye-ri nuclear site in May.
While the US and North Korea, however, were in a tug-or-war over detailed procedures for denuclearization after the Singapore summit, President Moon was further accelerating efforts to move forward the inter-Korean relationship.
Following a brief summit with Kim at the northern part of the truce village, about 200 separated families from South and North Korea reunited at the Mt. Geumgang resort in the North in August, the first such reunions since 2015.
Moon flew to Pyongyang in September for his third get-together with Kim. During the three days of summit from Sept. 18 to 20 in the North Korean capital, both leaders agreed on a set of sweeping measures to ease military tension along the Demilitarized Zone and reboot cross-border business projects.
The tension-reducing agreements are meaningful and practical steps toward declaring an end to the Korean War since the two militaries began disarming hot spots for conflicts and turning them into peaceful spots, Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told Arab News. The militaries of both Koreas completed withdrawing troops and firearms from 20 front-line guard posts (GPs)  10 from each side  in early November and subsequently destroyed the watchtowers. South Korea has 60 more such guard posts whereas North Korea is believed to have 160 more.
Both militaries also finished removing firearms and troops from the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom, where South and North Korean armed troops used to stand face-to-face.
This irreversible destruction of GPs is the most visible and symbolic effort to prevent accidental clashes between the two militaries and build mutual trust, Gen. Kim Yong-woo, chief-of-staff of the Republic of Korean Army, said during his visit to the GP destruction site near the border on Nov.12.
Preparations for reconnecting cross-border railways are under way. On November 30, a South Korean train with a sign reading Seoul to Shinuiju crossed into the North for a long-stalled joint inspection of railway sections there.
It was the first time in a decade that a South Korean train has traveled on rail tracks in the North.
Both Koreas held a groundbreaking ceremony for the railway reconnection project on December 26 after completing the 18-day inspection of the lines on the west and east coast.
In spite of tangible progress on inter-Korean relations, however, the talks over North Koreas denuclearization have been in a prolonged stalemate due mainly to disagreements over the terms of denuclearization.
Washington is holding fast to its policy of exerting maximum economic pressure on North Korea though President Trump has claimed progress in denuclearizing the North. In the latest move to squeeze the North, the US Treasury Department blacklisted three top aides to Kim Jong-un over serious rights abuses and censorship.
North Korea experts here believe the timetable for the Norths denuclearization should be amended inevitably because of the deadlock in the US-North Korea nuclear disarmament talks.
North Korea is believed to be in a dilemma over how to respond to the US sanctions and implement the denuclearization pledge agreed upon at the Singapore summit, said Hong Min, a researcher at the state-funded Korea Institute for National Unification.
Attention is now on the new years message of Kim Jong-un, Hong said, adding that the North Korean leader could issue a fresh message to break the nuclear deadlock.
On the contrary, should Kim send a negative message on the denuclearization process, the peace initiative led by President Moon could collapse, said Cho Sung-ryul, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy.
We should brace for a negative situation in which the North Korean leader sends a skeptical message on his nuclear pledge, Cho said. As skepticism about the Norths denuclearization effort grows among American lawmakers, Trumps top-down initiative of engaging the North could not work anymore, he said.
If and when the North Korean leader will make his return visit to Seoul is a matter of primary concern. When Moon met Kim in Pyongyang, the North Korean leader agreed to visit Seoul at an early date, but he has yet to accept Moons invitation to visit by the end of December.
The South Korean government was preparing for Kims December visit with a large artwork showing the two leaders smiling and shaking hands being installed outside the presidential Blue House.
South Korean citizens have been divided over the North Korean dictators visit to Seoul.
A group of young citizens called welcome committee for a great man leads a campaign to encourage Kims visit with a slogan of I am a fan of Kim Jong-un.
Other groups of conservative citizens are engaged in a counterattack campaign to expel Kim Jong-un.
With only two weeks to, however, Blue House officials have acknowledged that Kim would not be able to come to Seoul within this year.
Said Yim Jae-cheon, an associate professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul, said: If it happens, I expect Kims Seoul visit would likely be made before the second summit of Trump and Kim. Thats because the inter-Korean summit in Seoul could certainly serve as a stepping stone for the US-North Korean summit.
