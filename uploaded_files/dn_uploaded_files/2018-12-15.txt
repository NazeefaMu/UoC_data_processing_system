All should get together to resolve present crisis
Chairman of the Sri Lanka World Solidarity Forum for Justice and Peace Ven. Mahagalkadawala Punniyasoma Thera said yesterday that all the political parties should join hands to save the country from the present plight.
Ven. Punniyasoma Thera said that all should enter the path of the peace to seek solutions to the political crisis.
The Thera said the resettlement programme in the east that the government initiated must be highly lauded. President Maithripala Sirisena takes steps effectively to nab criminals and control the drug menace. However, the President alone cannot do the needful and we all must support him, the Thera said.
We all must unite to develop the country and pave the way for reconciliation among different communities in the country, the Thera said.

Brutal news: Global carbon emissions jump to all-time high in 2018
Rapid cuts needed to protect billions of people from rising emissions due to increase in use of cars and coal
Global carbon emissions will jump to a record high in 2018, according to a report, dashing hopes a plateau of recent years would be maintained. It means emissions are heading in the opposite direction to the deep cuts urgently needed, say scientists, to fight climate change.
The rise is due to the growing number of cars on the roads and a renaissance of coal use and means the world remains on the track to catastrophic global warming. However, the reports authors said the emissions trend can still be turned around by 2020, if cuts are made in transport, industry and farming emissions.
The research by the Global Carbon Project was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, where almost 200 nations are working to turn the vision of tackling climate change agreed in Paris in 2015 into action. The report estimates CO2 emissions will rise by 2.7% in 2018, sharply up on the plateau from 2014-16 and 1.6% rise in 2017.
Almost all countries are contributing to the rise, with emissions in China up 4.7%, in the US by 2.5% and in India by 6.3% in 2018. The EUs emissions are near flat, but this follows a decade of strong falls.
Climate change
The global rise in carbon emissions is worrying, because to deal with climate change they have to turn around and go to zero eventually, said Prof Corinne Le Quere, at the University of East Anglia, who led the research published in the journal Nature. We are not seeing action in the way we really need to. This needs to change quickly.
The current Paris agreement pledges from nations will only limit global warming to 3C, while even a rise of 1.5C will be disastrous for many people, according to the worlds scientists.
Le Quere said: I hope that by 2020, when [governments] have to come back with stronger commitments, we will then see a turning point.
The International Energy Agencys data also shows rising emissions in 2018. Its executive director, Fatih Birol, said: This turnaround should be another warning to governments as they meet in Katowice this week.
Renewable energy
Every year of rising emissions puts economies and the homes, lives and livelihoods of billions of people at risk, said Christiana Figueres, at the Mission 2020 campaign, who was the UN climate diplomat overseeing the Paris agreement. We are in the age of exponentials, she said, with renewable energy and electric cars expanding rapidly, but with the extreme weather impacts of climate change doing the same. We have to ensure it is the solutions exponential curve that is going to win the race. Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, said: This annual balance sheet for global carbon is comprehensive and scientifically robust. Its message is more brutal than ever: we are deep in the red and heading still deeper. For all our sakes, world leaders must now do what is required.
Harjeet Singh, at ActionAid International, said news of the emissions rise should galvanise those at the climate summit: Theres way too much complacency in the air at these talks.
The dark news of rising emissions is merging with two other alarming trends, according to Prof David Victor, at the University of California, San Diego, in an article with colleagues also published in Nature on Wednesday.
Falling air pollution is enabling more of the suns warmth to reach the Earths surface, as aerosol pollutants reflect sunlight, while a long-term natural climate cycle in the Pacific is entering a warm phase. Victor said: Global warming is accelerating. [These] three trends will combine over the next 20 years to make climate change faster and more furious than anticipated.
The Global Carbon Budget, produced by 76 scientists from 57 research institutions in 15 countries, found the major drivers of the 2018 increase were more coal-burning in China and India as their economies grew, and more oil used in more transport. Industry also used more gas. Renewable energy grew rapidly, but not enough to offset the increased use of fossil fuel.
Paris agreement
There was hope China was rapidly moving away from coal power, but the last two years have shown it will not be so easy to say farewell quickly, said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway.
In the three years since the Paris agreement was signed, financial institutions have invested more than $478 bn in the worlds top 120 coal plant developers, according to a report by the NGOs Urgewald, BankTrack and partners. Chinese banks led the underwriting of coal investments, while Japanese banks led the loans, the NGOs found.
In the US, emissions rose as an unusually cold winter and hot summer boosted demand for both heating and cooling in homes. But it is expected that emissions will start to decline again in 2019, as cheap gas, wind and solar continue to displace coal  coal use has dropped 40% since 2005 and it is now at its lowest level since 1979.
The global rise in emissions, even in rich, developed nations, is very concerning, said Antonio Marcondes, Brazils chief negotiator at the UN summit: Emission reductions are like credit-card debt: the longer they are put off, the more expensive and painful they become.
Brazil reached its 2020 emissions targets early, but fears of a rise in deforestation under the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, could reverse this. But Le Quere is optimistic that the rapid global rises seen in recent decades will not return: This is very unlikely.

Congress brings challenge to Modi & BJP
Indian politics are in focus this week with the major defeat suffered by Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janatha Party (BJP) in key state assembly elections, while UKs Theresa May and Frances Emmanuel Macron shared the European worry scene, and Donald Trump did have cause for worry.
Indias ruling Hindu nationalist BJP had clear defeats in state elections this week, giving an unexpected and big boost to the Congress Party and its leader Rahul Gandhi, as parliamentary elections approached next year. Prime Minister Narendra Modis BJP lost control of three key states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, with the opposition centre-left Congress emerging as the single largest party in each state.
PM Modi who has been strongly opposed to the Congress, and who has carried on a strong campaign directed against the Congress and the Gandhi family, succeeding Indias first Prime Minister and Freedom Leader Jawaharlal Nehru, unusually accepted defeat with a tweet saying We accept the people's mandate with humility, in the BJP's first major setback in state elections since it won national power, taking 282 of 543 parliamentary seats in 2014.
The results are expected to boost the fortunes of the Congress party, which has campaigned to present itself as a credible rival to the BJP, and the likely potential leader of a broad anti-Modi alliance.
British PM Theresa May
During the state election campaign, Modi and other members of the BJP ridiculed Gandhi, 48, as the callow scion of a political dynasty. But the Congress leader was able to engineer what is the most significant defeat for Modi since he took office in 2014.
From the time of its national victory in 2014, Narendra Modi had a strategy of seeking to create a Congress-Mukt Bharat  a Bharat Free of Congress  which appears to have been largely defeated with these assembly polls. It had shown an increased following for Rahul Gandhi, in his attempts to organise opposition alliances against the largely Hindutva-led BJP. There are signs of the emergence of new youth leaders in Indian politics, which could have a larger impact in the national elections next year.
Modi and the BJP swept into office in 2014 on promises of an economic boom and a corruption-free government. However, with just months to go before the 2019 polls, his popularity has started to wane.
Economic growth dropped sharply to 7.1 percent in the latest quarter, compared to the 8.2 percent GDP growth reported in August. The strongest protests against Modi came from the agricultural population, and among farmers in the rural belt. The BJPs reputation has also been badly affected by increasing incidents of communal violence and sexual violence against women.
Interestingly, the poll results in two other states -- Telangana and Mizoram -- showed both the BJP and Congress losing to regional parties respectively, indicating a rise in the voices of regional parties, which could affect the coming national polls.
With national elections expected to be held in April/May 2019, these results show a clear contest between the BJP and Congress, which was not the political calculation of the Modi and the BJP, who thought of isolating the Congress, which won only 44 seats in the 2014 national election. However, the Hindutva cry of the BJP and its increasing religious and ethnicity themes could continue to give it considerable strength in 2019, too.
May clings to power
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has renewed efforts to obtain some concessions from the European Union (EU) in the Brexit Deal, after escaping a defeat as the leader of the Conservative Party last Wednesday, in the most jamming situation she faced as Prime Minister.
With her leadership of the Tory party challenged, she did get a majority of party MPs, and remained in charge of the Brexit process, but with little to show there were any changes in the desperate negotiations with the EU, which had clearly said there will be no changes to the Brexit Deal. To win the vote of confidence by the Tory MPs, May did assure that she would not lead the party at the next general election due in 2022, which makes this her only leg as Prime Minister.
The Tory party cannot move her out of office for another year, but she is nowhere near a workable Brexit policy that can be passed through the House of Commons. She did one of the most shocking parliamentary moves this week, suddenly putting off the scheduled final debate and vote on her Brexit Deal with the EU, when she realized it would be hugely defeated.
Conceding the actual defeat she faced in her own party, in pledging to step down as leader before the next general election, May said: I've said that In my heart I would love to be able to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election, but I think it is right that the party feels that they would prefer to go into that election with another leader.
She added: I don't expect an immediate breakthrough, but what I do hope is that we can start work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary.
At Thursday's EU summit in Brussels, May has the opportunity to spell out the problems she faces to leaders of all the other 27 member states. But the key leaders she has already met, have clearly said there could be no changes to the signed treaty, but would consider explanations and clarifications. She will once again have to face a strongly opposed Commons, with the likelihood of a new referendum on Brexit rapidly gaining momentum in the country and the Commons; the story of an awaiting defeat for her.
France: Christmas Market attack
The French Government has urged the yellow vest protesters not to hold their fifth round of demonstrations today, calling for economic relief, and the resignation of President Emmanuel Macron, as the Police were hunting for a fugitive who attacked a Christmas Market in the city of Strasbourg.
The Strasbourg attack, the oldest Christmas Market in Europe, has brought new strains on the security forces, with threats in both France and Germany, following a 29 year-old Strasbourg native, who killed two-and injured 13, with reported shouts of Islamic terrorist slogans, too. The situation here is an additional strain on Police and Security services if the yellow vest protests too take place.
Records show that Strasbourg held a Klausenmarik (Saint Nicolas market) on December 6 each year, and it dates back to the late 12th century. Strasbourg is also known for its famous cathedral, and has a huge tourist presence in December.
The government has appealed to yellow vest protesters to be reasonable, citing the strain on security personnel.
Before Tuesday's attack in Strasbourg, President Macron made a major retreat in policies, scrapping a fuel tax increase slated for January 2019, a core demand of the protestors, from the rural areas and smaller towns. He also announced a hike in the minimum wage, tax relief on overtime payments. And a rollback of taxes for pensioners. But, he did not restore the Wealth Tax on the rich.
The yellow vest protests began on November 17 over fuel tax increases, but snowballed into a revolt over living standards as well as Macron's perceived indifference to the problems of ordinary citizens. While some of the yellow vest movement's representatives have said they are open to halting the protests to negotiate with the government, others say Macron's concessions are not enough. This is a movement that shows being a deeper political drive, and leading to new developments in French politics. It is a major challenge to President Macrons policies.
Trump has problems
President Donald Trump is facing new problems with his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen sentenced to three years in prison, on tax evasions and matters involving Trumps campaign finance during his election.
Cohen pleaded guilty in a case brought by New York prosecutors for campaign finance violations, tax evasion and making a false statement to a bank, and false statements to Congress.
The former lawyer, who was earlier very much respected by Donald Trump, the President has recently referred to him as a weak person who is seeking to have reduced jail terms. Cohen while being sentenced has blasted his former boss's dirty deeds and repented for joining Trump's dark side.
These are new situations that President Trump is facing, with increasing reports of possible impeachment over the illegal payments made by his lawyer, Cohen, which also adds to the increasing problems with the US Senate, over moves to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia, and the Crown Prince there, over the role of killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Five bowlers who have taken 10 wickets in an innings
Only once in a blue moon, any player achieves this sort of a record. While there are many instances of a bowler picking up 10 wickets in an innings of a match in the history of cricket. Here is my top 5 pick of this rare feat. Everyone knows about the 10-wicket haul that Anil Kumble took against Pakistan at the Ferozshah Kotla Stadium.
It is an incredible feat for any bowler to achieve regardless of the format and the competition he is playing in. Here is this list we will be discussing other players who have been able to achieve similar kind of feat across the world in different formats.
5. Jim Laker
The Englishmen achieved this great feat back in the year 1956 and that too in the Ashes. It cant get bigger than this for any English player as this was against the mighty Australians. This was the fourth Test match of the series which was played in Manchester. In the first innings, England score 459 runs with the help of two centuries from Richardson and Sheppard.
Australia wouldnt have thought this even in a nightmare. They were bowled out for just 84 runs in the first innings were asked to follow-on. Thanks to Jim Lakers 9 wickets which helped England to wrap the Australians so early. Second Innings had something special in store for Jim Laker as he went on to become the first bowler in the history of International Cricket to take 10 wickets in an innings.
He completed with a figure of 51.2-23-53-10. He took a total of 19 wickets in the match which is still a world record for most no of wickets in a single Test match. England won the Test match by an innings and 170 runs on 31st July 1956.
4. Anil Kumble
Anil Kumble was the first Indian bowler to take 10 wickets in an innings of an International Test Match. He achieved this milestone against Indias arch-rivals Pakistan back in 1999. Pakistan was chasing a target of 420 runs in the final innings to win the Test at the Ferozshah Kotla ground.
Saeed Anwar and Shahid Afridi gave Pakistan an excellent start and put on a century run partnership giving hopes to the Pakistani fans that they can still win the Test match. Ferozshah Kotla Stadium which is known for its turning pitch helped India make a comeback in the Test match.
Anil always known for his grit and hunger had some other plans for the Pakistani batsman. Anil Kumble took 10 wickets and helped India win a historic Test match. He finished with the figure of 10 wickets for 74 runs.
Anil took 10/74 against Pakistan.
3. Mahaboob Alam
Few would know his name as he is not a player from a Test playing team. Mahaboob Alam is left-arm pacer from Nepal. This man had his name in the Guinness Book of World Record when he became the first player to take 10 wickets in an innings of a limited over format.
He was the first man to do so in an official limited over match. Nepal was playing Mozambique in an ICC World Cricket League Division 5 match in 2008. Nepal batting first scored 238 runs in their stipulated 50 overs.
Mozambique lost half their side at a total of just 9 runs. Nepal wrapped up the match in just 14.5 overs and thus winning the match by a handsome margin of 219 runs. A total of nine ducks were in the scorecard for Mozambiques batsman. Alam finished with an overall figure of 10/12.
Mahaboob Alam was playing in ICC WCL Division 5 match.
2. Debashish Mohanty
In 2001, two years after Anil Kumble took 10 wickets in an innings, Mohanty achieved a similar feat. He achieved this feat in a domestic match where the South Zone was playing against the East Zone. His effort helped East Zone to bundle out South Zone for just 113 runs.
South Zone had two all-time great batsmen in their side, The Wall, Rahul Dravid and Very Very Special Laxman. Little mattered to Mohanty on that day as he was on top of his game. His bowling held East Zone to win the match by four wickets while chasing a modest target of 167 runs.
He finished with a figure of 10-46 in the first innings. He also played 45 ODIs and two Test matches for Indian. He took 57 wickets in the 45 ODIs that he played and four wickets in his Test match career.
Mohanty also played 45 ODIs and 2 Test Matches for India.
1. Rex Raj Kumar Singh
The latest member inducted to the family of taking 10 wickets is Rex Raj Kumar Singh. Rex is an 18-year-old player who plays for Manipur at the domestic level. Manipur was facing Arunachal Pradesh in a Cooch Behar trophy match at Anantapur. The left arm-pacer took only 9.5 overs to take 10 wickets. This helped his side to wrap-up Arunachal Pradesh for 36 runs in just 19 overs.
In the whole spell, he was close to taking a hat-trick three times but was not able to convert any of the chances into a hat-trick. With his effort, Manipur has to chase only 55 runs in the final innings to win the match which they chased down quite easily without losing a wicket and thus winning the match by 10 wickets. - sk
Rex achieved this feat in a U-19 Cooch Behar Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh in Anantapur.

ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup:
Future stars of Sri Lanka on show today
The future of Sri Lanka will be on show when the home team takes on favourites India in the final of the Asia Cup Emerging Team Trophy championship at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo today.
The Indians go into the final with a better record taking into account their showing in the qualifying round games, while Sri Lanka can take heart from the fact that they raised their game at the right moment to beat Bangladesh by four wickets in the semi final.
It was mostly down to the 20-year old Kamindu Mendis from Richmond College showing the stuff he is made of as he blasted an unbeaten 91 as Sri Lanka chased down a challenging 238 target.
Mendis knock ensured Sri Lanka were home in the 49th over after some scares as the home team lost six wickets. He is the leading run-maker in the Sri Lanka line-up with an aggregate of 174 runs and interestingly also the leading wicket-taker with seven scalps from the three qualifying round games which makes him the player that India will closely watch and monitor.
But the occasion is also crucial for the rest of the players at a time Sri Lanka is now hard-pressed to groom and prepare future players with time running out and the rest of the top 10 cricket-playing nations in the world leaving no stone unturned.
Being in the same group Sri Lanka were beaten by India in the qualifying round but todays match is expected to be a different genre altogether as the touring team can also come under pressure while carrying the unbeaten tag into the final.
India will have to look forward to its leading batsman and opener Himmat Singh who has hammered 207 runs in the run-up to the final that includes seven sixes and a top score of 126.
Sri Lanka squad: Kamindu Mendis, Lasith Embuldeniya, Shammu Ashan, Hasitha Boyagoda, Jehan Daniel, Asitha Fernando, Nishan Maduska, Avishka Fernando, Chamika Karunaratne, Asela Gunaratne, Shehan Madushanka, Nishan Peiris, Sandun Weerakkody, Shehan Jayasuriya, Wanindu Hasaranga.
India squad: Jayant Yadav, Ankush Bains, Siddharth Desai, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Himmat Singh, Deepak Hooda, Mayant Markande, Shams Mulani, Prasidh Krishna, Ankit Rajpoot, Nitish Rana, Atit Sheth, Shivam Mavi, Simran Singh.

India fight back with triple strike in Perth
Perth, Friday: Australias top order batsmen squandered a number of promising starts to cede an early advantage on the first day of the second Test against India in Perth on Friday.
A century opening partnership after captain Tim Paine won the toss and elected to bat appeared to lay the foundation for a sizeable total on a challenging pitch at Test crickets newest venue, but openers Marcus Harris and Aaron Finch were among a number of top order players who couldnt build the big individual score Australia craved.
At stumps on a scorching day, the home side were 277 for six, with Tim Paine on 16 and Pat Cummins on 11, a crowd of 20,746 braving the heat to be part of history on the first day of Test cricket at the new Optus Stadium.
Although Australia might have been lamenting a missed opportunity, India, which dropped two catches, ended the day with concerns of their own.
Paceman Ishant Sharma briefly left the field late in the day with what appeared to be a side issue, and their batsmen would have been a bit alarmed by some of the variable bounce on the opening day.
It was a solid day at the crease for the Australians, but could have been much better had any of its four batsmen who made over 40 gone on to post a substantial innings.
Second-gamer Harris led the way with 70, Finch made 50, Travis Head hit 58 before throwing his wicket away and local favourite Shaun Marsh made 45.
3 wickets lost for 22
Australia started very well, with Harris and the under-pressure opener Finch, needing to justify his position at the top of the order, putting on 112 for the first wicket.
Finch lived dangerously at times and narrowly survived successive lbw appeals early in his innings, one of which cost India a DRS review, to notch his second Test half-century.
Despite the pitch having a distinctly green tinge that appealed to the four-pronged Indian pace attack, the pair backed their captains call at the toss until Finchs luck ran out and he was trapped in front by paceman Jasprit Bumrah (1-41).
Finchs dismissal brought struggling left-hander Usman Khawaja to the wicket and he made just five, sparring at a short ball from Umesh Yadav and getting a thick edge to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant.
Harris was dropped at second slip from the bowling of Mohammed Shami on 60, he but added just 10 more before falling to the part-time spin of the recalled Hanuma Vihari (2-53).
Vihari got a ball to rise sharply off the pitch and it followed Harris as he recoiled, fending it to Ajinkya Rahane at first slip.
Harris had been there for 141 balls, but his dismissal meant Australia had lost three wickets for just 22 runs and surrendered their early advantage.
Australia slumped to 148 for four when Peter Handscomb (7) again fell against a short ball outside off stump, Indian skipper Virat Kohli pulling down a scintillating one-handed catch in slips from the bowling of Sharma (2-35).
Marsh, dropped by Pant on 24 from the bowling of Vahari, and Head steadied the shop with an 84-run stand.
However, Marsh became Viharis second victim, caught at first slip by Ajinkya Rahane.
Head was growing in confidence and was eyeing his first Test century until a rush of blood saw him lash out at a wide delivery from Ishant and slice it straight to Mohammed Shami on the third man boundary.
India won the first Test in Adelaide by 31 runs as they seek their first series victory on Australian soil. AFP

Old Anandians take rugby honours:
Nalanda wins 11th Maroons Battle in the UAE
Old Nalandians continued their winning streak over Anandians, knocking the traditional rivals out of the 11th Battle of the Maroons in the UAE, and clinched both P de S Kularatne Memorial Trophy and Lionel Mendis Memorial Trophy.
The 11th Battle of the Maroons in the UAE was jointly organised by Ananda College Old Boys Association (ACOBA) UAE Wing and Nalanda College Alumni (NCA) UAE to embark on the traditional fellowship.It was held on 2nd November 2018 at the Eden Gardens Cricket grounds in Ajman.
Old Anandians batted first and posted a commanding total of 151 for the loss of 5 wickets in their allotted 20 overs with Ananda Captain all-rounder Achinda Witharamalage top scoring with a well calculated 54 runs in 29 balls. Achinda was well supported by Yasitha, who contributed 31 runs and put on a formidable partnership for the 5th wicket. For Nalanda, Ranga Kalyanaratne was the pick of the bowlers accounting for 2 wickets giving away 24 runs in his allotted 4 overs. Kavinda took 2 for 29.
Early wicket
Chasing 152 for victory, Nalanda started their innings badly when Madura was out in the first ball of the innings. Because of the early wicket Nalanda had to be extra cautious, and the run rate was extremely slow in the first few overs. add to that Yasas was out in the first ball of 3rdover which was Tharindus second over, caught behind again for 1 run. The score at the time was 1 run for the loss of 2 wickets. In came Nalanda Captain Namal to join Arunalu and they began rebuilding the innings cautiously. Arunalu was the next to go when the score was at just 50runs in 10 overs. Kavinda was the next batsman, who provided good support to Namal, who at the other end was batting nicely.
Kavinda was unfortunately out LBW when he was at 11 and the score at 71 in the 13th over. Nalandas veteran cricketer and coach, Viraj joined Namal and continued to build the score with cautious batting. Namal on the other end was building his score and reached his half century with a scintillating boundary. Nalanda scoring rate was slow when they reached the 100 run mark which happened in the 16th over. However, with Namal timing the ball sweetly, the target was always at sight. He made sure to keep his wicket till last over as he knew its his responsibility to take them over the line.
In the 17th over, with the help of couple of wides and poor deliveries they managed to score 19 runs.
Whilst Viraj was out for 11, next batsman Asanka provided sufficient support to Namal, who finished the match with a boundary off 2nd ball of the last over. Namal remained unbeaten at 90 and all celebrations began of a hard-fought win for Nalanda.
Scores:
Old Anandians: 151 for 5 in 20 overs (Achinda 54 not out, Yasitha 31 not out, Thakshitha 17,Nimesha 16, Ranga 2 for 24 and Kavinda 2 for 29)
Old Nalandians: 155 for 5 wickets in 19.2 overs (Namal 90 not out, Arunalu 12, Viraj 11, Kavinda 11, Asnaka 11 not out, Tharindu 3 for 16)
Earlier in the day Old Nalandians second XI team led by Sandun Kosala outplayed Old Anandians second XI team and won the Lionel Mendis challenge trophy for the 3rd consecutive year. Nalanda Skipper Sandun Kosala won the toss and elected to bat first.
Nalanda openers started brilliantly and reached 100 runs in the 11th over. Nalanda veteran Diptha Premasinghe was the top scorer with a well-paced inning of 57 runs off 3 deliveries.
Last year batting hero Chanaka Senathilake also batted well reaching his 50 off 48 balls. Whilst Nalanda was headed for a big score, with the introduction of Aruna Ratnaweeras left arm spin, quick wickets resulted in Ananda restricting Nalanda to 147 for 7 in their allotted 20 overs. Aruna bowled well to take 5 wickets for 22 runs in his 4 overs.
Ananda in their run chase lost wickets at regular intervals as Nalanda bowlers were tight in their line and length.
Top scorers for Ananda were Dhanuka Prageeth 18, Nipuna 14, Shalin 14. The asking rate was so high, Ananda managed to get only 104 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in their allotted 20 overs.
For Nalanda Upul was the pick of the bowlers who took 3 wickets for 15 runs, Sajith 3 for 17 runs and Captain Kosala took 2 wickets for 9 runs.
Scores:
Old Nalandians : 147 for 7 wickets in 20 overs (Diptha Premasinghe 57, Chanaka Senathilake 50, Aruna Ratnaweera 5 for 22)
Old Anandians: 104 for 9 in 20 overs (Dhanuka Prageeth 18, Nipuna 14, Shalin 14. Upul 3 for 15, Sajith 3 for 17 and Sandun Kosala 2 for 9)
The last event of the day was the Ananda vs Nalanda seven a side tag rugby encounter that was played for the P de S Kularatne challenge shield. Old Anandians Rugby team came up with good performance with two tries on either side of the break, while Nalanda replied with one try at the dying seconds of the game.
The result saw Old Anandians clinch the P de S Kularatne challenge shield for the third consecutive occasion.

The next steps
The Supreme Court on Thursday delivered the highly anticipated verdict on the dissolution of Parliament as per a Gazette notification issued by the President. The Court ruled that the dissolution of the House was unconstitutional, as the President can do so only after the lapse of four and a half years into a Parliamentary term.
All political parties have respected this decision, regardless of their own viewpoint on the dissolution. This is a good sign that restores our faith in the political system despite the recent incidents of acrimony witnessed in Parliament and elsewhere. There were occasions in the past when the houses of Supreme Court judges were pelted with stones after they gave verdicts unfavourable to the Government in power.
Thursdays verdict is yet another instance of the Courts ruling against the Government in power in recent times. The credit for creating a climate for courts to function independently must go to President Maithripala Sirisena, who promised independence for the Police, Judiciary and the Public Service upon his ascension to the Presidency in January 2015. The President has humbly accepted the verdicts of the Courts, regardless of whether they were in favour of or against the Governments actions. This too is a welcome sign.
The separation of powers among the Executive, Legislature and the Judiciary is a time tested principle in functioning democracies. These checks and balances are necessary to curb any excessive use of power or authority by any of these instruments of the State. It is essential to retain these features of our democracy lest the people lose faith in the governing structure. There is a healthy debate in our society and in the media on whether Sri Lanka needs a Presidential or Parliamentary system of Government but what matters in the end is that one component should not become too powerful.
It is also heartening to note that in spite of the recent political developments, there were almost no acts of violence apart from the sad deaths of two Ceylon Petroleum Corporation employees. Leaders of all political parties must impress upon their supporters and activists the need for calm and restraint, regardless of the outcomes in Courts and Parliament. It is quite acceptable to celebrate what is perceived a victory by one camp, but it must be peaceful. A few black sheep who overstep the boundaries of decency can ruin the reputation of a party or individual.
It is into this category that those who created an unruly scene in front of Lake House on Thursday night belong. This posse of provincial level politicians, who were probably acting on their own without any instructions from their leaders, tried to attack Lake House employees and worse, even forcefully grabbed a crutch from a disabled individual who was passing by with the intention of attacking someone with it. The timely intervention of a policeman saved the disabled person from falling over on the pavement, which would have resulted in certain injury. The UNP has promised an inquiry into this incident and stern disciplinary action against any UNPers involved. Indeed, any individuals in any party who do not respect the rights of the disabled, leave alone their other offences, must actually be barred from politics for life.
All political parties must ensure that their members behave responsibly, respecting the rights of all others. There should be no place in modern politics for violence as we are a mature democracy now, where recent elections have been conducted without any major incidents. We must set an example for other countries in the region where election and political violence is the norm rather than the exception.
It goes without saying that the present political impasse must be ended soon, at least by end January next year as some of the lawsuits filed in connection with the various political developments have been postponed for that month. Many options have been discussed  a referendum, a General Election or even a Presidential Election. A Presidential Election makes no sense at the moment because according to the Supreme Court verdict, whoever becomes President will have to work with the present Parliament for nearly two more years.
It has been pointed out that there is a way out for the Parliament itself to circumvent the four and a half years rule  by calling for dissolution with a two-thirds majority. Given the fracas and the bad blood that were evident during recent Parliamentary sessions, going in for a brand new Parliament may be a sensible option. Granted, a General Election is a very costly exercise for an emerging economy like ours, but that could be one of the options. That way, the people will be able to decide on a new Government to guide their fortunes for the next 5-6 years. If such an opportunity is granted, political parties as well as voters must ensure that only educated, honest, hardworking men and women are sent to the Hallowed Chambers to speak on their behalf. This will start a new political culture in the island.

## Title: POLITICAL CRISIS: A MUSLIM PERSPECTIVE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Saturday, December 15, 2018 - 01:00
POLITICAL CRISIS: A MUSLIM PERSPECTIVE
The Muslims of Sri Lanka with their composition of business-people (big and small) through the educated and the peasants have one thing in common  that is their belief in the Oneness of God the Creator (Allah), seek help through supplication from Allah and Allah alone, and that everything happens  good or bad  from the Will of Allah, that is, ones destiny is in Allah. This belief is fully ingrained in almost all Muslims (with some exceptions) irrespective of being a practising Muslim or not. In such a scenario one cannot expect the Muslims En-Masse to show outwardly a false pretention of being supportive or otherwise to contentious issues whether social, cultural or political.
This is how the Muslim public are articulating themselves towards the unfolding drama of the political aspects of governance though the Muslim politicians would act or behave differently for the sake of their own benefits while espousing as if they do so for the good of their people  and this is the behavioural pattern of all politicians. The question of indifference as perceived by some Muslim writers has no significance whatsoever as that question does not arise or need not arise as the Muslims are fully involved trying to visualize what is taking place in the political aspects of governance and supplicating (to Allah) for the best solution He Wills.
Pundits in law and politics
From the evening of October 26, 2018 when the President Maithripala Sirisena appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister when the sitting Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was the functioning Prime Minister, the Muslim community became active politically to know why this happened. While the pundits in law and politics were debating the constitutionality or otherwise of the appointment, the Muslim populace was debating casually irrespective of political party affiliations, the whys and wherefores of the Presidents decision. To the Muslim public that was unthinkable. The sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post of Prime Minister was unacceptable to the Muslims though they did not have much regard for Wickremesinghe after the Muslims were attacked in Digana and Kandy where he as the Prime Minister could have prevented the attack on the Muslims as soon as it started to unfold; further he did not forcefully condemn the riot either. There are various conspiracy theories on this violence against Muslims and that is a different issue and should be left at that.
The Muslims are not revengeful that they did not allow the above incidents (violence) to mar their independent thinking on the political issues facing the country. The Muslims, as any other community, expected their elected candidates to act as per the laws of the land and foremost upholding of the Constitution. They are disappointed by the turn of events and are rendering all possible assistance to each and every group that endeavours to undo the damage in the most legitimate ways possible.
Therefore, to brand the Muslim community as indifferent to the present political issues is, at best, not knowing the ground realities of Muslims vis--vis the roles they have opted to play as being patient and supplicative (to Allah) and, at worst, injurious to the stature of the Muslim community at large. This type of irresponsible branding of the Muslims is particularly done by those who do not get any chance of intermingling effectively with the Muslim community in Sri Lanka and therefore out of step with the attitudes and realities of the Muslim community in strategic national issues.
Shia dominant countries
One other aspect we notice among these Muslim writers is that they purposely and continually attack the Ulama (Muslim clergy) for no valid reasons  they pejoratively call the Ulama as Mullahs  a term which is never used in Sri Lanka, India and the Arab world but only in Shia Iran and may be other Shia dominant countries. These writers also engage in scathing attacks on the organisation that is home to most of the Ulama in Sri Lanka viz. All Ceylon Jameeyathul Ulama (ACJU) on the writers wishful thinking and not on specific religious (Islamic) misguidance and / or deviations. I have no attachment, liking or enmity to any Muslim / Islamic organisation of mainstream Muslims yet I show my reservations and opposition when organisations are involved in bidah (innovations) and Shirk (Polytheism).
The Muslim writers  I do not wish to name them  without exception call the ACJU as the apex body of decision making in the affairs of the Muslims of Sri Lanka which is not and never the case and  this is what ACJU had been trying to become and has miserably failed. These writers should realize that there are many other Muslim / Islamic organisations  Sri Lanka Thawheed Jamaath (SLTJ), All Ceylon Thawheed Jamaath (ACTJ), Thihariya Jumma Mosque Thawheed Jamaath, Ceylon Thawheed Jamaath (CTJ) which are rendering yeoman services to the Muslims (In Islam and related issues) and also to other communities (community development; social work etc.).
The Muslim community from the grassroots level to the top, like all other communities, is involved in politics and some are active members in the various political parties in Sri Lanka.
Then how does one say that Muslims are indifferent to political issues in Sri Lanka The present political deadlock is a very complicated issue not only based on legal matters but also on personality conflicts, personal biases, power politics, group/party pressures and finally power capture.
In this scenario the Muslim community through patience and prayer (supplication) is seeking the Help of the Almighty God (Allah) to inculcate the minds of all the lead players in the political crisis to arrive at a sensible and workable solution so that Sri Lanka and its citizens will be relieved from the hardships they are facing now due to the present political crisis.

President urged to revert to status quo prior to October 26
Eksath Bhikku Peramuna Secretary Ven. Bopitiye Dhammissara Thera urged President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday to revert to a status quo that prevailed in the country prior to the October 26 in the light of the Supreme Court decision and save the country from the present constitutional crisis.
The Thera was addressing a media briefing held in Temple Trees yesterday.
Sri Lanka has become a country with no government today. It is heading towards anarchy. The Treasury has no funds to pay salaries of the public servants from January as the budget or a Vote on Account has not been passed in Parliament, the Thera said.
If the Executive does not uphold the Parliamentary sovereignty and the independence of the Judiciary, it is a breach of the trust of the people, the Thera said.
We hope that President would respect the judgment of the courts and save the country from the current calamity, the Thera said.

SC refuses to stay Order on Mahindas appeal
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda yesterday unanimously refused to set aside the Interim Order issued by the Court of Appeal restraining Mahinda Rajapaksa and 48 others from functioning as Prime Minister, Cabinet of Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers respectively.
However, plurality decision of the Supreme Court three-judge Bench decided to grant leave to appeal with four appeal petitions filed by Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa and several others.
Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda made a dissenting order to reject these appeal petitions in limine. Accordingly, the appeal petitions were fixed for argument on January 16, 17, and 18 next year. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court issued an order staying the Court of Appeal proceedings pertaining to Quo Warranto application until the conclusion of Supreme Court inquiry.
The Supreme Court further directed the Supreme Court Registrar that the request that had been made to nominate a fuller Bench to hear these appeals be referred to the attention of Chief Justice.
However, the motion filed on behalf of Parliamentarian Ranil Wickremasinghe sekking a fuller bench comprising more than five judges of Supreme Court to hear these applications was rejected by Supreme Court yesterday morning. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva informed that respondents in this appeal solely relying upon the hansard report to support No Confidence Motion (NCM) which is available in uncorrected version. Though the Hansard mentioned the motion pertaining to the NCM was carried, the video footage released by the Parliament official website did not transpire anything to support in this regard.
A Quo Warranto cannot be issued based on the uncorrected version of parliament proceedings (hansard reports), Mr. Silva further added.
Silva further said the Court of Appeal failed to properly consider their preliminary objections that Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear a Quo Warranto petition.
The Court of Appeal acted in wrongful manner from the beginning. We are in a situation where there is no a Prime Minister or Cabinet for several weeks, he further said.
Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana appearing for Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa stated that the Court of Appeal has granted an order that has to be granted after conclusion of the petition.
He made a request to vacate the Interim Order issued by Court of Appeal which prevented the operation of entire Cabinet.
Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran stated that Parliament has passed a NCM with majority of 122 parliamentarians on November 14 against the de-facto government. 122 members of parliament who constitute majority of the Parliament voted in favour of the NCM filed against the government. If Parliament passed a NCM on the government, the cabinet of ministers stands dissolved, Kanag-iswaran said.
Counsel Suren Fernando appearing for the petitioner-respondents stated that Parliament proceeding cannot be challenged in courts. Parliament has full authority in the affairs relating to legislative matters.
Through this appeal petition, Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa sought an order to set aside the Interim Order dated December 3 by Court of Appeal.
He also sought an order to grant special leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal order in the writ application No.363/2018.
Rajapaksa alleged that the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to take cognizance of the absence of a proper and legally countenanced application before it in terms of the law in as much as inter alia the failure of the 122 MPs to have supported their application with affidavits countenanced by law. He stated that the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to take due cognizance of its lack of jurisdiction to hear and determine the said writ application in which arose a number of matters involving and requiring interpretation of several constitutional provisions.
He further said the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to consider the legal effect of the cogent evidence adduced by some of 122 MPs by way of affidavits and documents, unedited Hansard issued officially by the office of Secretary General of Parliament and the video footage extracted from the official website of parliament depicting that the said uncorrected draft copies produced in court do not in fact depict accurately the parliamentary proceedings of the said date and that there were in fact no valid votes of no confidence passed in parliament as claimed by the 122 MPs.
Meanwhile, Parliamentarians Johnston Fernando, Dr. Wijedasa Rajapaksa, Dinesh Gunawardena and Chamal Rajapaksa also filed appeal petitions challenging Court of Appeal order dated December 3.
They cited UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe and 121 MPs and 49 others as respondents.

SC ruling, a victory for the people - JVP
A wrongful decision of the Executive was reversed by the judiciary for the first time in the countrys history, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
Speaking at a press conference at the JVP Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday, the JVP MP pointed out that the Supreme Court ruling on Thursday was a victory for the progressive people, supremacy of law and the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
He said a massive rally has been organised at 3 pm at Kirula Grounds in Kirulapone today to mark Thursdays victory and galvanise the people to make it a real victory of theirs.
The JVP right from the beginning said that we would do everything in our capacity to defeat the conspiracy. We waged our battle in Parliament, in the Courts of law and on the streets. The Supreme Court verdict sealed the victory for our struggle, MP Herath said.
He invited all citizens who fought to defeat the coup to attend the rally. He further said that the JVP would start a two-week hand-out distribution campaign from Monday to make the public aware that the fight must continue to achieve a real peoples victory. Herath also pointed out that the new Cabinet of Ministers should not exceed 30 as the UPFA has officially withdrawn from the Unity Government.
He pointed out that the JVP has no objection in giving the Opposition Leader and Chief Opposition Whip posts to the UPFA, when the UPFA members sit in the Opposition in the absence of a National Government.
He further said the JVP would spur the 20th Amendment to the Constitution taking note of the recent developments in the country. The people have now realized how harmful it can be when too much power is concentrated on one individual. We will push the 20th Amendment in Parliament and then seek the peoples approval for it at a referendum, he said. He said Thursdays Supreme Court ruling was possible because of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. There were many false criticisms on the 19th Amendment, but now it is clear that the 19th Amendment only contained correct, progressive and democratic reforms, MP Herath added

Sri Lanka reeling from upheaval ahead of New Zealand Tests
WELLINGTON Dec14: Sri Lanka will hope to put poor form and off-field chaos behind them when they face New Zealand in the first Test at Wellington's Basin Reserve on Saturday.
The tourists' preparations have been anything but smooth, with changes to their coaching staff increasing pressure on a team coming off a 3-0 Test series whitewash against England last month.
Former England player Jonathan Lewis was named as the side's new batting coach this week, joining Australia's Steve Rixon, who was brought in as fielding coach last week. Sri Lanka's bowling coach Nuwan Zoysa was suspended by the International Cricket Council in October after he was accused of match-fixing and other corrupt conduct.
That same month, ex-chief selector and former captain Sanath Jayasuriya was charged for failing to cooperate with a match-fixing probe.
Adding to their woes, off-spinner Akila Dananjaya was suspended this month for having an illegal bowling action, and the national team's selection panel was sacked over the England series loss.
Opening batsman Dimuth Karunaratne admitted it was difficult to block out the upheaval and focus on the upcoming two-Test series.
It's not easy, swapping management... but we're going to the same basics and everything, he told Wellington's Dominion Post newspaper.
It's not a matter for us. We're trying to regroup as a team, do our best, and trying to win. The Sri Lankans, ranked sixth in the world, also have a poor Test record against the Black Caps in New Zealand, winning only two of 17 matches against them.
Fourth-ranked New Zealand enter the series full of confidence after securing their first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years, to give coach Gary Stead a winning start to his tenure.
Stead said he was not taking Sri Lanka lightly and was concerned his players may be drained after wrapping up series against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi last Saturday.
Some guys are still struggling with jetlag and we going from the extreme conditions of low, slow, turning wickets to probably a hard, fast bouncy Basin Reserve wicket, he told Radio New Zealand. They are all things that are little red flags that we need to be aware of... we're a little more vulnerable than we would normally be. New Zealand have named a 13-man squad for the series while Sri Lanka have 17 players to choose from, giving them added options with the bat.
The two Test series will be followed by three one-dayers and a single twenty20 match.

It is claimed that leaders of the United National Front had held several discussions with regard to forming the new Cabinet tomorrow.
Respecting the promise Ranil Wickremesinghe had made in writing to Ravi Karunanayake, the possibilities are that he would take action to appoint Ravi Karunanayake, as the Finance Minister. While it is claimed that President Maithripala Sirisena has said that he would not have any political alliance with Ranil Wickremesinghe,UPFA MPs willing to obtain Ministerial posts in the new Cabinet have not been barred in the Cabinet Wickremesinghe plans to form, as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has taken a decision not to take any action against them, sources said.
Meanwhile, in a Twitter message MP Namal Rajapaksa informs that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna would form a broader alliance with President Maithripala Sirisena

UPFA MPs to attend Parliament
UPFA Matara District Parliamentarian Kanchana Wijesekera yesterday said that the group of UPFA Parliamentarians had decided to attend Parliament sessions scheduled to be held on December 18.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) office in Battaramulla, MP Wijesekera said that the government MPs did not boycott Parliament proceedings and were only protesting against the Speaker who acted in a biased manner in Parliament.
We considered Parliament to be dissolved. But, as the Supreme Court has now ruled that President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to dissolve Parliament was unconstitutional, we have to respect that decision, MP Wijesekera said.
He further said that their struggle was not to get positions or benefits. If we lose power, we would not hesitate to play our role in the Opposition. Three years ago, we didnt even have the right to represent both the Government and the Opposition in Parliament.
There was an undemocratic era where 54 MPs didnt receive our right to sit in the Opposition.
But, the TNA and the JVP remained silent. We hope that the crisis situation which prevailed in the country would be solved within the next few days, he said.
He further added that Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed as the Prime Minister with more than 105 seats in Parliament and the TNA and JVP considered it as a minority government. But, without the TNA MPs, the UNP has only 103 seats. So the TNA should decide whether they represent the Opposition or the Government.
If the TNA sits on the government side, Ranil Wickremesinghe will have 117 seats and can form a government.
Hambantota District MP D.V.Chanaka said that the UNP MPs and supporters have already realised that the UNP would not be able to win any future election.
As a result, they are always attempting to postpone elections. Due to the Bond issue, the selling of national resources and the heavy tax burden imposed on the people, they do not want go for any election, Chanaka said.
He further said that Mahinda Rajapaksa accepted the PMs post in order to protect countrys national resources, the Constitution and provide relief to the people.
Within a very short period of one and half months, we could be able to achieve various victories including the reduction of tax burden,reduce fertilizer and fuel prices, he said.
Though the JVP claims that they supported Maithripala Sirisena to become the President it is clear that they only supported Ranil Wickremesinghe to become the Prime Minister. Everything the JVP does now is to safeguard Ranil Wickremesinghe. The JVP never raised their voice when the countrys assets were being sold, MP Chanaka said.
TNA MP Sumanthiran says that there is no agreement with the UNP. At the same time TNA MP Dharmalingam Siddharthan says that the UNP has given a written agreement to abolish the Prevention of Terrorism Act, to release imprisoned ex-LTTE cadres, to release lands used by the Security Forces and for a Federal Constitution, he said.
